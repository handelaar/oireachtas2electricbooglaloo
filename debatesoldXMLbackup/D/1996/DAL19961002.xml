      <P>Herr Präsident des Abgeordnetenhauses, Herr Präsident des Senats, sehr geehrter Herr Ministerpräsident, meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, Exzellenzen, meine Damen und Herren!</P>
      <P>Zunächst, verehrter Herr Präsident, erlaube ich mir eine kleine Berichtigung bei Ihrer so überaus freundlichen Begrü&szlig;: Ich schlage vor, da&szlig; wir es der Geschichtsschreibung überlassen, wenn man im Bereich der Geschichte schon eingeordnet wird.  Ich fühle mich eigentlich noch sehr gut und noch nicht reif für die Bücher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> Das meine ich jetzt sehr ernst: Wer Politiker ist &mdash; und es gibt hier viele Beispiele &mdash; und ein langes politisches Leben hinter sich hat, viele haben es noch vor sich, wer wie ich 37 Jahre Abgeordneter ist und das Auf und Ab des parlamentarischen Lebens erlebt hat, dem rate ich, wie mir selbst auch, sich an einem Satz zu orientieren, den der von mir sehr verehrte Papst Johannes XXIII. einmal in Bezug auf sich selbst und angesichts der freundlichen Worte, die ihm gewidmet wurden, gesagt hat: Giovanni, nimm Dich nicht so ernst! Er will damit sagen, da&szlig; man sich sehr ernsthaft verhält, aber es der Nachwelt überlä&szlig;t, wie das Buch in der Geschichte ist.</P>
    <P>Herr Präsident, ich bitte Sie, das so zu verstehen, wenn ich sage: Umso mehr bedanke ich mich für diese so ganz freundliche Bergrü&szlig;ung gegenüber meiner Frau und mir.  Für mich ist das vor allem eine Freude und natürlich auch eine Ehre, hier zu ihnen im irischen Parlament sprechen zu dürfen.  Das erste, was ich sagen darf und will ist: Ich habe zu danken für die Freundschaft und für die Verbundenheit, die wir, die Deutschen, spüren, wenn wir in Ihr Land kommen und wenn Menschen aus unseren Völkern sich begegnen.</P>
    <P>Gestern haben Ihre Staatspräsidentin und ich gemeinsam mit Ihrem Nobelpreisträger Seamus Heaney die Frankfurter Buchmesse eröffnet, die grö&szlig;te Buchmesse der Welt.  Ich finde es eine wunderbare Sche, da&szlig; in diesem Jahr Irland im Mittelpunkt dieser Messe steht.  Darin &mdash; und so sehen Sie es bitte &mdash; äu&szlig;ert sich ein ganz besonderes Interesse, da&szlig; Irland bei uns zu Hause in Deutschland findet.  Für uns &mdash; und ich denke für viele Europäer &mdash; gehört der kulturelle Schatz der Iren, ihre Schriftsteller, ihre Bardendichtungen, ihre Balladen zum Schatz Europas.  Ihr Land hat wie kaum ein anderes Autoren von Weltrang hervorgebracht &mdash; Gro&szlig;e der Literatur wie Sean O'Casey, James Joyce und Samuel Beckett.  Wir bewundern die Kraft der irischen Poesie, William Butler Yeats zum Beispiel, der in seinem berühmten Gedicht das Wort von der &ldquo;Furchtbaren Schönheit&rdquo; geprägt hat.  George Bernhard Shaw hat einmal gesagt und geschrieben, es sei vor allem die Verantwortung für die Zukunft, die weise mache.  Das ist, wie ich denke, ein guter Satz für die Europäer am Ende dieses <Col N="970" /> Jahrhunderts, ja dieses Jahrtausends, denn in vier Jahren beginnt ein neues Jahrhundert, ein neues Jahrtausend.</P>
    <P>Das Bewu&szlig;tsein von Gemeinsamkeit und von gemeinsamer Verantwortung entsteht auch und nicht zuletzt aus einer leidvollen Erfahrung der Geschichte.  Wer wü&szlig;te nicht, wie viele Ihrer Landsleute sich gezwungen sahen, ihr Vaterland zu verlassen. Kaum ein anderes Land in Europa hat einen solchen Verlust an Dynamik und Personalität hinnehmen müssen.  Heute ist es unsere gemeinsame Sorge, dafür zu sorgen, da&szlig; nie wieder Menschen aus ihrer Heimat fortgehen müssen.  Das Ziel, unser Ziel in Europa hei&szlig;t: Wir wollen ein Europa bauen, in dem unsere Kinder und kommende Generationen in Frieden, in Freiheit, in sozialer Gerechtigkeit und auch in Wohlstand aufwachsen können.</P>
    <P>Wir Deutsche &mdash; auch das darf ich in dieser Stunde sagen &mdash; hoffen von ganzem Herzen, da&szlig; alle Bemühungen zur Verständigung, um in dem Proze&szlig; der Verständigung Nordirlands voranzugehen, einen guten Fortgang und, wie ich hinzufüge, endlich auch ein gutes Ende nehmen.  Es geht um Frieden, es geht um Menschenwürde &mdash; jene Werte, für die schon Daniel O'Connell gewaltlos eingetreten ist.</P>
    <P>Das zweite, was ich sagen will, ist ein Wort des Dankes an das irische Volk &mdash; und ich sage es als Deutscher &mdash; als unsere Freunde und Partner.  Ich will Ihnen danken für die Hilfe, die uns aus Irland zuteil wurde.  Wir wissen aus unserer privaten Existenz, da&szlig; wahre Freundschaft und menschliche Grö&szlig;e sich vor allem dann zeigen, wenn der andere in Not ist.  Unsere irischen Freunde &mdash; und ich sage das bewu&szlig;t auch 50 Jahre nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg, wenn eine andere Generation herangewachsen ist; zwei Drittel der radisenen &mdash; haben uns in einer bitteren Stunde unseres Volkes geholfen.</P>
    <P>Damals war Deutschland ein zerstörtes Land.  Es herrschten Hunger und Elend in einer heute kaum vorstellbaren Weise.  Über 12 Millionen Flüchtlinge waren unterwegs &mdash; Vertriebene auf der Suche nach einer neuen Heimat.  In dieser für Deutschland und für die Deutschen so schwierigen Zeit haben die Menschen hier in Irland auch bei knappen eigenen materiellen Ressourcen ganz selbstverständlich geholfen.  Viele, viele deutsche Kinder wurden damals hier aufgenommen und vor dem Hunger bewahrt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> Ich sage es so, obwohl es beinahe jetzt materiell und mechanisch klingt: Das irische Volk spendete damals &mdash; umgerechnet auf den Kopf der Bevölkerung &mdash; mehr als jedes andere auf der Welt, um Not in Deutschland zu lindern.  Wir haben es nicht vergessen.  Wir erinnern uns auch daran, was Sie uns an Hilfe, Unterstützung und Sympathie sechs Jahre zurück aus Anla&szlig; der gro&szlig;en dramatischen Veränderungen in Berlin, in Deutschland und in Europa gaben.</P>
    <P>Morgen, am 3.  Oktober 1996, feiern wir in Deutschland den sechsten Jahrestag der deutschen Einheit.  Für uns war dies einer der glücklichsten Augenblicke unserer Geschichte &mdash; nicht nur der jüngsten Geschichte.  Wir bekamen das Geschenk der Einheit unseres Volkes in Frieden und Freiheit und &mdash; dies gab es noch nie in der Geschichte &mdash; mit der Zustimmung aller unserer Nachbarn, Partner und Freunde in Europa und in der Welt.</P>
    <P>Irland, das irische Volk, hat sich damals für uns und mit uns gefreut.  Es hat von Anfang an Deutschland und die Bundesregierung rückhaltlos auf dem Weg zur Einheit unterstüzt. Ich werde nie vergessen, wie in einer dramatischen Sitzung der Europäischen Union damals im Dezember 1989 es nicht zuletzt der irische Ministerpräsident war, der in einer sehr schwierigen Situation, auch in einer für mich sehr schwierigen Situation, uns Deutsche und mich unterstützt hat.</P>
    <P>Während seiner Präsidentschaft im ersten Halbjahr 1990 hat Irland damals entscheidend dazu beigetragen, da&szlig; das Gebiet der damaligen DDR, des heutigen Ostdeutschlands, reibungslos und ohne wirklich gro&szlig;e Probleme in die damalige europäische Einheit integriert werden konnte.</P>
    <P>Meine Damen und Herren, Herr Präsident, heute &mdash; sechs Jahre später &mdash; sind wir bei der Vollendung der inneren Einheit Deutschlands ein gutes Stück vorangekommen.  Natürlich haben wir noch gro&szlig;e Probleme.  Eine Teilung des Kontinents in Ost und West hat auch tiefe Spuren bei uns hinterlassen.  Wir waren durch viele Jahrzehnte durch Mauer und Stacheldraht wirklich geteilt.  Beim Neuaufbau des demokratischen Lebens in der früheren DDR, den jetzigen neuen Ländern, haben wir einen weiten Weg beschritten. Wir haben in den materiellen Bereichen gewaltige Fortschritte erreicht, obwohl noch viel zu tun ist.  Aber wir haben vor allem auch <Col N="972" /> im immateriellen Bereich zu spüren bekommen, wie sehr wir uns in diesen über vier Jahrzehnten bei der gleichen Muttersprache und der gleichen Geschichte auch auseinandergelebt haben.</P>
    <P>Um es ihnen, die Sie mitten im politisch-parmentarischen Leben stehen, vielleicht am einfachen Beispiel deutlich zu machen: Man hat in Leipzig im März 1990 in der damaligen DDR zum ersten Mal frei wählen können.  Die letzte wirklich freie Wahl in diesem Teil Deutschlands war im November 1932.  Das hei&szlig;t, wenn Sie es überlegen, mu&szlig;te man 1932 nach der alten Verfassung 21 Jahre alt sein, um wählen zu können.  Wer also 1990 zum ersten Mal wieder frei wählen konnte, war über 80 Jahre alt.  An diesem Beispiel können Sie erkennen, welchen Weg wir in so kurzer Zeit zurückgelegt haben.  Es wird noch manche Zeit brauchen, manches wird noch zusammenwachsen, aber mit Geduld &mdash; und die fällt uns manches Mal als Deutsche schwer &mdash; und mit Mut und Zuversicht werden wir das Ganze zum Gelingen bringen.</P>
    <P>Herr Präsident, meine Damen und Herren, Konrad Adenauer hat schon sehr früh beim Beginn der Bundesrepublik zu Beginn der frühen 50er jahre uns Jungen demals zugerufen: &ldquo;Deutsche Einheit und europäische Einigung sind zwei Seiten derselben Medaille.&rdquo; Wer ja sagt zur deutschen Einheit und nicht gleichzeitig für die Einigung Europas eintritt &mdash; so war seine Politik, so ist unsere und so ist meine Politik &mdash;, verrät die Zukunft unseres eigenen Landes und, so denke ich, auch die Zukunft Europas.</P>
    <P>Wenn wir heute vom &ldquo;Bau des Hauses Europa&rdquo; sprechen, dann tun wir es auch in der klaren Erkenntnis, da&szlig; dieses Jahrhundert so viel Krieg und menschliches Elend gesehen hat und da&szlig; dennoch diese 50 Jahre von 1946 an seit der gro&szlig;en Rede Winston Churchill's in Zürich, die in diesen Tagen in unserer Erinnerung wieder hervorkam, diese europäische Einigung, eine beispiellose Erfolgsgeschichte wurde.</P>
    <P>Aus ehemaligen Feinden wurde durch die europäische Integration Verständigung, Zusammenarbeit und schlie&szlig;lich Freundschaft.  Frieden, Freiheit, Demokratie und Menschenrechte und nicht zuletzt Stabilität und Wohlstand sind die notwendigen Grundlagen, auf denen das neue Europa sich auf den Weg macht und das wir jetzt zu Ende bauen müssen.  Irland war uns dabei stets ein verlä&szlig;licher und guter Freund.  Seit seinem Beitritt zur <Col N="973" /> Europäischen Gemeinschaft im Jahr 1973 hat diese Freundschaft eine besondere Qualität erhalten.  Die Iren waren und sind &ldquo;Europäer aus Überzeugung&rdquo;.  In zwei Referenden haben die Menschen hier diese Überzeugung mit gro&szlig;en Mehreiten zum Ausdruck gebracht.  Irland hat zugleich einen wichtigen Antoil daran, da&szlig; wir auf dem Wag zur europäischen Einigung weit vorangekommen sind.  Die irischen Präsidentschaften haben in diesen Jahren in der Gemeinschaft immer wieder wichtige Akzente gesetzt.  In besonderer Erinnerung ist mir der EG-Gipfel in Dublin von 1990.  Hier wurden im wesentlichen die Grundlagen für das gelegt, was wir später im Vertrag von Maastricht beschlossen haben.</P>
    <P>Ich denke &mdash; und ich sage das zu Ihnen, Herr Präsident, zu Ihnen, Herr Ministerpräsident, und den Damen und Herren des Parlaments &mdash;, da&szlig; durch die jetzt amtierende Präsidentschaft das, was wir am kommenden Samstag hier tun wollen und das, was sich in Dezember auf der gro&szlig;en Tagung wiederum in Irland vollzieht, eine Fortsetzung dieser Erfolgsgeschichte sein wird.  Ich sage Ihnen ganz einfach, was wir als Deutsche und was ich selbst als Person dazu tun kann, werde ich ganz selbstverständlich tun, so da&szlig; die irische Präsidentschaft ein gro&szlig;er Erfolg wird.</P>
    <P>Herr Präsident, meine Damen und Herren, Irland hat eine gro&szlig;e Fülle von Verbindungen über den Atlantik und weltweit, die viele Menschen in anderen Kontinenten mit uns hier in Europa verbinden.  Ich denke an die vielen Millionen überall in der Welt, die stolz sind auf ihre irische Herkunft &mdash; in Australien, in Kanada und vor allem auch in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika.  Dies ist, wie ich denke, eine wichtige Klammer zwischen der Alten und der Neuen Welt.  Wir wollen, da&szlig; dieses Haus Europa ein Haus ist, in dem auch unsere amerikanischen Freunde und Partner auf Dauer eine feste Wohnung haben.  Wir haben im Deutschen den Begriff &ldquo;Wohnrecht auf Lebenszeit&rdquo;.  Ich möchte gerne diesen Begriff auf die Präsenz unserer amerikanischen Freunde in Europa übertragen.</P>
    <P>Wir stehen jetzt vor gro&szlig;en Entscheidungen &mdash; Entscheidungen, die das Gesicht unseres Kontinents weit hinaus in das 21. Jahrhundert prägen werden.  Ich bin sicher, da&szlig; die irische Präsidentschaft dazu eine wichtige Markierung sein wird.  Für die europäosche Währungsunion haben vor ein paar Tagen hier in <Col N="974" /> Dublin die Finanzminister der Europäischen Union mit ihrer grundsätzlichen Einigung auf einem Stabiliätspakt ein kläres und, wie ich denke, auch ermutigendes Zeichen gesetzt.  Wir wollen und wir brauchen die gemeinsame Währung, um den Standort Deutschland zu stärken, um neue Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen und vorhandene Arbeitsplätze zu stabilisieren.  Wir brauchen die gemeinsame Währung, um auch der steigenden Herausforderung der Kontinente in anderen Teilen der Welt, nicht zuletzt in Südostasien und auch in Lateinamerika, begegnen zu können.</P>
    <P>Ich denke, das wird uns nur gelingen, wenn die Währungsunion eine Stabilitätsgemeinschaft ist.  Deswegen halte ich nichts von den Versuchen, die Kriterien der Stabilität zur Disposition zu stellen.</P>
    <P>Ich bin auch dafür, da&szlig; wir den uns gesetzten Zeitplan einhalten. Wer beginnt, an diesen Prinzipien Veränderungen vorzunehmen, stellt nach meiner festen Überzeugung das Werk als Ganzes in Gefahr.  Ich begrü&szlig;e es, da&szlig; Ihr Land, da&szlig; Irland auf diesem Weg besonders gro&szlig;e und, wie ich sehe, auch erfolgreiche Anstrengungen unternimmt.  Die gegenwärtige Dynamik ihrer Wirtschaft wird in ganz Europa anerkannt.  Auch wir in Deutschland haben die Weichen für die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion gestellt.  Ich sage hier ganz deutlich: Für mich ist es ein gutes Ziel &mdash; und ich würde mich freuen, wenn es erreicht werden könnte &mdash;, wenn Irland von Anfang an an diesem entscheidenden Ziel teilnehmen könnte.</P>
    <P>Ein weiterer wichtiger Punkt, meine Damen und Herren, beim Fortgang der Regierungskonferenz zur Revision des MaastrichtVertrags wird hier in diesen Tagen &mdash; ich sagte es schon &mdash; beim Sondergipfel besprochen.  Es geht darum, die Handlungsfänigkeit einer künftigen Europäischen Union sicherzustellen.  Es geht darum, da&szlig; die Bürger in Europa einen Sinn in dieser Europäischen Union erkennen können, da&szlig; das, was da geschieht, verständlicher, transparenter ist, da&szlig; nicht der Eindruck erweckt wird, da&szlig; ein neuer Überstaat ohne Kontrolle und ohne Sinn für die täglichen Sorgen entsteht, sondern eine bürgernahe Institution, die auch die Identität der einzelnen Völker respektiert.</P>
    <P>Einer der gro&szlig;en Dichter unseres Landes, Thomas Mann, hat es schon in den 30er Jahren im Blick auf Europa so formulliert: &ldquo;Wir wollen deutsche Europäer und europäische Deutsche sein.&rdquo;  Für <Col N="975" /> mich ist dieses Europa nur dann ein wirklich erstrebenswertes Ziel, wenn wir dabei unsere Identität bewahren.  Wir sind dann eben Iren und Europäer oder Europäer und Iren und deutsche Europäer und europäische Deutsche.  Wir wollen auch, da&szlig; dieses Europa kraftvoll ist.  So wird eines der wichtigen Themen an diesem kommenden Samstag sein, da&szlig; wir &mdash; ich nehme nur eines unter den vielen wichtigen Themen heraus &mdash; uns als Europa gemeinsam gegen den Generalangriff der internationalen Kriminalität, der Mafia und nicht zuletzt der Drogenmafia widersetzen.</P>
    <P>Es ist in dieser Frage &mdash; und dies sage ich mit gro&szlig;em Ernst &mdash; nach meiner Überzeugung fünf Minuten vor zwölf.  Wer glaubt, diese Frage rein auf nationaler Ebene lösen zu können, wird sich täuschen.  Das ist kein Mi&szlig;trauen gegen die Arbeit unserer nationalen Polizeien und Sicherheitskräfte.  Aber das ist, meine Damen und Herren, eine Erfahrung, da&szlig; wir heute mit weltweit operierenden kriminellen Banden zu tun haben und da&szlig; die Bürger in unseren Ländern zu Recht sagen: Es ist die Sache unseres jeweiligen Staates, die innere und die äu&szlig;ere Sicherheit, den inneren und den äu&szlig;eren Frieden des Landes zu garantieren.</P>
    <P>Wir haben noch in diesen nächsten Monaten und Jahren uns darüber zu unterhalten, wie dieses Europa der Europäischen Union aussehen wird.  Damit stellt sich die Frage nach der Erweiterung um die Staaten Mittel-, Ost- und Südosteuropas.  Sie verstehen, wenn gerade ich als Deutscher zu Ihnen sage: Es ist für uns als Deutsche unvorstellbar und völlig inakzeptabel, da&szlig; die Ostgrenze Deutschlands die Westgrenze Polens die Oder-Nei&szlig;e-Grenze ist. Wenn ich den Namen nenne, wei&szlig; jeder, was dies vor der Geschichte bedeutet.  Das wäre eine Trennung zwischen der Europäischen Union und einem Land au&szlig;erhalb der Europäischen Union.</P>
    <P>Unser Ziel in Deutschland ist, da&szlig; das, was an der Westgrenze in meiner Heimat zwischen der deutschen und der französischen Grenze als eine Grenze der Freundschaft und der Partnerschaft möglich war, sich so zwischen Deutschen und Polen an der Oder/Nei&szlig;e entwickelt.  Ich wei&szlig;, auf diesem Weg ist noch vieles an Schwierigkeiten zu bwältigen.  Aber ich denke, es wäre eine schlimme Heuchelei, wenn wir durch 40 Jahre hindurch unseren europäischen Nachbarn in Prag &mdash; ich nenne nur die wenigen <Col N="976" /> Länder für alle-, in Warschau, in Krakau oder in Budapest zugerufen hätten: Ihr gehört zu uns.  Wenn ihr dann den Kommunismus abgeschüttelt habt, wenn die Grenzen, die Mauern und die Stacheldrähte gefallen sind, dann werden wir mit euch gemeinsam in die Zukunft gehen.  Jetzt ist auch die Stunde europäischer Solidarität mit diesen Nachbarvölkern.</P>
    <P>Meine Damen und Herren, Warschau, Budapest und Prag sind ebenso ein Bestandteil Europas und der europäischen Kultur wie Berlin, Paris und Dublin.  Die irische Stimme im Konzert der Kulturen wollen und können wir nicht missen.  Das nur an Fläche kleine Land an der atlantischen Grenze Europas hat uns in Europa vielgegeben.  Irland entwickelte schon früher eine ganz eigene gro&szlig;e Kultur, deren Strahlkraft auf ganz Europa wirkte.  Irische Mönche &mdash; wir wollen das nicht vergessen &mdash; brachten seit dem 7. Jahrhundert aus den Klöstern und Kapellen dieses Landes den christlichen Glauben auch in das Territorium des heutigen Deutschlands.  Der tiefe Glauben und der Lebensmut dieser Männer hat die geistigen Wurzeln unseres Kontinents tief geprägt. Herr Präsident, Sie hatten die Freundlichkeit, an den Heiligen Kilian zu erinnern.  Er war als Bischof und Stadtpatron von Würzburg tätig und wird noch heute in diesem Teil unseres Vaterlandes hoch verehrt.  Die Zeugnisse christlich geprägter Kunst, die im Laufe der Jahrhunderte in Irland entstanden, gehören zum gro&szlig;en Kulturerbe Europas.</P>
    <P>Meine Damen un Herren, ich freue mich auf meinen Besuch morgen in Glendalough, und morgen werde ich auch das &ldquo;Book of Kells&rdquo; sehen.</P>
    <P>Irland ist nicht nur ein Land einer alten Kultur.  Ganz Europa ist fasziniert von der Kreativität und der künstlerischen Gegenwart &mdash; von irischer Musik über die bildenden Künste bis hin zum irischen Film.  Es hat noch einen unschätzbaren Vorteil, und Sie verstehen, wenn ich das mit einem leichten Unterton, vielleicht sogar des Neides hinzufüge: Es ist ein junges Land mit vielen, vielen jungen Menschen.  An sie, an die jungen Iren, richte ich mein Wort, wenn ich sage: Ihr, die Jungen in Irland, steht heute vor Chancen, vor Möglichkeiten und vor Zukunftsperspektiven, von denen Eure Mütter und Väter und schon gar nicht Eure Gro&szlig;eltern nicht einmal zu träumen wagten.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> Wir wissen, diese Zukunft wird nicht immer einfach sein.  Es gibt eine Menge Probleme auch im Alltag.  Aber dies gehört zu einem ganz normalen Leben.  Auch wir in unserer Generation bekommen die Zukunft nicht geschenkt.  Vernunft und Augenma&szlig;, Mut und auch guter Wille sind nötig.  Aber jetzt &mdash; ich sage es noch einmal &mdash; am Ende dieses Jahrhunderts, das so viel Elend, Leid und Sorgen sah, ist es doch ganz gewi&szlig; viel einfacher als in manchen Stationen dieses Jahrhunderts, Zukunft zu meistern.</P>
    <P>Wer heute 20 Jahre alt ist, hat noch eine weite Lebensperspektive vor sich.  Nach der mittleren Lebenserwartung werden die meisten der jetzt 20 jährigen, auch die, die heute in Dublin leben, die Mitte des kommenden Jahrhunderts erreichen.  Das hei&szlig;t, ihre Lebenszeit, die Ihnen geschenkte Zeit, wird weit in das 21. Jahrhundert hineinführen.</P>
    <P>Herr Präsident, meine Damen und Herren, ich denke, es ist unsere Sache, die Sache derjenigen, die heute zum Handeln berufen sind, da&szlig; wir dafür Sorge tragen, da&szlig; diese junge Generation eine gute Zukunft hat &mdash; die der älteren Generation in diesem Haus, die aus meinem Jahrgang kommt und die wie ich noch den Krieg erlebt hat &mdash; ich war bei Kriegsende 15 Jahr alt &mdash; und die der mittleren Generation, die in diesem mittleren Abschnitt im dritten Viertel dieses Jahrhunderts verautnortung hat und die der ganz Jungen, die hier erfreulicherweise dabei sind.  Es geht um eine gute Zukunft in Irland, in Deutschland und in Europe.</P>
    <P>Wir sollten das mit einer gro&szlig;en Freude und nicht mit Verzagtheit tun, nicht mit Pessimismus und nicht mit blo&szlig;em Optimismus, sondern mit realistischem Optimismus und uns dann auf den Weg zum Wohl unserer Völker für Frieden, Freiheit und Wohlstand machen.  So sage ich Ihnen und rufe Ihnen zu: Lang lebe die deutsch-irische Freundschaft! Gott segne Irland!</P>

      <P>Chancellor, it is now my great privilege to offer you the thanks of the House for your inspiring address which we shall long remember and for your kind and generous remarks about us.  As you and your charming wife leave us you can rest <Col N="978" /> assured that you carry with you the warmth, affection and sincere good wishes of the Members of this House and of all the Irish people.  If you experience any delay in making your exit from this Chamber it will only be because the ambitious Members on both sides of this House will have a particular interest in ascertaining from you the secret formula of your longevity in political life.  My parliamentary colleagues know from my record that I have mastered the knack, but I am not telling.  You may, Sir, if you so desire pass on the advice to them as to how to get to the top and stay there for so long.</P>
      <P>I say most sincerely, long live German-Irish friendship, long live Helmut Kohl and the grand people whom he represents.  Slán agus beannacht.</P>

      <P>It was a great privilege for this House to listen to Chancellor Kohl today and to acknowledge one of the great statesmen of Europe and the world.  It was gratifying for those of us on this side of the House to listen to his kind remarks about my predecessor, Charles Haughey, who during the meetings of December 1989, which he kindly recalled, and during the last Irish Presidency, worked to bring about self-determination for the German people and German unity.  I express our appreciation in that regard.  I am sure the Taoiseach <Col N="980" /> will join me in acknowledging Chancellor Kohl's nice remarks about my predecessor as well as acknowledging the great contribution to European unity which Chancellor Kohl is working hard to achieve during our Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily endorse what Deputy Ahern said.  Chancellor Kohl was even more appreciative in private than he was in public of the role played by the Irish Government during its Presidency and by my predecessor, Mr. Haughey.  He strongly believes this was a very important intervention by Ireland in assisting German reunification at a time when the issue could have gone either way.  It was proper that he acknowledged that but it is also equally appropriate that we should acknowledge the vision, endurance and statesmanship of Chancellor Kohl at a time when many, even in Germany, did not believe German reunification was possible.  He had the vision, the persistence and the international stature to achieve it.  The House was privileged to hear a man whom I certainly consider to be perhaps the greatest European of his time.  When in later years we consider the history of our times, we will be very pleased to tell our successors we were here when Chancellor Kohl spoke. We were in the presence of a truly great man.  That frequently cannot be said about people who are still in office but it can certainly be said of Chancellor Kohl.</P>

Without adding a sour note, the Government has been considering the bail issue for 18 months. Three months ago the Taoiseach promised a referendum.  To date, we have not seen the legislation and we do not know when the referendum will take place. Eight out of ten people want the law on bail changed.  What is the delay?

      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House when the decommissioning legislation will be published and, more important, when it will be debated in this House?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the timing of this legislation will be crucially important, particularly after the remarks at the weekend by Mr. <Col N="982" /> Trimble that even if there were a genuine IRA ceasefire, for which we continue to call in this House, there would still be preconditions set to create obstacles for inclusive, all-party talks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on the legislation in question is at an advanced stage.  We were anxious to take into account the views of all the parties which have been consulted in the Belfast talks and not to publish anything definitive until we had given all the relevant parties an opportunity to have their views heard by both Governments and, in the case of the legislation here, by the Irish Government.  That consideration is coming to a conclusion and we will be in a position to finalise and publish the proposals reasonably soon. However, I cannot give a precise date to the Deputy.  Obviously it is important with regard to the talks generally that parties should recognise the need for compromise, the need to understand the point of view of others and to accept that everyone has a responsibility for working towards a reasonable agreement that will bring peace and stability and a sense of self respect to every individual living in Northern Ireland and on these islands.</P>

On the other points I made following the remarks made by Mr. Trimble over the weekend that even if there were a genuine IRA ceasefire he would still set preconditions, will the Taoiseach agree that the timing of the passing of this legislation should be considered and that we should keep a close eye on how progressive other people are in dealing with other parts of the agreement within talks?</P>

      <P>This is a topic we discussed at some length on Committee Stage.  I am not happy about what we are doing in respect of control areas.  I set out to make the country a control area.  I accept the Minister is trying to accommodate my proposal and I thank him, but the Bill as framed allows local authorities to opt out rather than in.  The whole country should be a control area and if a local authority wishes to opt out it should only be allowed do so by going through the tortuous process of by-laws etc.  If local authorities are contiguous and do not have a control area the Minister has powers to do something about it.  Is that going far enough?  I do not understand the Minister's reluctance to make the whole country a control area. He could accept my amendment and also include amendments Nos. 7 and 8.</P>

      <P>This problem seems to be concentrated in certain parts of the country.  We carried out an audit of the number of wandering horses throughout the country and discovered that certain parts of the country are not affected by the phenomenon.  That was the reason we decided to develop control areas. The advantage in having a control area is that resources can be targeted in those areas where the problem is most pronounced.  If the entire country was a control area resources would have to be spread thinly.  There are specific areas where this is a real problem.</P>
      <P>I hope, through the concept of control areas, we can target certain areas.  Concern was expressed by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Kenneally, on Committee Stage.  I consulted the parliamentary draftsman and we came up with amendment No. 7 which provides that if a local authority designates its area a control area and if horses wander in from the neighbouring local authority area, which is not a control area, that local authority can request the neighbouring local authority to declare its area a control area.  If it refuses to do so the local authority can apply to the Minister who can direct that local authority to declare itself a control area.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Bill that local authority can use the local authority which has a control area for administrative purposes, licensing and so on.  This is a very important provision.  If it becomes a national problem the whole country could become a control area. The Bill is built around the concept of control areas where there is a problem. If the State was designated a control area there would be no point in having control areas.  I am here to listen, to try to improve the Bill and provide effective legislation which will have the support of the House.  We will allay the fears of a number of Deputies, including Deputy Walsh, who spoke on this question on Committee Stage.  Given that we have tried to accommodate Deputy Kenneally and others I ask him to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone a long way to address the problem I raised on Committee Stage.  He has done an excellent job in drawing attention to an important aspect &mdash; the ability of the State to target the areas where the problem exists, such as Tallaght where there are now more than 1,000 wandering horses.  If the entire country was designated a control area it would be difficult to target the affected areas.  The ability of the Minister to intervene if a local authority adjacent to another area where there is a problem fails to act is the required safeguard. The Minister has done an excellent job and has addressed the problem adequately.  Deputy Kenneally's amendment, although his intention was to address what was becoming a very big problem, would dilute the targeting of resources to where the problem exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that targeting all areas, and not only those where the problem is most pronounced, will result in the resources being spread too thinly.  Deputy Walsh referred to Dublin where the problem is different from that in other areas.  In areas outside Dublin people who own horses will move to an area which is not a control area, if there is a problem.  In the past these owners moved out of areas where there were problems and returned at a later stage when the heat had died down.  I cannot, therefore, accept the argument that by targeting all areas the resources will be spread too thinly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that a local authority can be directed at a later stage to designate an area a control area.  We discussed the matter on Committee Stage and concluded that it would take approximately two months for a local authority to introduce a by-law <Col N="995" /> designating an area as a control area.  It would take a similar period for the Minister to make an order and for it to be operable.  The formula I have put forward is more acceptable and would work much better.  Having said that, I accept that the Minister listened to the points made by Deputies on Second and Committee Stages and has gone a good deal of the way in addressing the reservations expressed by me.  With this in mind, I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a problem with these amendments but I am afraid the Minister may be leaving the door open for a local authority to act in an agency capacity for all other local authorities.  The Minister said that the area outside Dublin with the largest number of horses is Wexford.  Given the large number of horses in its area the local authority in Wexford will have to deploy staff to deal with the registration, etc. of horses.  Local authorities in other areas may decide that the staff in the Wexford local authority are experts in these matters and it would be better to pay that local authority an agency fee.  Is that the aim of this provision and, if so, how will it work in practice?  Will it mean that, say, Donegal County Council will be able to send all the paperwork regarding the registration of horses to the Wexford local authority?  That is my reading of these amendments and I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be done by agreement.  If Bray, which is on the outskirts of a local authority area, has a problem which affects the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area, it can ask the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority to apply its by-laws to the affected area.  Local authorities will not be compelled to do this; rather it is an option which we believe will facilitate the speedy imposition of <Col N="998" /> by-laws and immediately put in place a licensing system to deal with the problem. This system has not been provided for before.</P>
      <P>We discussed the matter at length and considered the reservations expressed by the Deputy but, at the end of the day, we decided that this provision would facilitate the effectiveness of the Bill. The adoption by a local authority of the by-laws of another local authority will have to be done by agreement between both local authorities.  This is probably not the way local authorities will go but it is an option for them.  Deputy Lenihan, who has a legal background, may have a different view of this innovative provision but, having discussed the matter at length, I am convinced it will facilitate the taking of effective action to deal with a problem at a particular time.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned Bray as an example which, of course, is an urban district.  The definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in the Bill appears to be restricted to counties and county boroughs. I take it the Minister was referring to a county adjacent to a county borough in which case it would be more convenient for the county borough to manage the pound for the suburban area within the county, for example, the part of Meath adjacent to County Fingal or the part of Kildare adjacent to South County Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposal is excellent, particularly with regard to the Dublin area where there are four local authorities.  It would be <Col N="999" /> pointless to oblige each authority to set up a structure to deal with the problem of wandering horses.  South Dublin County Council would be the ideal authority to deal with it as it has the greatest number of wandering horses. This would be an ideal arrangement to prevent duplication of services, although it might be more difficult to apply in rural areas.</P>

We were confident, therefore, that its inclusion would improve the Bill's effectiveness. Arrangements can be made between neighbouring councils if there is a specific problem which spills over into another local authority area.  As Deputy Kenneally pointed out, people might move to an area where there are no controls and this provision will speedily rectify that problem.</P>

    <P>This amendment was proposed on Committee Stage and the Minister of State undertook to examine the position.  He appears to have done that.  The Department's officials have indicated that what I sought to achieve in the amendment is already enshrined in legislation. However, this amendment probably goes further.  When this matter was discussed on Second Stage and Committee Stage a number of Government backbenchers were overwhelmingly in favour of the amendment.  In amendments Nos. 21 and 22 the Minister is given the power to amend by-laws of local authorities. Is it the case that the controls I was attempting to introduce are not in place and that local authorities do not have the power to enforce regulations such as this?  If they had such power it would not be necessary for the Minister to propose amendments Nos. 21 and 22. If they do not have the power it would be better to go further than the Minister and introduce the various conditions outlined in my amendment.  Perhaps my amendment duplicates what is already included in other legislation.  Would the position be more secure if it was included?</P>

      <P>I agree with the provisions in the amendment.  However, they are not matters for primary legislation. Many of the provisions are already in place in various welfare Acts, as is outlined in the table in the Bill. Local authorities can take account of these provisions in their by-laws.  Including these provisions in the Bill would curtail the flexibility of local authorities in this regard.  I prefer to leave such decisions to local authorities so that they can frame by-laws that would be most suitable to their own areas and difficulties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenneally expressed considerable concern about this on Committee Stage and, in order to take his point on board, I have emphasised the words &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;market&rdquo; in the Government amendment.  The amendment refers specifically to the conduct of fairs and markets by local authorities when they are framing by-laws.  We have gone as far as possible to allay the fears of Deputy Kenneally with respect to fairs and the welfare issue.

There is a major problem and we must ensure that the legislation is effective.</P>
    <P>My amendment is simple and straightforward. If an animal is impounded on three occasions the local authority can dispose of it as it sees fit.  I have spoken to members of my local authority and received representations from other councillors and local authorities who were concerned about the Bill following Committee Stage.  They believe it has been rendered inoperable.  The Minister of State has put forward a lengthy amendment to section 39 to meet some of those fears.  However, I am not convinced that it achieves its aim.  It appears that we will still have to refer to section 8 of the Bill which provides that a local authority must go to court to get possession of a horse in order to make a decision on how the animal will be disposed of.  We are all aware of how clogged our court system is at present and how long it takes for a case to get to court.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to achieve is much simpler.  The authorised officer should be allowed make a decision on impounding and disposing of horses. The Minister's amendment will create unnecessary bureaucracy.  Subsection (3) states &ldquo;... (including representations to the effect that the owner of the horse was not the owner of the horse on any previous occasion when it was detained under section 36 during the aforesaid period of 12 months) ...&rdquo;. That provision will allow horse owners circumvent the law.  If a person's horse were impounded, ownership could be transferred to the owner's wife.  If it <Col N="1006" /> were impounded a second time, ownership could be transferred to a son or daughter and after a period of 12 months it could be transferred back into the husband's name.  The Minister is creating a loophole for people to circumvent the provisions of the legislation. Subsection (4) of the Minister's amendment states, &ldquo;...the person may within 7 days of such notification appeal against the decision to the judge of the District Court within whose district court district the horse is detained&rdquo;. This would mean the relevant local authority would have to go through the courts to have the matter resolved.</P>
    <P>This is not what we set out to do.  We wanted to make the legislation as simple as possible, but instead we are creating unnecessary bureaucracy.  This is a fundamental section of the Bill.  If we allow the legislation to pass as currently drafted, it will not work and Members will have wasted time dealing with it. The authorised officers should make decisions about disposing of horses.  The Minister also referred to the necessity to put up notices and to write to the person concerned.  This Bill will accommodate the perpetrators, not those affected by the problem.  If a horse is impounded because the owner is not taking care of it, the onus should be on that individual to get the animal back.  As this section will make the Bill unworkable, I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>I accept the spirit of the Deputy's amendment, which is included in the Minister's amendment. We must provide a system of appeal in this area.  The onus is on the owner, not the local authority, to make the necessary representations or, if necessary, to go through the legal process to have his or her horse returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three strikes clause, which was in the original legislation, was removed on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman because of the question of property and constitutional rights.  We consulted Dublin Corporation and other local authorities prior to drafting this amendment and it addresses the concerns <Col N="1007" /> expressed on Committee Stage.  It will also mean a citizen cannot be treated unfairly.  The amendment strikes a balance between introducing effective legislation and ensuring people are not victimised.  The parliamentary draftsman did a good job in drafting it.  While I accept the Deputy's point, I am sure he will change his mind about the Minister's amendment now that he knows the horse owner, not the local authority, will have to go through the legal process to have the horse returned.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister addressed the concerns expressed by Members on Committee Stage.  Local administrations and their officers were concerned that the Bill would lead to a revolving door system at the pound where horses would go in and out in a manner analogous to our general penal system.  The Minister has gone some way towards meeting that concern.  One could also make an analogy with the driving test.  If one fails, one has a right to appeal, but the onus is on the person applying for the licence to make that appeal.  The Minister has placed the onus on the horse owner to reclaim the animal when it has been impounded on three occasions.</P>
      <P>Our amendment gives a much clearer signal about what will happen.  Clear signals are necessary in this area.  I am pleased the draftsman reconsidered the matter because I understood from the Committee Stage debate that the Attorney General believed it would be unconstitutional to dispose of a horse that had been seized and impounded on three occasions.  Is it unconstitutional, for example, for local authorities to collect and dispose of litter?  We are dealing with anti-social behaviour in this legislation.  If the common good deems it necessary, the Constitution allows property rights to be delimited in the interests of social justice.  In this case the common good would deem it necessary to provide for the forfeiture of a horse that has been impounded on three occasions.  Our amendment gives a clear signal in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a detailed explanation of this complex matter.  The onus to take the matter to court will rest with the horse owner. Local authorities were concerned that they would have to go to court to get permission to deal with the problem and in so doing waste a great deal of time dealing with people who have little regard for the legal process.  The Minister's amendment addresses the concerns expressed on Committee Stage and the legislation will work.  The onus will be on the offender to take the matter to court.</P>
      <P>If this provision were not in the Bill, horse owners would probably go through the courts anyway.  If we do not provide for a system of appeal, a court might not approve of local authorities confiscating horses.  In other words, the courts could place restrictions on the manner in which the legislation works and they could decide how to deal with the problem.  The Minister must be seen to be fair and he has taken the best course of action.  I am sure Deputies Kenneally and Lenihan will also agree this is the best possible approach.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State made an excellent case for the amendment and I accept his views to some extent.  However, in making a judgement under this legislation, a local authority official or a superintendent would be more likely to take positive action to deal with this major problem if that person were operating on the basis of the amendment tabled by Deputies Kenneally and Lenihan rather than on the one tabled by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister's proposal will be to water down the effectiveness of the Bill.  The case put by my colleagues is a lot stronger and will result in a better Bill which will serve the public in a more positive way.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister but he has not told me anything I do not already know.  Obviously the person who is appealing must bring the matter to court but how long will it take?  The <Col N="1009" /> horse will be dead by the time the case gets to court given the backlog in our courts system at present.  The Minister spoke about red tape but, as I said, the authorised officer must write to the person, as stated in his amendment.  There is a safeguard for the owner because the horse is not disposed of after the first or second occasion but after the third.</P>
      <P>The Minister is hiding behind the parliamentary draftsman and constitutional rights.  As he said, the heads of the Bill were along the lines I proposed.  Again, we have not heard a reason that is not constitutional.  My colleague, Deputy Lenihan, adverted to that.  Unfortunately, the Bill is being watered down.  I accept the Minister has tried to go a long way but the Bill, as it stands, may not be workable.  He should have taken that extra step and for that reason, I will press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 23, line 9, after &ldquo;area&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in particular may provide lands within the functional area of the local authority for the keeping of horses&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This arises out of the earlier discussion about the need for local authorities to provide corrals or some place for the keeping of horses.  This amendment provides that in addition to making by-laws for the control and welfare of horses in the whole or part of its functional area, a local authority may &ldquo;in particular provide lands within the functional area of the local authority for the keeping of horses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment as proposed does not suggest that there should be any obligation on a local authority to do so.  It merely permits a local authority to provide lands for that purpose.  If inserted in section 43, it would allow the local authority to adopt by-laws to regulate any such corral or place.  The general social problem which this amendment seeks to address is the need to provide or to give encouragement to those in deprived areas who have shown a great interest in equine culture and to try to develop that in a positive and regulated fashion.  That was the thinking in our party behind tabling this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this on Committee Stage and I expressed my opposition to it following consultation with people in the areas most affected by the problem of wandering horses. They were adamant that there should be no place in any urban area for the keeping of horses because there is great difficulty in enforcing control.  If a local authority allows for a corral, it would fall to it to police it and to ensure that it is kept properly.  Attempts to provide such places would create difficulty to people living adjacent to them.</P>
      <P>People are fearful of the consequences of having animals in urban areas and fear that it is unhygienic.  A suggestion was made in Tallaght today, though I am convinced there must be some mistake, that a case of foot and mouth disease has been identified in Crumlin Hospital.  It is strange that people from a rural background are suggesting the control of animals in urban areas is a problem and that some children in Crumlin Hospital have been affected by foot and mouth disease as a result of droppings from animals.  I know that sounds like a wild suggestion but it was said to me by a number of people.</P>
      <P>The keeping of animals in an urban area is unsuitable.  Inserting such a provision in the Bill would create a loophole and corrals would be established. It would fall to the local authority to police them so as to ensure they were operated in accordance with various regulations and Acts.  This would put further strain on a local authority.  If people in urban areas wish to enjoy horses they must do so in an environment which is suitable for the horse. The local authority areas I represent do not constitute such an area.  I oppose this amendment on the grounds that people have told me they do not want horses in urban areas.</P>

      <P>This amendment was inspired by a visit I made to Deputy Walsh's constituency and by remarks made to me by my Dublin colleagues who knew of various projects set up around the city.  This problem relates <Col N="1014" /> more to Dublin than to any other part of the country.  I withdrew the amendment on Committee Stage to see if we could improve its wording.  It is basically an encouragement to local authorities to try to provide ground, where possible, for properly constituted organisations in areas which will not affect anybody and where animals will be corralled.  We cannot compel local authorities to provide corrals.  They do not have the wherewithal to deal with such a problem. However, certain projects are operating well, are extremely well controlled and deserve to be supported.  I suggest that councils issue a licence in respect of worthy projects and withdraw it in a year's time if the operation is not properly run.  Encouragement should be given to the people operating such projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the section is broad enough to cover the establishment of an area for the purpose intended in the amendment. Section 43 states that the local authority may make by-laws for the control and welfare of horses in all or part of its functional area.  If necessary, that covers local authorities providing lands within their jurisdictions.  The amendment is a legal nicety and it is not required.  I agree the option covered in it should be available.  The ownership and use of horses is uncontrolled and horses are widely abused, particularly by young people of virtually every age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area, Dublin Corporation has embarked on proposals to provide at least one corral in the area in Ballyfermot. It has identified land and met City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee with a view to establishing a corral covering an area of 12 acres. People have requested that the area be larger, up to 20 acres, and local councillors have been involved in the discussions. It is proposed that stables be provided and that the local authority, FÁS and the vocational education committee co-ordinate their efforts in the provision of community employment schemes and education facilities in that <Col N="1015" /> respect.  The approach is not directed at stamping out the love and care of horses that is part and parcel of the issue.  It is directed at stamping out the abuse of horses while ensuring that young people in deprived areas have an opportunity to come in contact with animals, particularly horses.  In that process they would be educated and trained in the care, grooming and riding of horses in controlled conditions.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of open space in areas, such as Ballyfermot and Finglas, that border County Dublin.  People in Finglas are seeking the establishment of a corral project.  The local authority should have the option to set up such projects, but they must be controlled, otherwise matters will get out of hand. It is envisaged that horses will be provided under such projects and not owned by the children, that training will be provided by FÁS and that education will be provided by the local vocational school.  That would encourage youngsters into an education and training mode.  Many of the young people involved with horses are drop-outs and are at risk and it would be valuable if their energies were channelled into such developments.</P>
    <P>I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Walsh, but each local authority should be able to reserve the right to pursue the option set out in the amendment in consultation with its councillors and with people in localities where the problem of wandering horses and abuse of them is endemic.  We are all aware of those areas in the county and city.  The wishes of Deputies Kenneally and Lenihan are encompassed in section 43.  I agree with the wording in it and welcome the exploration by my local authority of the prospect of providing an area where young people can be properly educated in the handling of horses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of providing land for corral and other projects in areas experiencing the problem of wandering horses, but it is not necessary to provide for that in <Col N="1016" /> legislation as local authorities can do so under existing arrangements.  As Deputy Costello pointed out, section 43 allows local authorities to approve the setting up of corral projects.  If the provision was included in the Bill, it could be used against local authorities.  It could be abused and could leave local authorities open to court action and unreasonable requests.  Local authorities experiencing this problem will have to respond to the needs of their communities.  If there is a need to provide proper corral projects for young people to pursue their interests, local authorities should provide them and should be supported as much as possible by the State.</P>
      <P>However, providing for that in legislation is unnecessary and it could put an unfair onus on local authorities.  For that reason I reject the amendment, but I agree with the aspiration and motivation behind it.  I hope local authorities will provide these facilities when the full impact of this Bill is felt.  It is tough effective legislation and there must be a response to the problem.</P>

On that basis and on the basis of the interpretation of the section given in such an authoritative manner by Deputy Costello and confirmed by the Minister we will not press the amendment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Costello that the problem concerns children in deprived areas, some of which are experiencing the drugs problem at its most intense. Any activity that can give a spark of hope to the younger populations in those areas must be encouraged.  That is why my party tabled this amendment. While I appreciate Deputy Walsh's concerns, there is a good deal of vacant land in local authority areas of Fingal and South County Dublin and, as Deputy Costello stated, in parts of the functional area of Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>I take the opportunity to thank Members for their co-operation in dealing with this Bill.  The House has had a major influence on its drafting and final outcome.  The Bill has been enhanced and strengthened as a result of the amendments made during the debate.  While I have not accepted all proposals for change, I have considered each of them carefully and I have made sure to draw upon any which were amenable to insertion in the Bill, either on practical or legal grounds.  I like to think that I have accommodated Deputies to the fullest extent possible. I thank the House for its positive and constructive support of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I also put on record my appreciation of the support and advice received from the local authorities, resident associations, travelling community, equestrian groups and the farming community.  The extensive level of consultation with such a wide cross section of our society reflects the complexity of the difficulties encountered with wandering horses. This consultation process was of great benefit in the drafting of the Bill.  I have already commenced a consultation process in relation to the means of horse identification appropriate under the legislation and in relation to the drafting of by-laws to be introduced by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I believe this Bill addresses two principal issues, namely, the protection of persons and property from the dangers of wandering horses and also the welfare of horses.  On the implementation of the provisions of this Bill the risks to motorists and pedestrians will be much reduced.  Coupled with this, the Bill reflects the onus on horse owners to take greater responsibility for their horses by not exposing their animals to the dangers of motorways and to provide adequate accommodation for their horses without hindrance to other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to bringing this Bill to the Seanad without delay as early enactment is desirable to alleviate this escalating problem of wandering horses, principally in urban areas.  I assure those <Col N="1020" /> who have supported the Bill that the legislation, when enacted, will be vigorously enforced.  This is in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>I thank my officials who have worked very hard for the past year and a half on this legislation.  Last March two officials and I received a blank sheet of paper and were told to put this legislation in place.  It was a difficult task.  This is pioneering legislation in many ways and it took a long time to produce a framework for it.  We produced this Bill in record time.</P>
    <P>I also thank the parliamentary draftsman who was very patient.  He followed the debate and listened to the contributions by Deputies on all sides.  As a result, we have a better Bill.  I thank Deputies for their worthwhile contributions, especially Deputy Kenneally who introduced his own Private Members' Bill, and the Minister, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my thanks for the generous way in which all Deputies approached this Bill.  We worked together very effectively during the private briefing and on Second and Committee Stages.  The Bill has been agreed by the House and I hope it will be effective.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have finally reached this stage.  This matter has been a bugbear for a considerable period.  Nobody was doing anything about the problem, which is what inspired me to draft my Private Members' Bill.  I compliment the Minister of State on all the work he has done.  As he said, he began with a blank sheet of paper and it was a difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time I have been so closely involved with any legislation.  I do not agree with everything in the Bill but most of the points we put forward on Second and Committee Stages were seriously considered and taken on board by the Minister of State where he could do so.  We were also given the courtesy of being brought through the heads of the Bill at the drafting stage.  The Bill contains 47 sections and one can clearly see from the number of amendments <Col N="1021" /> tabled on Committee and Report Stages that a great deal of thought and consideration was put into it by everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope the necessary resources will be put in place to ensure the effectiveness of the legislation.  Otherwise, our work over the past months will have been useless. I hope we do not have to return to make further changes to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for all his help and courtesy throughout the entire debate.  I also thank the Deputies on all sides of the House who contributed. The Minister of State's officials were extremely helpful.  I thank everyone who was involved.  I hope the Bill will be passed by the Seanad fairly quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I too pay tribute to the Minister and his work on this excellent, well researched Bill, the provisions of which will address the serious problem of wandering horses nationwide.  He has done an excellent job in the manner in which he accommodated, wherever possible, any reasonable argument and his crucial, prior consultation with local authorities, residents' associations and everybody with a vested interest in its provisions which also reflect the extremely hard work of his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Kenneally and Lenihan consistently put forward excellent proposals, with which we may not always have agreed, but our common interest was to address and endeavour to solve the problem.  We need only await the passage of the Bill through the Seanad when, I have no doubt, our constituents, particularly mine in Dublin South-West &mdash; where the problem is particularly acute &mdash; will be glad to note its final passage through both Houses.  I look forward to its provisions being implemented and to experiencing some respite from this serious problem in urban and other areas.  It was an eye opener to note from the study that Wexford is hardest hit, with 800 wandering horses, demonstrating how difficult this <Col N="1022" /> problem has become within a short time.</P>
    <P>We shall all be thanked in future years for introducing this Bill because of the effectiveness of its provisions, brought about through the co-operation of everybody involved.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment to section 14 and arises from one tabled by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on Committee Stage, the main purpose of which was to provide that a person appointed chief executive officer of a health board shall hold office for a period not exceeding seven years.  Fully accepting that the principle of that amendment was technically defective in certain respects &mdash; I often did the same when I was in Opposition &mdash; she agreed to withdraw it, when I undertook to have a suitable one drafted for Report Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Residential property tax was born of the Fine Gael-Labour Government in 1983.  I repeat the commitment given by me on behalf of Fianna Fáil on budget day 1995, that Fianna Fáil will repeal residential property tax on its return to power.  The political parentage of this tax was thrown into some doubt upon publication of the memoirs of former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  The notion of residential property tax was always claimed by the Labour Party and sold as such from its inception.  However, in his book, Dr. <Col N="1026" /> FitzGerald took umbrage at this notion and suggests that he and his daughter-in-law, now Minister of State Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, were the originators of this daft concept.  That proves Dr. FitzGerald has lost none of his very likeable political innocence since leaving power.  One would have thought that few politicians would rush to claim such a stupid tax, but such considerations do not trouble Dr. FitzGerald.</P>
      <P>What was the political rationale behind the introduction of residential property tax in 1983?  The politics and philosophy behind such a tax was born out of the confused social thinking so beloved of Irish politics, the typical old Labour Party doctrine of begrudgery. The doctrine in politics of begrudgery is beloved by the left in Irish society, and acolytes and disciples are to be found in some media productions, print and broadcast.  Although the politics of Europe has changed remarkably in the past decade, Ireland remains a bastion of an old regressive, sterile and outdated rhetoric of the left.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party thinking in 1983 on residential property tax was roughly based on the concept that people in large houses should be taxed more. Someone would then have asked: &ldquo;What about dear old ladies who live in large houses but have no income?&rdquo; I presume some Labour Party guru came up with the idea of the income threshold and thus the residential property tax came into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political philosophy of denigrating those who make an effort to improve themselves was not confined to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s but was at the background of much of the thinking of politicians and advisers, particularly those of the left, in recent years.  It can be summed up by the suggestion that if one makes a success of their lives, whether getting a job or promotion or starting up a business and employing people, one is to be denigrated.  Those people are usually praised for a few years and told they are great to employ 200 or 300 people, but as sure as night follows day, if people are too successful <Col N="1027" /> they are pulled down by those who probably have denigrated them from the outset.  That is a unique Irish phenomenon which has grown apace in recent years, particularly in some publications. It was at the root of much of the difficulties and thinking of the 1990s and was referred to in many debates in this House.  Many people who make a success of themselves and provide employment are pulled down by people using the privilege of this House and by their acolytes in the media.  Those who go to the effort of making a success of themselves should not be denigrated.</P>
    <P>Most politicians will agree with what I am saying, but one cannot be too outspoken in this regard because one would be given the tag &ldquo;right-winger&rdquo;, one who is in favour of making the poor pay. People in cushy jobs, usually supported by the State or by institutions, those who have enough money to pay their employees and have never been forced to let them go, denigrate people who have had to mortgage their houses in order to support their business.  That form of begrudgery is endemic in Irish society.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will agree with much of what I say in that regard.  It is to the shame of many politicians and commentators that this practice has become the accepted form.  It is at the root of much political thinking of the present day and it was at the root of the concept of residential property tax in 1983.  The rationale behind the confused economic thinking of many people such as Dr. Garret FitzGerald escapes me now as it did then.</P>
    <P>Unless we are prepared to accept the &ldquo;risk and reward&rdquo; principle we will not encourage native Irish entrepreneurs and business people to get ahead.  If we foster the practice of knocking the man or woman who makes a success of themselves we are at nought.  We never seem to knock the entrepreneur who comes here from afar or the multinational which sets up in one of our constituencies. It is the Irish person who perhaps started off with very little and has worked very hard who is constantly <Col N="1028" /> knocked.  In recent years a number of Irish people have suffered in this way, although nobody would say that everybody in business is a saint.</P>
    <P>Those who have survived and succeeded in business despite the bureaucracy have to work hard and possibly on occasion have to take short cuts.  Whenever I hear Members of this House, particularly from the left, denigrating or criticising such people whenever a mistake is made I feel violently ill because the people concerned have not created one job in their lives.  Those who make policy and policy initiators within the Civil Service should bear this in mind. Unless we make some efforts to correct this confused political thinking and devise a new political, social and economic philosophy which praises the man or woman who makes an effort we will be at nought.</P>
    <P>There was no logic behind the introduction of residential property tax and there is no logic behind the concept now.  It is worth commencing this debate with a few thoughts on what the tax is all about.  It is a tax on property, on a family or individual's home but unlike any other tax that I can think of and over which we may wish to disagree violently it does not start from an equitable basis.  Many taxes have ended up being inequitable but each one that I can recall started out from an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>Residential property tax is not an income or wealth tax; it is discriminatory, anti-family and grossly unfair.  By its very nature it is arbitrary in its application. Yesterday, 1 October, was D-Day for residential property tax returns. Any member of the parties in Government can state what they like on this issue.  If Fianna Fáil is of the view that a tax or policy is downright unfair, discriminatory, biased or penalises one section of the community or any one region it will immediately address the issue and abolish it.  We have promised to do this in the case of residential property tax.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the decision of Deputy Bertie Ahern when Minister for <Col N="1029" /> Finance in 1994 to adjust the valuation and income thresholds.  My party leader may be too much of a gentleman to say so but as a member of the then Government I feel under no such constraints. The question of why the thresholds were adjusted should be put to the Labour Party members of that Government or alternatively to the spin doctors of the Labour Party both then and now.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled to this motion in the name of the Minister for Finance, a member of the Labour Party, reads: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes the speedy action taken by the Government in the 1995 budget to reverse, as promised in its Programme of Renewal, the changes in the income and house value thresholds for residential property tax introduced in the 1994 Finance Act...&rdquo;.  Perhaps my former colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairi Quinn, would explain to the House why the income and house value thresholds were changed.  I am constrained by the principle of Cabinet confidentiality but it was not Deputy Bertie Ahern, Deputy Cowen or me who thought up the idea.</P>

      <P>It is an inescapable fact that residential property tax is inequitable.  No one can seriously disagree with that statement.  It must be abolished because it penalises those who reside within certain areas of the country.  It is those who reside within the Dublin region who are hit hardest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures clearly demonstrate that it is the citizens of Dublin city and county who pay the greatest proportion.  On 5 April 1994 75 per cent of the persons paying residential property tax were residing in Dublin city and county.  On 5 April 1995 this figure had increased to 77 per cent. Residential property tax is not working <Col N="1031" /> because it heavily penalises many thosands of households who have endeavoured to provide a home base for themselves and their families.  The attributes of endeavour and hard work have been penalised by this discriminatory tax which has left many thousands much worse off.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the parties in Government have been jockeying for positions in the lead-up to next year's budget.  Fine Gael seems to be advocating a reduction in tax rates; Democratic Left seems to favour a widening of the tax bands while the Labour Party appears to be confused on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious to everyone that this politicking is designed for one side or the other to gain advantage in the 1997 general election.</P>
      <P>Earlier today the end of September Exchequer returns were announced. The following question is pertinent. Why did the Government grant few tax concessions in the 1996 budget?  The net benefit to the ordinary taxpayer amounted to a measly £15 million.  The Government deliberately short changed the taxpayer this year in order to improve its electoral position for the 1997 budget.</P>
      <P>Taxation, once it is on a fair and level playing field, undoubtedly plays a significant role in the functioning of any modern democratic society.  Only taxation which is fair can ever be acceptable to those who have to pay it.  A nation's health, education and welfare support systems and many associated and sundry services require funding. The majority of these services are underpinned by the taxation system.  We must pay a certain level of tax to pay for services which keep a modern society functioning.  A country must have a fair and unbiased system of taxation but residential property tax flies in the face of this basic notion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is fair about somebody living and supporting a family in Dublin who has endeavoured over many years to <Col N="1032" /> own their own family home ending up paying upwards of £1,000 in residential property tax when a family in Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Wexford or even Kildare with a similar house, similar number of children and income levels etc. does not have to pay this tax? What is fair about somebody who has had to seek work in Dublin or its outer regions, in a firm such as Intel in Leixlip, for example, suddenly have to fork out up to £1,000 in residential property tax?</P>
    <P>We can talk all night about yields, thresholds and percentages but one thing is abundantly clear; residential property tax is basically unfair.  Not only is it unfair by its very nature and structure, it has also proved to be a tax which is fundamentally oblivious to what is happening in the property market, particularly the Dublin residential property market.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of residential property tax in 1983, income levels and property value thresholds for RPT have increased by 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent over the period of the tax, whereas property prices over the same period have risen in excess of 30 per cent.  This dramatic divergence continues to grow and if current and forecast property prices hold true, it will become greater and the unfairness will continue.</P>
    <P>The house price boom, particularly in Dublin city and county areas, has gone from strength to strength and shows no sign of abating.  Many people seem to think that those who are rolling in money and live in fine houses and mansions on plenty of land are the only ones affected by residential property tax. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>I was given figures recently which show the way in which the prices of ordinary houses have changed in the past five years; these figures can be verified. For example, in 1991, a house in Heytesbury Street, Dublin was sold for £67,000; in 1996 it was sold for £148,000. In Clontarf, a house sold in 1989 for £90,000 was sold this year for £160,000. In Sutton Park, an area I believe Deputy Sean Ryan knows, a house sold <Col N="1033" /> in 1989 for £80,000 was sold in 1996 for £130,000.  Ordinary houses are now in the residential property tax net.  The figures I have given are accurate and relate to sales in the years I have mentioned and sales this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As our spokesperson on Finance has outlined, Fianna Fáil is making a clear, unambiguous commitment to abolish residential property tax within the framework of our strategy for the public finances.  This is essentially a tax on those who live in locations rated in an order that makes them liable to penal taxation and, therefore, it lacks equity.  Because of the rise in house prices, houses that were never intended to be included are being brought into the net whereas, in the past five years, property thresholds and income limits have only been raised by an average of 1 per cent per year.  Some household properties have almost doubled in value in the interim, as had been pointed out by Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>As I have continually argued both in and out of Government, RPT is a cumbersome and administratively costly tax which raises remarkably little revenue. It is a symbol of thinking that has gone out of date.</P>

The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, claims credit for it in his memoirs, working in conjunction with his daughter-in-law, now Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  The Labour Party was always naively enthusiastic about it, seeing in it a major revenue-spinner, and would be loath to see it go, judging from the remarks of Deputies on the Government benches tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The residential property tax was one of nearly a dozen new taxes or major tax increases introduced by Fine Gael and Labour from 1981-83. It is a monument to the appetite for extra taxes which were always a softer option than restraint or curtailment of spending.  Prior to the national Coalition of 1973, we were a relatively low tax economy.  If we want to sharpen our competitive edge, we must gradually work our way back to that position &mdash; the policy put forward by our spokesperson, Deputy McCreevy &mdash; by keeping a tight rein on spending increases and eliminating further borrowing that adds to the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued that residential property tax restrains high prices paid for houses.  The 6 per cent stamp duty on houses valued above £60,000 already raises substantial revenue on more expensive houses.  We should encourage wealthy people to live in our country as we did in the 1940s and 1950s.  The <Col N="1039" /> Chester Beatty, Beit and Hunt collections are among the benefits which accrued to us from people living here in decent houses and not driven out by wealth taxes.  There could, in future, again be people who will prefer to come and live here, if there is peace.  It is already happening in many locations. People want to come and live in west Cork but do not want to pay RPT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The only argument between me and Deputy McCreevy was about whether the figure was £15 million or, as shown in one of the Government documents on the 1996 budget, £12 million.  With 1.4 million people working in this buoyant economy with 8 per cent growth last year, just less than the growth rate during the last year I was Minister for Finance, the Government managed to get only £15 million net.  I do not believe my former colleagues in the Department of Finance have got the Exchequer returns wrong because nothing changed during the <Col N="1040" /> course of the year; the figures we were given here on the last Wednesday in January were suppressed by hundreds of millions of pounds to con the people, maintain the nest-egg and make the 1997 budget seem a huge give-away.</P>

      <P>Labour and Democratic Left are irreformable public spenders. In their book, tax concessions are due only once every five years to keep voters sweet.  Otherwise, they see the Government's job as being to collect and spend as much taxpayer's money as they can.  In the past two years current day to day spending has increased by four times the rate of inflation, and Exchequer capital spending by seven times the rate of inflation.  They are the facts based on the figures issued today by the Government.  Employment and living standards will not progress as they should.  Last year's and this year's performance show that there is no serious political commitment by any of the parties in Government to lowering taxation and making the economy more competitive when things turn again against us, as they definitely will.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil was the first Government in 20 years, from 1989, to start seriously lowering the burden of taxation, cutting the standard rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.  We reduced VAT from 25 per cent to 21 per cent and corporation tax from 43 per cent to 38 per cent.  We created the consistent positive growth from 1987, and the current high growth phase which began a number of years ago.  It was our prudent management of the economy over many years that made this Minister awash with money.</P>

      <P>The Government has been increasing spending in nearly all directions except health and law and order, where the hospital queues lengthen and the problem with drugs and crime is not being brought under control.  Over 1995 and 1996 Fine Gael, Labour and the Democratic Left missed their spending targets by a mile.  They have stuffed ministerial offices with outside appointees, where Fianna Fáil chose its programme managers from within the Civil Service.  A Tánaiste Office was established to enhance the status of one leader, and another leader in this Government copied him, while we had to legislate for an extra Minister of State for the Democratic Left and create an extra seat at the Cabinet table for another Minister from the Democratic Left.  Some Ministers are treating the European Presidency as a lavish constituency benefit.

      <P>The extent of social welfare fraud has increased, not surprisingly, under Deputy De Rossa as Minister. It is inexplicable that the live register should have started to rise sharply five months after he came into office when the economy was continuing to grow strongly.  The Minister's political standards were well displayed last year, when he confined the old, a group from which his party gets no votes, to a miserable 2.5 per cent welfare increase.</P>
      <P>All of this is part of the context in which we look at RPT.  Its abolition at a small cost to the Exchequer would provide a clear signal that we intend to tackle the high levels of taxation which are still crippling this country's economy. Its yield does not go to local government, so that is not really relevant. I warned the Government, and the parties of the left in particular, not to think up new ways to fleece the public after the election, something at which they are looking already.  In particular, further tolls on the Dublin ring road are not acceptable to this party and we are holding the Minister for the Environment personally accountable for any toll imposed by the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the speedy action taken by the Government in the 1995 budget to reverse, as <Col N="1045" /> promised in its programme of renewal, the changes in the income and house value thresholds for residential property tax introduced in the 1994 Finance Act and the commitment also given in the Government's programme to review the future of the tax in the context of the professional study on local government financing, and welcomes the continued steady progress made by the Government in improving the tax system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to respond on behalf of the Government in this debate.  It is necessary to set out some of the facts on residential property tax and how this Government has alleviated this tax, and on the substantial tax reforms and other tax reductions introduced in the last two budgets.  It is important to set this debate in the context of overall tax policy since this is what matters in the end and determines the tax burden on the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Residential property tax was introduced in 1983.  The tax is charged at the rate of 1.5 per cent on the excess of the market values of all residential properties owned by a person over an exemption limit.  The house value exemption limit was £65,000 in 1983.  In addition, the tax is only payable where the household income exceeds a gross amount, which in 1983 was set at £20,000.  Both these thresholds were indexed for years after 1983 and the respective figures for 1996 are £101,000 and £30,100.  The tax is payable on or before 1 October of each year on the basis of property values and incomes as at the previous 5 April.  The tax may also be paid on an instalment basis.</P>
    <P>While the issue of taxation of property has always been a controversial one in Ireland, the present controversy can be said to stem from the decision announced in the 1994 budget to reduce the house value and household income threshold to £75,000 and £25,000 compared with £91,000 and £28,100, and to <Col N="1046" /> replace the flat 1.5 per cent rate with a new rates structure of 1 per cent, 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent.  This decision, which was introduced by the then Minister for Finance and current leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, more than doubled the number of taxpayers in the RPT net to 38,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The great proponents of tax reform, the Progressive Democrats Party, during their period in Government with Fianna Fáil also showed a distinct lack of interest in, or concern for, those taxpayers caught in the property tax net.</P>
      <P>Their new found concern has been cultivated only since it hit the Opposition benches, particularly in recent times with a general election year approaching.  The programme, A Government of Renewal, contained the following commitment to reverse the 1994 changes in residential property tax:</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the changes to the income and house value thresholds in the Residential Property Tax in the 1994 Finance Act will be reversed in the 1995 budget.  The future of this tax will be considered in the context of the professional study on local government financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his first budget in February 1995, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, delivered on that commitment when he announced that the new thresholds for 1995 would reflect the 1993 thresholds indexed to 1995 values and the rate of tax would revert to 1.5 per cent.  Accordingly, the 1995 Finance Act <Col N="1049" /> reverted to a flat 1.5 per cent rate, increased the property value exemption threshold to £94,000 from £75,000, to which Fianna Fáil had reduced it, and increased the household income threshold from £25,000, to which Fianna Fáil had reduced it, to £29,500.  It further provided that those threshold values will continue to be index linked in future.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of that commitment, the Minister for the Environment has already published that professional study last June and is seeking to advance the debate in this area in a coherent manner.  In other words, within 18 months of this Government taking office a study has been commissioned, completed and published.  For seven years Fianna Fáil did nothing but double the rate of tax and the number of taxpayers taken into the net.</P>
    <P>The threshold changes in the 1995 Finance Act halved the number of taxpayers paying residential property tax compared with the previous year.  In 1995 the Minister retained all of the special adjustments introduced in 1994 to meet certain anomalies in the system which had been identified as causing hardship to certain specific categories of taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Those adjustments helped eliminate possible hardship for elderly or incapacitated owner-occupiers of houses coming within the scope of the residential property tax.  They cater for where a houseowner needs to bring in a carer on account of his or her incapacity or, if widowed, to care for dependent children. They also ensure that no household will be brought into the residential property tax net simply on account of caring for an elderly or incapacitated person.  They further provide that no residential property tax charge will arise from alterations made to a property because one of the people living in the house is permanently incapacitated. Another provision was to give the Revenue Commissioners discretion to deal with possible hardship cases which are <Col N="1050" /> not covered by the various specific reliefs.</P>
    <P>These adjustments are in addition to two significant reliefs &mdash; the child relief and the marginal relief &mdash; which were introduced in 1983.  Child relief substantially reduces the actual charge for all families with dependent children.  All residential property tax bills are reduced by 10 per cent for each eligible child in a household.  Where there are four children the charge will be only three-fifths, or 60 per cent, of the full figure.</P>
    <P>There is also an income related marginal relief which serves to greatly reduce the residential property tax charge for people whose income is relatively close to the income threshold. Marginal relief now applies where household income is up to £10,000 above the income threshold.  This means that in 1996 marginal relief is available up to £10,000 above the income threshold. This means that in 1996 marginal relief is available up to £40,100.  For example, in a case where household income is £35,100 only half of the full residential property tax liability is payable. If the householder is aged over 65, he or she is eligible for marginal relief if the household income is up to £15,000 above the income threshold, that is up to £45,100 in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, the present value exemption threshold is £101,000.  If on 5 April 1996 the property was worth less than that amount there is no tax liability regardless of the size of household income.  If two or more people own the same property then the value of the property and the valuation exemption threshold is divided between them.  Equally, regardless of the value of the property, there is no liability if household income is less than £30,100 in the 1995-96 tax year.  The income of anyone who is not an owner and who is aged 65 or over, or who is permanently incapacitated is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> Exemptions also apply in a number of other categories.  If any of the owners is over 65 household income is limited to that of the owner.  The income of anyone else living in the property is excluded.</P>

      <P>If any of the owners is permanently incapacitated, the income of anyone &mdash; who is not an owner &mdash; living in the property due to the medical condition of the owner is excluded.  If the owner is a widowed person, the income of anyone &mdash; other than the owner &mdash; living in the property due to the owner having dependent children is excluded.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the market value for tax purposes may be reduced by the amount of value attributable to alterations or improvements provided that the changes were necessary to accommodate or facilitate an incapacitated resident and the incapacitated person usually lived in the property during the relevant tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the value exemption threshold which stands at £101,000, the value threshold is indexed to the new house price index, a figure compiled and published by the Department of the Environment. While this index may not fully capture the full range of price movements in the house property market, it is probably fair to say that one index will not achieve this.  Nonetheless, it has <Col N="1052" /> been this Government's policy to uprate the thresholds to maintain the real value of the thresholds as far as possible and not to down-rate or decrease them as Fianna Fáil did in 1994.</P>
    <P>Given the thresholds and the range of reliefs available it is all the more strange that residential property tax appears to have generated a mythology all its own. Media coverage and Opposition comment sometimes combine to give the impression that residential property tax is placing an onerous obligation on the general body of taxpayers.  Nothing could be further from reality.  The number of taxpayers paying residential property tax in the last year was just under 20,000 &mdash; down from 38,000 which Fianna Fáil brought into the net &mdash; or about 2 per cent of taxpayers.  It is important to keep residential property tax in some perspective.  This year the tax will be paid by some 23,000 households. This represents just over 2 per cent of the total stock of approximately 900,000 owner-occupied houses in the country.  More than half of those 23,000 will be able to reduce their tax bills by claiming either marginal relief &mdash; where household income is between £30,000 and £40,000 &mdash; or child relief &mdash; a 10 per cent reduction for each dependent child. By way of example, the residential property tax payable for 1996 on a £120,000 house &mdash; where the income is £35,000 and there are two dependent children&mdash; will be £111.72.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have indicated that the average residential property tax bill is in the region of £500.  Given the distribution of residential property tax payers, this statistic is erroneous.  In 1995 &mdash; figures are not yet available for 1996 &mdash; 30 per cent of RPT taxpayers paid less than £100 and 71 per cent paid less than £500.</P>
    <P>There has been much overstatement on the incidence of residential property tax in the media and especially the property pages.  We can all understand what the motivation in the property pages might be.  One article suggested people living in what was termed very modest homes could pay as much as £1,500 to <Col N="1053" /> discharge their residential property tax liability.  To have such a liability the house would have to be valued at in excess of £201,000.  While undoubtedly the occupants of such a house may not be numbered among the rich, this is not such a modest house when it is considered that the average house price in Dublin at the end of March 1996 was, according to the Department of the Environment housing bulletin, £71,618 for new houses and £73,615 for second-hand houses.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes claimed that rapid increases in house prices in parts of Dublin are pushing many householders into the residential property tax net. Revenue statistics confirm that a higher proportion of residential property taxpayers reside in the greater Dublin and other urban areas.</P>
    <P>Householders in Dublin pay approximately three-quarters of all residential property tax.  While this is unfair it is not surprising, as it reflects the reality that most of the country's valuable residential property is concentrated in the capital city.  In addition Dublin incomes tend to be higher than the national average which means that less households can claim income exemption or marginal relief.</P>
    <P>In any national property tax based purely on values it is inevitable that householders in high value areas will pay a disproportionately higher share of the overall tax.  This is not unique to Ireland: Londoners or Parisians also pay a disproportionate share of UK or French property taxes.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to avoid a geographical imbalance for any value based property tax.</P>
      <P>Discussions on RPT need to be set in the context of the significant reforms of the tax system undertaken in the past two years by the Government which have seen major improvements in the tax burden borne by the general body of taxpayers.  Ireland has for some years been undertaking a programme of tax reform with the aim of increasing competitiveness and growth, thereby contributing to the creation and maintenance of employment.  Deputy McCreevy should take note of this point.  The primary focus has been on reducing the level of income tax while implementing base-broadening measures, particularly in the area of corporate taxation.  I doubt Deputy McCreevy would disagree with that.  This strategy of concentrating on income tax reduction has also been guided by the desirability of achieving moderate wage developments through a consensus approach with the social partners.</P>
      <P>In its Programme for Renewal the Government commits itself to continuing the process of tax reform.  The programme stresses that reform should favour the incentive to work; tackle the poverty trap; aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development and growth.  I doubt if there could be any argument on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years significant progress has been made in improving the income tax system.  The standard rate was cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent while <Col N="1055" /> the top rate was cut from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of 1994 when the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was agreed the effort to reduce the tax burden has continued. In 1994 the 1 per cent income levy was removed, the low income threshold for the health and employment and training levies was introduced, the marginal relief rate of tax was reduced from 48 per cent to 40 per cent and personal allowances and tax bands were widened.</P>

      <P>The 1995 and 1996 budgets have confirmed the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, the process of tax and PRSI changes as an important element in overall strategy.  Over the two budgets combined, personal allowances have been increased by close to 13 per cent while the standard income tax band has been widened by £1,200 in the case of a single person and by £2,400 for a married couple.  This is an increase of close to 15 per cent, which more than compensates for the reduction in mortgage interest and VHI reliefs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>A new PRSI-free allowance was introduced in 1995 and increased to £80 per week this year for most employees.  This measure, a unique new feature in the social insurance system, means that in the case of most workers the first £80 of their weekly wage is disregarded when calculating their PRSI contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This allowance is of particular benefit to those on lower pay as it gives valuable relief to those who are already exempted from income tax and who would not benefit from further increases in either the exemption limits or personal allowances.  Furthermore, the threshold for payment of the health and employment and training levies has been increased to keep pace with inflation.  The combined effect of these measures has been to increase take home pay, particularly in the case of lower paid workers, thereby making <Col N="1057" /> employment more attractive.  Equally important, these measures will ensure that we continue the progress being made in reducing the employees' average tax burden and the overall tax wedge.  I will illustrate this point with a number of examples.</P>
    <P>In 1994-95 the average tax take, including income tax, PRSI and levies, for a married couple with one earner and two children earning the average production wage was approximately 23.2 per cent.  This figure is expected to fall to 21.6 per cent in 1996-97.  For a single person on the same wage level the average tax take in 1994-95 was approximately 30.9 per cent, and this figure is expected to fall to approximately 28.7 per cent in 1996-97.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister get the correct script?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994-95 the tax wedge, that is the tax take including employers' PRSI, for a married couple with one earner and two children, earning the average production wage was approximately 31.6 per cent.  The tax wedge, after allowing for tax increases, is expected to fall to approximately 30 per cent in the tax year 1996-97.  For a single person on the same level of income, the tax wedge is expected to fall from 38.4 per cent in 1994-95 to under 36.4 per cent in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>These figures give a clear indication of the continued and steady progress being made in the income tax and PRSI areas and refute statements made by those who do not understand or seek to minimise or understate the Government's achievements.  Naturally one of the Government's aims is to achieve greater progress and it is our goal to build on the substantial improvements which have been made in the past two years.  If tax changes are to be pursued it is best to do so on a sustained basis. A succession of consistent and affordable tax reductions from year to year can, over a relatively short period, make a substantial difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> A further aim of the Government is to encourage the development of enterprise to generate and maintain employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>To this end the lower rate of employers' PRSI was reduced from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent and the income threshold for the higher rate was increased from £173 per week to £250 per week, an increase from £9,000 to £13,000 per annum.  This represents an increase of approximately 45 per cent. In addition, the main rate of employer contribution was reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget the Government introduced a new reduced rate of corporation tax which will apply to all businesses liable at the standard rate.  The new rate of 30 per cent applies from 1 April this year to the first £50,000 of taxable income in the accounting year. While all companies will ultimately benefit from gradual reductions in the standard rate, this year's measure provides proportionately greater benefit to the small business sector in recognition of the fact that it has shown the capacity to create substantial additional employment.</P>
      <P>Some people will ask the relevance of this to RPT.  It is extremely relevant.  It is important that the overall burden is reduced with the clear strategic goals of rewarding work, promoting employment and seeking greater tax equity.</P>

      <P>The performance of the economy in recent years has been impressive both in absolute terms and <Col N="1059" /> compared with the EU average.  Economic growth averaged 4.25 per cent over the five years 1991-95 compared with an average EU growth rate of 1.5 per cent.  During the same period employment here grew by more than 1.5 per cent while it declined in the EU. Our economic performance over the past two years has been striking, with average annual GNP growth of 7.4 per cent, three times the EU rate.  At the same time inflation and Government borrowing have been better than the EU average.  This year we expect to see GNP growth of at least 6 per cent compared with an average growth rate of approximately 1.5 per cent in the EU. Yet despite this strong growth, inflation remains moderate at 1.5 per cent.  The strong growth in employment and consumer spending this year is reflected in buoyant tax receipts which have resulted in an Exchequer surplus of £185 million for the first three quarters of this year, as announced this afternoon by the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at the key factors which have contributed to our strong performance.  They are, first, the prudent fiscal and economic policies adopted by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;successive Governments since the mid-1980s &mdash; I can be fair and realistic; second, the consensus among the social partners on the broad parameters of policy &mdash; low budget deficits, moderate pay-nominal pay increases to maintain competitiveness, boosted where possible by tax and PRSI reductions to ensure real increases in take home pay and, third, low interest rates which are in part the reward for these prudent policies.  It is these low interest rates and rising house prices which have helped the property market and brought the focus onto RPT.  Mortgage interest rates are some 4 per cent lower today than they were when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats parties were in Government.  This is a saving of approximately £2,000 per <Col N="1060" /> annum on a £50,000 mortgage.  These are real savings to households.</P>

      <P>The picture for continued economic growth is also promising.

This is a consistency of budgetary performance which few if any member states can equal.  Ireland and Luxembourg are the only member states judged not to have an excessive Government deficit under the Maastricht guidelines.

      <P>To progress the funding matter, approaches have been made by the Minister for the Environment to the two main Opposition parties in the <Col N="1061" /> belief that the subject would be best addressed on an all-party basis.  The Minister will follow up these approaches shortly.  Pending discussion between the parties it would be premature to speculate on the format of any joint approach to the issue should this prove acceptable to the parties.  If agreement on a consensus approach cannot be reached the issue will be addressed in the context of the strategy statement.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment proposes to launch a strategy for the renewal of local government by the end of the year that will address the key issues of local government both at strategic level and by way of a planned action programme with clear objectives. The issue of funding will be included in this strategy statement.</P>
      <P>The timing of this motion is most interesting.  Fianna Fáil was in Government for seven years and did nothing to alleviate a &ldquo;daft concept&rdquo;, to quote Deputy McCreevy.

      <P>In 1995, the tax take was £9.5 million of which £7.3 million was collected in the Dublin area.  We must accept that the tax discriminates against people living in the capital and that the point made by Deputy Yates was valid.</P>

      <P>House prices have increased by 15 per cent in Dublin and this has brought a number of people into the residential property tax net who would not otherwise be included. Unfortunately, people have no control over the increase in house prices.  The Government should encourage people to have houses that are adequate in size and comfort to rear their families.  The State gets sufficient tax take from the house through tax on construction materials and building and from the 6 per cent stamp duty on second-hand houses.  The case for the abolition of the tax has been well made tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have quoted Deputy Rabbitte's <Col N="1065" /> views on the tax.  The Labour Party's view is more interesting.  Eight members of that party were quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 September as being against the tax.  They included Deputy Eamon Walsh who, two years ago, spoke in favour of the tax in this House.  All these views help me to understand why the Minister of State did not deal with residential property tax in her contribution and instead gave us a resumé of taxation during recent years.</P>
    <P>I will not omit the opinions of the Minister of State's other constituency colleague.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, last week abandoned his plans to publish the White Paper on local government reform.  Was that linked to this motion? I was interested to hear the Minister of State's comments on the timing of the motion.  Even if this motion were passed, it would have no relevance for people who had or had not paid their residential property tax.  If the system were changed tonight the Government could make arrangements to ensure equity for all taxpayers, including those who had paid by 1 October and those who had not.</P>
    <P>A significant aspect of this debate is that this is the first time since I became a Member of this House that Private Members' Business has been given such importance.  I am glad to see that.  It could be implied from the final paragraph of the Minister of State's speech that if the Fianna Fáil motion was passed tomorrow night, this measure would take effect immediately.  I would like to believe that would happen.  Many Members support the motion.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister.  It is ironic that I am here with my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, the Minister of State is here with her colleagues in Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats were here earlier, but those in the left who support RPT are not here.  The parties who do not support RPT have more than 120 seats in the House.  Those from the left are probably up in their offices laughing while listening to the debate.  This is a joke.  They foisted this tax on Members in various coalitions and are holding firmly to their view.  The tail is wagging the dog.  They did it while we were in Government and they are now doing it in this Government.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister of State agrees with what she said tonight.  We had to march in here on a previous occasion and vote for this tax even though we did not support it.  It is grossly unfair and should be abolished. I verified with two auctioneering firms today that a house that was bought in my constituency five or six years ago for £100,000 is now worth approximately £250,000.  If the owners of such a house have an annual income of £40,000 and do not have children, they must pay RPT at the rate of £2,200 per annum after paying all their other taxes.  That does not make sense.</P>

      <P>The RPT is a vindictive, unsavoury and discriminatory tax which epitomises left wing politicians and their ideologies.  There is no better means of encapsulating in one tax the ideologically driven parties of the left than in the RPT.  It discriminates against hard working people who are probably the greatest supporters of the State in terms of the tax they already pay.  It adds insult to injury to impose RPT on them.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to note the Minister of State's lengthy dissertation on tax, while her comments on tax reform consisted of some ten sentences of nonsense. That indicates the inability of this Government to deal seriously with tax reform.  The fiscal policies put forward by Fine Gael in Opposition were abandoned when it went into Government. It also abandoned the Department of Finance to the Labour Party which dictated policy every time those parties were in coalition.  In the period from 1983 to 1987 it virtually bankrupted the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because I am extremely concerned at the proposal to abolish duty free facilities from 1 January 1999.  This measure, if adopted, will have serious repercussions for regional airports in particular. Some 4,000 people are employed nationally in duty free facilities and many more in airlines throughout the world.  We have many products which are internationally known, particularly small craft type products, which would not survive if it were not for duty free. I call on the Government, during its EU Presidency particularly, to insist that duty free be retained.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has pioneered this mode of marketing and merchandising goods. There is no good reason it should not be allowed to continue.  Some 40 per cent of Aer Rianta's earnings come from duty free activities.  I would like to be parochial by saying that 35 people are employed in the duty free facility &mdash; to which I often had access &mdash; in Cork Airport.  There are an additional 100 jobs in ancillary activities around the airport.  There are many industries in Cork, as far as the Bere peninsula, whose products are for sale in the duty free shop in Cork Airport.  Were it not for the duty free facility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; they would be put out of business.  Not only does it sell Gubeen cheese, which I have eaten, but it has Milleen's which is at Ardgroom and Ahakista and Round Tower cheese. Having done a tour of the constituency I will return to the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The airport made £2.2 million last year which was made exclusively from the duty free shop.  All the other activities at the airport just about broke even; the shop kept it going.  Excellent improvements have been carried out at Cork Airport under Fianna Fáil <Col N="1074" /> Governments over the past seven years, to which the Minister of State referred a short time ago.  There is a new runway, landing facility and lounge.  The entire airport has been upgraded and it would be a pity if this development was not allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>If this facility is allowed to be closed down, it will have serious repercussions for all regional airports.  As the Minister knows, there are good facilities in Galway, Letterkenny and in many parts of the west.  Kerry Airport is the only one which is getting any substantial aid.  It is a disgrace that the Government allowed one regional airport to be developed and subsidised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Another factor which I ask the Government to take into account is that probably our premier product worldwide, Bailey's Irish Cream, was developed through the duty free system. No matter what airport one visits one may not get Paddy Whiskey, but one will certainly get Bailey's Irish Cream.</P>

I call on the Government to not only use the EU Presidency to savour the nice things in life, like Chablis and Chateau Lynch-vages, but to think of the economy, the country and small industries, like the craft industry, and our regional airports and to insist, as President of the Council of Ministers in Europe, that this facility will be retained.</P>

      <P>For certain ports and airports, particularly Shannon Airport, the non-EU traveller is an important source of revenue.  The other State airports also handle traffic to and from non-EU locations, including the important and welcome visitors who come here from Iceland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards EU travellers, the EU has decided as part of the package of Single Market measures adopted in 1992 to allow the continuation of duty free and tax free sales for intracommunity travellers only until 30 June 1999.  This was agreed as part of a comprehensive series of Single Market tax measures, including substantial changes to the entitlements of travellers to bring in tax paid goods more freely.  From 1 January 1993, travellers from EU countries benefited from enhanced entitlements to import items tax paid from other EU states and easier border controls.  This continuation to end June 1999, set out in Directives 91/680/EEC and 92/12/EEC, was agreed to allow the duty free operators, including Aer Rianta, time to diversify their activities.  It had been originally planned that duty and tax free sales would end in January 1993 for EU travellers and the duty free operators were well aware of this intention for many years before that.  The extension to 1999 was in response to requests for more time to adapt and that extension was reluctantly agreed to by the Commission on the basis of an entirely new system of vendor control of duty free <Col N="1076" /> sales and with the legal position being that EU duty free would end in 1999.</P>
    <P>This new system of vendor control was to be subject to review by the Commission as it was a very substantial change from the previous arrangements based on customs controls, which became unworkable in a Single Market context, with much reduced frontier formalities, including the creation of special Blue Channels for EU passengers. From indications from the Commission, it seems that it has not been entirely happy with how the vendor controls have operated.</P>
    <P>I stress that the decisions to end duty free in 1999 are firm ones that have been taken by the Council and enacted in Community law some considerable time ago, not proposals from the Commission which have still to be adopted by Council.  Public comment sometimes suggests that these are new proposals which can be obstructed by Ireland or by other member states, but that is not so.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner with responsibility for the Internal Market, Mario Monti, very recently confirmed to the duty free industry in the EU that the Commission had no intention of bringing forward any proposal for a further retention of duty free and tax free sales beyond the expiry date of 30 June 1999.  If there is no Commission proposal on the table, the Council cannot adopt any measures to extend the concession.  I draw the Deputy's attention to that important point.</P>
    <P>I know Aer Rianta has taken many steps to diversify its activities, including the operation of duty free shops outside the EU.  It operates in Russia and in the Middle and Far East and it has adopted a prudential attitude to the question of duty free sales and to the issue of extension post-1999.  Obviously it would like the concession to continue but it has not placed all its eggs in one basket and will be able to cope with the changing circumstances. Increased passenger throughput at the Irish airports will also help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> I am aware of concerns over the ending of duty free facilities for EU travellers. It is a major issue in my constituency of Wexford which includes the port of Rosslare Harbour.  The Irish and EU duty free sectors have been making clear their difficulties.  The Minister for Finance will monitor the position with interest and he has received representations from the industry which he is considering.  As I explained, however, the right of initiative in this case does not rest entirely with us or with the Council.  It is a matter initially for the Commission.  The Deputy may know one or two friendly Commissioners with whom he could have a word.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leat as ucht ghlacadh leis an rún seo uaim ar an athló.</P>
      <P>There has been much understandable public disquiet about the VHI in recent months.  The company has lost its second chief executive in a very short period.  To lose one chief executive is serious, but to lose two in less than two years reflects the fact that the company is off course and requires to be stabilised.</P>
      <P>There also has been serious concern about the VHI's fees policy.  Recently the company again put up its premiums by 6 per cent.  This came on top of a raft of increases in previous months.  Over the past ten years, VHI premiums have gone up by 54 per cent.  In the past four years, when inflation was running at less than 2 per cent per year, the compound VHI premium increase over the period was 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As if customers of the VHI were not paying enough, a row with the private hospitals has resulted in subscribers facing top-up bills at the hospitals.  This unseemly row with the private hospitals has been played out in the media and <Col N="1078" /> has damaged confidence in the VHI's ability to run its affairs, especially as stiff competition in the health insurance market looms, for the first time.</P>
    <P>To cap all this concern, it has now been reported that an official reprimand has been issued by the VHI to the subscribers' council.  The reprimand arose when the subscribers' council urged the VHI to reach an agreement with private hospitals and stop the practice of extra billing for patients.  This recommendation by the council was very sensible. However, because the board of the VHI was not consulted first and its consent sought, the council has been reprimanded. Inevitably, the people on the council are up in arms.</P>
    <P>At the time the VHI (Amendment) Bill was going through the Dáil last February, I raised this very concern about the subscribers' council.  I said that unless a statutory council was set up to deal with subscribers' complaints and concerns, the VHI would try to manipulate the council.</P>
    <P>I put forward an amendment to that effect on Report Stage, providing for the establishment of a statutory council along the lines of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  I argued that the VHI should not be allowed to act as judge and jury when it came to consumer complaints and concerns.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister for Health made a major mistake in not accepting that amendment.  Because the VHI had taken cynical preventative action by establishing its own council that is now the subject of controversy, the Minister decided to opt for the <i>status quo</i>.  He said at the time of the debate that, if the VHI's council did not work, at the end of 1996 he would review the situation and consider the establishment of a statutory council.</P>
    <P>At column 356 of the Official Report of 7 February 1996 he said, &ldquo;I am not accepting the amendment although I share many of the concerns expressed by the Deputy.&rdquo; At column 359 he said:</P>
    <P>I accept its good intention and I hope the system works as intended.  I <Col N="1079" /> share the Deputy's desire that the VHI should have independent redress.  If the provisions I outlined this morning do not do that, I reserve the right to establish and legislate for a body independent of the VHI ... there is a lot of merit in her arguments. The measures in place are probably sufficient to meet the Deputy's requests.  However, if there is a need for an independent body, depending on how this works out in 1996, I will provide it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take this course. It is clear that the VHI council has limitations and that those who are appointed to it find themselves in an invidious position.  A statutory users council is the only way to proceed.</P>
    <P>This will be an important step in restoring consumer confidence in the VHI.  As the State company faces into competition, it needs to be put on an even keel.  Otherwise the company could lose droves of its subscribers to the looming competition.  The VHI subscriber has to be brought centre stage in the company and has to be listened to.</P>

      <P>I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, who is unable to be present this evening.  I apologise for his absence.</P>
      <P>The VHI Members' Advisory Council was set up by the VHI in December 1995 and held its first meeting on 19 January 1996.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the council are: to review all communications with VHI members, including product terms, and to suggest ways in which these can be improved; to propose codes of practice in relation to all aspects of VHI business including the standards of service required from hospitals and doctors; and to review such other aspects of VHI operations as are considered appropriate from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council is chaired by Mr. Finbarr Flood, deputy chairman of the Labour <Col N="1080" /> Court, and other members of the council represent a wide spectrum of commercial, vocational and public sector interests.</P>
    <P>There have been certain reports in the media regarding relations between the advisory council and the VHI board. I understand that the question at issue relates to media coverage of certain aspects of the board's operations which arose some months ago and which the VHI board felt that the council should have discussed with it in advance of going public on the matter.  However, the board has also made it clear that the council is absolutely entitled to state its concerns on any aspect of VHI operations. I also understand that the board has indicated to the council its availability to discuss matters of mutual interest, and that an early meeting has been requested by the chairman of the council.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health recently indicated to the House that it is primarily a matter for the board to identify and implement whatever steps are required to deal with issues such as subscriber confidence and he is confident that such matters are being addressed by the recently enlarged board as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I note that the council has been given a wide remit with regard to its terms of refererence and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Because the advisory council has been in operation for less than one year, it is too early to say whether the establishment of this body has been a success. It is up to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to form an opinion on that matter in the first instance.  The terms of reference of the insurance ombudsman provides additional consumer protection in regard to complaints, disputes and claims made in connection with or arising out of the VHI's policies.  However, as indicated previously in the House to the Deputy, the Minister for Health will keep the issue under review.</P>
    <P>In particular, he reserves the right to establish and legislate for a body that is <Col N="1081" /> independent of the VHI, if the circumstances so require.  It is important that VHI members feel they have a forum through which their concerns can be expressed and that the board is responsive to those concerns.  As I have indicated, the Minister is keeping an open mind on the matter and if there is a need for an independent body it will be provided.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter this evening. Will the Minister of State explain to the House why two schools in Cork city, one in Knocknaheeney and the other in Churchfield, were not included in the list of schools chosen for the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; scheme?  That decision flies in the face of natural justice.  I appeal to him to intervene and to take the necessary steps to have the scheme extended to the two schools in question.</P>
      <P>This is a good scheme, the purpose of which is to give an extra leg up to children who are struggling to surmount the adverse social and economic effects of long-term unemployment in their community; in other words, to give them a fair start in life, Knocknaheeney and Churchfield have unemployment levels in the region of 80 per cent &mdash; stubborn, long-term, second generation unemployment. By any objective standards, these two schools ought to have been top of the list of eligibility for this scheme.  Their exclusion beggars belief. I know the Minister of State knows the exact details of the situation.  I ask him to ensure the necessary steps are taken immediately to remedy this gross injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for sharing her time with me on this matter which I also raise.  In common with the majority of people, I warmly welcome any initiative which attempts to address the major inequality in the take up of education services throughout the country.  While the ultimate price paid for any under use of the education system becomes evident when one examines second level completion rates and third level participation rates, there is little doubt that the problem starts at the first level.  Therefore, I am particularly optimistic about the possible impact of the Minister's initiative, entitled &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo;, which on a trial basis involves significantly reducing the pupil teacher ratio in selected schools throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As is the case with any expenditure of State resources, it is important that fair, open and equitable criteria are applied in the identification of schools which are most deserving of inclusion in the test programme.  Unfortunately, in the case of &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo;, the available evidence strongly suggests these vital principles have not been honoured.</P>
      <P>In particular, two schools on the north side of Cork city &mdash; Scoil Padre Pio in Churchfield and St. Mary's on the Hill in Knocknaheeney &mdash; have been excluded to the total dismay and astonishment of anyone with even the remotest idea of educational needs in Cork city.  These two outstanding schools play a vital role in the north side communities which have suffered so much from unemployment and its side effects.  It is simply not believable that these schools do not come near the top of the list of appropriate schools for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any fair assessment of the matter leads to only one conclusion, namely, that some clerical error must have taken place in the selection process.  If that is the case, I urge the Minister to proceed immediately to rectify the matter.  A response along those lines from the Minister could only enhance the scheme and the Minister's standing among the extremely committed educationalists in <Col N="1083" /> these two schools.  If, on the other hand, the Minister decides to retain the <i>status quo</i> and continues to put the request to one side, we will have no alternative but to request detailed and explicit information on the precise criteria used to select schools for the scheme and the specific operating procedures followed.</P>
    <P>The matter is of such importance that I have to state clearly and without reservation that we have no option but to pursue it to a fair and just conclusion.  I urge the Minister not to place a cloud over the scheme by continuing to exclude those two highly deserving schools.  All that the boards of management, principals, teachers, students and parents of the schools are seeking is fair play &mdash; they will settle for nothing less and neither can we.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the two schools in question were not included among those selected for the urban phase of the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative.  It is, of course, the case that four schools from the north side of Cork city &mdash; the schools in question are Scoil Colmcille CBS, Blarney Street; St. Marks BNS, The Glen; St. Brendans GNS, the Glen; and Scoil Aiseirí Chríost Senior, Farranree &mdash; have been selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of being among the top 25 schools selected by the Education Research Centre.  Indeed, a further school from the north side of Cork city, Scoil Iosagáin, Farranree, has also been included by virtue of its close association with Cork schools which scored among the top 25.  A total of 16 extra teaching posts are being allocated to these schools under the scheme as well as special extra funding.  Over 20 per cent of the total national allocation went to schools on the north side of Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently met representatives of the schools to which the Deputies refer and she is in no doubt as to the great disappointment and concern felt by the authorities of these <Col N="1084" /> schools and the parents of the pupils at their failure to secure admission to the scheme.  However, in considering this outcome, it is most important to understand the background to the initiative and the basis upon which the selection process was conducted.  In order to address the concern raised by Deputy Wallace the Minister will outline the procedures for making these decisions.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the Combat Poverty Agency was commissioned by the Minister for Education to conduct a detailed review of our current approach to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage. The decision to commission this study arose from a concern to ensure that our supports were properly targeted and that children with real need were in a position to benefit from the scheme.  The criteria used in selecting schools for special support and the nature of the supports provided were among the issues addressed in the study.</P>
    <P>The report presented by the Combat Poverty Agency was one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.  It examined the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacted on pupils in the education system.  It reviewed the procedures in place to identify and address educational disadvantage. The report also evaluated the effectiveness of current approaches, using a wide range of national and international research data.  While the report recognised the very considerable advances which have been made in alleviating the effects of educational disadvantage, it also made a series of comments and recommendations aimed at improving former arrangements.</P>
    <P>Among the key issues raised in the report was a concern that under the current criteria, the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage. It was recommended that the selection criteria be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as mainfested in rural as well as urban settings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> It also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The report also considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.  The Deputy may be aware that both of the schools in question are already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and, as such, are in receipt of additional ex-quota teaching posts and special supplementary funding allocations.</P>
    <P>Following the Combat Poverty study, the Minister for Education commissioned the Education Research Centre to carry out a further study aimed at developing precise criteria to be applied in the selection of schools for special disadvantaged supports.</P>
    <P>The outcome of these studies formed the basis for the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative recently launched by the Minister for Education.  Under this initiative, a new targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in large urban areas, five in the north side of Cork city.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools, particularly those in rural areas which have high levels of disadvantage, are being selected to receive a targeted programme of supports.</P>
    <P>In the case of the urban element of the initiative, the Education Research Centre invited a total of 221 eligible schools to apply for inclusion in the scheme.  A total of 191 of these schools submitted applications.</P>
    <P>In each case, applicants were required to complete a detailed questionnaire devised by the Education Research Centre, aimed at identifying the relative levels of disadvantage between applicant schools.  In particular, every school was requested to provide data relating to the pupils in its in-take class under the following headings: 1. number of pupils from a family in which the main <Col N="1086" /> breadwinner has been unemployed for a year or more; 2. number of pupils whose family holds a medical card; 3. number of pupils living in a rented local authority house or flat; 4. number of pupils living in a lone-parent household; 5, number of pupils whose mother did not take at least the Group or Intermediate Certificate Examination, and 6, number of pupils whose father did not take at least the Group or Intermediate Certificate examination.</P>
    <P>The above criteria had been devised by the Education Research Centre following consultation with the Combat Poverty Agency and after detailed consideration of a wide range of possible indicators.</P>
    <P>All applicants submitted data under the above headings and under a standard application form devised by the Education Research Centre.  The centre reviewed the data and established a list of schools in descending order of need as reflected by the data submitted.</P>
    <P>The top 25 schools were selected by the Education Research Centre for inclusion in the scheme.  A further eight &ldquo;associated&rdquo; schools were also included for a special package of supports because their enrolments involved a high proportion of children from the same families as those attending one of the 25 most disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>Regrettably neither of the schools mentioned by the Deputy was selected by the Education Research Centre as among the top 25 scoring schools.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that individual schools will be disappointed at their failure to secure inclusion in this very important initiative.  However, the Minister is satisfied that the approach adopted by her in allowing decisions on this matter to be taken by the Education Research Centre was the correct one. While there were allegations of political interference, I should say there was none, a totally independent procedure was adopted by the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment and am glad to note the Minister is in attendance to respond.</P>
      <P>I sought this debate because of my serious worries and those of my constituents about this continuing dispute, there having been a strike at Wellmann International Limited, the largest employer in the region, with some 490 employees at this factory since 14 July last.  Since this plant was established in 1973 very valuable, worthwhile employment has been provided in Mullagh.  I know many of the staff at the plant and the dedicated service given by many of them, some practically since its inception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is and has been serious concern in County Cavan about this continuing industrial dispute.  It is obvious, particularly within the competitive international environment in which companies must trade nowadays, that they must retain their markets and any loss of production time, and the repercussions from that, must be viewed very seriously.  Stark warnings have been issued by senior management of Wellmann International Limited about reviewing their investment policy in <Col N="1088" /> Ireland.  Over the years this company has had a policy of continual investment, involving substantial expenditure, in upgrading its plant.</P>
    <P>County Cavan and adjoining areas cannot afford to lose such a factory particularly since 490 people are directly employed there in addition to large numbers of others in downstream enterprises.  The closure of the Wellmann factory would have catastrophic consequences for County Cavan, a scenario we cannot countenance. The personal, economic and social consequences of such a closure for a number of local communities are too terrible even to contemplate.</P>
    <P>Since requesting this debate, I was glad to learn that the directors of Wellmann International Limited have announced that production will recommence next week and that they have invited all employees to return to work not later than Wednesday next, 9 October.  A general meeting of all SIPTU members has been called in Mullagh for Friday next, 4 October.  It is my hope that it will be possible to reach the necessary agreements within a matter of days.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister, who I know has taken an active part in negotiations in recent weeks, to ensure that all the expertise available to his Department, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission is made available to ensure that the outstanding issues at dispute are resolved urgently.  While the Minister may state that he cannot become directly involved in industrial disputes, he can bring the influence of his office to bear and I urge him to do so.  I appeal to him this evening to use every single resource available to him and to the State agencies to assist in reaching the necessary agreement to safeguard and maintain these 490 jobs.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for sharing his time with me.  I warmly welcome the statement on the part of the company inviting its workers to return to work not later than Wednesday, 9 <Col N="1089" /> October.  The nature of the change being proposed by the company is far-reaching but necessary in order to maintain competitiveness with low-cost countries producing commodity fibres.  The Wellmann statement demonstrates a positive interest on the part of the company to reopen real dialogue and demonstrates that in discussions with SIPTU the company values the work done to date and the need to build on that valuable progress.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Smith said, a general meeting of SIPTU workers has been called for Friday next.  The potential exists for the company and SIPTU to resolve their differences through dialogue and get the company back into full production.  It is also my belief that the President of SIPTU, Mr. Edmond Browne, has played a crucial role.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement this morning but why did it take him ten weeks to deal with the issue?  It is important for the Minister to show where he stands &mdash; I am not asking where the Government stands because with three Ministers in the Department we will never know that.  The consequences are catastrophic for the workforce and I am convinced these jobs can be saved.  The Minister should have got involved at a much earlier stage.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minister's very valuable contribution in this instance, there is confusion in the Department as to his role in protecting jobs and which Minister has responsibility in this regard.  I instance Packard, Semperit, Wellmann and the plant in Tipperary where there were signals well in advance that there were problems regarding job losses.</P>

      <P>Ministerial intervention came at the eleventh hour in many cases, sometimes by different Ministers, and that is not good enough.  Usually after announcements of closures there are announcements about new jobs in <Col N="1090" /> other areas.  High tech jobs, as in the case of Wellman, and jobs in information technology areas are very valuable and labour intensive and I ask the Minister to please refrain from the PR exercise of announcing new jobs in other parts of the country.  While I acknowledge the importance of providing new jobs, the Minister should not take his eye off the real need to protect existing jobs.  That issue is central to this debate.  Deputy Smith and I, in raising this matter, ask the Minister to adopt a hands-on approach with regard to Wellman and Semperit and ensure that the jobs, which are valuable not only for the workers but for their families and communities, are saved.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for raising this issue.  I particularly acknowledge the interest of Deputy Brendan Smith who was anxious to attend a meeting I had with council and public representatives in Cavan, but due to a family bereavement was unable to attend.  I express my sympathy to him. His very keen interest in this matter is shared by all Deputies and councillors in Cavan.</P>
      <P>Before this strike began the company and SIPTU, representing the employees in dispute with the company, attended the Labour Court in an effort to resolve the dispute.  The Labour Court issued a recommendation on the dispute, which was accepted in full by the company. However, the terms of the Labour Court recommendation were not accepted by the SIPTU members, who subsequently commenced strike action that has continued for some 12 weeks now.  In recent days Mr. Eddie Browne, General President of SIPTU, engaged in positive discussions with senior management personnel of the company and substantial progress was achieved on most of the issues in dispute.  Regrettably, it appears not to have been possible to reach full agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, I indicated yesterday and <Col N="1091" /> again today that I was gravely concerned about the prospects of the factory reopening.  The company has since then announced that it intends to restart production next Wednesday and that it will invite all employees not currently at work to return to work not later than that date.  I know that informal contacts between the company and SIPTU are continuing and I hope that they will help the striking SIPTU workers to find an agreed solution based on the very helpful work done by Mr. Browne.  In the interests of ensuring that the plant remains in Mullagh with 500 jobs which are so vital to the economic well-being of the area, I urge all concerned to reflect carefully on the current situation. The responsibility for resolving this dispute rests directly with the parties involved; it is within their capacity to bring matters to a satisfactory end.  Of course, the Labour Court remains available to the parties, but the people involved must be willing to realistically address the issues.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies of 6 February 1996 to Questions Nos. 30, 57 and 75 and of 24 April 1996 to Question No. 65 and of 25 April 1996 to Question No. 5, which outline the additional staffing arrangements for the Department of Foreign Affairs for the period of the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The additional staff are required to enable the Department of Foreign Affairs to carry out its Presidency responsibilities efficiently and effectively. The 1996 Presidency will be more onerous and demanding than any of Ireland's previous Presidencies, in particular because of the substantial expansion in the activities of the European Union since the Maastricht Treaty and the fact that the Inter-Governmental Conference to review the Maastricht Treaty is taking place during our Presidency.</P>
      <P>The current Presidency staffing position is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full-time staff: 79 permanent, established civil servants from other <Col N="1094" /> Departments or recruitment panels have been assigned to the Department of Foreign Affairs for the Presidency. They will be redeployed to other Government Departments after the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Part-time staff: There are no part-time staff employed in the Department of Foreign Affairs for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Contract staff: A total of 22 staff have been employed on a contract basis for the Presidency.  The contract for one of this group has already expired which leaves 21 who are currently working.</P>
    <P>The duration of the above assignments ranges from six months to one year.  The projected staffing costs in this regard are as follows: Permanent staff: £977,506; Contract staff: £384,257.</P>

      <P>The European Union and the United States share a common desire regarding the promotion of democratization, respect for human rights and economic reform in Cuba.  The EU also supports the efforts of the US to combat international terrorism.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the extraterritorial effects of the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (Libertad) or Helms Burton Act and of the Iran and Libyan Sanctions or D'Amato Act are a matter of serious concern to the European Union and its member states.</P>
      <P>Title III of the Helms-Burton Act provides that companies or individuals deemed to be &ldquo;trafficking&rdquo; or engaging in commercial activity in expropriated property in Cuba may be the subject of compensation suits in the US from US citizens who claim title to such property. Title IV of the Act allows for the exclusion from the US of non-US citizens and their families deemed to have trafficked in such property, or who are corporate officers, principals or shareholders of any entity that has done so. The D'Amato Act, <i>inter alia,</i> penalises foreign investment in the Iranian and Libyan petroleum sectors.  Such extraterritorial legislation is contrary to international law and harms the rights and interests of the EU and its member states in the trade and investment field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 15-16 July General Affairs Council adopted conclusions re-affirming the EU's deep concern over the extraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton Act and the then pending D'Amato Act and identifying a range of measures which could be deployed by the EU in response to the damage to the interests of EU companies resulting from their implementation.  These could include: the use or introduction of legislation within the EU to neutralise the extraterritorial effects of such legislation: moving to a WTO dispute settlement panel; changes in procedures governing <Col N="1096" /> entry by representatives of US companies to EU member states and the establishment of a watch list of US companies filing actions under Title III of the Helms-Burton Act (Title III came into effect on 1 August but the right to sue has been suspended by President Clinton until 1 February 1997 when it may be waived for further six month periods. This is a welcome decision but the extraterritorial aspects of Title III remain in place as does Title IV).</P>
    <P>Measures identified by the 15-16 July General Affairs Council to counteract the effects of extraterritorial legislation are currently being examined in the appropriate EU fora.  Yesterday's General Affairs Council reviewed progress in this connection and decided to take rapidly all the necessary measures to counter the extraterritorial effects of these laws.</P>
    <P>It is important that EU-US differences over the Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts, serious though these differences are, should not be allowed to deflect either side from their shared commitment to develop and strengthen the transatlantic partnership, notably within the comprehensive framework of the New Translantic Agenda and the accompanying EU-US Action Plan agreed last December.</P>

      <P>I availed of the opportunity of my recent address to the United Nations General Assembly to point out that the non-payment of dues owed to the United Nations was a &ldquo;poison in the system&rdquo; which should cease. I recalled the clear and consistently repeated view of Ireland and the members of the European Union that <Col N="1097" /> all member states of the United Nations have an obligation to discharge their arrears and pay their assessed budget contributions promptly, in full and without conditions.</P>
      <P>This position has been clearly and emphatically conveyed to United States officials on many occasions both formally and informally, and I have myself raised the matter personally with President Clinton.  At a recent meeting within the framework of political dialogue on UN issues between the Union and the United States, the Irish Presidency repeated the view that the European Union required all member states of the UN to meet their financial obligations.</P>
      <P>I note that President Clinton, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly, stated that the United States is paying its dues and is committed to paying off the US accrued obligations.  I welcome this commitment.  The United States remains the largest contributor to the United Nations budget.  It is important therefore that it meets its financial obligations in full in order to resolve the current financial crisis within the United Nations system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The current practice in EU-Russia relations in the area of political dialogue is to hold a ministerial level meeting twice a year, one under each EU Presidency. In this context, I hosted a meeting in New York on 24 September of EU Foreign Ministers and the Commission with Foreign Minister Primakov. Discussions were wide-ranging and included issues relating to EU-Russia relations, European Security Architecture and Bosnia.  F M Primakov expressed himself generally satisfied with Russia's relations with the European Union and with the co-operation on political issues.  He described Russia's interest in closer relations with the EU, particularly the entry into force of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement (PCA) at the earliest possible date.  In this connection, the Presidency noted that Ireland has completed its internal procedures for ratification of the PCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both sides agreed on the importance of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, both in relation to the developing European Security Architecture and in the context of the peace implementation process in Bosnia. Russia and Ireland, together with our EU partners, share the view that the OSCE, based on its comprehensive, inclusive and co-operative concept of security has an essential role to play in enhancing European security and stability. It is envisaged that this OSCE role will be further developed in co-operation with the other security organisations, including, in addition to the EU, NATO, Western European Union and the Council of Europe amongst other regional and sub-regional organisations. This will give further expression to the concept of mutually reinforcing institutions adopted by the OSCE at its Summit in Helsinki in 1992.  In relation to Bosnia, there was a shared concern by the two sides about the difficulties of the task ahead and the need for close co-operation to promote a successful <Col N="1099" /> conclusion of the electoral process and the consolidation of democratic infrastructure.</P>
    <P>With regard to President Yeltsin's health the European Union noted that the President was expected to undergo surgery within approximately six to eight weeks, and conveyed the Union's best wishes for his speedy recovery.  The Union also noted the arrangements which the President has put in place for the temporary transfer of power to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.  These include measures already in place which provide for co-ordination under Prime Minister Chernomyrdin of a number of key ministeries (Interior, Foreign Affairs, Defence and the Security Services).  In addition, on 19 September, President Yeltsin issued a decreee announcing that he would hand over all powers to the Prime Minister, including control of nuclear forces, for the period of the heart operation.  This would be done by a further decree issued just before the operation.  He would then issue a further decree revoking the transfer, after the operation had been completed. These arrangements are intended to provide for both transparency and continuity in decision-making and to enable the conduct of business with Russia to continue as usual, including in the area of EU-Russia relations.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the situation in Northern Iraq, and has been working closely with its European partners to assist in humanitarian relief efforts for the Kurdish population, and to ensure the safety of personnel employed on EU aid programmes in Northern Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> The sudden advance of Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) forces and the subsequent conquest of Sulaimaniyah caused a major flow of refugees to the Iranian border.  The Government decided on 27 September, in response to an appeal from the International Federation of the Red Cross, to contribute funding of £35,000 for humanitarian operations to relieve the plight of Kurdish refugees in Iran.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency was also represented by an official from my Department at an urgent meeting called by the European Community Humanitarian Office in Brussels on 30 September.  The meeting heard reports from member states of the European Union with nongovernmental organisation (NGO) programmes in Northern Iraq, and considered measures to alleviate the humanitarian situation.</P>
    <P>The Presidency requested its representative in Ankara, along with a representative of the European Commission, to undertake a mission into Northern Iraq in order to assess the local situation.  The Presidency also asked them to deliver a message to Mr. Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, underlining the Union's concerns about the safety of local aid workers employed by organisations from the EU, and to seek his assurance that the Iraqi/Kurdish aid workers in question would be afforded adequate protection in the areas under the control of the KDP.</P>
    <P>During their visit from 19-21 September the EU representatives met with the duty officer commanding the UN Guards, representatives of eighteen NGO's in Northern Iraq and Mr. Barzani. Mr. Barzani gave the EU mission assurances that the KDP would ensure the safety of aid workers and their families working for EU NGOs.</P>
    <P>The Presidency also instructed its representatives in Ankara to formally approach the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Turkish authorities to facilitate the activities of NGOs operating in Iraq, in order to ensure that they can carry out their <Col N="1101" /> work efficiently and in accordance with their mandate.  The EU representatives reiterated to the Turkish authorities the Union's support for the valuable work performed by these NGOs in the difficult situation obtaining in Northern Iraq, and stressed that the NGOs operated in accordance with the rights and obligations of international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>The Government, as the Presidency of the EU, will continue to closely monitor the humanitarian situation in Northern Iraq and will continue to co-ordinate closely with its EU partners, and NGOs operating in the area, to assist in alleviating the situation of the Kurdish population.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there have been several violent incidents in Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank and Gaza which have resulted in the deaths of at least 79 people.  Ireland and our European Union partners are appalled at this violence and the casualties it has caused.  I wish to offer the families of those who lost their lives sincere condolences, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the European Union.</P>
      <P>I am also gravely concerned about the implications of the unrest for the future of the Middle East Peace Process.  The ongoing disturbances are undermining the partnership that has been developing between the Israelis and Palestinians within the framework of the peace process.  As we declared at the Florence European Council in June 1996, peace in the Middle East is a fundamental interest of the European Union.  We are committed to the peace process as the only means of achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict.</P>
      <P>On Thursday September 26, Ireland as Presidency of the Union issued a statement on the unrest.  In that statement we urged all parties to exercise the utmost restraint and to work to avoid further confrontation.  The Presidency underlined the importance of re-establishing international confidence and demonstrating commitment to the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard we welcome the initiative to host a meeting in Washington <Col N="1103" /> between the parties.  We hope that it will lead to the recommencement of constructive negotiations on the basis of the principles of the 1991 Madrid Conference establishing the Middle East Peace Process and the terms of the 1993 Declaration of Principles on Palestinian Self-Rule.  The Union is ready to play an active part in efforts to recommence negotiations.  As President of the Council of Ministers, I invited President Arafat to Luxembourg for a meeting with the EU Troika on the eve of the General Affairs Council on 1-2 October.  We had the opportunity to exchange views with him on the recent crisis.  We agreed to keep in close contact in the follow-up to the Washington initiative.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council on 1-2 October adopted a Declaration which sets out the position of the Union at this critical juncture in the peace process. The declaration calls upon both parties to avoid resorting to disproportionate force and to exercise restraint and sets out clearly those areas where the Union believes that progress is crucial to the peace process: the implementation of the agreements already reached including redeployment from Hebron and the release of Palestinian prisoners; positive steps to alleviate the economic plight of the Palestinians including the early lifting of closures, guaranteeing safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank, and the lifting of obstacles to international aid efforts; resumption of full co-operation in order to ensure internal security both in Israel and the areas under Palestinian authority; refraining from measures that prejudge the outcome of the final status negotiations, including annexation of land, demolition of houses, new settlement construction and expansion of settlements; and engagement of the next stage of negotiations as set down in the Declaration of Principles.</P>
    <P>Ireland as Presidency of the EU intends to undertake a ministerial Troika to the Middle East in the near future.  The purpose of the visit will be to ensure the EU's visibility in the <Col N="1104" /> region and, as the region's economic partner, to enable it to contribute to the effort to restore momentum to the peace process.</P>

      <P>EU-China relations are conducted on the basis of the Council of Ministers' Conclusions on a long-term policy for China-Europe relations of 4 December 1995 and the Joint Agreement for the Political Dialogue.</P>
      <P>The basic goals of the EU's strategy towards China are: to preserve world peace and maintain stability in foreign and security policy; to sustain an open world trade system as well as to support sustainable development, the smooth and gradual integration of China into the world economy and the fight against poverty; and the promotion of democracy, structures based on the rule of law and the respect for human rights based on the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Decaration of Human Rights and the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.  These objectives and basic principles constitute essential elements in the relations between the EU and China.  Since the beginning of Ireland's EU Presidency there have been a wide range of contacts with China at various levels.  I met with the Chinese Vice-Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Qian Qichen, en marge of the ASEAN Regional Forum and ASEAN Post Ministerial Conferences in Jakarta in July.  I also had a further opportunity to meet with Vice-Premier Qichen in New York last week when I led the EU Ministerial Troika at a meeting en marge of the 51st United Nations General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took this opportunity to express the European Union's firm commitment to <Col N="1105" /> the EU's long-term strategy and welcomed the policy of economic modernisation and opening up in China.  A wide range of issues were addressed at this meeting including security in Asia, economic issues and human rights.  The latter subject will also continue to be addressed within the EU Troika-China Human Rights' Dialogue at expert level which has been in existence since the beginning of 1995.  It is a hoped that a further meeting of this Human Rights' Dialogue may take place shortly.</P>
    <P>The EU-Chinese Political Dialogue, officially launched in 1994, has become a valuable vehicle for contact with China and has provided the opportunity to meet at various levels.  The latest official level meeting in the context of this Dialogue took place in Beijing on 13-14 June 1996.</P>
    <P>The EC-China Trade Committee established under the EC China Trade and Co-operation Agreement signed in 1985 will meet in Beijing on 14-15 November 1995.  The EU will be represented at this meeting by the Commission and the Presidency.  The agenda for the talks has not been finalised but it is likely to cover various aspects of Sino-EU trade and co-operation activities.</P>

      <P>Ireland has strongly advocated the establishment of a permanent international criminal court, as we believe that it is only through such a court that the international community can effectively bring to justice those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law.  The support of the European Union for the establishment of an international criminal court was made clear in the memorandum accompanying my Presidency address on behalf of the European Union to the 51st General Assembly of the United Nations on 24 September last.</P>
      <P>A Preparatory Committee has already been established under UN General Assembly Resolution 50/46 to begin negotiations on the provisions of an international treaty to establish the international criminal court.  The most recent session of this Committee was held in August 1996.  The issue will be taken up by the United Nations General Assembly during its current session in late October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, and its partners in the European Union, have been actively participating in the discussions to date within the Preparatory Committee.  In our role as Presidency of the European Union, <Col N="1107" /> Ireland will be active in promoting the support of the Union for such a court as well as working for a constructive outcome to the debate within the UN General Assembly on its establishment.  We attach importance to making good progress in the work of the Preparatory Committee which would lead to the convening of an international conference to adopt a convention establishing and international criminal court.</P>

      <P>The sluices at Dysart and Ballycanauna are situated on embankments originally constructed by the Irish Land Commission.  In many similar instances trust funds to be administered by the Land Commission were established out of which the cost of the subsequent maintenance of the structures was to be met.  Such a fund exists in the Dysart case and the funds are to be made available to the Commissioners of Public Works, on an agency basis, to undertake the works required next summer.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Ballycanauna sluice, the fund has been exhausted since 1962 and accordingly there are no immediate plans to undertake works at this location.</P>

      <P>I have been further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are precluded on grounds of confidentiality from indicating publicly or to third parties whether they will investigate the tax affairs of particular taxpayers.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 26 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board operates a reporting scheme for doctors and other health professionals.  This involves a free post &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; system and is similar to the systems in many other EU member states.  The board requests doctors to report all adverse drug reactions.  It is a condition of product licensing that drug companies must report all suspected adverse drug reactions to the Irish Medicines Board.  The board produces an annual report of side effects which gives anonymised data on all suspected adverse drug reactions reported to the board and doctors are <Col N="1113" /> regularly reminded of the methods of reporting.  In addition, within the last year, the board has initiated a system of drug safety newsletters which are sent to doctors on a regular basis highlighting recent relevant safety issues.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that the contract between health boards and general practitioners for the delivery of the primary childhood immunisation programme requires general practitioners to report suspected adverse reactions to the Irish Medicines Board and to the health board.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has a system of &ldquo;monitored release&rdquo; or intensive surveillance of newly authorised products which can be imposed as a condition of the product authorisation. However, in the case of Hib vaccine currently in use in Ireland, the board received, as part of the authorisation application, extensive data both on safety and efficacy of its use over many years.  The data came from both Europe and the USA.  It was on the basis of these data, submitted by the applicant, that the safety profile contained in the product authorisation documents was drawn up and completed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the procedures already in place for the monitoring and reporting of adverse reactions and I do not have any proposals at this stage to introduce a mandatory reporting scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the data base on the operation of immunisation programmes, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that health boards are currently developing systems which will ensure that comprehensive information will be available regarding uptake levels, etc.</P>

      <P>Three changes have been made to the subvention scheme under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 by amending regulations which came into effect on 31 July 1996.</P>
      <P>The first change increases the threshold above which the circumstances of a son or daughter are assessed by a health board to establish if he or she is in a position to contribute towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a parent who has qualified for a nursing home subvention.  This amendment will have the effect of reducing the amount of time spent by health boards in assessing the circumstances of sons or daughters who are clearly not in a position to contribute towards the nursing home costs of a parent.</P>
      <P>The second change is to permit health boards to contract beds in nursing homes above the number contracted on 1 September 1993 and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases.  This amendment is to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet this need.</P>
      <P>Finally, an amendment was made to the regulations to clarify the manner in which health boards, instead of paying a subvention to a person who qualifies for a subvention and who was not resident in a nursing home on the day the Act was commenced, may offer accommodation in a health board institution providing nursing care.</P>

Therefore, beyond advising sufferers to keep in close contact with their general practitioners or hospital consultants about their particular situation, it is difficult to set down a policy position which would adequately reflect the full range of situations which can arise.

      <P>There are currently 22 in-patient specialised detoxification beds in the Dublin area &mdash; ten in Beaumont Hospital and 12, to be increased later this year to 15, in Cherry Orchard Hospital.

    <P>The average waiting time in both facilities is approximately six weeks from the date of referral.  This situation will be greatly improved when Cherry Orchard is fully operational with 15 beds and when a &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; detoxification programme from Cherry Orchard, which is at present being phased in in conjunction with the Merchants Quay Project, commences.  This will reduce the time spent in in-patient beds to two weeks, so significantly reducing waiting times and waiting lists for in-patient detoxification.</P>
    <P>The Deputy would note that detoxification is provided by either in-patient or out-patient methods.  Experience to date indicates that only about one person in four needs detoxification on an in-patient basis.  The Eastern Health Board is confident that with 25 in-patient beds and with &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; detoxification on offer through Merchants Quay, there will be adequate in-patient <Col N="1118" /> detoxification facilities to cope with the need for these services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department is currently in the process of introducing new mental health legislation.  The legislation will give greater protection to the civil rights of those with mental illness who have to be detained for treatment and will bring Irish legislation into conformity with international law.  A draft general scheme and heads of a new mental health Bill were recently approved by Government and I hope that new legislation will be enacted in 1997.  The new legislation will provide, as promised in the White Paper <i>A New Mental Health Act</i> published last year, for the appointment of a commissioner of mental health services whose function it will be to review the quality of care of patients in our mental health services. The commissioner will also produce a code of practice for the care of mentally ill patients.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to the publication of a charter of rights for patients of our mental health services but believe that it would more appropriately be formulated and introduced at the same time as the other protective measures we are providing for in the new legislation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy will wish to know that in 1996 my Department has provided funding to the Southern Health Board, under the Waiting List Initiative, to carry out an additional 45 hip procedures at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurrnabraher, Cork. This is in addition to the board's baseline activity target of 299 procedures.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has confirmed that there has been no cessation of hip procedures at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurrnabraher, Cork and the board is confident that its 1996 targets for hip operations will be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The new hospital at Tallaght is a major and complex project involving the building and equipping of a modern hospital and the integration and transfer of a number of existing hospitals to the new site at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I am happy to report that major progress has been made on all aspects of the project.  The base hospitals moving to Tallaght are co-operating successfully and following my introduction of the agreed legislation last July these hospitals are now governed by a single board since August 1st this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building of the new hospital is very advanced with completed sections already handed over to the Tallaght <Col N="1123" /> Hospital board.  The contractors will complete their work and hand over the building early next year.  Plans for the equipping of the new hospital are well advanced and I am satisfied with the progress being made in the many other facets of the project.</P>
    <P>My Department has approved a salary level of £50,484 for the chief executive post in a number of major hospitals, including the new hospital to be opened at Tallaght.  With regard to the management structures of the new hospital and the salary scales of senior and middle management, discussions will take place with the new chief executive officer within the framework approved for similar sized acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the progress made <Col N="1124" /> to date and I intend to continue to provide all necessary support to the board of the hospital to enable it to effect the transfer of services to Tallaght in accordance with the agreed plan.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Cross-Border co-operation between the health services here and in Northern Ireland takes place both at national level and between individual health boards and health agencies in Northern Ireland.  At the national level, twice-yearly meetings to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern take place between myself and my counterpart in Northern Ireland.  The established areas of co-operation include the initiative for an all-Ireland Institute of Public Health and the disposal of healthcare waste.  A long-term solution to the problem of transporting, treating and disposing of healthcare waste is being developed on an all-island basis and proposals from potential contractors for such services are currently being examined by a joint working group.</P>
      <P>While opportunities for joint action in the area of service provision are discussed, as necessary, at ministerial level, the development of joint initiatives in the provision of particular services also falls to the appropriate health agencies who can also identify opportunities for joint action.  I am aware of a number of instances where health boards co-operate with health agencies in Northern Ireland in the provision of particular services.  In addition, where it is to the advantage of all concerned, the purchase of major items of medical equipment may be negotiated on a joint basis as, for example, in the purchase of MRI scanners for the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast and Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clear lines of cross-Border communication on health matters exist at both ministerial level and between health agencies.  This has allowed the identification of a number of areas of mutual interest to the health services here and in Northern Ireland to the benefit of all concerned and ongoing contacts at all levels provide a means to further the <Col N="1131" /> process of cross-Border co-operation in the health area.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, withdrew from negotiations which were being pursued under Clause 2 (iii)-Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and pursued industrial action in the form of a work to rule with effect from 15 January 1996.</P>

      <P>In view of the complexity of these negotiations it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this point.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The approach in the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> to the development of acute services is focused on developing regional self-sufficiency in acute hospital services. Additional funding has been allocated to health boards in recent times to widen the range of services provided on a regional basis to improve access to specialist services.  The development of such improved services at a regional level reduces the need for patients to seek treatment outside their local health board area.  In certain cases it is not feasible to provide particular services on a regional basis, due to the high degree of specialisation and size of patient population required to sustain a viable service, and in such cases, specialised supra-regional units provide specialist services which serve much wider catchment areas and concentrate resources nationally to the best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patients would be encouraged to avail of services available in their own area and consequently, it is not the responsibility of hospitals to treat patients from <Col N="1133" /> outside their catchment areas for routine conditions other than in the context of a supra-regional service.  I am, however, not aware of any hospital in the Dublin area where appropriate admissions are being refused on the basis of the patient's place of residence.</P>

Bhí seacht gcomhlucht ó Chontae na Gaillimhe san áireamh ainsin ach tuigfidh an Teachta nach mbeadh sé críonna ainmneacha na gcomhluchtaí príobháideacha ar leith a lua.  Bhí an próiséas tairisceana teoranta do chomhluchtaí atá ar an liosta reatha de chomhluchtaí atá inghlactha don Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus do Bhord Fáilte Éireann chun seirbhísí den chineál a bhí riachtanach don Chruinniú Airí a chur ar fáil.  Ós rud é nach raibh Bus Éireann ar an liosta sin, ní raibh ar chumas mo Roinn-se cuireadh a thabhairt don chomhlucht sin tairiscint a chur <Col N="1141" /> ar fáil &mdash; cé gur iarradh tairiscint ar CIE Tours, atá sa chlann céanna le Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>Rinne oifigigh de chuid mo Roinne na tairiscintí a mheas i gcomhréir le treoirlínte atá leagtha síos ag an Rialtas.  Mar thoradh ar an mbreithniú sin, tugadh an conradh don chomhlucht a chuir an tairiscint ab ísle isteach.  Ba léir freisin go raibh an chumas an chomhluchta sin an cineál seirbhíse a bhí de dhíth a sholáthar.</P>
      <P>Chloigh mo Roinn go beacht leis na treoirlínte i roghnú an chomhluchta a fuair an tairiscint agus ní miste a threisiú go soiléir nach raibh páirt ar bith agamsa, a bheag nó a mhór, sa phróiséas roghnaithe a bhí i gceist.</P>

      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is responsible in Ireland for the implementation of the EU Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.</P>
      <P>The workshop is being organised in co-operation with, and with financial assistance from the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Article 6 (1) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC (The Habitats Directive) requires member states to establish the necessary conservation measures for special areas of conservation required to meet the ecological requirements of the natural habitat types and the species, set-out in annexes to the Directive, present on the sites, thus ensuring their favourable conservation status.</P>
      <P>Site management plans have been identified as a major mechanism towards achieving this objective.  Management plan preparation for NATURA 2000 sites has not yet been discussed within the framework of the EU Habitats Committee or its scientific working group.</P>
      <P>Different styles of management plans have been developed for nature conservation sites and are starting to be applieod to NATURA 2000 sites, some of which concern projects co-financed through the LIFE programme.</P>
      <P>The objective of this seminar are to identify the ingredients of good management plans for NATURA 2000 sites and to provide useful guidelines for their preparation.  The workshop will involve case studies and discussions on the different phases of the management plan preparation process.</P>

    <P>The organisations invited to participate in the workshop are set out in Appendix I, and those organisations requested to provide case study speakers are set out in Appendix II.</P>
    <P>In the period of the Irish Presidency it is particularly important that management planning, in respect of the EU NATURA 2000 network, be examined in the European context and that, as far as possible, a joint approach be adopted throughout the Union.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to amend the terms of the 1995 tenant purchase scheme.  Local authority housing is provided for persons on low incomes and, at any time, certain tenants will not be in a position financially to undertake tenant purchase.  The 1995 scheme made purchase more affordable to tenants by increasing the discounts and including, for the first time, an option to purchase by way of shared ownership.  The necessary mortgage finance for either an outright or a shared ownership purchase may be obtained from the local authority. In the case of an outright purchase, the applicant also has the choice of applying for a loan from a commercial lending agency.</P>

      <P>I refer to the comprehensive reply to Question No. 108 on 27 March in which I set out my position in this matter.  No toll scheme in respect of the route in question has been submitted to me.  I am aware of the significant level of opposition to any proposals to impose tolls on the C Ring and I have received a considerable level of correspondence from groups representing motorists, from residents' organisations and from individuals on the subject. Apart from the additional expense for individual motorists, there is significant concern that the imposition of tolls could divert large volumes of traffic away from the motorway on to the surrounding network, resulting in a detrimental environmental impact and loss of residential amenity, and giving rise to demands for additional road construction and maintenance costs at other <Col N="1148" /> locations.  I believe that these concerns have considerable validity and they would bear heavily on any decision I might be called on to make should the NRA proceed with proposals for tolling the C Ring.</P>

      <P>Last July the group submitted an outline proposal to link the Lawerencetown/Eyrecourt scheme with the newly completed Clontuskert scheme which, in turn, is supplied from the Ballinasloe public water supply.  The proposal is being examined in my Department and the group will be written to shortly on the matter.  I am aware of the importance of the scheme and I will consider its funding in the context of the finances available for group schemes in 1997.</P>

      <P>Development consisting of the carrying out by a local authority of works required for the construction of a new road, or the maintenance or improvement of an existing road is exempted development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  However, certain road works are subject to the alternative procedure provided for in section 3 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Effect is given to the provisions of that section by Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, as amended, under which local authorities are oblilged to give public notice of specified classes of development proposed by them, including any proposal for the widening or realignment of an existing road, where the length of the widened or realigned portion of the road would be 100 metres or more in an urban area, or 1 kilometre or more in any other area.  In addition to the specified classes, notice is required to be given of any other development by a local authority, the estimated cost of which exceeds £50,000; such development could include traffic management measures, such as the erection of traffic lights.  Submissions or observations dealing with the proper planning and development of the area concerned must be sought in regard to the proposed development and the plans must be available for inspection by the public during a period of not less than one month.  Following the period allowed for submissions or observations, a report must be prepared regarding the details of the proposal and this must include details of any submissions or observations received in relation to it. The report must be submitted to the elected members of the local authority who have discretion, under section 3 of the Local Government Act, 1955, to <Col N="1158" /> direct that the proposed development is not to proceed.</P>

      <P>Issues relating to examination appeals procedures at third level are a matter for the various institutions themselves. All these institutions have established clear procedures for appealing examination results.  A central feature of these procedures is the clear acceptance that all students have the right of access to such procedures.</P>
      <P>While there are some slight variations in the systems adopted by the various institutions made necessary by the fact that certain institutions have different assessment procedures, there are a number of common features: students are entitled to discuss their performance after examination results are published; they are entitled to seek a re-check of results; and they are entitled to an appeal of results.</P>
      <P>These systems are designed to protect the rights of students and I do not consider legislation necessary in this area.</P>

    <P>The oral examinations for the ceard teastas Gaeilge are held four times per year and written examinations are held twice per year.  It is open to candidates to repeat the examinations as frequently as they wish.</P>
    <P>In the case of oral tests there is no provision for review because of the interactive nature of the test.</P>
    <P>There is no formal arrangement for the review of written examination results.  However, where on occasion candidates contact my Department to advise that their results are seriously at variance with their expectations my Department arranges to have the chief examiner review the written work in such cases.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for holding ceart teastas Gaeilge, including the question of introducing a formal appeals process, are currently under review in my Department.</P>

      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy have for some time been included in the disadvantaged areas <Col N="1165" /> scheme, and as such enjoy considerable benefits in terms of staffing and resources.</P>
      <P>Both of the schools were also invited to apply for inclusion under the urban phase of the new breaking the cycle initiative.  Schools were selected for support under this initiative by reference to new selection criteria which were developed by the Education Research Centre.  The new criteria take on board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>All urban applicant schools, including those referred to by the Deputy, submitted data to the Education Research Centre on a standard application form devised by the centre, the aim being to assess the level of educational deprivation on the basis of the data supplied. The Education Research Centre reviewed the data and established a list in order of need as reflected by the data submitted by the schools themselves. The schools selected were those which scored highest across the range of disadvantage criteria.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the names of the schools selected for inclusion in the urban phase of breaking the cycle. Unfortunately, the schools referred to by the Deputy did not rank high enough on the priority list to be included in this initiative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 127, 128, 134, 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and to try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at special targeted assistance for selected urban and rural areas which suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> The information sought by the Deputy on the number of hours remedial teaching given by 37 remedial teachers in County Donegal to 104 individual schools is not readily available in my Department.</P>

      <P>Following an extremely thorough examination of all relevant factors by an independent consultant, it has been established that a post-primary school is not now required in the area.  It was decided instead that the demand for school places could best be met by providing additional accommodation at existing schools.</P>
      <P>In a recent development, temporary recognition has been granted to a primary gaelscoil to serve the area.

      <P>The use of leasing arrangements to obtain working capital was one of the issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on the 1994 accounts of County Westmeath vocational education committee. According to his report, the lease was taken out on a minibus which had been purchased and paid for by the parents' association of Athlone community college.  The money raised was used to refurbish a home economics room in the college and to meet part of the cost of converting the minibus.  I understand that the leasing agreement was negotiated with the relevant bank by the former acting chief executive officer of County Westmeath vocational education committee.  The lease was signed by the principal of Athlone community college.  The leasing agreement was undertaken without the knowledge or approval of my Department.</P>

      <P>The acting chief executive officer of County Westmeath vocational education committee retired on 24 May 1995.  His pension and lump sum were based upon his existing service of 25 years plus seven added years. Terms equivalent to the Local Government (Early Retirement and Voluntary Redundancy) Superannuation Scheme, 1992, were applied in the case of the retiring chief executive officer.  This scheme was designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the public service.  Any case of a similar nature <Col N="1184" /> involving a chief executive officer would require to be considered on its own merits.  As the Deputy will be aware arrangements for the early retirement of teachers are under negotiation with the teacher unions within the framework of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

A number of initiatives have been taken in relation to curriculum, classroom materials, school policy, information for parents and the compilation of a list of relevant resource materials.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), with representatives of the Department of Education, school management authorities and parent and teacher organisations, developed interim curriculum guidelines for primary and post-primary schools. The guidelines are being distributed to teachers in the context of the ongoing training programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, resource persons were appointed to prepare classroom materials for primary and post-primary teachers.  The draft materials will be pre-tested over the coming months and may be revised following the pre-test.  It is not intended that the materials will offer a centrally prescribed programme, but rather they will make available a range of resource materials from which programmes can be drawn up in response to the individual school's policy.</P>
      <P>A policy folder, which is currently in preparation, will provide a step by step assistance to school managements in formulating school policy.  It will also outline the partnership approach between teachers, parents and boards of management in developing the policy. An information booklet for parents is being finalised and will provide comprehensive information on the introduction of the programme into schools.  The booklet will give practical information on how the programme will be introduced into schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, a list of general educational resources on social personal and health <Col N="1188" /> education and relationships and sexuality education has been compiled to assist schools.

    <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer of 25 <Col N="1195" /> July 1996 to Parliamentary Question No. 608.</P>
      <P>As I stated at that time, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that under the guidelines governing the holding of identification parades there is no requirement for a witness to place his or her hand on a suspect and that it is sufficient for the witness to clearly point out the person being identified.  It is also the case that the Supreme Court has stated that there is no rule of law or practice that requires visual identification in all cases to be by means of an identification parade: each case must be considered on its facts.</P>
      <P>The overriding consideration in any identification procedure is to exclude any suspicion of unfairness or the risk of erroneous identification and to make sure the ability of the witness to recognise the suspect has been fairly and adequately tested.  The inherent fairness or otherwise of the procedure followed at the identification parade is among the matters which can be questioned by the defence in the course of any subsequent trial.</P>
      <P>Clearly complex issues arise and any changes in existing procedures could only take place after very detailed consideration. While I understand that the Garda authorities envisage difficulties arising in relation to the proposal in the Deputy's question, I shall keep the question of changes in this area generally under review.</P>

They have expressed concern, which I share, about supplying the kind of detailed information sought by the Deputy on the grounds of security and in the interests of crime prevention generally.</P>
      <P>However, they have informed me that policing for the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan is provided by the Garda division of Donegal.  Cavan / Monaghan and Sligo / Leitrim.  The current strengths for all ranks of each of these divisions is as follows: Donegal division, 450; Cavan / Monaghan division, 395; and Sligo / Leitrim division, 262.</P>

      <Quest>the crimes for which the 53 persons still at large having absconded from open centres to date in 1996 were serving a sentence; the length of those sentences; the period of time which had to run on the sentence when they absconded from such open centres; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out below.  It should be noted that offenders transferred to open centres are entitled to half remission on the balance of their sentence to be served from the date of the transfer.  They would of course revert to the standard one-quarter remission if returned to closed custody. The figures for the amount of sentence remaining quoted below are calculated on the basis of half remission. The offenders marked with an asterisk have since been returned to custody.</P>
      <P>Further investigation has indicated that of the total of 53 quoted as still at large as of 18 September 1996 having absconded from open centres, nine were in fact persons who had failed to return from temporary release.  These are shown at numbers 45 to 53 at the end of the table.</P>

      <Quest>the percentage of the 722 offenders transferred to open centres in 1996 who were serving sentences for serious crimes; the percentage of the 722 offenders who had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of over five years; the criterion used for the selection of such offenders for transfer to open centres; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The criteria used in the selection of offenders for transfer to open centres include the nature of the offence for which he is imprisoned, the length of sentence imposed and remaining to be served and conduct while in custody. Offenders serving long sentences for serious offences are sometimes transferred to open centres on the recommendation of the sentence review group.  This would normally take place towards the end of their sentence and would be part of a programme aimed at preparing them for their return to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual report on prison and places of detention contains a range of statistics and other information and is <Col N="1205" /> available in the Oireachtas Library.  The latest report published is for the year 1993 and work is being finalised on the 1994 and 1995 reports.  The specific statistical information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.</P>

      <P>The detection of fraud and abuse of social welfare schemes is an integral part of the work of my Department and all departmental staff involved in the determination and payment of social welfare payments have a responsibility to ensure that procedures to ensure correct payments are applied at all times.  There are some 570 staff engaged specifically in the control of fraud and abuse of the various social welfare schemes at local, regional and national level.  This includes 383 regional staff and 187 at central level who are engaged in work related to control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control activities undertaken by the Department include routine inquiries of claimants in relation to their <Col N="1208" /> entitlement to payments, reviews of means and other selective interviews by investigative staff, matching of data from different schemes areas, medical examinations, etc.  Information is not available in relation to the numbers of claims, by county, which cease as a result of those different activities.  Savings attributed to the various control measures undertaken by the Department during 1995 amounted to some £124.5 million.  Of this some £11.6 million can be attributed to fraud which was specifically detected on the part of 10,820 claimants.  Savings of £15.3 million derive from PAYE/PRSI underpayments detected as a result of employer inspections.  In 1995 some 8,000 employers were visited and compliance was found to be completed in order in four out of five cases.</P>
    <P>The total amount paid by way of salary, subsistence and expenses to officials engaged in control activities in 1995 was £9,091,000.</P>
    <P>Detailed information on those officers engaged in the detection of fraud in the Regions during 1995 is as follows:</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and up to age 19 in respect of children who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally handicapped.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, I made provision in the 1996 budget for increasing the grant in respect of the birth of twins to £500 and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12.  These new grants are intended to assist with the particular financial pressures arising at birth and as the twins enter primary and secondary school.  The improvements were brought into effect from 1 January 1996 and to date some 1,400 sets of twins have benefited at a cost of almost £700,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the improved grants, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 budget, these rates represent an increase of 45 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 36 per cent in the higher rate payable in rspect of other children.  Assistance with back-to-school expenses is also provided under supplementary welfare allowance administered by the health boards and funded by my Department. This provides an increased allowance in 1996 of £43 in respect of children from two to 11 years of age and £58 in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>Experience in Ireland and internationally shows that it is difficult at any time to estimate the level of abuse and/or fraud of the social welfare system. However, the levels of detected abuse, with their resultant overpayments of benefit or underpayments of PRSI, show that there is a continual level of abuse, perpetrated by a minority of claimants and employers.  This abuse can range from minor short-term irregularities to serious deliberate fraud of the system.</P>
      <P>The only study of the absolute level of fraud and abuse was undertaken in 1987 by the Department with the assistance of consultants.  The study covered both disability benefit and unemployment payments.  In relation to unemployment payments the findings indicated that in Dublin some 2 per cent of the number of unemployment payments were based on claims which contained some clear element of fraud.  In monetary terms this figure represented some 1.6 per cent of unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>In addition, the review showed that 7 per cent of the sample of cases gave rise to suspicion on the ground that the facts of the case did not check out at the initial interview.  Later investigation of these cases showed that two thirds were found to be actually bona fide, a minimal number were clearly fraudulent and no definite conclusions could be drawn about the remainder.  Based on this study it would appear a reasonable conclusion that at that time there was a baseline fraud level of around 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Control activity of the Department has been a continuing feature of its work and by its nature it is targeted at categories of claimants who are considered to be at higher risk of fraudulently claiming payments and of employments where there is greatest <Col N="1212" /> scope of working and claiming fraudulently or greater likelihood of non-compliance with statutory obligations.  The total annual value of savings arising from the Department's control activities in 1995 is estimated at £125 million. Some £50 million or so of this relates to the unemployment payment schemes which represents some 5 per cent of total unemployment expenditure, or 1.25 per cent of total expenditure. Where there are some 50,000 to 60,000 movements on and off the live rigister each month, the overall level of abuse must be in excess of that figure.</P>
    <P>The recent CSO survey was not undertaken directly to identify the level of fraud in the unemployment payments system.  It was designed to elucidate the reasons for the divergence between the different measures of unemployment which currently exist.  However a number of findings of the survey suggests the existence of a higher level of fraud in the unemployment payment system than the evidence available to date.  In particular the indications that a substantial proportion of people signing on as unemployed appear to be in full-time employment is a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>The remarks made by the secretary of my Department to the Committee of Public Accounts related to the level of overpayments of benefit and assistance which were identified as being due to fraud.  This relates to payments which were actually made to people engaged in fraudulent claiming and which are recoverable.  It cannot be taken as a measure of the overall level of fraud in the system.</P>
    <P>In the light of the indications emerging from the CSO survey I am arranging for a further survey to be carried out to get more detailed information on the problem which will enable the Department to deal effectively with it.  My Department is also currently carrying out an in-depth scrutiny of existing controls.</P>
    <P>I am determined to stamp out fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to apply the full rigour of the law to those employers and claimants who <Col N="1213" /> deliberately set out to defraud it.  I am satisfied that the measures now being put in place will yield results over time.</P>

      <P>The person in question was in receipt of unemployment benefit from 16 August 1996 to 25 September 1996 when she commenced her course.  She may re-apply for unemployment benefit once her course ceases provided she satisfies the criteria.</P>

      <P>No such instruction has <Col N="1214" /> been given.  The arrangements for the recovery of overpayments have been put on a statutory footing recently under powers which were given to my predecessor in office three years ago.</P>
      <P>Social Welfare legislation was amended in 1993 to provide that repayment of social welfare overpayments may by deferred, suspended, reduced or cancelled by an officer of the Minister authorised by him for this purpose in accordance with such code of practice as may be prescribed.  I recently made regulations which prescribe this code.</P>
      <P>The code specifies the information to be given to an individual assessed with an overpayment, the need to have regard to his or her ability to repay the overpayment and the various methods of recovery.  It also provides for circumstances in which the deferral, suspension, reduction or cancellation of repayment of an overpayment may be considered.  Where a person fails to make satisfactory efforts to repay an overpayment, the code provides that the Department may pursue recovery through the courts.</P>
      <P>The code requires that in pursuing recovery of overpayments due account must be taken of the interests of taxpayers and social insurance contributors, including employers, who finance the various social welfare payments as well as the ability of the person concerned to repay.  The code stipulates that every effort shall be made to recover overpayments in full.  The rate of recovery sought must thus have regard to the amount of the overpayment and the circumstances in which it arose.</P>
      <P>The code provides that the amount of repayment shall not reduce a person's weekly income below that of his or her basic needs.  These are defined in social welfare legislation as the weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I receive representations from Deputies of all parties to reduce even minimal repayments on grounds of hardship.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>Income from employment as a part-time member of the fire service is assessed as means under the heading of cash income in accordance with rule 1 (2) of Part 1 of the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for an amount of earnings to be disregarded. This amount was initially set at the daily rate of unemployment assistance for each day worked plus £10 per week. Following a review in 1993, the amount was increased to the daily rate of unemployment assistance plus £15 per day worked.  The current personal rates of unemployment assistance are £62.40 per week short-term and £64.50 long-term. Thus, a single person on the short-term rate, and working as a part-time local authority firefighter, can earn up to £25.40 per day worked without any means assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, part-time firemen are not <Col N="1216" /> required to sign off the live register on any day during which they are called out on fire duty.  Neither are they required to sign off when they are involved in training exercises.  Thus, they receive unemployment assistance on a full six day per week basis less any means assessed.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provides for changes in the assessment of earnings and the manner in which they will be assessed will be specified in regulations. It is proposed that the amount of earnings assessed in the case of a person without dependent children will be 60 per cent of the net earnings less £10 for each day worked.  In any other case, the amount of the earnings assessed will be 60 per cent of the net earnings.</P>
    <P>The £10 disregard to be applied in the case of people without dependent children is necessary so as to protect such people from losses which they would otherwise suffer.  Couples with children receive higher daily rates of payment than people without children and, because of the provisions for payment of unemployment assistance in respect of days of employment, as well as days of unemployment, in a week, a daily disregard of £10 is not required to improve the incentive for this category.  The new arrangements will come into force shortly.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>In 1988 the national fuel scheme was amalgamated with the urban fuel scheme to form a single fuel scheme.  In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, The scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.  The 1996-97 scheme will run from Monday, 14 October 1996 to Friday, 11 April 1997.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built-up areas of Dublin and Cork to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by almost 65 per cent in the past five years, from £26 million in 1989 to £42.8 million in 1995. This year a sum of £44 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the scheme.  This includes an amount for the increase in the income limits from £10 to £15 which I announced in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>Any increase in the rate of the fuel allowance would have to be considered in light of the modest increase in domestic fuel prices since the current rate of the fuel allowance was fixed.  In addition, increasing the level of the allowance would have financial implications. The estimated annual cost for doubling the allowance would be an additional £35.6 million approximately. A review of the scheme has commenced to ensure that it is operating effectively and equitably.  Independent consultants have been engaged to carry out the review and the adequacy of current rates of payment will be examined in this context.  The consultants are due to report to my Department in December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The £1 million referred to by the Deputy is an indicative amount provided for the development of the organic farming sector under the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, 1994-99, OPARDF.  The scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic farming sector under the OPARDF provides for grant assistance under two distinct headings as follows: aid is available to recognised bodies for marketing and promotion in support of organic farming, and aid is available to individuals, groups, companies or cooperatives for the provision of facilities for grading, storing, packing and distribution of organic produce.</P>
      <P>In the 15 grant approvals issued to date aid has been provided under both headings.  Four of the grant approvals were in respect of marketing and promotion with the remaining 11 in the area of capital investments.  I anticipate that practically all of the £134,000 provided in the 1996 Vote will be drawn down by the successful applicants before the end of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who has operational responsibility for the organic sector in my Department, recently met various organic interests.  At this meeting the Minister of State outlined his plans for <Col N="1223" /> the establishment of an organic consultative committee to advise him on the sector and how it can best be progressed. The committee's first meeting is scheduled to take place on 9 October 1996.  The membership of the committee will include representation from my Department, Teagasc, the approved private organic inspection bodies, farming organisations, An Bord Bia, An Bord Glas, SFADCo and other bodies or individuals the Minister of State feels can make a worthwhile contribution in this regard.  The terms of reference of the committee will be finalised at this first meeting.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated his intention to hold an organic symposium. While first envisaged for November 1996, it now appears more likely that this symposium will take place in early 1997.  Details will be finalised following the October meeting of the organic consultative committee.</P>
    <P>In addition to the incentives available under the OPARDF, my Department provides attractive financial incentives to farmers who join the rural environmental protection scheme and farm organically in accordance with an agri-environmental plan for a period of five years.  The payments in this context are in addition to basic REPS payment.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by agencies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the agencies themselves.  My Department has, however, approved three private organic inspection bodies to carry out inspection and certification work under Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91, as amended, which governs the organic production of crops and crop products.  My Department makes a financial contribution to the approved bodies towards the cost of inspections carried out under this regulation.  An amount of £10,000 has been provided in the 1996 Estimate for this purpose.  The Deputy may be assured that my Department will offer every possible aasistance towards the development of this expanding sector.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a decision has been made to discontinue blood testing in the laboratory in Sligo in view of the fact that Sligo and the north west as a whole is an area from which there is a high export of cattle to Northern Ireland and Scotland and the withdrawal of this facility will mean a delay of between two and four weeks in getting test results from the Cork laboratory.</Quest>

      <P>The question of transferring the blood testing service from the regional veterinary laboratory, Sligo, to the purpose-built brucellosis laboratory in Cork is under consideration in my Department with a view to making best use of available staff resources.  No final decision has been taken in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, the transfer of this testing to the Cork laboratory would not result in the type of delay mentioned.  If the service is moved to Cork the test results of animals intended for export will, in the normal course of events, be available two working days after receipt of the samples in the laboratory.</P>

      <P>A number of proposals have been made in relation to the provision of additional milk quotas to the Border regions in the context of the peace process, including that referred to by the Deputy.  No decision has been made on the matter.  I previously indicated my support for any initiative which would secure additional quotas in those regions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that granting additional milk quotas is a sensitive matter within the EU at any time.  If an initiative of this nature is to have any hope of success, it must be advanced for consideration at EU level in the correct circumstances, at the correct time and with the full support and involvement of the United Kingdom authorities.</P>

The package, which was worth £70 million to Irish producers provides for a top-up of £22.40 in the suckler cow premium and £15.08 in the special beef premium.  The special allocation of £13.3 million is being allocated to compensate producers who sold steers or bulls for slaughter or for live export to third countries between 25 March and 9 June and heifers for slaughter between 25 March and 29 June.

      <P>Issues concerning light rail were raised during CIE's public consultation programme and in debates in Dáil and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is fair to say these were <Col N="1232" /> prompted more by concerns about details of light rail proposals than opposition to the implementation of a light rail network in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The main issues which have been raised relate to the choice of routes and route alignments, the capacity of light rail, integration with other public transport modes, provision of an underground section in the city centre and traffic management aspects.  The CIE project team on light rail continues to respond to questions raised and has published a number of reports which address the main issues.</P>
    <P>The Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, provides that interested parties will have an opportunity to raise issues directly with me, as the responible Minister, once CIE has submitted an application for statutory authority to construct a light railway.  Questions raised will also be considered at a mandatory independent public inquiry which will be held into CIE's application.</P>

      <P>The question of office automation is a day-to-day matter for An Post in which I have no function.  I am generally aware, however, that the programme of An Post for the automation of rural post offices is being undertaken in two initial phases.  Phase I has now been completed and has involved the automation of the 600 busiest post offices which cater for 84 per cent of the business transacted at post offices.  Phase II is currently under way and will result in the automation of a further 400 post offices catering for 11-12 per cent of business.  This stage is due for completion by the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>The company is committed to review the level of automation appropriate to the remaining offices with a view to implementation of a suitable technological solution in due course.  The review is due to be completed by the middle of next year.</P>

      <P>I have completed a policy review on the operational use by the Defence Forces of landmines, particularly anti-personnel <Col N="1236" /> landmines, and my position may be summarised as follows.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces will not use anti-personnel mines on any future Defence Force military operation but will continue to procure and use small quantities for purposes of training and research.  It is essential that Defence Forces personnel receive realistic training in the detection, recognition, handling, methods of use and disposal of anti-personnel mines, particularly in view of their participation in overseas operations.  The use of landmines other than anti-personnel mines will continue to be a feature of Defence Forces planning but any such mines would be detectable by standard metal detection equipment and would be equipped with anti-handling devices.  The Defence Forces hold a small stock of anti-tank mines for training purposes.  No operational stocks are currently held.</P>
      <P>Perimeter defence and protection against infantry assaults will be provided by devices which are detonated by command.  These devices are direct fire weapons which are fired at identifiable targets by defending troops in a similar manner to rifles and machine guns. They are not indiscriminate in their operation and do not present a threat to civilian populations either during or after a conflict.  Where necessary, these weapons will be augmented by tripwire activated pyrotechnic flares.  A small stock of these devices are held for training purposes.  No operational stocks are currently held.  Defence Forces tactical doctrine will be amended to incorporate the foregoing changes and training at all levels of the Defence Forces will reflect the changed doctrine.  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government approved on 12 June 1996 an order under the Explosives Act, 1875, banning the manufacture, importation and sale of landmines.</P>
