    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 5, motion re Ministerial Rota for Parliamentary Questions; No. 8, Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 &mdash; from the Select Committee on Enterprise and Strategy &mdash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 1, Central Bank Bill, 1996, Second Stage (resumed); No. 9, Universities Bill, 1996, Second Stage (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: No. 5 shall be decided without debate; the Report and Final Stages of No. 8 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.15 p.m. today by one question which shall be put by the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications; and Private Members' Business shall be No. 32, motion 14 &mdash; motion concerning Defence Policy (resumed) and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>
      <P>I avail of the opportunity to express congratulations to a good, great and consistent friend of Ireland on his re-election as President of the United States, William Clinton.  As a country we have much to be grateful for in respect of President Clinton's first term.  We look forward to a second term.  We would also wish to commiserate with Senator Dole and express our appreciation of the integrity with which he addressed Irish issues and all other issues in the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach on behalf of this side of the House and congratulate President Clinton on his historic re-election. During his first term of office he was a great friend of this country both economically and through the summits I was honoured to attend. Probably the most impressive event I have ever attended was the two days with all his senior people and advisers for the purpose of promoting <Col N="238" /> the Irish economy.  He has continued to do that as well as to promote the peace process.  His continued commitment and energy is badly needed to re-establish peace and, probably more importantly, to build a political settlement.  Like the Taoiseach I wish Mr. Dole well in whatever he decides to do in the future.  I thank also the Senators from both the Democratic and Republican parties and the Congressmen for their continued interest in the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in congratulating President Clinton on his spectacular win last night.  I am sure the Taoiseach is envious of the fact that he could have such a spectacular win since that will not be facing the Taoiseach next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I have succeeded in waking up all Members who look tired and sleepy.  I do not think things are going as well as is pretended.  I have no doubt President Clinton will continue to show the interest in Ireland, and the concern for the peace process in particular, that he has shown during his first term of office. We are fortunate to have somebody in the most powerful position in the world politically who has such a keen interest in Irish affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us now proceed with the Order of Business.  There are three matters to put before the House.  Is the proposal that No. 5 be decided without debate satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 8, the Report and Final Stages of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House object to the guillotine on this Bill today as proposed in the Order of Business because it reduces the number of workers in Telecom Eireann and sells off shares at a scandalously low price to foreign investors without as much as a protest from the left wing parties in this House.  I therefore ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought not to anticipate the debate on the measure which is coming before the House this day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask that this Bill not be guillotined until the contract documents are brought before this House so that the public can see what a scandalous deal this is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My party objects strongly to the Report and Final Stages of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill being taken today without the Government or the Minister having made available to the <Col N="239" /> House the full details of the contract that has been entered into in respect of the sale of this major national asset.  As this is the first time part of a State company has been sold without full disclosure of the details of the contract of sale, my party takes a very strong view on it. Accordingly, we oppose the proposed Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Opposition is taking this view because I understand no objection was raised at the Whips' meeting by either party last week to taking this legislation in this way today.  There may have been communication difficulties between the Opposition Whip and the Opposition spokesman which did not enable the Opposition party to convey its views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, at this stage the Opposition is perfectly entitled to take this course of action; it is fine if it wants to divide the House on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We sought this information on Committee Stage and we thought it would be forthcoming.  When Greencore and Irish Life were disposed of during the life of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government all the details were fully disclosed.  It is out of order and highly inappropriate that the details will not be put before the House and the public.  Whose interests is the Government protecting?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison between a public flotation, which occurred in the case of Irish Life, where under the Stock Exchange rules the company is sold to the public at large and a private deal, which is normal in commercial enterprise, where certain confidentiality requirements occur.</P>

It is important that the African states who are best placed to promote a resolution, are given every support possible by international bodies, including the EU, in resolving this tragedy peacefully.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Notwithstanding the provisions and instruments listed in the Second Schedule, the Minister shall, before transferring to the Director any functions relating to television retransmission services or matters connected therewith, introduce regulations providing for the continuance in operation of the deflector system of television retransmission.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is a repeat of an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage which was voted down by the Government.  Does the Minister have further information on the matter?  The amendment seeks to permit the continued operation of the deflector system of television transmission, subject to the resolution of the legal and technical problems which exist.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told a packed hall in Carrigaline that, in office, he would ensure there was competition between the MMDS and deflector systems.  I understand the Government is committed to the programme for Government which contains a specific commitment to seek a resolution to these problems and bring about a situation where the MMDS and deflector systems could operate in competition with each other.  If pledges contained in programmes for Government mean anything, the Government must move on this matter.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the consultants and I wish to know if there has been any progress in that regard.  Why did the Government include a pledge in its programme and then bring in consultants to consider whether it can be implemented?  Election manifestos should be taken seriously but a programme agreed by parties about to enter Cabinet should be taken more seriously.  I call on the Government to live up to its specific commitment on this matter as urgently as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed my views on Committee Stage when I requested the Minister to inquire whether the use of the deflector system was legal.  The Minister confirmed that his Department's advice was that use of this system was illegal.  He stated that the Carrigaline case was being examined and the position was on hold pending the outcome of that examination.  Will the Minister elaborate further on this matter?  He is aware that this is a contentious issue in areas where cable television and MMDS are not available and the only way people can receive programmes other than those transmitted by <Col N="254" /> RTÉ is to erect special aerials which receive the deflected signal.  The opinion of the Department, given to Deputies over the years, is that the Irish authorities do not have the legal right to authorise the acceptance of a deflected signal from a producer in another country.  Clarification of this matter would be helpful.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach made a promise under pressure in a hall in County Cork during a by-election campaign.  Deputy Brennan rightly raised this matter, particularly the promise given by the Taoiseach at that time.  We have heard the Taoiseach make promises before in regard to other areas.  He signed letters in my constituency to the effect that if his party got into Government it would build a bridge across Lough Corrib at Knockferry.  Such a letter was signed by the then Mayo by-election candidate who is present and by the leader of Fine Gael, who has been in Government for quite some time and has not yet fulfilled that promise.  I do not believe the public are as keenly aware as some Members of the Taoiseach's ability to make promises and make no attempt to fulfil them.  That is rather a poor standard to apply to oneself in public life.  I have heard the Taoiseach this morning put inaccuracies on the record.  I have a way of dealing with that through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and other procedures which I intend to follow in view of the inaccurate remark made by the Taoiseach this morning.</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, is taking Report Stage.  This deal was made by the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and we were not aware that the Minister of State had any role in the negotiations or discussions.  It is also extraordinary that throughout the Committee Stage debate a contribution was not made by any member of the Fine Gael Party.  The is the first time we have seen a member of Fine Gael during this debate, perhaps because the question of deflectors is raised in Deputy Brennan's amendment.  I welcome Deputy Ring but I do not know if he intends to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many interesting things happening at present.  The Fine Gael Party is reluctant to defend the sale of this most important and valued national asset in which taxpayers have invested extraordinary large amounts of money over recent years.  That asset is being sold to a foreign consortium.  A total of 20 per cent is being sold for £183 million, the consortium has the right to purchase another 15 per cent of the company and another 14 per cent is being made available to the company's employees.  A clause in the Bill states that the State shall continue to own a minimum of 51 per cent of the shares.  No other outside investor can ever participate in our telecommunications industry through Telecom Éireann.  A further opportunity will not be afforded to third parties to invest in Telecom Éireann, our major telecommunications industry. The deal has been sealed under the Bill and the House is being denied details of the special sweetheart deal made with that consortium, <Col N="255" /> which has 20 per cent of the company and a right to acquire a further 15 per cent of it.  That deal is most unsavoury.</P>
    <P>Regarding the amendment, the Minister owes the House some explanation on the deflector system.</P>

A multi-channel television service would not be available if local communities had not provided the necessary funds in an effort to put such a system in place.  If we had been waiting for the Government or those who were given a licence to provide the service, we would have been waiting 20 years and would not have a deflector system.  The Taoiseach has given a commitment that he will consider the matter with his Government partners to try to resolve the problem caused when the former Minister, Deputy Burke, signed over the contract to those who had plenty of money, but wanted to make more.</P>

      <P>That happened when Fianna Fáil was in Government.  The Minister of State, the Taoiseach and members of the Government know my views on this matter.  Local communities should have the same opportunity to apply for a licence as those who have been given one.  The court case in Cork has given local communities an opportunity to apply for a licence.  I note that the Minister has brought in consultants from the European Broadcasting Union.  I ask him to try to resolve this problem and I am confident it will be resolved.  Fianna Fáil has been dealing with this matter since 1987.  It was in Government for seven years and all it did in that time was to sign <Col N="257" /> over the contract for the provision of the service to the wealthy people of this country.  It did not consider the people in Donegal, Mayo or those who needed the service.  If we were waiting for the State to provide such a service, we would have to wait 20 years.  Those granted a licence will service the large urban areas and neglect rural areas.  I am confident the Minister will resolve the problem.  I would like a copy of the signed contract made available and the equipment to which I referred returned to Kiltimagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy Brennan, on behalf of our party.  I live in rural Ireland and regard this as an important amendment.  Taking account of the major advances in communications nationally and internationally &mdash; the communications industry knows no boundaries &mdash; I am baffled that rural Ireland is isolated and its people are treated as second class citizens compared with to those who live in urban areas and the Dublin metropolis. That is the case in regard to every aspect of the delivery of public services.  Successive Governments have ploughed resources into delivering services to areas where the majority of people live and people living in rural areas have had to pay through the nose for all services.  If a public service is available in rural areas, it is a scant one.</P>
      <P>The same position prevails in the communications industry.  If a deflector system were not in operation, multi-channel TV would not be available in rural Ireland.  The is the sad reality because having regard to commercial investments and cherry picking in urban areas, investors, corporations and companies which provide those services have no interest in delivering them to rural areas because of the high cost of capital investment.  Constitutional justice is called for in that the citizens of all parts of the country are entitled to equality of opportunity in terms of delivery of service.  I accept that we are a member of the European Broadcasting Union and party to various broadcasting treaties &mdash; we signed legislative documents and directives which bind us to certain international agreements for communications and transmission of signals &mdash; but as a State that delivers and manages services on a daily basis we must ensure that, regardless of legislative impediments each citizen has equality of opportunity in terms of the methods of communication available to them.  The Government, particularly the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, must know that in modern times, with major innovations in technology and opportunities in communications, it is surely possible to find a technological system which will enable people in rural Ireland to avail of services similar to those in urban Ireland.  We have a duty as legislators to ensure that such an opportunity exists for all our people and I hope this matter will be resolved.</P>

      <Col N="258" /> Fine Gael in Government is passing the ball.  I have been in this House for more than 14 years. During the by-election at which I was elected in 1982, when Fine Gael was in Opposition, the then Leader, Dr. FitGerald, signed a document stating that on return to Government as Taoiseach he would ensure that the beautiful meandering Dunkellin river would be drained.</P>

      <P>I was director of elections for a Mayo by-election when Fine Gael, in Opposition, signed a document stating that it would build a bridge over Lough Corrib at the north ferry connection, but that was not done either.  I was involved in two by-elections in Cork and I heard the then Leader of the Opposition, now Taoiseach, give a public commitment, which was beamed out on the so-called illegal transmission channel, that on return to Government he would ensure this matter was regularised and legalised. After two years in Government that party, in a multi-coalition Government, has not even considered the issue.  It has found itself in difficulties and now proposes to refer the matter to an independent neutral director who will be at arms length from everybody, with the power of the State behind him.  Politicians will have no say in the work of this innocuous, invisible director who will make a decision in the interests of all Ireland, to the satisfaction of lawyers and advisers to Government who believe that is the way to proceed.</P>
      <P>That shows the hypocrisy of this Government. Politics is debased by not honouring commitments.  In Opposition and in Government we have been consistent.  If we give a commitment we deliver to the people.  The opportunity is here for the Government to deliver.  The Government is a team of Ministers and Ministers of State with certain responsibilities and duties and if Deputy Ring is committed to this system he should ask the Taoiseach to direct the Minister to ensure that this matter is sorted out today so that he can happily return, with the technical equipment which he stated is stored in this city, to the people of Mayo and tell them they will have the same opportunity as the people of the metropolis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to adhere to the subject matter of the amendment which relates to the retransmission of cross-channel stations through <Col N="259" /> the MMDS system.  The history of the MMDS system is as interesting as the amendment.  Like Deputy Treacy, I was a Member of the House when the Wireless and Telegraphy Act was passed in 1988.  At Christmas of that year two medium of communications were supposed to go off the air, pirate radio stations and deflectors, but while the pirate radio stations went off the air the deflectors remained.  As a result of that Act this little country was franchised for £200,000 &mdash; ten franchises at £20,000 each &mdash; cable management companies were granted the exclusive rights to retransmit cross-channel stations throughout Ireland by MMDS systems. Very few companies tendered.  One company in the south east submitted an application but was not even considered because its method of transmission was not MMDS.</P>
      <P>The inside track was given to the MMDS system in 1989 by the then Fianna Fáil Government and since then that system has operated in many parts of Ireland.  It is being introduced in the west and is planned in Donegal. Cross-channel stations were available in Donegal before we received RTÉ 1 and Network 2. Progressive local organisations in Donegal took it upon themselves to provide this service throughout the county and almost 50 local co-operatives have been transmitting cross-channel stations successfully at a very low cost to the consumer.</P>
      <P>For a sum of £20,000 Cable Management of Ireland has been given the exclusive franchise for Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and parts of Mayo.  Every hamlet and townland in Donegal, whether at the top of a mountain or in the lowest valley, receives cross-channel stations perfectly by deflector &mdash; I say that without fear of contradiction.  My concern is that if and when the MMDS system starts transmitting in that area, whose topography is unsuitable for such transmission, we will be unable to receive these stations.  Can the company guarantee to the people of Donegal that it will give the level of service we have been getting through our own efforts for the past 20 or 25 years?</P>
      <P>The MMDS system originated in Canada and the United States.  As recently as last spring I had a meeting with the Minister for Communications in Ottawa during which we discussed communications and bilingualism in broadcasting there.  When the meeting was over I raised with the Minister the question of the MMDS system and asked him how effective is its operation in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told that the system was suitable for the prairies of Canada and the United States, where it is possible to walk for 20 days without seeing a mountain and lines of vision are uninterrupted for hundreds of miles.  They told me it was very effective but that they were moving away from that system.  I was told that MMDS is the system of the past, that they are looking to the future and to the satellite system.  They are able to <Col N="260" /> rebroadcast signals via satellites and the topography makes no difference as the signal is coming from hundreds of miles out in space. Other modern technologies, such as fibre-optic cables, are also available so MMDS is gradually being phased out in Canada and the United States.  Is it fair that we should be harnessing this system when it is going out of use in the countries in which it originated?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair to CMI as the law is on its side.  CMI brought 13 of my constituents to the High Court recently and succeeded in getting an injunction against them because it was prevented from installing its equipment and transmission masts in Donegal.  The judge said that since 1988 the law has been on its side because it has the exclusive right to retransmit.  I know the Deputy does not want to hear this but I want to make my case.  CMI has the exclusive right to make these transmissions.  The Government is tied into the straitjacket created by the 1988 legislation and the franchise granted by Deputy Burke in 1989 when he was the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>I am trying to identify ways of breaking out of that straitjacket.  I have no doubt that if the Government decided to forget CMI and proceed with deflectors in Donegal and Mayo, it would be brought to court.  These companies would be looking for and are legally entitled to massive compensation.  It is estimated that in Donegal alone the income from transmissions is £3 million to £4 million per year.  CMI has been given that exclusive right for 20 years which is worth up to £100 million.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister his job.  The law is against him and the only way he can get out of this situation is to change it, which will cost him hundreds of millions of pounds.  These companies have the exclusive right to make transmissions.  I cannot say I am against the companies because they have right on their side and they will now invoke that right.  It is frightening to find ourselves in this situation.</P>

      <P>That is the straitjacket in which we find ourselves.  I am glad that the Minister has taken so much time to crack this legal nut.  No deflector has gone off the air for the last number of years.  Consultants from the United States have been invited by the Minister and I hope any further development will be stopped until we see their report.  As well as the cost of MMDS, I fear that it will not serve the people who have been receiving these cross channel stations in Donegal through their own efforts for the last 20 years.  It would be unpopular and unfair to deprive them of these stations now.  We will have satellites within a number of years and that is the way to go.</P>
      <P>This is a vital question.  Deputy Molloy had as little to do with this system as we did but we can talk about what Deputies who are in Opposition now said in 1988-89.  I want those Deputies to admit that they enacted this legislation and imposed this system.  If they have changed their minds and want to scrap it now, they can say so the minute they get the chance.  I hope it is not another promise that will not be honoured.  If they think what they did in 1988 was wrong they should admit it and tell us what they will put in its place.  I would like to have satellite transmission in its place.</P>
      <P>I know if we do that it will cost millions of pounds.  We have paid millions of pounds in compensation to beef farmers, social welfare recipients and other groups who have been badly treated in the past and this will cost money as well.  If we are to have a better system, let us find a solution.  The Members opposite are a bigger part of the problem for inflicting the MMDS system on us than we are for trying to solve it.</P>

      <P>Instead of giving a history lesson that goes into a <i>cul-de-sac,</i> I will cite facts for Deputy McGinley.  I refer him to the November 1995 by-elections in Cork, to a statement made before a packed house in Carrigaline at a function attended by many people concerned about the deflector system and particularly by members of the south coast community television group.  On that occasion the Leader of the Opposition, now the Taoiseach, indicated that it was important to encourage local communities in any activities in which they became engaged.  They should be encouraged and helped as far as possible.  This is where we have a major shift in position.  On that occasion the Taoiseach gave an absolute commitment that on entering Government he would grant a temporary licence to south coast community television and to other community groups involved in the deflector system, thereby changing the whole scenario.  That commitment is <Col N="262" /> on video and I have a transcript of exactly what the Taoiseach said on that occasion.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said there would be no shilly-shallying or delay.  He saw no difficulties.  While one could conclude it was a vote-getting exercise at the time, it was a statement taken seriously by the people as it came from the incumbent Taoiseach.  It was a commitment entered into by a very senior politician; a commitment to which one would give credence.  The people in the South Coast Community Television area and those dependent on a deflector system were overjoyed at the prospect of the difficulties surrounding the licensing of this system ending when the Taoiseach went into Government.</P>
      <P>Alas, that did not happen although I raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Taoiseach and with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in this House.  Is it any wonder that people feel they cannot rely on the commitments of politicians?</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Lowry, is not here.  I have the greatest respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, but this is an extremely important Bill and one would have expected the Minister to be here to take Report Stage.  This Government is well known for putting consultancies in place. When this commitment could not be delivered on, another set of consultants were brought in place so South Coast Community Television and other groups could have discussions with them. What has been the result after 18 months? Nothing.  No headway has been made on the commitment and South Coast Community Television and other community groups who are concerned about the deflector system find they have not moved an inch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more serious situation arises from this Bill in the appointment of a regulator.  The Minister is using ingenuity, crassness and guile to slide away from the commitment given by the Taoiseach and handing to a regulator the responsibility for decision.  During the by-election in Cork South Central Deputy Lowry was director of elections and was present when the Taoiseach gave the commitment.  Deputy Coveney and many others from Fine Gael were also there.  At the time the suggestion from Fine Gael was that legal advice had been sought on this issue from the monolith who is now the Attorney General.  Did Dermot Gleeson advise the Fine Gael party that this was legally possible?  If that was his advice then, what is the difficulty now?  The Minister of State and the Fine Gael Party have to answer for the legal <Col N="263" /> advice they touted to members of the public as coming from the eminent legal personality, Dermot Gleeson, and I expectantly await those answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The deflector system gave a choice of channels to people mainly in the west and southwest of Ireland when nobody else had any interest in giving them service because there was no money in it.  These systems were mainly put up by communities on a non profit-making basis to supply a choice of channels.  They are now being attacked.  The argument against them in the past was that they would interfere with essential services such as ambulances.  That argument has long since evaporated.  Another argument being advanced related to copyright but nobody ever wished to proceed on that basis against them and nobody ever will.  Nothing is being lost on it; some of the channels being picked up are delighted with the extra viewers, so that removes that argument.</P>
      <P>What is now left against the deflectors?  The franchise holders, who are seeking to extract the last penny from the lucrative franchises they were given in the late 1980s.  That is the kernel of the problem.  What will the franchise services do?  Will they try to get into every pocket of the west and southwest of Ireland?  They will not because the MMDS system is a line of sight operation and they cannot get in around the mountains, unlike the deflector systems.  They are not interested in getting in there.  They want to cream off the lucrative end of the market and leave the others with three channels, now that Teilifís na Gaeilge has started, but without any of the outside channels.</P>
      <P>This is all about money.  It is up to the Government to reach an agreement with the franchise holders, who have been given rights in law, but the Government cannot.  In any case, this is a temporary situation because satellite television is coming in and MMDS will be outdated very quickly.  As soon as it is, the MMDS operators will pull out if there is no longer any money in it.  We must reach a compromise on this.  The Government has consultants preparing a report.  With that report and an agreement the Government should demand from the franchise holders, we should get a solution on this.</P>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of Deputy Brennan's amendment.  The deflectors must be sustained at all costs in the west, south and southwest.  The Minister of State will bring this message back loud and clear to his Minister.  He is from Mayo and knows the contours of the territory and that MMDS cannot bend its way around the mountains.  If we have to have an alternative service, it must be the deflector system.  I am confident the Government will insist that it is provided.</P>

      <P>I commend the amendment to the House.  The difficulty with the Bill is that there <Col N="264" /> is now an attempt to take the responsibility for granting a licence from the Minister and to give it to an anonymous director.  That is the key issue at the core of this amendment.  Irrespective of the history of the situation, the deflector systems are still on the air throughout Ireland.  We have South Coast Community Television in Cork and there are others throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because South Coast Community Television took a successful court action the Minister is now acting under High Court obligation to process and move forward South Coast's application for a licence.  As Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said, we witnessed the present Taoiseach giving the people of Carrigaline a solemn commitment that, immediately on returning to office, they would be granted a temporary licence.  There were also strong suggestions that the Government would make good the community's losses in taking the action. Today, the reality is that a temporary licence has not been granted to them to proceed.  Will the Minister of State guarantee to the House that his Minister and the Government will retain for themselves the power and decision-making role on the application from South Coast Community Television for a licence?  Will it be the responsibility of the director or of the office this Bill purports to set up?  We need a straightforward answer to that question.  Will the Minister continue to have responsibility in respect of the licence application from South Coast Community Television in Carrigaline? There is considerable concern about this section and the degree to which it endeavours to take out of political control the response to the licence application from South Coast Community Television and other groups.</P>
      <P>I was interested in comments about the legal straitjacket in which the Minister might find himself.  It is interesting that Fine Gael Deputies are hearing from their Ministers that there is still a legal problem.  The only question that arises is, why did the Taoiseach say he would give the people a licence if they put his party into power prior to the 1994 by-election?  Perhaps he did not believe he would be in power so quickly and thought he could pull a fast one on the electorate of Cork South-Central.  That is what it was about. Even in his wildest dreams he did not see himself in the Taoiseach's Office a month or two after that by-election.</P>

There is no agreement to sell 14.9 per cent of the company to employees.</P>

    <P>The Second Schedule lists regulatory functions which will be transferred from the Minister to the director of telecommunications regulation.  The regulatory functions which will be transferred from the Minister to the director of telecommunications regulation include legislative provisions relating to the cable television sector. The proposed amendment would prejudge the outcome of an independent consultant's report to the Minister in the Carrigaline case.  Any decision regarding the long-term future of deflector <Col N="266" /> systems must await the outcome of this analysis. The Minister's commitment to the High Court in the Carrigaline case will be honoured in full.

      <P>The transfer of functions to the director need not give rise to any concern about the undertaking to the court because the functions transferred to the director are defined in section 1 to include powers and duties.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to remove a section from the Bill which provides for a price cap.  In other words, the Minister lays down that prices in telecommunications cannot increase by more than inflation over a period.  That is anachronism, a silly and unnecessary approach.  Telecom prices all over the world are coming down.  To include a clause which provides that prices cannot be increased above a certain limit is old fashioned economics and telecommunications.  It is <Col N="272" /> unnecessary to provide in legislation for any price increases.  My amendment seeks that this section be deleted.  If anything we should be legislating for price reductions although the market will take care of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that I have to reply to all of the amendments which are grouped together at the one time.  In relation to amendment No. 4, section 7 establishes a new method for the regulation of tariffs charged by providers of certain telecommunications services. The services which are subject to regulation under this section are those for which there is no competition in the market concerned and those which are provided by an undertaking which has a dominant position in the market concerned. The section provides that the Minister may make an order specifying an overall limit called a price cap on the annual percentage change in charges that can be imposed for a specified basket of telecommunications services provided by an undertaking.  The overall limit is calculated as the annual percentage change in the consumer price index, less an adjustment specified by the Minister in the order.  The initial price cap order is reviewable, after a period of two years, by the director at the request of the Minister.  In addition the price capping function powers of the Bill are transferred under section 4.  The director will have immediate powers to exercise these functions in respect of any areas of the market which qualify under the capping provisions and are not included in the Minister's initial order.</P>
      <P>As announced on Committee Stage the first price cap order to be made by the Minister will specify an adjustment factor of 6 per cent.  This means that Telecom Éireann's prices will fall by at least 6 per cent in real terms each year for the period of the price cap.  Over the five year period of the price cap, Telecom's prices will fall by at least 30 per cent in real terms.  The objective of this section's provisions include the creation of a stable regulatory environment in the period up to full liberalisation, the granting of flexibility for service providers to adapt to changing market conditions and to ensure that all customers will benefit from falling prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed price cap system will ensure a measured approach to tariff regulation in the period up to full liberalisation.  The price cap assures unprecedented reductions in overall tariffs.  These reductions will apply to all consumers whether domestic or business.  The price capping approach is common in other EU member states where it has proved to be a successful bridge to a competitive market place. By contrast the Deputy's amendment seeks to create a pricing free for all in that period. Acceptance of this amendment, combined with the proposed repeals of the tariff control provisions contained in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, would create a price control vacuum which would undoubtedly leave domestic users unprotected in <Col N="273" /> the move to full competition.  The price cap system will ensure a guaranteed minimum reduction in tariff levels.  This will provide real and tangible benefits to all Telecom's customers. The Deputy's amendment would seek to deprive consumers of these benefits.  Accordingly, I am opposed to amendment No. 4.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 6, section 7 (4) provides that the Minister may request information from a telecommunications service provider about services provided by that provider for the purposes of this section.  Any successful price cap must be based on a clear understanding of the economics of the service provision.  As I explained on Committee Stage, amendment No. 6 proposes to extend to the director the powers which will apply to the Minister under subsection (4), once the transfer of functions to the director has taken place in accordance with the provisions of section 4.  The functions of section 4 would be transferred to the director.  Accordingly the Minister under this subsection will become the director.  On the basis that the amendment is unnecessary I oppose it.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 7, section 7 (6) provides that the director may not make an order modifying the Minister's price cap order until five years after the making of that order unless he or she has been directed to review the order by the Minister, under the provisions of subsection (5). After that five year period the terms of all price cap orders will be solely a matter for the director. Once the initial price cap order or orders are made by the Minister the sole function remaining with the Minister under this section is the power to order a review of that order or orders. Amendment No. 7 transforms what is in effect a five year price cap, reviewable by the director after two years at the discretion of the Minister, into a one year price cap.  The price cap is designed to achieve a number of objectives.  One of the most important of these is the creation of a stable regulatory environment for the vital initial period.  Telecom Éireann, under the price cap regime, will be enabled to position itself to adapt to competition.  The price cap is also designed to give incentives to the company by seeking a benchmark for the achievement of internal efficiency on a year by year basis.  Additional growth in business and achievement of greater than anticipated efficiencies result in improvements in the bottom line which can, in turn, filter through to lower prices.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the setting of the price cap is of crucial importance to the ultimate success of the mechanism.  It is important that, while offering a real incentive for the company to make improvements in its operating efficiencies, there is scope for reassessment of both the contents of the basket and the absolute level of the price cap. The Government is determined the price cap should work to the long-term benefit of consumers as well as the company.  It has been <Col N="274" /> determined that the cap will be reviewed after two years by the director at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment essentially undermines the careful structure which has been set out in respect of the first price cap.  It signals a year by year approach to Telecom's pricing, devoid of any longer term strategy designed to introduce significant regulatory uncertainty and would thereby hamstring the company in the run up to liberalisation.  It flies in the face of both the philosophy and practice of any price cap applied internationally of which I am aware.</P>
    <P>A minimal interval between price reviews makes price control very similar to profit control and destroys the critical incentive properties of the mechanism.  Price caps in the UK have tended to last for four years.  This Bill provides potentially for just half of that term.  By providing for a review at the end of just two years the Government is going as far as it can, consistent with the need to provide scope for the company to provide for a flexible pricing mechanism.  This amendment is also incompatible with subsection (5) because it would leave the Minister in a position where he or she had to wait two years before telling the director to review the price cap; meanwhile, the director could do as he or she liked after one year.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I oppose the amendment which would have the effect of removing the price cap. That would simply throw Telecom Éireann to the wolves at a time when it is not prepared for the vicious competition which is waiting to seize it by the jugular.</P>

      <P>I understand why the Minister for Finance is seeking power to sell or transfer shares in the company as the main thrust of the Bill is to facilitate the strategic alliance.  However, why would the Minister seek power to buy shares in the company?  This is not the intent of the Bill.  Is it proposed to allow the Minister to buy shares at some stage in the future so that we can revert to having a monopoly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments deal with the issues which have given rise to disagreement between the Government and Opposition. Amendment No. 9 seeks to ensure that the Minister does not sell 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann for anything less than £300 million.  The deal agreed by the Government is a shabby one. I am shocked that a Government which includes left wing parties would agree to allow the Minister to preside over the sale of 20 per cent of our largest and most successful State company in the way proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I protest at the price agreed.  Deutsche Telecom was partly privatised recently and the price paid was ten or 11 times the profit margin, while MCI and British Telecom have referred in their merger discussions to a price which is 11, 12 or 13 times the profit margin.  The Minister is selling Telecom Éireann for an amount which is three <Col N="279" /> and a half to four times the profit level.  This is one-third of the price being paid for telecommunications companies in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>It is a shabby deal because it seems that no Irish need apply for a share in this company which is being sold to two overseas companies, small regional players, which were the only companies left after the scramble.  A person who wants to buy shares in Telecom Éireann in the future will have to buy them through the Dutch Stock Exchange.  This is a shabby and disgraceful deal and I am aghast that a left wing dominated Government is a party to it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister of State and his colleagues, particularly Democratic Left Deputies, would be apoplectic.  This company is being sold for one-third of its value in a one horse race to overseas regional companies and no Irish company is being given a look in.  My party leader asked today to see a copy of a contract which we believe shows this is one of the most shabby and scandalous secret deals ever agreed.  I call again for the publication of the secret contract document signed between the Government and these two overseas companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said all this money would go back into the company.  This means the people buying the company will get back 20 per cent of £183 million and 20 per cent of the first year's profits.  If the Government sells Cablelink &mdash; I suspect it is working on this &mdash; they will get back their share of the profits in that company.  In two or three years' time the sum of £183 million will be less than £100 million.  This means the Government will have flogged off for less than £100 million one-fifth of the shares in our largest company.  This Bill should be withdrawn.  If the left wing members of the Government had any credibility left they would not stand over this financial scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>I am glad to defend the strategic alliance transaction.  This deal defends the strategic and financial interests of the State, the company and the new strategic partner.  Above all, the deal is good for consumers and business. In partnership with KPN/Telia, Telecom Éireann can accelerate its transformation into a modern telecommunications company which is totally focused on the needs of its customers.  The deal has received a broad welcome at home and abroad from Telecom employees, business interests and financial experts.  This deal represents excellent value, and the facts speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>The 85 separate strategic initiatives agreed between Telecom Éireann and KPN/Telia provide a comprehensive strategic support programme which will consist of technical support, expert and managerial assistance, software and systems improvements across all the business categories.  Nobody can question the capability of KPN/Telia to deliver on these initiatives.  They have proven track records in their home markets and are backed by their global unisource partnership.  The figures given by the Deputy are absolute rubbish.  At the outset our priority was to find a partner with the right strategic fit.  This has been achieved in the context of a financial deal which also represents excellent value for the State.  In addition to the initial £183 million, which will be paid for the 20 per cent stake, the State will receive £200 million for the exercise of an option on a further 15 per cent of the shares.</P>

      <P>Finally, through a profit sharing formula, the State will capture a 60 per cent stake of the gain of the strategic partner's investment over a certain threshold and this will apply to the entire stake purchased by the partner, including the initial 20 per cent.  It is expected that, based on the likely business performance of the <Col N="281" /> company, this deal will produce overall proceeds to the State in excess of £500 million.</P>

Any reasonable person looking at the size of the company, which has been a monopoly since its foundation, owns property throughout the country and has received huge investment from taxpayers, must conclude that it is and should be valued at well in excess of £2.5 billion.  One third of the company is now being sold off.  Some 20 per cent is being sold for £183 million and the company with whom the deal has been made has the option to purchase a further 15 per cent for a figure which the Minister of State has built up to £500 million.  He is happy to sell a third of the company for £500 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there an official estimate of farm incomes in 1996 or part of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the manner in which the figures are compiled, they are macro-economic statistics based on the country as a global farm.  Figures are submitted by large companies, such as Avonmore and others, and attempts are made on that basis to work out the accurate figures.</P>
      <P>The figures for 1996 to date are not available. There is a time lag between the figures and the 1996 statistics are not available.  As the Deputy will appreciate in terms of pounds and pence, the figures are based more on the Teagasc survey which in 1995 showed that the average family farm income was £9,644, or an increase of 6.4 per cent on the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the good years in farming since 1990 were times when, by and large, the Fianna Fáil Party was in Government.  One of the best years was one in which I was Minister for Finance and I am grateful to the Minister of State for putting that information on the record.</P>
      <P>Regarding the formulation of the statistics and the figures used on that basis for the national economic data, is the Minister of State satisfied that it gives a correct over view of the position in agriculture, given that they are gathered in a loose fashion from individual co-operatives and companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought information in relation to the accuracy of the figures and how they correspond with the Teagasc figures.  As I said yesterday in relation to tourism figures, although two different methodologies are used, they compare relatively accurately to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the growth in farm incomes, there have been a number of minus growth years but, by and large, the upward pattern has continued. For example, the gross agricultural income was £1.6 billion in 1990, £1.5 billion in 1991, £1.8 billion in 1992, £1.8 billion in 1993, £1.9 billion in 1994 and £2 billion in 1995.  In addition, the method is used in conjunction with the inflation index.  The Deputy asked about the period 1980-95 and, although I will not go through each year individually, the agricultural income in 1980 was £671.5 million using an inflation index of 100.  In 1995, where the figure was £2.69 billion, the inflation index was 237.5.  Therefore, a certain adjustment must be made because inflation has increased since 1980.  However, even allowing for <Col N="286" /> inflation, there has been a considerable increase in farm incomes in the period 1980-95.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the increase in farm incomes in recent years.  However, the question about this year's farm incomes should be asked in the middle of next year.  Can the Minister indicate whether farmers' incomes, which have dropped, particularly those of small farmers in the west who depend on livestock, will be assessed in terms of their real incomes this year regarding their eligibility for unemployment assistance and medical cards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the average annual increase in farm incomes, does the Minister of State's brief refer to the problems regarding the incomes of families involved in horticulture and the supply of vegetables to the Dublin market and elsewhere?  Is the Minister of State aware that in many cases incomes in this area have dropped over the years?  Many growers have moved out of the market gardening area as a result of low incomes.  Is that referred to?  What measures will the Minister of State take to rectify the position?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate how these statistical matters are <Col N="287" /> transmitted to other Government Departments? Like Deputy McCormack, I am very interested in that, particularly from a health point of view.  This morning I raised a case with the Western Health Board regarding medical card eligibility.  The Chair will be interested in this matter in regard to Tipperary.  There does not seem to be any transmission of information regarding the current difficulties experienced by the farming community.  The reduction in their income is not taken into account by, for example, health boards because the transmission of information is not satisfactory.  How is such information transmitted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is a statistical question.  The other questions were interesting and I am sure we will get an answer to them shortly.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister of State was able to give me statistical data based on tourism when the figures were up for the first half of 1996.  Does the computer stop printing data when the figures are down?  Is that the reason we are not able to get data on the massive fall in farm incomes for the first half of 1996?  Having regard to that statistical data, can I assume the Minister of State will raise the matter with the Taoiseach to ensure that he will finally engage in trying to protect farm incomes, given that to date he and the Tánaiste have refused to become involved in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Apropos</i> the circulation of information to other Departments, which I presume was within the compass of the question and my remit, Deputies McCormack and Geoghegan-Quinn are aware that the CSO statistical release is circulated not only to all Government Departments but to all Deputies. The document to which I am referring is the standard CSO statistical release covering the estimated output, input and income from agriculture for the period 1991-5.  On the basis of the figures in the release, it is up to every Department to make whatever adjustments are necessary.  As the Deputies will appreciate, from the point of view of medical cards those adjustments are dictated in the first instance by the Department of Health and secondly by the eight health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Ahern's point on farm incomes, the question relates to the period 1980 to 1995.  There has been a real increase in farm <Col N="288" /> incomes of 29.4 per cent over that 15-year period after adjustment for inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke will see from the recent Labour Force Survey findings that there has been a further reduction in the number of full-time farmers.  This is a continuing trend, not a phenomenon that happened in 1995.  The number of full-time farmers has been declining.  There has been a switch from full-time to part-time farming and so on.  Agricultural incomes for 1995 amounted to an all time high figure of £2.069 billion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should tell that to the farmers of north county Dublin who are suffering from a lack of support in the marketplace in relation to horticulture.</P>

      <P>The most recent information relates to May of this year.  Comparing the period January to May 1996 with the corresponding period in 1995, imports increased from £244.6 million to £272.1 million and exports increased from £309.5 million to £333.5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not seem to be.  In terms of exports versus imports, there appears to be a positive balance in favour of exports.  There does not appear to be a slowdown in the pattern of trade as a result of what, I hope, will be only a temporary breakdown of the ceasefire.  The momentum appears to have been maintained.  As the Deputy will note, the January to May figures corresponds very favourably with the 1994-5 January to May figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear there was not any significant change in trade because there was a good deal of talk of a slowdown in trade at the time of the Drumcree incident and following the sporadic boycotts that took place in the mid-summer. Is the Minister of State aware that from January to May of this year imports from the North have been growing twice as rapidly as imports from Great Britain, but our exports to the North are growing less quickly than those to Great Britain?  Based on the official statistics, will <Col N="289" /> the Minister of State indicate why that might be the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

      <P>Imports increased from £536.8 million in 1994 to £640.4 million in 1995, reflecting an increase of £103.6 million.  Exports increased from £721.9 million in 1994 to £791.4 million in 1995, reflecting an increase of £69.5 million.  There is still a positive balance, but I agree with the Deputy the gap is narrowing.  We do not have an explanation for it.  There are equal opportunities for exporters in the South and for exporters in the North.  As the playing pitch has been levelled I cannot understand why those opportunities and challenges are not taken up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question, but the Minister of State cannot do anything about the answer.  It seems extraordinary in a period of five months when matters were not too bad from a security point of view that imports from the North were growing twice as rapidly as imports from the UK, but we were getting no corresponding benefit on the southern side.  My question would perhaps be better directed to those in the business community.  We argued that great benefits could be gained from North-South trade.  For the first period for which I have seen figures, that does not appear to be happening. Our business community should reflect on these figures and come up with some answers.  I am sure the Minister will check the figures for the full year.  There is a major distortion in the trade figures.  I do not dispute that.  The trade figures are to the credit of businesses in the North.  Our business people should consider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the challenge appears to have been willingly taken up by northern business people in that they appear to recognise there are not any frontiers, tariff barriers, that there is open access to trade and we all share the same island.  Northern business people appear to have responded more positively to the opportunities and openings in the market. I hope that our business sector and Departments will consider what can be done to stimulate our business people to have a greater realisation of the opportunities in Northern Ireland as a potential export market.</P>

      <P>There is a perception, particularly in Border areas, since March when the BSE controls were put in place there that there has been a major disincentive for North-South trade, particularly in areas close to the Border.  Has the Minister of State figures which would show whether growth in North-South trade has been stunted as a result of the fairly dramatic setting up of Border checkpoints?</P>

      <P>As regards the five months period during which there was an escalation in the BSE crisis, I do not have the figures for that <Col N="290" /> period but I can give the figures up to May &mdash; there was consciousness of the BSE crisis and the pattern has been maintained.  For example, imports for the period January to May 1994 from the North to the South amounted to £209 million and for January to May 1995 the figure had increased to £244 million, a 16.8 per cent increase on the previous year.  For the period January to May 1996 there was a further increase of 11.2 per cent, to £272 million.  On the export side, for the period January to May 1995 the figure was £309 million, an increase on the previous January-May period of 8.6 per cent.  For the period January to May 1996 the figure was £333 million, an increase of 7.8 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Local Development continues to meet on a monthly basis to co-ordinate policy in relation to the local development programme across departmental areas of responsibility.  It considers progress on the implementation of the local development programme, identifies cross-departmental issues and agrees how they should be progressed, or in the case of those which require attention by Government, prepares recommendations to address the issues raised.  The committee is primarily concerned at present with considering the issue of complementarity between programmes; the implications of the recent OECD report on local development in Ireland; and the European dimension of local development.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the forthcoming Conference on Local Development will play a key role in encouraging the local development process nationally and internationally and identifying issues requiring further evaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I have waited a long time to ask this question, through no fault of the Minister.  The Taoiseach, who arranges these questions, continues to put them for answer by the Minister of State to the end.  What priorities has the Minister in terms of local development?  How does he envisage the various schemes and subheads in Departments helping local development?  Will he outline the strategy that should be followed?  I think everybody agrees that local development is welcome if operated efficiently.  At present a person wishing to organise a project would need to take a month off to go to the various agencies to find out the position.  The Minister spoke about this issue <Col N="291" /> previously and perhaps he will outline what can be done to make progress in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for his support for the concept of local development. This is a programme I inherited in that the pilot schemes were in place.  The programme has been extended to 38 partnerships in 35 areas &mdash; some areas are so large they need two partnerships. Most partnerships are up and running and their plans have been assessed.  An allocation of £65 million has been made to local development partnership companies and that money will be spent in an integrated way in supplementary education, training, environmental improvements, estate management training for tenants and assisting employment, particularly in small, one to five person enterprises.  My first objective was to get the partnerships up and running.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have seen a supplement in today's <i>Irish Independent,</i> produced with the assistance of the European Commission, on a conference on local development to be held in Dublin on Monday and Tuesday next, which will be addressed by the Taoiseach and President Santer, President of the European Commission. This is part of a strategy to ensure Ireland takes its place in Europe as the leading state in the area of local development.  It is my ambition that in tackling disadvantage in communities local development partnership companies will become what the credit union movement is to finance in that they will not replace the IDA but will have a niche role.  We must make people aware of local development.</P>
      <P>The Goodbody group has been appointed to evaluate the mid-term progress of the three sub-programmes, county enterprise boards, local development partnerships and urban village renewal, and it will report shortly.  As a result of that report we will be able to evaluate progress in terms of the objectives and assess performance efficiency, where there is an adequate link and if there is overlap.  We will then be in a position to move to the next stage.  Most of this year has been spent getting the partnership companies up and running.  This is a very exciting development and I very much appreciate Deputy Ahern's support for it &mdash; there is one such partnership in his constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see rationalisation so that all schemes and funds are properly utilised.  In review of this matter I would like the Minister to take into account one aspect.  It seems as if everybody has a very active role in enterprise boards except elected politicians, particularly Members of this House. Since politicians were involved in the old schemes will the Minister ensure that elected representatives who have a mandate to improve local development are central to ongoing developments?  It makes no sense that everybody except elected representatives should be involved <Col N="292" /> in the distribution of funds, whether from Brussels or the Exchequer.  Elected representatives are accountable for these issues and they should be central to the co-ordination of the schemes in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern raised an important point, a concern which has exercised my mind.  When I came to office I appointed councillors to the county strategy groups which co-ordinate programmes.  Consultation is taking place between the Minister for the Environment and myself to see how we can best complement the role of elected representative democracy.  I want to try to close the gap to which Deputy Ahern referred without dampening the spirit of those involved in the partnership companies or taking from their remit.  I meet the chairman and managers of the partnership companies about three times a year and on my last meeting with them I addressed this issue and asked for their ideas -I have also asked from time to time for the ideas of local elected representatives.  In the meantime I have asked all partnership companies to communicate with local public representatives, councillors and TDs, so that they are fully informed about what partnerships are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are all very much in favour of local development and recognise the benefits of the bottom-up approach, will the Minister agree there is a plethora of bodies?  For example, in Donegal there are county enterprise boards, a Leader board for the islands, Údarás na Gaeltachta, local enterprise boards and so on, with the result that people have difficulty in identifying the correct body to approach for a particular project.  Does the Minister agree that if these bodies are not to be amalgamated, there should be more co-operation between them?  I know that an effort was made to have more co-operation between the ADMs and the Leader boards.  How successful has that been and what has been the uptake?  Have there been any amalgamations?  Are they co-operating with each other?</P>

      <P>I do not have a date but I will communicate with the Deputy and give him some idea of the timescale.  I invited Leader companies to take on the role of partnership companies <Col N="293" /> where they were prepared to do this.  It required a small amendment to the representation on their board.  A number of Leader companies took up this offer but many did not.  There is room for looking at the issue of overlap.</P>
      <P>County enterprise boards support the development of small business.  Whatever the sector and whatever the status of the promoter, their objective is to increase the start up and survival rate of small businesses.  Local development companies are primarily concerned with tackling unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, and finding opportunities for the unemployed as promoters or potential employees.  They are concerned with a ground-up approach.  They have different objectives but they are complementary.  I do not want to see them amalgamated but I want to see unnecessary overlap removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all in favour of local development.  My worry is about the overlapping of such projects and agencies.  The Minister of State spoke of chairing an interdepartmental committee.  How does he deal with Departments which do not want to relinquish control over county enterprise boards?  Does he have ministerial permission to give orders to sections of other Departments, or does he hope that they will deal with him in a non-combative way?  My experience is that what Departments have they hold and will not relinquish.</P>
      <P>There is an overlapping and an oversupply of agencies and of people and projects, but the end result is often that the applicant who is supposed to benefit does not.  He or she is bemused and puzzled by the range of agencies and conduits which must be gone through to get aid.  Does the Minister of State have permission to give the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, orders about county enterprise boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to say local development is not successful.  A sum of £330 million is being spent, one third on county enterprise boards, one third on village renewal and one third on partnership companies.  We have heard from people who were in Dublin West during the by-election campaign who for the first time appear to understand what happens in Deputy Ahern's constituency and my constituency every day of the week.  We are very much aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody but the partnership companies is trying to tackle the real problems that those communities face, and I resent and reject any suggestion that they are not doing a good job. They are doing an excellent job.  When I arranged a briefing for Members of the Oireachtas, because I have heard this sort of nonsense across the floor before, only a handful of people turned up.  I have inherited and refined this partnership programme.  Not only is it good, it is probably one of the best in Europe and it is one of the few <Col N="294" /> programmes doing anything to tackle the real problems that people are facing in the poorest communities.</P>
    <P>Ministers do not need to order anybody about. The interdepartmental committee is chaired by an Assistant Secretary in my Department.  I have specific responsibility for local development and overall responsibility for co-ordinating the three sub-programmes, that is, the co-ordination of the programme.  That is done at the Department of the Taoiseach where the various Departments and agencies attend the interdepartmental committee at which it is a function of the Department of the Taoiseach to co-ordinate. That is one of the roles of the Department of the Taoiseach and it is done quite well.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee will receive Goodbody's report on the mid-term review and we will take whatever critical evaluation they make into account and refine our approach to local development accordingly.  We will not do it on the basis of throwaway statements which do not stand up to evaluation and which are grossly unfair to people who are working very hard to give a cost effective service to the communities in greatest need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister is so excited.  I thought the Minister of State chaired this interdepartmental committee, as did everyone on this side of the House.  That is quite a surprise.  The Minister should chair it as it needs a political, rather than an administrative, hand on it.  We all agree that local development is very valuable.

      <P>Chapter 10 of the Operational Programme for the implementation of the URBAN initiative in Ireland outlines the role of the monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>At its first meeting on Friday, 25 October 1996, the members discussed the objectives of URBAN, agreed on rules of procedure and considered the report on the appraisal of the action plans for the three areas where the operational programme will be applied.  These plans had been circulated prior to the meeting to the committee, who must approve the strategies, targets and performance indicators envisaged in them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>URBAN has many similarities to the local development programme but it is an EU initiative applicable in all the 15 member states.  We had a local development programme here which was far more advanced than in any other European Union state, but as every other Union state was able to benefit from URBAN we also benefited.</P>
      <P>The Commission's objective was to spend this money in one area but because we had local development projects up and running it was agreed that three areas could be involved.  The three areas chosen were two in Dublin, one on the north side of the city, in Ballymun-Darndale-Finglas, and one on the west side of the city, Tallaght-Clondalkin, with one in north Cork.  The local communities, in consultation with the partnerships, the local authorities and local communities, have submitted plans which are being assessed for the expenditure of the money. In some cases the information was not sufficient. The fact that we are taking some time over allocating the funds indicates that we are determined the funds will be spent in a cost effective manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have amended Clauses 5(i) and 5(ii) of the scheme to compensate persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of human immunoglobulin Anti-D, whole blood or other blood products.</P>
      <P>Clause 5(i) of the scheme now reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The making of a claim to the Tribunal under the Scheme will not involve a waiver of any right of action.  If a claimant receives an award from the Tribunal after the establishment by the Minister for Health on 24 October 1996 of the Tribunal of Inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries (Evidence) Acts 1921 and 1979, the claimant will have a period from the date of receiving notice of the award to one month after the publication of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry, or one month after the date of receiving such notice, whichever shall later occur, during which the claimant can decide either to accept or reject the award.  If a claimant neither accepts nor rejects the award within that period, the claimant will be deemed to have rejected the award.  Only if the claimant accepts the award will the claimant be required to agree to waive any right of action which the claimant may otherwise have had against any party arising out of the circumstances of the claimant's claim and to discontinue any other proceedings instituted by the claimant.  The execution of such a written agreement will be a condition precedent to the payment of any award under the Scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Clause 5(ii) of the scheme now reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of an award to a claimant who is a minor, the acceptance of the award shall be <Col N="299" /> subject to the approval of the High Court, which approval shall be sought within one month of the notification of the making of the award, or within one month after the publication of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry established on 24 October 1996 by the Minister for Health, whichever shall later occur, and the claimant shall have one month from the date of such approval within which to accept such approved award&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the House will note the amendments have effect from 24 October 1996, the date on which I formally established the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for not only amending the clauses of the compensation scheme but doing so in the terms outlined in Question No. 12.  We have asked for this from this side of the House for a long time. Every week when new information became available from the Blood Transfusion Service Board we asked that this might be done.  I thank the Minister although it has taken a long time to do it.</P>
      <P>In respect of those who have already accepted final awards, of which there is quite a number, what will happen to them when the tribunal of inquiry reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: I am glad of the Deputy's welcome for the changes but do not understand the comment that it has taken such a long time.  The request was that the time to consider and accept an award would be extended to one month after the tribunal of inquiry reported.  Since the tribunal of inquiry was only set up on 24 October, the issue did not arise until after that date.  A full month has not passed since then so everyone who has received or been offered an award since the tribunal was set up on 24 October will be a beneficiary of the new provision.  I do not understand the suggestion that there has been tardiness on this because the issue did not arise until the tribunal of inquiry was set up.  The second issue that arises in the question relates to the request by Positive Action and other groups to extend the period of consideration of an award to one month after the publication of the report of the tribunal of inquiry, of which everyone will be aware.  There was a consequential amendment with which I dealt and which was not requested publicly in respect of the acceptance of an award subject to the approval of the High Courts for minors.  To do the first without the second would be illogical so I am also including that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal was set up to establish the facts. We know from the statements by the former Chief Justice, Tom Finlay, yesterday in court that it is proceeding apace to get under way.  I understand he intends to have the first oral hearings on 2 December.  It is not a tribunal which will draw conclusions on negligence; it is not a court of law.  Although it is appropriate that <Col N="300" /> anybody now getting an award from the compensation tribunal would have an extended period to consider its acceptance, it does not change the position for those who received awards previously.  The House may be interested to know the tribunal is continuing its hearings.  It has now fixed cases up to 27 March 1997 and it is offering compensation to plaintiffs at an average of ten per week.  It is proceeding well and it will continue to do its work while the tribunal of inquiry proceeds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister has said there will now be a distinction between two groups.  People have already gone to the compensation tribunal on the understanding that the Miriam Hederman O'Brien report contained all the information available on the hepatitis C scandal.  Those affected were awarded a full and final settlement which they accepted.  They now find that if they had not got their appointment prior to 24 October and had not been offered a full and final settlement until after that date, they would have been able to put that on hold until one month after the tribunal of inquiry reports.</P>
      <P>A number of people telephoned me &mdash; I am sure Deputy O'Donnell and Deputies on both sides have received similar calls &mdash; to say they had accepted a full and final award and that they thought all the information was in the Hederman O'Brien report only to discover that there must now be a tribunal of inquiry to establish the facts, all of which were not known.  They have asked where that leaves them if other information comes out in the tribunal of inquiry, as no doubt it will, and if they have been short-changed.  What does one say those people when their counterparts are allowed one month, which is correct, after the tribunal reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The compensation tribunal will operate under the law of tort as it has done heretofore in assessing the amount of compensation it considers appropriate for a plaintiff.  The tribunal of compensation has not become involved in the issue of negligence or otherwise.  It has made payments to those who could establish a link between hepatitis C and the receipt of infected blood or blood product.  That is all one is required to prove at the compensation tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only change I am making is that from now on people will have a longer period to consider whether they will accept an award.  There is no suggestion that there will be a variation in the manner in which an award will be calculated.  I have always said that by establishing a tribunal of compensation on an informal &mdash; not a statutory &mdash; basis we would have the flexibility to have its terms of reference changed by the Minister in accordance with changing circumstances.  If circumstances again change after the tribunal of inquiry reports, I will be prepared to revisit the <Col N="301" /> terms of reference and to make appropriate changes.</P>
    <P>The change I am now making is appropriate to the new set of circumstances in which we find ourselves.  While it gives a lengthy period to people who receive awards to consider whether they will accept them, it does not disadvantage anybody who has received an award previously. If circumstances change, I will be prepared to change the terms of reference in the interests of those who go before the compensation tribunal.  I will continue to make that commitment and to take advice from all sides on the appropriate changes.  The fact that I did not go down the statutory route &mdash; I would like Deputies to acknowledge this &mdash; allows us to have an effective compensation tribunal, the terms of reference of which can be changed in the light of changing circumstances in the best interest of claimants.</P>

      <P>What would the Minister say to a victim who contracted hepatitis C, went to the compensation tribunal on the understanding that all the information was in the Hederman O'Brien report, put their case and were awarded compensation and given one month to make up their mind whether to accept the award?  Having accepted the award, the Minister established a statutory tribunal of inquiry.  What avenue of appeal has the victim if the tribunal of inquiry establishes facts which were not available to their legal team when they went before the compensation tribunal?  Is it true that they do not have an avenue of appeal to the courts or elsewhere because they have accepted an award as a full and final settlement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy's questions are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which the compensation tribunal operates.  It does not operate on the basis of negligence or culpability. All one is required to establish before the tribunal is that one has hepatitis C, hepatitis C antibodies or one of the associated conditions and that one got it from infected blood or blood product.  The premise on which the Deputy is asking the question is that if new information comes from the tribunal of inquiry, it will change the way in which the compensation tribunal calculates awards.  It will not because it does not deal with the issue of negligence or culpability.  It looks for proof of the link between a condition and the infected blood or blood product and it measures the quantum of damages in the way the High Court would in respect of a personal injury claim or, to put it in legal terms, in accordance with the law of tort.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is questioning me on a false premise.  However, if circumstances change in the future in a manner which we have not envisaged, for example, in a High Court case or if something else occurs, I will be prepared to revisit the terms of reference.</P>

We are fortunate to have a flexible scheme which is working well and which can be measured at all times to serve the best interests of plaintiffs.  The only bind on me is the aspect of the terms of reference which say I can change them to improve the position of plaintiffs before the compensation tribunal.  I cannot change the terms of reference to disadvantage people.  That is the only stricture on me.  It is an appropriate one which I introduced, not to tie myself but my successors.  When the public interest fades in this matter and it is no longer a matter of monthly scrutiny in this House I do not want the Minister, in a compensation tribunal which is to last indefinitely, watering down the provisions to disadvantage new plaintiffs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A new statutory-based food safety board to replace the present Food Safety Advisory Board was one of the principal recommendations of an Interdepartmental Group on Food Safety Controls. This group was established by the Government in March 1996 and the Government last week reviewed its report and agreed to the establishment of the new food safety board.</P>
      <P>The new food safety board will act as an independent guarantor of the safety and hygiene standards for food in Ireland.  The new board will operate under my aegis, thereby signifying clearly that food safety is, first and foremost, a public health matter.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Board of Ireland will have a full and wide range of legal powers to ensure compliance by all agencies engaged in food controls with their legal obligations.  In effect, its function is to ensure, in the interests of public health and consumer protection, that the best and highest standards of food safety and hygiene are being observed throughout our food industry.</P>
      <P>However, the value of the board does not depend solely on the extent of its legal powers. The separate and independent status it will have, <i>vis-à-vis</i> other agencies, will give it its strength and credibility.  It will quickly be regarded as an objective, third party guarantor of the safety of our food, whose assessments and reports will be respected both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board will have power to determine binding hygiene and safety standards for any sector where none currently exists in national or <Col N="303" /> EU law and its staff will have the right of access to all premises engaged in the food trade.  It will have access to all records and documentation and will have powers to seize records as well as products considered unfit for human consumption.  In addition, the board will have power to prosecute for failure to observe or enforce prescribed standards of food safety and hygiene.  The board will also have authority to publish reports of all its audits and these reports will have a significant influence on the level of compliance with required standards by both agencies and operators.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, also true that our food industry will benefit from the reinforcement of consumer confidence which will result from this innovative structural and legal reorganisation of our food control systems.</P>
    <P>I hope to introduce the necessary legislation early in 1997 but, recognising the importance of consumer protection in this vital area, the Government has agreed to the establishment of an interim board, the membership of which has already been announced.  Its function will be to establish the structures and formulate the work programme to be carried out.  I am confident that all the agencies currently responsible for food controls will co-operate with the interim board, pending passage of the necessary legislation.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister propose to reorganise those persons involved in food control in his own Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the health boards?  Will they be removed from those Departments and brought into the agencies' staff to put the controls in place?  An important element of food control in relation to standards of safety and hygiene has been non-operational for some time by virtue of the fact that the Minister's Department and environmental health officers in the health boards are engaged in discussions and their work is not being done as a result.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The proposition is not as simple as the Deputy seems to suggest. Inspectors controlling the quality of food in Ireland are employed by six different Departments: Health; Enterprise and Employment; the Marine; the Environment; Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Energy.  Persons are also involved in this work in every local authority and in all the health boards.  While the idea of pulling everybody together into one agency is a possible strategy, over a long period it would give rise to major organisational, administrative and industrial relations difficulties, particularly when we bear in mind that the bulk of these people are not only involved in the regulation of food but in other duties which they perform for the particular Department and agency employing them.  It is the intention that as a first phase response to the difficulties now perceived in the food industry and in the lack of confidence in particular products on the part of many consumers, the Food Safety Board will be set up under statute. It will, however, have its own chief executive and technical and administrative staff, and it will proceed in a policing role by way of audit to intervene in other agencies and Departments to ensure that what they are required to do by law is done in accordance with best practice.  They will be given strong legal powers to ensure they can do that.  They will have right of access and the right to requisition documents if co-operation is not forthcoming but we hope that will not be the case.  They will have the right to publish their findings independent of the Minister for Health, any other Minister or the Government.  They will also have the right to prosecute independently without reference to any Department.  That will result in a quantum leap in our food standards and this is the way we will proceed.</P>
      <P>The second issue arises from an industrial relations dispute which is of long standing and which arises from a Labour Court decision on a claim when the Deputy was a Minister.  We are resolving that matter under the umbrella of phase three of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and we have advanced the negotiations on an intractable problem to a point where we believe we will get a resolution, but it is at a delicate stage.  It is untrue to say the environmental health officers are not carrying out their duties.  They have claimed a regarding and are refusing to carry out duties in respect of tasks made mandatory on them after a particular date but, as a result of the negotiations, they are now carrying out some of the work in areas where they had previously not carried it out as a sign of goodwill in the negotiations.  We hope it will be resolved shortly but if the Deputy wants to table a written question to me on the matter I will give her a precise answer.  I am speaking from memory of the state of the negotiations which are proceeding fairly well.</P>

These inspections are concerned with both general animal health and welfare as well as meat inspection and the testing of meat for the presence of antibiotics, growth promoters and other prohibited substances.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the health boards, controls the sale of meat at retail level under the food hygiene regulations.  In addition, the health boards enforce a wide range of regulations on my behalf in respect of food additives and contaminants.</P>
      <P>My Department is, of course, concerned about the reports of antibiotic residues in meat.  This concern is twofold.  Such residues can induce reactions in some people but, more particularly, they can have the effect of increasing resistance to medicines administered to human for human illnesses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry's statement of 1 November 1996 in which it was stated that the pigmeat producers and processors were once again told that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is committed to the total elimination of antibiotic residues in order to ensure both full compliance with legal requirements and to allay the concerns of consumers.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will rigorously apply the tighter controls in this area which were introduced in recent months and will prosecute those who fail to observe the relevant requirements, of which both producers and processors are by now well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department does not currently have any direct function in relation to the control of antibiotic residues, this is exactly the type of issue which will come within the remit of the new Food Safety Board of Ireland which the Government has decided to establish and which will operate under my aegis.  That board's primary function will be to provide and ensure the necessary health protection for consumers and will have all the necessary powers for that task.  It will act independently of all existing food control agencies and will supervise in a very tangible way <Col N="306" /> the operation of these agencies to ensure they are discharging their functions in a proper manner.  It will have access to all the necessary data, it will evaluate the effectiveness of control systems, it will be able to enforce compliance with its audit findings and will have the power to prosecute for failures to observe the highest standards available.  In particular the board will be obliged to publish its findings in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new board will, therefore, meet the needs for consumer protection in this area and that it will play an important role in stamping out unacceptable practices in regard to antibiotics and other substances.</P>
    <P>Turning to the recent tragic reports of the inquest in Belfast, I think it is important to point out at the outset that the cause of death was, it seems, the new variant of CJD.  I am aware that there is now persuasive, but not yet conclusive, evidence of a link between this new variant of CJD and the consumption of infected beef.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the incidence of CJD in the Republic of Ireland is very low.  Twenty cases have been reported since 1980 to date, none of which was of the new variant CJD.  Since the beginning of the concerns about the public health implications of BSE we in Ireland have adopted strict and prudent animal control measures to protect the public from exposure to the agent of BSE.  The Food Safety Advisory Board has considered the question of BSE on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>In September of this year I set up an advisory group on CJD chaired by Professor William Hall, Director of the Virus Reference Laboratory and Professor of Microbiology in University College, Dublin.  This advisory group consists of experts in all disciplines relevant to this subject such as neurology, neuropathology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology.  The brief of this advisory group includes advising me on research strategies in relation to CJD and on international developments generally in this area.</P>

      <P>My question relates to serious public concern at the levels of antibiotic residues in pork and the link between CJD and BSE-infected meat.  Was the Minister or anybody in his Department made aware of the now famous but unpublished Department of Agriculture report which found that up to 28 per cent of porkmeat contained antibiotic residues which exceeded permitted EU levels in meat for public consumption, which has grave implications for public safety, given that the Minister for Health has said that food safety is primarily a matter of public health?</P>

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was not made aware of these important reports, and the Minister for Health was not made aware of a Government report from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  What steps will be taken by the Government in relation to the suppression of important public information?</P>
      <P>The Minister says there have been 20 reported deaths from CJD in the State.  Given the increase in the incidence of BSE, 162 cases since 1969, 47 cases this year alone and treble last year's incidence, would the Minister not consider making autopsies compulsory in the case of all suspected CJD deaths?  Will he consider making CJD a notifiable disease?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the question of antibiotics in pork and in particular the fact that a Government Department seemed to have information which was not communicated, my response was to set up an independent food safety board.  While that is my immediate response, the genesis of the independent food safety board was the setting up in March of an interdepartmental committee under the second secretary at the Department of Finance.  It is to review food safety controls and it recommended, after considering all matters, that we should set up an independent food safety board under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The Government's response to my proposal was not only to accept it but to instruct me not to wait until I had the statutory provisions in place but to go ahead and set it up on an interim basis so that work could commence immediately.  It is the best guarantee of food safety in the interests of public health that we should have an independent group of specialists who would have the right to go to any agency at any time to ensure they are carrying out their functions under the law, and that the findings of this agency can be put into the public domain.  While the genesis of the agency goes back to last March, it is an appropriate response to what the Deputy has identified and to other matters also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of CJD, I would like to give the House some information.  In Europe there is an incidence of about one case of CJD per annum per million of population.  In Ireland, between 1980 and 1996, there were 20 cases reported.  That is about one per annum, one third of the European incidence.  A strengthened surveillance system has been put in place under the aegis of the CJD advisory group to which I referred in my parliamentary reply.  In addition, the chief medical officer of my Department has established <Col N="308" /> links with the CJD Surveillance Centre in Edinburgh which is one of the reporting centres for the Biomed Programme under the European Union.  As part of the surveillance system two hospitals, Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital, have been designated as national centres for post mortems on the brains of suspected victims of CJD.  The procedure is that there would be a post-mortem on all suspected victims of CJD, to be carried out either at University College Hospital, Cork, or at Beaumont Hospital.  At present the diagnosis of CJD can only be confirmed by post mortem.  In the event of a case being confirmed, arrangements are in place for the two designated hospitals to report to the chief medical officer and the CJD advisory committee.  There is a twin-track reporting system from the two hospitals involved, a direct line to the chief medical officer in the Department of Health and a direct line to the group of experts which I have set up to act as an advisory committee on CJD under Professor Hall.  No case of new variant CJD has been reported here.</P>
    <P>As to whether CJD should be designated as a notifiable disease, normally notifiable diseases are those which are highly infectious and pass quickly from one person to another.  Notification is required so that interventions can be made by the health authorities to prevent the spread of an infectious disease.  CJD does not come into that category, but I am considering whether CJD should be designated as a notifiable disease.  I see merit in that other than the reasons diseases would normally be designated as notifiable diseases.  I am considering whether it should be designated and, if so, it would be done under the relevant infectious diseases regulations.</P>

Will he agree that most members of the public would have expected that such information would be passed to the two relevant Ministers?  What action, if any, will be taken by the Government to deal with that suppression of information?  The Minister's response represents an indecent haste to move on and not to deal with the suppression of vital public information by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which has an impact on public health.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is not correct to state that my response is solely to set up the independent food advisory board, even though <Col N="309" /> that is a strong response.  I have explained in detail that this offence did not lead to the setting up of this board, that its genesis is in the report of the interdepartmental committee set up in March.  In my reply I said that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry made a statement on 1 November 1996 that the pigmeat producers and processors were once again told by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that he is committed to the total elimination of antibiotic residues to ensure full compliance with legal requirements and to allay the concerns of consumers.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will rigorously apply the tighter controls in this area which were introduced in recent months and will prosecute those who fail to observe the relevant requirements, of which both producers and processors are aware.</P>
      <P>I remind the House of an analogous situation some years ago when mastitis in milch cows was a major problem and people applied antibiotics, penicillin, in particular, directly to the cows. There was a big problem of antibiotic residues in milk.  When the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry cracked down the matter was solved very quickly and was not repeated.  Questions of suppression, discipline and so on are pejorative terms.  If the Deputy wishes to know the full circumstances of what happened to a report which was compiled in the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry she should table a question to that Minister.  I do not have a remit to deal directly with civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is a matter of very grave concern, a public health issue and unacceptable.  My first knowledge of the difficulty came from an advance copy of the EU consumers' report which was conducted throughout Europe, in which the consumers' association of Ireland played a part in Ireland.  On the day I received it, it was indicated to me it would be published in a matter of days.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My Department has acted promptly in making arrangements for the safe disposal of health care risk waste, both in progressing the long-term solution to tender stage and in dealing with a temporary situation which arose recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> The long-term solution is being addressed by a joint waste management body, representative of my Department and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, which is currently seeking tenders for the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of health care risk waste within Ireland.  The programme envisages the appointment of a contractor by the end of this year and the commencement of the service before the end of 1997.  This solution will cater for the health care risk waste from all health agencies including James Connolly Memorial Hospital and the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, health boards and voluntary hospitals have made arrangements with waste management contractors to collect their health care risk waste and export it for treatment in the United Kingdom.  I am aware that, on 10 October, the contractor dealing with the majority of these exports wrote to his customer hospitals informing them that collections would cease immediately. My Department wrote to the health agencies advising them to provide refrigerated storage until exports could resume.  In addition, my Department sought disposal routes to other countries and, on 24 October, confirmed its acceptance of the proposals made by an Irish waste management company to have this waste exported to the Netherlands for incineration. Although exports to the UK have now resumed and the waste stored on hospital sites has been substantially cleared, it is necessary to keep the Netherlands route open in the interest of ensuring continuity of service.</P>
    <P>There will be additional costs associated with export to the Netherlands.  These are currently being assessed by the health agencies, and it is not possible at this stage to give a precise figure for the costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Public hospitals generate about 4,000 tonnes of health care risk waste annually.  Until recently this waste was disposed of in small hospital based incinerators. When the EU introduced the current standards on incineration it was not technically feasible to bring these small incinerators up to EU standards.  The Deputy will be aware that when she was Minister in 1992-3 the building of a large modern incinerator in the grounds of St. James's Hospital was considered but the Government of the day did not proceed with this option due to public opposition.  Unfortunately the Government, as in many other cases, allowed the matter to rest and no solution was put in place.  We were then in a position where it was contrary to EU standards to keep the small incinerators, with which we were all familiar in hospitals all over the country, in operation.  The only alternative was to get private contractors to export to the United <Col N="311" /> Kingdom.  The UK was quite happy to take this waste on a temporary basis.  In negotiations with my colleague Malcolm Moss in Northern Ireland, we have agreed an all-Ireland initiative on the disposal of hospital waste as there are similar problems in the North.  Initially we invited submissions from over 30 companies.  This has been reduced to a tender list of eight who expressed an interest and showed particular expertise.  Those eight companies have tendered and we hope to have a contractor selected before Christmas.  We hope to have a system in place which would allow for the disposal of hospital waste in this country without recourse to export.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, because decisions were not taken in time by the Government, of which Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was a member, we have to export waste.  We had an agreement with the United Kingdom that on its Protocol for the disposal of waste it would include hospital waste from Ireland supplied by private contractors.  The pressure on its incineration system increased dramatically with the BSE cull.  The incineration of cattle arising from the culling of herds, because of BSE, has put such pressure on its system that it reorganised its Protocols in terms of prioritising what would be dealt with in its incineration.  We received notice from some private contractors involved in this business that the UK authorities would no longer take Irish waste.  Then the Minister for the Environment who has primary responsibility in this area contacted his equivalent in the United Kingdom.  I had previously made a submission to Mr. Stephen Dorrell and within a short period the United Kingdom reversed positions and, thankfully, it is now obliging us by taking the waste.</P>
      <P>In the meantime some of the contractors sought alternative countries who would take our hospital waste and succeeded in reaching an agreement with authorities in the Netherlands.  Since that agreement the UK authorities have again agreed &mdash; and I thank them &mdash; to take our hospital waste.  The export of waste which was stored has recommenced to the United Kingdom. No waste has yet been exported to the Netherlands but an arrangement was made to do so and it is prudent to keep that alternative open. One of the health boards has also entered negotiations with Denmark and that is another alternative.  We must look at this in the overall context.  We are talking about 4,000 tonnes a year, which is a very small amount of waste compared to the amount of waste generated by any reasonably sized town.  We can solve that problem domestically and, because the amount is so small, we can solve it more economically on an all Ireland basis than with separate North and South initiatives.  That is what we are proceeding to do.</P>
      <P>In this, as in other matters, I reject the criticism being levelled at me.  I would not have this problem if those who came before me had taken this action several years ago.</P>

I received very interesting replies from a number of those local authorities, including ones in the mid west.  How has an audit been received in relation to quantities of clinical waste?  I presume that is how the information was provided by his officials to the Minister.  A number of weeks ago in answer to six parliamentary questions I was told no audit was available of quantities of medical waste.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the United Kingdom authorities unexpectedly told the private contractors engaged by the different <Col N="313" /> health boards and hospitals they would no longer take Irish medical waste, the problem landed back in the Department of Health.  We said that until we negotiated alternative outlets it should be stored in refrigerated units.  It was stored on health board and hospital property at that stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Sometimes at the individual hospital which generated the waste and sometimes at a central location.  It was stored under refrigerated conditions.  I understand from my brief that that has been almost cleared now. Some of it may now be stored by private contractors.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the United Kingdom, which has changed its Protocol once more, is now receiving the medical waste and that the private contractors which deal with this matter have commenced export to the United Kingdom.  I do not know whether they have succeeded in clearing the backlog but there is not a problem about clearing it.</P>
      <P>However, because of the difficulty which arose, and for fear difficulties would arise again, from a policy point of view the arrangements with the Netherlands should be kept open.  We should encourage health boards and private contractors to use the Netherlands outlet because it gives us a prudent alternative.</P>
      <P>The ultimate solution is what I have already put in place &mdash; a joint initiative between ourselves and the health authorities in Northern Ireland to deal with this problem in a satisfactory way within Ireland.  We are jointly examining the tenders to select a contractor.</P>

      <P>In relation to what the Minister said about dealing with the situation within Ireland, does he have any plans for an initiative to reduce the amount of clinical waste?  My consultation with hospital staff suggests that a considerable amount of material which is not clinical waste is categorised as clinical waste because of the lax practice of bundling it all together.  Will the Minister take an initiative to greatly improve that situation?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the technologies, other than incineration, now in place for dealing with actual clinical waste?  Is he open to consultation on some of these technologies which do not inform the present waste strategy?  The waste legislation deals with very large scale solutions which are not always appropriate, particularly where the technology exists to deal with them locally and <i>in situ.</i></P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is a very fair comment.  If the Deputy had asked that of my predecessor several years ago there would have <Col N="314" /> been a much higher tonnage of hospital waste but it would not have been clinical waste.  Everything was bundled together.  Cartons in which new equipment was packed were included with waste from the operating theatres and canteens.  New strategies have been put in place and we have succeeded &mdash; in my predecessor, Deputy Howlin's, time and mine &mdash; to introduce Protocols to the health boards.  Normal domestic waste is now separated from clinical hospital waste which is why the tonnage is now substantially less than it was heretofore.</P>
      <P>A range of technologies is available.  However, the option I am considering of appointing a contractor to deal with the problem within the country, in consultation with my friends in Northern Ireland, does not involve an incineration option.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My only knowledge of the Mid Western Health Board storage is that it had a refrigerated unit at the regional hospital in Limerick.  A second refrigerated unit was put in place which became a constituency problem for me because the sound of the refrigeration kept local residents awake at night.  That was my route to the information. Some of those refrigerated units were subsequently put together near Croom Hospital which has extensive grounds.  I have not heard of <Col N="315" /> any unauthorised storage.  Once the waste is sent to the contractor it is a matter for him, while the controls are exercised by the Department of the Environment.  I cannot, therefore, give a categorical assurance that there was not storage.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is interesting.  I have two replies, one from Limerick County Council and the other from Limerick Corporation.  The county council is an involved in Croom Hospital while the corporation is involved in the health board property in the city.  Both replies state clearly that no application was requested or received in respect of a permit to dispose of or to store clinical waste.  It is important to establish how the health board was able to operate &mdash; as it would seem from these replies to have done &mdash; outside the law.</P>

We need a formal report from the health board to establish precisely what happened from the time of first referral to the time of the unfortunate death of this young girl.  I have asked the inspector of mental hospitals, who investigates the care and treatment of all persons suffering from a psychiatric illness, to investigate the case and report to me as soon as possible.

The unit in St. Patrick's Hospital is up to international standard, yet GPs do not seem to be aware it is available. The Department of Finance should highlight the availability of these units.  It may not be feasible or cost effective to set up specialised units in each health board area and these units could be availed of by health boards at competitive rates.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to what has been said to me outside the House regarding the process which has given rise to this Bill and to the controls that will be put on the economy, now and in the future.  At a recent public meeting a councillor colleague of mine, a Minister of State, said that the resources and allocations that may in the future be expected or be at the discretion of the Government would in many ways be controlled more centrally than at present.  For <Col N="319" /> example, at budget time we would have to take into account stricter controls on the Department of Education and, by implication, other Departments.</P>
      <P>On the issue of economic and monetary union, I asked the Minister for Finance yesterday if the Government would be regulated by monetary union to the extent that allocations of national financial resources to different Departments would be controlled from a European base.  In his reply the Minister said that there was no provision for regulation under economic and monetary union.  However, in reply to supplementary questions he referred to the criteria set out in paragraph 104 of the Maastricht Treaty and its associated protocol, with which we are all familiar, which defines the levels of deficit and debt in terms of overall Government spending as a proportion of GDP.  It was said that these do not seek to impose any constraint on the means taken by member states to meet these obligations.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government would not expect people to think that there is not a problem simply by it saying that there are no rules to state how we should meet our obligations.  While I would not like to carry the analogy further than the minimum, it is worth pointing out that the same argument is often heard from some of the more unscrupulous drug dealers when they say they are not asking people to rob money or carry syringes to make attacks to feed their habit but that they want the money and they do not care how it is obtained.  This is essentially what is being said here: we are not being told from which Departments to cut funds but we are told that we will have to be stringent.  This must be realised and faced up to.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced as part of a prelude to economic and monetary union.  I hope the debate on economic and monetary union will be broadened so that we see the bigger picture and not simply each Bill, item by item, as if it is part of the Government's everyday legislative programme.  It is something much bigger and this Bill is part of something far more significant.</P>
      <P>At the EU Council of Ministers meeting yesterday there was unanimous agreement that money would be provided to Korea to help with its nuclear programme.  Korea wants to build nuclear plants, ostensibly to generate electricity. We are part of the EU some of whose member states have a well known interest in the proliferation of nuclear plants around the world. We must courageously address the issue of principle which challenges us.</P>
      <P>This issue is a warning.  If it is possible for us to be corralled or cajoled into supporting the nuclear industry in Korea without economic and monetary union, I shudder to think what our approach will be when we are part of economic and monetary union.  It will probably be a resignation to the reality that there is little we can do.  People need to know this; it must be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> Not too long ago mortgage and interest rates made matters very difficult and people felt helpless.  The Central Bank then acted in some way as a buffer against the vagaries of European monetary trends.  I hope when we take on board all that economic and monetary union involves we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards.</P>
    <P>Some people consider that it is better that we be controlled more centrally from Europe than centrally from Dublin.  I do not agree with this. Such people have a jaundiced view of the famous phrase regarding openness, transparency and accountability.  There is much secrecy.  For example, while written rules and regulations supposedly govern the tendering process in Departments it is often difficult to ascertain what is going on and to obtain information on who is accountable and who is making decisions.  I am not talking about elected representatives.  I am talking about other people who make decisions.  I hope this begrudging factor does not inform the debate.</P>
    <P>I do not believe central European activities or decision-making will be less secretive than decision-making at a national level.  If the Bundesbank decide monetary policy, it may be even more difficult to get information about the motivation behind those decisions.  It will certainly be much more expensive to make telephone calls to obtain such information.  This is in stark contrast with what happens in many other Governments.  In Canada anybody who submits a tender at official government level is invited to attend when the boxes are being opened.  It is similar to a polling day here.  They know to whom the tenders are awarded and why they were awarded to them.  This highlights some of the progress that remains to be made here in regard to accountability, a problem that will not be resolved by economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The Green Party canvassed against acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty and there are still grounds for opposing it.  The decision to accept Maastricht was democratically taken and we will have to live with it.  The Central Bank may control the monetary life of the country although, as Deputy McCreevy stated, this Bill may mean a diminution of that control.  Some aspects of Central Bank control, economic and monetary union and this Bill need to be debated in a broader manner.  Our European neighbours have allowed us benefit significantly from Structural and Cohesion funding, which has improved the lot of our people.  How many of us ask why Germany, France and Britain, the main benefactors of European funding, want to give money to peripheral regions and countries with a low GDP.  We are not given a clear answer in that regard, we are told it is in the interests of greater brotherly or sisterly business.  It is a matter of selling more products in a wider area, with restricted barriers.  Do the countries which have contributed money to our economy really hope we benefit and that it will create local employment?  Do they hope production will <Col N="321" /> thrive in our towns, cities and villages to meet their needs?  Do they hope their location here will enable us sell locally and cut down on vast transport costs which involves a great deal of air and sea travel?  I do not believe they have those interests at heart.  They want free access to markets and they want to control local finance.</P>
    <P>Much lip service is paid to the term &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; in European structures, but there is not much subsidiarity in the economic and monetary union process.  I understand producers are no longer allowed to state the country in which their products are made.  They may only state they are made in the EU.  We are facing a rough ride with economic and monetary union, but I hope I am proven wrong.  We must keep our eyes open.</P>
    <P>The Government frequently claims the economy is doing well and boasts about job creation.  If genuine jobs were created, they would be worth boasting about.  I asked the Taoiseach recently if the statistics for job creation can be broken down into part-time jobs, contract work or any type of sustainable employment.  There is no measure of the quality of jobs being created, many of which are low paid.  I recently spoke to an economist and former German Minister in Helmut Kohl's Government who told me that, while German companies were doing well, they locate here to avail of a lower cost base.  They are not coming here for the love of the people, even though that perception is often mooted.  It would be nice if that were true.  While I am sure some German companies are interested in what we have to offer from a tourism point of view, essentially they locate here to maximise profits.</P>
    <P>Will the process on which we are embarking ensure a more secure future for this and future generations or do we have a choice?  The Maastricht Treaty has ensured we do not have a choice.  We can learn from countries that have worked alongside a twin track &mdash; I am not talking about Northern Ireland &mdash; where local economies work alongside the macroeconomic climate. France has managed to do this with locally produced bread, wine, cheese and so on.  Some people have been able to do this here, but not with official support.  I am talking about the phenomenon which started in Canada and is known as the local exchange trading systems.  The Central Bank would not have control over them, although they could be dealt with under Part V of the Bill which deals with <i>bureaux de change.</i> However, the reference in the Bill relates more to airports and high street banks than locally created currencies.  This position is a reality in many towns and villages where a large proportion of skilled people have time on their hands because they cannot find paid work in the formal economy.  They are effectively benefiting their local area by keeping wealth in it and benefiting each other by serving people's needs through a Golden Pages type directory of services and skills on which they put a value and which they agree will be their unit of currency.</P>

Time constraints prevent me dealing with it in depth but the book, <i>Short Circuit,</i> by the economist, Richard Douthwaite, deals with it in greater detail.  However, it will become increasingly necessary as we move towards economic and monetary union as proposed in the Bill.  We must establish more stable local economies within the unstable macroeconomic climate on which we depend at this point.  If we are serious about employment, economic security and ecology &mdash; this matter relates closely to ecological principles &mdash; we must offset the risks of economic and monetary union with active encouragement for initiatives which strengthen local economies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill presents an opportunity to discuss the Central Bank and its potential management of the single currency.  I make no apology for using this opportunity to discuss the single currency because there has been an appalling lack of debate on this issue.  I do not agree with my colleagues on this side who said recently that the matter has been debated at length.  It has been debated at committees and has arisen during Question Time but, unless the Minister can point me in the right direction, I am not aware of a serious debate on the single currency in the House since the Government took office or previously.  It is most irresponsible of all Members to consider crossing the rubicon of a single currency without a specific debate in the House.</P>
      <P>I am sure party positions will harden, but this issue does not cut across party lines at this point. I am aware that members of my party, and others, have different views.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach on the matter but they were all transferred to the Minister for Finance who said Ireland passed the Maastricht Treaty and that, in effect, was the end of the discussion.  He is working out the details but we are stuck with a single currency.  However, I wish to challenge that view.  The impression is being given that one is unpatriotic if one challenges the notion that Ireland will automatically become a full member of the single currency by virtue of the Maastricht Treaty.  That is not my understanding of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland agreed to join the system, but we did not agree to the timing, the precise mechanisms involved or the relationship with other economies.  We have some options and it is unfair to the House &mdash; the Government is not doing it deliberately; I am aware that they are all busy &mdash; to leave the impression that this is a done deal which cannot be reopened or discussed, and if we debate it that we are only tinkering at the edges. It is a fundamental issue because this sovereign Parliament is about to cross a financial and economic rubicon.  There will be no going back <Col N="323" /> once it is crossed and this is why I wish to make a number of points regarding the Central Bank and its management of a single currency.</P>
    <P>The single currency proposal has not been properly debated.  The decision is historic and will have far reaching consequences.  It will affect the economy for many years.  Ireland must join the single currency but we must do more to bring the UK on board.  We must be satisfied about a number of issues before the negotiations are completed.  I am glad the Minister said there are negotiations about certain matters, such as the relationship with sterling and other currencies.</P>
    <P>The Government missed the glorious opportunity presented by Ireland's EU Presidency.  I was involved in a previous Presidency and I am aware of the problems involved in being seen to abuse it.  However, when a country holds the Presidency, time can be found to raise matters of national importance and it should have been used to try to bring the British on board in regard to the single currency. I was disappointed that the matter was not even on the agenda for the last meeting of the Heads of State.  It will be on the agenda for the next meeting, but that is the last one during our Presidency.  It is a pity it was not discussed at the October meeting because we could have tried to pull the British on board.  We do not appear to be making any attempts in that regard.</P>
    <P>We must be satisfied about a number of issues before we sign up for the single currency.  An arrangement regarding a link between sterling and the new currency must be made.  It is unthinkable that Ireland could be a member of a currency in the absence of a formal or legal relationship with sterling which could behave as it wishes.  For example, it could become involved in competitive devaluations, which would throw Irish exporters into a panic overnight.  Up to 30 per cent of our exports could be wiped out if a serious devaluation battle occurred when Ireland was involved in the single currency and Britain was outside it.</P>
    <P>We should join economic and monetary union even if Britain does not join but, before we do so, we must insist on the UK forming a statutory link with the new currency.  It could, perhaps, agree to float in a new ERM type system in a similar band to the current system of 15 per cent.  There is no reason that cannot be worked out and it is a derogation of responsibility by the Cabinet not to hammer home this point at every opportunity.  I am disappointed it has not been taken up more strongly because it is a critical issue.  The ESRI suggested that 20,000 jobs might be lost if sterling was allowed to float freely.</P>
    <P>I do not wish my next point to be misinterpreted, which could easily happen, but I do not favour an ECU system which is dominated by the Bundesbank and the German authorities. It is critical that the new currency is controlled by a number of EU members with strong and almost equal regulatory powers.  The new currency must <Col N="324" /> not be a souped-up deutschmark.  If it is to be a real European currency, it must be controlled by a number of EU members with strong and almost equal regulatory powers.  This is a critical point.</P>
    <P>The banks must lay down policy, but within policy guidelines laid down by the Council of Ministers.  It is unacceptable that a European central bank should be totally independent.  Some economists will throw their hands up in horror at that statement but the Council of Ministers is an institution of co-operation in Europe.  The broad policy parameters must come from there and not exclusively from the directors of the Bundesbank and the new directors of the Central Bank of Europe acting on its own.</P>
    <P>Some compensatory financial arrangements must be put in place to ensure our economy is supported in the event that we become caught up in the crossfire of currency devaluations between, say, the new currency and sterling.  I hope that will not be viewed as a begging bowl statement, but will be considered much more seriously.  No country in these regions is as vulnerable as we are to fluctuations in sterling because proportionately we are extra dependent on the British economy. We are much more dependent proportionately on it than the French, the Germans or the Italians. It is critical that if we join and Britain does not join we have an arrangement whereby, if we do not work out a link with sterling, some compensatory arrangements will be put in place.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a point about Northern Ireland. I would not like to be party to a Government decision that provides for the setting up of an economic border on this small island.  Such a border will be set up if sterling goes one way and a new currency goes another without some formal link.  In that regard I had cause recently to suggest formally a transition system which might be put to the British Government.  When he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, said he did not want a single currency, he wanted a common currency.  By that he meant an additional currency to run alongside the existing currencies which would be interchangeable.  In other words, for a long period the punt as well as the ECU would be used here.  Both would be tradeable and acceptable in shops and they could be exchanged at their exchange rate.  We are handling 13 currencies and there should not be any big deal about handling a fourteenth.  In time we would come to handle the new currency and rely on it.  That was not accepted by John Major's Government at the time.  I have had occasion to discuss it with senior economists recently and they assured me that, given that perhaps we will have one currency and Northern Ireland another, there is no reason that a common currency type regime could not be put in place if the British Government were to agree with the Irish authorities and the new Central Bank to do so. That, at least, would mean that the same currency could be used in Belfast as in Dublin.  Without such an arrangement, that would not be possible. It is not possible at present, but a single currency <Col N="325" /> would be a much more serious development in the long term.</P>
    <P>I intervened to avail of the opportunity of the debate on this Bill to demand more debate on a single currency, plead for a formal link between sterling and the new currency to be worked out in advance, to ask that the new currency should not be dominated by Germany or its Bundesbank, but be a genuine new European currency, that some compensatory mechanisms should be available to Ireland if, overnight, we were caught in a devaluation crossfire without any option to help ourselves and to suggest that a common currency regime in Northern Ireland would be eminently practical and possible if it were discussed at a senior level between Prime Ministers and Departments of Finance.</P>
    <P>Those conditions are essential before we enter the full rigours of the single currency.  I reject the notion that it is a done deal.  A careful study of the matter would reveal that there is plenty of scope for making those type of adjustments.  If they were made, a single currency could be a wonderful experience for the economic development of this country.  If we progress without those or similar conditions, we would be extremely vulnerable and will face the full rigours of a very heavy loss of exports in a very short time.  We would hear speeches on the floor of the House claiming this is an export led country, an open economy and that without exports we will not survive, but suddenly we would find that we could not export because the Bundesbank would have set the rate for the ECU which we could not meet.  We would not have a currency of our own to devalue and would not be able to assist our exporters.  We would not be allowed to grant-aid them as that will be against the European philosophy and our only option will be to let them sink.  That is not a doomsday situation.  I genuinely believe that is what we are heading towards unless we put those type of conditions in place.</P>
    <P>On a more topical point, I note that in the past few days the Central Bank has intervened to prop up the Irish pound to prevent what it claims to be inflation.  That was a wrong decision by the Central Bank and a wrong conclusion.  It should let the punt slide downwards.  It has said that if it lets it slide downwards we will import inflation, but there is none to import.  I got a note from the bank this morning which states that inflation is 1.4 per cent in Germany, 1.6 per cent in France, 1.9 per cent in Belgium, 1.8 per cent in Austria and 2 per cent in the UK.  Intervening in the market and spending reserves to buy up the punt to keep it strong, as has been happening in recent days, are designed to keep down inflation and to stop us importing it.  That is a silly argument because there is not any inflation to import.  It would have been better to let the punt find its level, and I believe it would come down.  That would be a boost to exporters.  It would be a much more sensible economic strategy than the silly one in which we are engaging.  The Central Bank <Col N="326" /> should stop artificially hardening the punt because it has the opposite effect, that of sucking in imports and the volume of those imports not so much the inflationary aspect of them will increase.</P>
    <P>The transition to a single currency must be managed.  If we are following the path of a single currency, who is managing it?  Information leaflets, glossy brochures and pictures of Ministers are all very well &mdash; no better man than me when I was in office to produce glossy brochures and pictures &mdash; but they are not enough.  The transition to a full single currency must be managed and it can only be managed by the Government.  There is no sign of such management being put in place.  There are not any debates, discussions or plans to deal with exports, to bring Britain on board or for Northern Ireland.  There is no plan other than that Brussels will send the money and because we are good Europeans we will sign up for it.  That is a derogation of the Government's responsibility and I ask it to consider in a non-partisan way the statements I made.  They could prove very useful if they were taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few brief comments and to ask the Minister of State some questions.  She told us last night that this is a technical Bill.  There are 70 sections in it, probably a good deal more than we would have expected.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on whether payment systems are clearly defined under section 5?  Section 5 (a) refers to the processing and handling of securities.  Will the Minister clarify the limits that apply?</P>
      <P>Section 10 outlines the procedure where the bank proposes to refuse or approve of the rules of a payment system.  A time limit does not appear to apply to the Minister making a decision in that regard.  I presume the Minister would give a reason for such a refusal, but that is not stated in the section.</P>
      <P>Section 17 provides that the Minister may, after consulting with the bank, prescribe fees to be paid to the bank by any person supervised or regulated by it under any enactment.  The question of costs, the level of fees and whether they might be unfair to banks that are supervised by the Central Bank arises in that regard.  Other financial institutions might not have to meet those costs.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 20 Deputy McCreevy last night made a valid point about the list of powers the Central Bank will assume in terms of which are new and which existed under the Central Bank Act, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 is a technical provision to allow the Minister to transpose into Irish law the proposed EU directive on cross-Border credit transfers. That may have implications for cost competitiveness.  What are the implications under the European directive for cross-Border transfers <Col N="327" /> between the Six Countries and the South?  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>Section 22 gives authority for the formation and acquisition of subsidiary bodies by the bank subject to the consent of the Minister.  What has the Minister in mind and what acquisitions is the Central Bank likely to make?</P>
    <P>Section 23 gives legislative effect to the present position whereby the governor of the Central Bank appears before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  The governor has appeared before the committee on a number of occasions and that was a very worthwhile exercise.  I compliment him on the forthright, straightforward and open way in which he has dealt with questions and on the comprehensive overview he gave in his opening statements.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to supervise the <i>bureau de change.</i>  That will be in the interests of tourists coming here and, as the Minister said last night, it will help to combat money laundering, about which we must be concerned.  It is interesting that with the end of the Cold War and the reduced likelihood of physical combat in the European Union there are still serious issues that can undermine stability in the European Union or in individual nations, such as major crime and drug abuse.  Obviously money laundering is a very serious element in that regard and any measure that will help combat it must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 32 requires the Central Bank to publish a list of <i>bureaux de change</i> once a year and to publish a notice of any revocation of an authorisation as soon as possible.  Apart from publishing the register, how will the public know the <i>bureau de change</i> has an authorisation from the Central Bank?  For example, will the <i>bureau</i> be obliged to display the authorisation?  There does not appear to be any provision in the Bill to cater for that.</P>
    <P>On sections 35 and 36, the first of the miscellaneous sections, Deputy McCreevy made the valid point last night that they are contrary to the policy and philosophy currently promulgated that for a variety of reasons people, particularly people in receipt of social welfare, should use cheques to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter with the Minister relating to &ldquo;account payee&rdquo; as it appears on cheques.  A number of businesses made payable to the collector general for the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; a very important arm of the Department of Finance &mdash; cheques marked &ldquo;account payee&rdquo; and one person took out a bank draft for £3,000 payable to the collector general, but the accountant involved, who was afterwards charged with fraud, used the cheques to discharge his own liability to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners however followed the original owners of the cheques and the person who paid for the draft and held them liable rather than the accountant.  That may be legally in order but there is no moral justification for it.  No <Col N="328" /> ordinary justice would dictate that a person who pays the Revenue Commissioners by way of cheque or bank draft should be held accountable if a middle man defrauds him.  The purpose of section 35 and 36 is to combat fraud and protect the citizen.  Will the Minister consider the case to which I referred to ensure that an arm of the State does not penalise a person in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>Section 50 to 54, inclusive, seek to delete provisions in Irish law which conflict with Article 104 of the Treaty of the European Union, which prohibits monetary financing of the public sector by the Central Bank.  I am aware this is not the relevant Bill with which to deal with economic and monetary union but nevertheless the issue has been raised by some of my colleagues.  I share the concern at the lack of public debate on this matter outside the House.  The Minister and Minister of State have made every effort to initiate debate on the issue.  It has been raised by way of parliamentary questions and has been debated in most meetings of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  This is a major decision for us, particularly in terms of the implications in the event of the United Kingdom not joining the economic and monetary union.  Deputy Brennan referred to the problems that would arise for the economy in the Border region if we joined the economic and monetary union while the UK remained outside it.  There are different views on this matter.  Some people believe it would cause a serious problem for the economy while others believe there would have to be stability in the UK currency, that it could not afford to let its currency fluctuate.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the fluctuations in the value of the Irish pound against sterling over recent years.  I was particularly concerned when the Irish pound went to £1.05 sterling.  Some economists were predicting that it would go as high as £1.08 by the end of the year, but it dropped to parity within two or three weeks.  That fluctuation cannot be good for business.  Many of our importers are dependent on imports for their raw materials and this affects them.  On the other hand the food sector is a major employer, particularly in my constituency.  This sector has great difficulty when the Irish pound goes too high against sterling because those in that sector work with very small margins and it is a labour intensive industry.  Those issues need to be addressed and I would like to see more debate on them.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill have any effect on the credit unions?  I know the legislation for the credit unions is being prepared by another Minister's Department and there are concerns at its long gestation period.  Will the enactment of this legislation have any implications for the credit unions?  The many provisions in the Bill that will help to combat fraud are welcome.</P>
    <P>What are the implications for the Central Bank in regard to costs under the new legislation and the establishment of a European Central Bank? <Col N="329" /> Will it continue to employ 578 people?  Will the cost of administering our Central Bank be reduced significantly?  What will be devolved to our Central Bank and what will be retained by the European Central Bank?  Those are the question I wish to ask.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate and I assure them that I will give all the matters raised due consideration prior to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy suggested that the purpose of the Bill is to &ldquo;featherbed&rdquo;&mdash; his word &mdash; the jobs of officers of the Central Bank in the post-EMU period by giving additional powers to replace those he claims they are to lose.  However, only the monetary policy functions of the Central Bank will transfer to the European Central Bank and responsibility for supervising financial markets will remain within the competence of individual member states.  As I explained in my introduction, the Bill caters for the extension of the Central Bank's supervisory and enforcement powers in order to bring them up to date with best current practices internationally.  There is no element of featherbedding in that.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy also suggested that half the provisions of the Bill have no connection with the role of the Central Bank.  This is not so.  It is true that amendments are being made to a number of enactments other than the Central Bank Acts of 1942, 1971 and 1989.  These Acts themselves contain references to other legislation.  This does not mean, however, that they do not relate to the competence of the Central Bank.  Of 70 sections in the Bill, only six amend legislation which is not directly within the competence of the Central Bank.  There is a big difference between six and 50 per cent of 70 which is 35.  These six sections include such worthwhile provisions as the subjection of the Bank to the value for money audit functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the provision of protection to joint account holders in the event of flotation of a building society.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy asked if payment systems need to be regulated or supervised.  The answer is yes.  As I pointed out in my introduction, there is an international drive to standardise the supervision of payment and securities settlement systems with a view to reducing the systemic risk associated with settlement processes.  A European Commission proposal for a directive on this issue is currently the subject of discussion at both Council and Parliament in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised queries about section 22 of the Bill which provides for the Central Bank to form or acquire subsidiary bodies subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Unlike most other Central Banks, the Central Bank of Ireland does not have this right at present.  Section 22 is an enabling provision only and is restrictive in that the functions of any subsidiary company established or acquired <Col N="330" /> under its terms will be restricted to those of the bank itself.</P>
    <P>The kind of thing envisaged here would be subsidiaries to undertake overseas aid contracts, assisting foreign governments to establish Central Bank operations or the minting of coins.  I stress that the bank has no plans to form or acquire such a subsidiary at present.  The provision merely reflects a facility which other central banks enjoy and which the Government feels should be extended to the Irish Central Bank.  Deputy McDowell raised an interesting point about the possibility of the application of the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money audit to any future subsidiary of the Central Bank.  I will investigate this matter prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 35 and 36, relating to the conferring of legal status on cheques crossed `account payee only', were mentioned.  The purpose of this amendment is to make sure that if someone writes a cheque to someone else, and it is crossed, no one can have the use of that cheque between the time it is written by the payer and is received by the payee.  For example, if it is handed by the payer to an intermediary &mdash; who could be an insurance broker or a solicitor &mdash; prior to being given to the payee, if that intermediary cashes that cheque he or she, and possibly the bank which cashes it, commits an offence.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this could give rise to difficulties for recipients who, having received the crossed cheques safely, have no bank accounts into which to put them.  It should be noted, however, that according to the legal advice received from the Attorney General's office, the term &ldquo;account payee&rdquo; should not be interpreted literally.  This does not mean that the recipient or payee must be the possessor of a bank account. What is being legislated for is the protection afforded to the payment as between the payer and the payee.</P>
    <P>At present, in some cases, banks will either cash the cheque or the payee will endorse it to someone else who will pay him and subsequently cash it in the endorsee's bank.  This practice can continue under the new legislation.  There is no legal blockage which would prevent a bank cashing a crossed cheque or such a cheque endorsed to another.  It could be asserted that in the revised circumstances banks might be less likely to do so.  This is a matter for the banks and we will be discussing their likely reaction with them.</P>
    <P>On section 64, Deputy McCreevy asked which building society requested that this protection should be afforded to deposit holders.  This provision has been included at the request of the Minister for the Environment to avoid a repeat of the unfortunate instances during the flotation of the Irish Permanent whereby a number of joint account holders did not qualify for free shares following the death or marriage of another joint holder because of the order of the names on an account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> Deputy McCreevy adverted to the time it takes companies wishing to trade in the IFSC to get certification under the Finance Act, 1980.  It is not necessary for a company to be in possession of a certificate under section 39B(2) of the Finance Act, 1980, in order to commence trading operations at the IFSC.  This is considered an advantage in not delaying the start-up of operations.  IFSC companies can commence trading at the IFSC immediately after approval to establish there has been given by the Department of Finance.  It is accepted by IFSC companies that the absence of a certificate signed by the Minister does not under any circumstances delay the establishment of operations in the IFSC, nor does it place an IFSC-approved operation under any competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of economic and monetary union.  I have noted these comments but as I said, this Bill does not address the legal issues arising from the move to stage three of economic and monetary union.  Those issues will be the subject of another Bill which will be published closer to the relevant date for the establishment of the European system of central banks in early 1998.</P>
    <P>Deputies' comments on the lack of debate and excited interest in the move to a single currency are valid.  It is not that this House has not given enough time or that enough time will not be provided for debate, I am more concerned that those in our economy who should be clued into what is happening hear what is being said.</P>

      <P>There is a debate among economists and in these Houses through the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the parliamentary question system and others, but is it getting to the general public?  Are commercial and industrial Ireland plugged into the debate?  I want to hear from them, not just from academic economists.  The practitioners on the ground need to be more involved.  That is where we all agree regarding concern about not being heard as this issue is being discussed.  We have the opportunity to discuss this and the Whips will give all the time necessary but there is an unreal feel to the debate as if 1999 were two decades away and not just around the corner. That concern was expressed on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>In reference to section 32, Deputy O'Hanlon said that the Central Bank will publish the list of authorised <i>bureaux de change</i> and <Col N="332" /> notice of any revocation.  There is no proposal that <i>bureaux</i> should be obliged to display a certificate of authorisation but, as in the case of banks, they may indicate the fact that they are authorised if they wish.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon was also concerned about securities and their definition.  &ldquo;Securities&rdquo; has the normal meaning the term has in financial markets, for example where one bank agrees to give another one a certain amount of money for a set period, a condition of the second institution lodges a security to the value of the above loan with the first institution on condition that the second institution lodges a security to the value of the amount loaned with the first institution. The term &ldquo;securities&rdquo; is well known in financial markets.  We thought the term &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; was as well but we have redefined them.</P>
      <P>In section 10 I note Deputy O'Hanlon's point on a time limit to appeal to the Minister.  I will reflect on this before Committee Stage.  The same Deputy referred to section 17.  This is a standard provision which has been in existence since 1989. In practice, the Central Bank has not charged for supervision.  Neither the Bank nor the Minister wish to impose any charge which might put our market at any competitive disadvantage.  I acknowledge Deputy Sargent's contribution but time ran out before he got to the Bill.  I note his comments.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to new powers in relation to section 20.  As I said, the new powers are those which are specifically related to the bank's increased involvement with payment systems, for example in paragraphs (1), (m) and (n) of this section.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to section 21 and the cross-border credit directive.  The proposed directive is a consumer protection one which sets out the amount of a refund the customer will be automatically entitled to in the event of a payment not being completed to a third party in another member state.  This directive was the subject of a conciliation session in the EU recently.  Whatever about the merit of the directive, which is beyond doubt, what emerged from the session was the questionable merit of the system of resolving difficulties between the Parliament and the Council.  We may have to revise the co-decision making process resulting from Maastricht.  Many of us have severe concerns about the efficacy of the procedure in resolving difficulties or outstanding matters in relation to such legislation.  In terms of competitiveness, all credit institutions in the EU will be obliged to comply with the terms of the cross-border credit directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions to a long and technical Bill of over 70 sections.  Only six of the sections did not directly relate to the Central Bank so it is well named as the Central Bank Bill and not, as might have been suggested, though not seriously, as collection of amendments that could have been dealt with elsewhere.  Each section and point made in the Bill are relevant to <Col N="333" /> the secure operation of our Central Bank system and financial institutions generally in the changes coming in the important years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Last week I welcomed the change of status for St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, in this legislation.  It is a recognised college.  One change which is particularly welcome is in section 42 of this Bill which will amend the 1908 Act which restricts the use of public funding for teaching religion or theology in a constituent college of the NUI.</P>
      <P>That provision has been particularly unfortunate in the case of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  In addition to the faculties of the NUI side of the college, there is the largest faculty of theology of any college in the country in the Pontifical University.  It is literally at the side of the road as well as being at the side of the college. It has been a matter of regret to many people that students who went there to study arts or science in the NUI side could not take short or longer courses in religion or theological studies as part of their university degree.  This anomaly is shared by other NUI colleges.  It is particularly hard to understand when one considers that as part of one's studies for a BA in Trinity College one could combine Biblical or theological studies with other arts subjects.  In Mary Immaculate College, part of the University of Limerick, one can do religious studies as part of a BA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this era of encouraging those studying at third level to broaden their horizons and in a college like Maynooth which has a particular strength in philosophy, it is to be welcomed that if that college now wishes to offer courses in religious or theological studies to NUI students, that facility will be available to them.  The Pontifical University took an initiative in that area many years ago, combining theological and arts studies in the BA course in theology and arts. The NUI will now be able to do that and I am very happy that Maynooth will be the institution most affected by the proposed legislation.  I understand the academic council, the college <Col N="334" /> executive council and the trustees supported the Minister's proposals for the future development of the college.  I understand further amendments which have been agreed with the college will be tabled during the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This legislation was requested many years ago by Maynooth College, UCC, UCD and UCG, through the Senate of the National University of Ireland.  It delivers the reforms sought by the NUI Senate in 1992.  In addition, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick have requested legislation to update their operations. It is, therefore, difficult to believe that the appearance of such a Bill should be a matter of surprise for anyone.  I am confident it will be improved during its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas and I am happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While masquerading as a Bill which will give our universities the scope, structures and potential to face new challenges, the Universities Bill, 1996, will restrict, confine and constrain their freedom to do so.  This Bill represents an unacceptable onslaught on academic freedom, which is precious in any free society.  Many people in the universities were afraid that when the Minister announced free third level fees with a fanfare, this benefit would come with strings attached.  Their fears are now being realised.</P>
      <P>Most of the universities predate the foundation of the State.  The exceptions are the University of Limerick and Dublin City University established by Fianna Fáil in 1989 on the basis of the NIHEs. The universities, like the more recent regional technical colleges and other third level colleges, have served this country well.  All third level institutions have responded to social change and have been willing to have due regard to the needs of citizens and the State.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge expansion initiated by Charles Haughey and Deputy O'Rourke with the heads of universities.  I have never found any of the universities wanting in civic and social responsibility.  Like other educational institutions, they manage extremely well on a shoestring budget in overstretched facilities.  They are as committed as the State to greater equality of opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaders such as Eamon de Valera, valued and cherished academic freedom.  He established the Institute for Advanced Studies, in part as a home for extremely gifted refugees from war-torn Europe.  The great universities around the globe are not run by bureaucrats from Departments of Education or Higher Education Authorities. People working in places of higher education are the source of many of the ideas that form the basis of political, economic and social progress which we debate in this House.  However, one cannot apply a measuring tape to the universities' contribution to society.  One cannot apply time and motion studies or carry out efficiency audits on that contribution.  Universities are a magnet for much of the high technology investment <Col N="335" /> which we have attracted over the past decades. Many of our colleges and researchers enjoy international reputations of which we are proud. Those who work in that area are highly motivated, want to see the country prosper and to be at the cutting edge of advanced knowledge and to ensure we benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Universities thrive on freedom.  Many have successfully attracted large scale private research funds, particularly in recent years.  I do not see the need for tighter State interference or control, which seems to come from the Labour Party's love of bureaucracy, and perhaps a desire to increase its political patronage.  I am satisfied we are, by and large, getting value for money from our universities and third level colleges.  They have to meet the challenges of the market place, despite the large element of State funding, which will never be sufficient for all they want to do. They are best placed to judge what is required without further State involvement.  They do not need civil servants trying to second guess them at every step.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this Bill which proposes powers to suspend university charters and statutes greatly compromises the precious independence which all our colleges prize so highly.  To have their historic independence replaced by arbitrary ministerial powers, policies or diktat, is to remove something essential and fundamental.  They will not have it.  To accept such would be to play a key role in their destruction.  Let me recall for the benefit of the Minister and her colleagues what the former chairman of the Labour Party, Deputy Kemmy, said on the University of Limerick Bill on 25 May 1989.  &ldquo;The new university must have no Government or Ministerial intervention.  It must be internally democratic.&rdquo;  He went on to argue for staff and student input into decisions.  Deputy Kemmy was right; the Minister is wrong.</P>
    <P>The cavalier attitude of the Minister in putting forward these proposals which will hamper academic freedom and restrict managerial independence is extraordinary.  We expect third level graduates to finish courses not only with an academic qualification, but also with the confidence and assurance which comes from independent decision-making.  It is surely ironic that the Minister wants to hog-tie the decision-makers of our universities by giving the Higher Education Authority a more intrusive role in their planning processes.  The universities have already evolved structures and processes to deal constructively and effectively with every aspect of their responsibilities.  The Minister's aim should be to support, consolidate, properly fund and help co-ordinate their work in finding their way forward.</P>
    <P>Financial autonomy is an integral part of the universities independence.  Structures already in place play a strict supervisory role in ensuring that public moneys are spent to best advantage and are properly accounted for.  The Comptroller <Col N="336" /> and Auditor General Bill, 1993, which I introduced, and the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, are tried and tested instruments of financial accountability.  To propose that our university colleges would not have the right to determine, order and raise fees is to greatly restrict their financial autonomy and impose tight political control.</P>
    <P>The colleges have excelled in devising and implementing financial packages which have brought sizeable contracts to campus as well as private funding for new buildings and facilities. They deserve our praise for their fine efforts in that regard, and Government should support those independent efforts and the independent ethos, as Fianna Fáil has always done.  Rather than tying them in unnecessary bureaucracy and political interference, the Minister should persuade her colleague, the Minister for Finance, to give tax concessions to benefactors who want to donate major sums to our colleges.  Many fine organisations, multinationals and individuals have been benefactors for which we should be grateful. We should encourage them to do more.</P>
    <P>Why, when there are so many positive things the Minister could and should do to assist the university sector, she has decided to alter terms and conditions of employment, raise serious questions about pension schemes and pension rights, filter out democratic electoral practices and try to stifle the spirit of innovation and individual responsibility, is beyond me.  This is not just busybody politics at its best; it is political interference at its worst because it seems to come from some indefinable ideological well.  The former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, has remarked that this Bill is Thatcherite in its lack of a basic understanding of what universities are about.  That is the reason we in Fianna Fáil have decided to repeal it on our return to Government if the Government and this Minister are so unwise as to proceed with enacting these draconian powers.</P>
    <P>Many worthwhile issues are raised and many reasonable and sensible proposals are included in the Bill but they are peripheral because the core is fatally flawed.  Fianna Fáil is not simply suggesting a redrafting of the Bill, we demand a rethink of the entire basis on which it is constructed.  That is the reason I am anxious to contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>Some Bills can be introduced in this House and fundamentally changed by way of Schedules or amendments to sections, but it is our combined view that this is not one of those Bills.  Many Fianna Fáil Ministers found that Bills they introduced were fundamentally flawed and that they should be redrafted and reintroduced as new legislation.  This Bill falls into that category.</P>
    <P>I understand the reason the Minister wants to see this Bill through to the end of Second Stage, where we will oppose it.  A number of her colleagues have said it will be changed but that is not good enough.  The Minister is a sensible, intelligent and competent person but this Bill is <Col N="337" /> not one of the brightest ideas she has brought forward in the four years she has been at the Department.  She should forget about it once Second Stage is concluded, put it in the miscellaneous file of bad ideas and start again.</P>
    <P>The diversity of approach developed by our university colleges, old and new, is a uniquely Irish approach to third level education and all the richer for that diversity.  What they all have in common is a unity of purpose to give our students a quality education and a sophisticated skill base. Anything which would diminish that commitment or interfere with its natural development cannot be said to be in the national interest.  This Bill is not in the national interest.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  This is the first significant legislation dealing with our universities since the Irish Universities Act, 1908 and the first time we have had an opportunity in this House to discuss the relationship between universities and Government and where the line should be drawn in regard to accountability and autonomy.  This debate is important because 50 per cent of 17 and 18 year olds go on to third level education.  Hopefully that number will continue to grow so that all our children can aspire to third level education.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of the Bill which many people will welcome and the structural changes to the university sector proposed have been requested for many years.  They include effective independent university status for the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland, a status long merited by their achievement of internationally recognised high academic standards and their constant growth in student numbers.  The Bill also recognises Maynooth as an independent university &mdash; denied in 1908 &mdash; and gives recognition to the legitimate aspirations of various groups to be represented on the governing bodies and authorities of the various institutions.  It also allows for funding for the teaching of theology in the universities.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill for the Minister to have brought forward and the debate on it raises many interesting issues.  There is no doubt also that it has evoked much concern, but before dealing with the areas of concern I want to comment on the challenges currently facing third level institutions.</P>
      <P>There has been a major increase in participation, from 4,000 students when the Irish Universities Act was enacted in 1908, to 10,000 in 1960 and 50,000 in 1996.  There has been enormous diversity and a need for higher standards as well as effectiveness, efficiency and accountability.  Universities throughout the world are having to meet similar challenges and we have seen different reactions in various countries, an aspect I will refer to shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to university in the 1960s when they were just beginning to open up; thankfully they <Col N="338" /> have opened up even more.  There is no doubt that universities originally were the preserve of an elite but they are now central to the progress of societies where knowledge, not natural resources, geographic size or military power, is the key to national strength.  In universities people are given the opportunity to think, to learn and to understand the process of decision-making.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure on universities is enormous. Millions of pounds are being poured into them in a variety of ways and in that regard a new legislative framework is needed.  It is important that this legislation does not damage the essential autonomy of universities.  It must not curtail academic freedom or create an unnecessary level of interference in the business of universities.  We must ensure that any changes we make are sensitive to the development of this sector and that we respect and encourage the competence of the institutions and the importance of academic freedom.  That is what the Minister wants to achieve in this legislation and I look forward to Committee Stage when some of the changes that are necessary to achieve this are debated.  It is important that we get the balance right.</P>
    <P>We must support the discretion of universities in managing their affairs while demanding accountability and development in the context of national educational needs.  We cannot have a situation where universities are not connected to the needs of society.  I do not believe that is the case because major changes have taken place in our universities.  We must also have effective use of resources.  Universities must continue to ensure that more people have the opportunity to attend them.  They should be more innovative in reaching out to communities.  Universities should be places where people who have the experience of life but who may not have achieved academic qualifications in their first attempt at schooling can return.  They must be places where lifelong learning is accessible to those who did not have the opportunity when they first attended school.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider the concerns raised by the NUI, TCD and the IFUT because some interesting and reasonable points are being made by these groups.  I say that while recognising the merits of this legislation and the need for a structure that addresses the changing role of the university, the need for new governing structures and clear definitions of the relationship between Government and the universities, particularly in the area of financial accountability.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to our university heritage and its contribution to society of which we can be justifiably proud.  Our literary tradition, unique by any standards, is very strong.  Graduates from all the universities have served Ireland at home and abroad with distinction.  Universities serve the local and international community by being the cradle of critical thought.  A society without independent critical thinking is an impoverished one.  Let us make no mistake about that, because mind control has been a characteristic of all <Col N="339" /> totalitarian and fascist regimes.  The destruction of books is the symbolic expression of such an attitude.  It is very important that we maintain independent critical thinking and develop opportunities for research within universities.</P>
    <P>Research does not sufficiently inform policy here, and we need to develop a much more vibrant and creative relationship between the universities and public policy.  I have no doubt there will be tensions in that relationship, but we must ensure that research informs policy and the thinking that goes on in universities is more widely disseminated throughout society.  The marvellous research that goes on in universities and the development of thinking, whether in relation to business development or social issues, sociology, research on the family etc., does not get the wide coverage and discussion it deserves. We should encourage a greater creative relationship between policy makers and universities.</P>
    <P>Universities should not give in to the pressure to merely train people for jobs.  It is incredibly important that there be a link between what happens in universities and the economic demands of our society at any one time.  It is certainly part of what happens in universities, but it does not have to be the <i>raison d'être.</i>  The <i>raison d'être</i> of a university has to be the search for truth, critical thinking, research and training to help people to get a place in society.  The economic dimension is important, and it is one that has been ignored.  We should not move towards too narrow an interpretation of the economic role of the universities.  We have to demand that our universities operate in the real world, the real economy, and contribute to our economic development, but we must keep a careful balance.  It should not be for the Government to decide on grades or the numbers in a particular department.  Universities should decide that for themselves.  In responding to the debate I would like the Minister to say more about the framework being set by the Bill in relation to this.</P>
    <P>It is important that universities should have the right to raise and use additional funding.  From the taxpayer's point of view we have to be confident that the university centre is run efficiently and that its work adds value to the life of the nation in a wide range of ways.  There must be transparency in the way money is spent, but there must also be discretion for the universities and structures of accountability.  We must be sure the Bill supports such development with accountability but no undue interference in the life or work of the university.  The role of the universities has changed dramatically in the past 20 years.  Although there has been a huge opening up, we still have a long way to go.  I outlined some of the areas where improvement is needed, namely, accessibility and the creation of a more developed relationship between the universities and other sectors.  In modern times universities <Col N="340" /> impact in all sorts of ways on social, cultural, political and economic life, and the existing framework needs to be updated.</P>
    <P>The Bill has three main strands, restructuring of the National University of Ireland, provision of revised governance structures and a framework for interaction between the universities and central Government.  It also provides for accountability generally.  Each has to be welcomed as necessary, but there must be a balance.  We need to continue to discuss this Bill in committee to ensure that we get the balance right.  Many countries have grappled with this, and mistakes have been made where there has been undue interference.  This has had disastrous results in that research has been inhibited, morale in the universities has sunk low, and they do not now deliver what they were set up to do because the structure around their development has not been right.  This has happened in some American universities.  We must be careful not to do that here.</P>
    <P>The record of the universities and their contribution has been very good.  They have given many people an opportunity to develop their potential and have contributed to society in a unique way.  We must create a framework that does not unduly interfere with the work of the universities, that builds in accountability and supports their development into the next century. The universities should reach out to those who have not had access to them and their research should be linked to the real needs of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the requirements of accountability and transparency which are declared to be one of the objectives of this measure, I should declare an interest as a graduate of Dublin University and a lecturer in Trinity College, at present on leave of absence from that institution.  I am sorry to disappoint the Deputies opposite by making it clear that we do not believe this Bill should go to Committee but should be rejected in this House.  It may be rejected in another forum, but that should not be raised here.</P>
      <P>Regarding the third objective of this Bill, accountability and transparency, I will begin with the extraordinary public statement by the Higher Education Authority on the authority of the chairman and under his name and his secretary dated 29 October 1996 in a newspaper advertisement taken in the national press under the heading &ldquo;Proposed University Legislation&rdquo;. In the final paragraph of a very extensive statement issued by the Higher Education Authority it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transparency and accountability in the affairs of the universities must clearly be key principles in safeguarding the public interest in its financial investment in universities.  The Higher Education Authority operates in a financial accountability framework which has been developed in accordance with accepted and internationally applicable best practice. <Col N="341" /> Within that framework, contrary to misleading impressions given, a university budget and the allocation of funds to the various activities within that budget are matters for determination only by the university authorities.  The role of the HEA, in accordance with its statutory functions, is to allocate between the universities, in accordance with clear objective criteria, such funds as are made available by Government and to ensure, in accordance with public financial policy, that deficits are not incurred.  The Higher Education Authority believes that this process has worked well, with a satisfactory outcome for both the universities and the State.  It has not sought and would not wish that any change in this process would be reflected in the legislation.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary statement made by a statutory body, acting under the aegis of the Minister which plainly states, so far as the third purpose of the Bill is concerned, that the Bill is not required.  The body which is charged by legislation of this House with advising the Minister on these matters said the present arrangements are working well and that there is no need to change them.  For that reason alone my party opposes that measure.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether public funds had been applied in respect of the publication of this statement in the national newspapers in which the Higher Education Authority states it does not need the guidelines provided for in section 33 as the present arrangements are working well.  Section 33 has detailed provisions for reporting to An tÚdarás, which refers to the Higher Education Authority.  There is a clear provision that guidelines can be issued under subsection (9) which states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás may, from time to time, after consultation with any or all of the chief officers of the universities, issue guidelines relating to the proportion of the budget of a university to be applied to the different activities of the university.</P>
    <P>That is a controversial subsection and has already been referred to in the debate.  The Minister is introducing a Bill providing for this extensive measure of bureaucratic control over the universities and the body which is charged under legislation with exercising the control says it does not need this legislation.  That is the clear import of the statement issued by the Higher Education Authority.  Perhaps that section will disappear on Committee Stage because the Minister has said there will be amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the fundamental objectives is declared to be accountability and transparency.  When the body established by a Fianna Fáil administration many years ago has satisfactorily performed that task I do not see the need for this legislation. Accountability and transparency were not invented in the life of this nation at the last general election.  Many institutions were <Col N="342" /> established down the years to so provide and if they are working well there is no need for legislative change or to waste the time of the House on this measure.</P>
    <P>In relation to the first declared objective which is to establish the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth as constituent universities of the National University of Ireland, no Member would object if that was the wish of the colleges. I am confused as to why this metaphysical entity, the National University of Ireland, will continue to subsist following the enactment of this legislation.  Are we leaving ourselves open to ridicule in providing that there are four universities which are one university at the same time.  This is somewhat redolent of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity in theology where there are three in one and one in three, a matter on which theologians have argued for centuries.  As a matter of legislation and as a matter of our own repute is it in order for us to provide that a university can be a component part of a university?  I will not tax the Minister with that aspect of the Bill because I accept she is following the counsel she received from the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the governing authorities and the attempt, in effect, to provide a standardised legislative framework for the universities, while there was a demand from the universities for clarification of their status, there was no public demand for the clarification of the status of Trinity College, Dublin, or Dublin University which is the degree granting body.  As a matter of common courtesy &mdash; perhaps the Minister will deal with this in her reply &mdash; I do not understand why the measures refers to Trinity College as Trinity College rather than as Dublin University. After all the Constitution refers to that body as Dublin University, so too the legislation providing for the election of Members to Seanad Éireann.  As a matter of courtesy a body should be called by the name it calls itself, though it has lent itself to some confusion in this area in the past.</P>
    <P>There is substantial opposition to the Bill not only in Trinity College but throughout the component colleges of the National University of Ireland.  It is clear the staff in all the constituent colleges and the Fellows of Trinity College, other than St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and the National University of Ireland, are most unhappy with the measure.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the Minister bringing in this Bill which provides for all this interference and detailed regulation where none was sought or asked for when she could have introduced a short simple Bill providing for the establishment of the constituent colleges of the NUI on an independent basis as there was a demand for that. If the Minister had taken that course of action rather than all these detailed provisions she would be treated in the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland much the same as <Col N="343" /> Queen Elizabeth is treated in Trinity College and would be remembered for a long time in those entities.  Instead of taking that course of action the Minister &mdash; I accuse her of ideological influence in this regard &mdash; has gone down the road of attempting to provide in great legislative detail for many matters which were best left to the universities.  These matters were left to the universities when the Higher Education Authority was established.  I am not aware of any demand to change that arrangement.  After Queen Elizabeth the person who most endowed Trinity College was the founder of my party, Éamon de Valera.  When a decision was made after the last world war to provide a public subvention towards Trinity College he met the leading authorities in the college and agreed that the intellectual freedom of the institution should be respected, that it should be allowed to evolve in its own way and that State funds would be accounted for in the proper and normal way, as they have been ever since.  There was no demand for a revision of the governing body of the college.  Since then the governing body has changed dramatically in that it now has student representation.  However, that student representation will be reduced as a result of this measure.  There is a democratic election of the chief governing officer in Trinity, the Provost is elected by the staff of five years' standing.  On one reading of the Bill, that position will be eroded. There is a greater collegiate control, if I can draw a comparison between Trinity College and the Vatican, by the Fellows over the affairs of the college.  The chief officer, the Provost, will be given more powers so that the Bill is a drift towards a presidential system of Government. There has been no demand for any of this.  I fail to see why this is required as it has generated a great deal of unease in the universities.  There are suspicions of a 1984 type agenda on the part of Labour who are trying to control the universities and ensure they are good nurseries of their own ideas.  From what I have heard to date, if that was the objective it has failed.  If anything, the Minister is doing enormous damage to her own party's support in these institutions.</P>
    <P>Despite the assumptions in the Bill, the international standing of Irish universities and graduates is high.  We should be careful about enacting any measure that interferes with that standing or the repute that our degrees carry throughout the world.  The National University of Ireland, Dublin University and the other new Irish universities, in a short time, have established themselves as major innovators in the educational world.  This Bill sends out all the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>The unit cost of our universities is about half those of universities in the United Kingdom. Standards are monitored by external examiners from different countries.  Staff publications are constantly refereed by international experts and research funds are raised in the face of international competition.  Accounts are prepared <Col N="344" /> by eminent firms of accountants with the highest certification to prevent theft, fraud and the misapplication of funds.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is also involved.  Entry to our universities is determined by the CAO.</P>
    <P>Given that universities have this high standing, where is the requirement for this single measure applying to all Irish universities?  The Bill assumes there are problems of accountability and transparency which require drastic Government intervention, the dismissal of provosts and presidents, the suspension of governing bodies and the suspension or removal of staff.  There has been no public concern about any of those issues. However, this measure has been brought here as a matter of urgency on the eve of a general election, when we in this House have been pressing the Government about a range of vital and urgent legislation.  I will not trespass into those other items of legislation and I accept many of them are not part of the Minister's area of responsibility.  Nevertheless, Government time is being wasted on a measure for which there is no substantial public demand.</P>
    <P>Provost Mitchell of Trinity College, Dublin, stated &ldquo;Universities must stand as centres of independent thought, free without fear or hindrance to pursue truth, to question and criticise established orthodoxies, to create and express ideas and to communicate knowledge&rdquo;. The controls and interventions in this Bill are seen as an attack on the principle of university autonomy.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will very fairly say that she who pays the piper must call the tune.  However, that is the whole reason for the existence of the Higher Education Authority.  It has done a good job and there is no need to change it.  Is the Minister satisfied the Higher Education Authority has done a good job?  If she is, it is a very short leap of faith for her to say there is no real requirement for this Bill.  The Higher Education Authority is saying it has done a good job, although I accept that has to be subject to an external check, and does not need any new legislation.  If the Minister accepts it has done a good job we should respect its wishes on the matter for once.  It has experience of dealing with these institutions and trying to accommodate their requirements within an overall financial requirement.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons, I ask the Minister to look at the Bill again in relation to the governing authorities of universities.  Of course, there is a need to look again and again at the governing body of any institution as important as a university.  The governing bodies of our universities evolved in different ways.  The governing bodies of the NUI colleges and their overall structure were devised in the 1908 legislation, which might need to be revised or changed.  However, that should be looked at on its own merits.  The same principle should apply to Trinity College, Dublin, and the new universities in Dublin City and Limerick.  If <Col N="345" /> changes are required to ensure greater student participation in the governing bodies of those institutions and a greater gender balance on their boards, that should be done.  However, there is no reason the Minister cannot do that in consultation with those universities and ensure the necessary changes take place on an individual basis in those universities.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of trying to devise an ideal administrative type for all the universities is fallacious.  The constitutions of those bodies have evolved in different ways.  What staff and students are comfortable with and what is required in the public interest &mdash; I accept there is public interest in this matter &mdash; has to evolve over time.  The Minister could negotiable with the different bodies.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in tandem with this legislation a private Bill should be promoted by Trinity College, Dublin, to provide for the necessary changes which the Minister is seeking. However, I gather there is a great deal of unease in the college about a private Bill because of the manner in which the debate on the Universities Bill has proceeded to date.</P>
    <P>I am open to the idea of change in governing bodies.  However, it is a great mistake to try, as the measure does, to impose a new form of government on each university.  I do not agree that is the right way to proceed in this matter. The Minister should look again at what is appropriate in terms of each individual university. Given the reputation of those institutions, the least they deserve is to be considered on their individual merits and if the Minister has reservations about some aspect of their government she should communicate with them so that an appropriate formula can be worked out.</P>
    <P>The government of Trinity College, Dublin, with which I am familiar, has evolved over hundreds of years.  Originally, the power was vested in the provost and the senior fellows.  It was then democratised to include the fellows and eventually to include staff of five years standing in the election of a provost.  It is not unlike the evolution of the parliamentary system of government in that it took place over many years.</P>
    <P>There is always room for improvement in any system of government.  However, it is not fair for the Minister to say to any institution that she has gone back to first principles and decided the best form of government for each university.</P>
    <P>I also have reservations about another aspect of the Bill, which the Minister might think is a rather curious objection.  I am unhappy with section 11 which states &ldquo;The objects of a university shall be...&rdquo;.  The whole point of the universities in the intellectual life of our nation is the idea of intellectual freedom, the staff engaging in research and giving the benefit of that research to students in the form of advanced teaching and the idea of scholarship.  That cannot be encapsulated in one section of a Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> It is almost presumptuous for this House to state the objects of a university.  In the old days before the Iron Curtain fell, governments in those lands dreamt up such sections for their legislative instruments as appropriate for the satellite states of their collectivist empire.  However, in order to see the modern thinking and approach one only has to look at the studies conducted for the National Economic and Social Council on the central importance of innovation in developing our social and economic life.  A section in this Bill outlining the function of a university is not very innovative.  It is an attempt to put the universities into an intellectual framework, a straitjacket, which nobody has requested.</P>
    <P>These institutions have developed a high standard of which we are all proud.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to look again at this Bill and to consider whether the university colleges in Cork, Maynooth, Dublin and Galway could be put on an independent foundation, as they wish to be.  The Minister might make her name in history on that basis.</P>

      <P>Probably.  A universities Bill has been long sought by the universities.  Initially I did not understand the need for the Bill but it received a broad welcome from many people. This is one of the reasons I am amazed at some of the remarks now being made by university commentators.  It is probably another part of the debate I find difficult to comprehend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will give individual NUI colleges and Maynooth University a legal standing which is more in line with reality by making them independent and autonomous.  It will also bring the University of Limerick and DCU, which were previously national institutions for higher education and regulated by the State in a different way from other colleges, more into line with other universities and colleges and put them on the same statutory footing.  More importantly, it will set the relationship between the State and universities on a proper footing.  It is questions about what the proper footing should be and the appropriate balance between institutional autonomy and accountability to the citizen who pays the bill which have generated the heat about this matter.  While this heat may come as a surprise to some people it is no surprise to politicians who have received many <Col N="347" /> representations on this matter.  However, this heat has thrown very little light on the argument.</P>
    <P>A high proportion of university funding comes from the State.  This involves a significant public interest dimension which must be protected in any new legislation.  The Opposition's argument in this respect is flawed.  There is huge public interest in how universities operate in terms of the students who are accepted and how they are treated and also how the staff, particularly female staff, are treated.  This interest is shared by all the groups concerned with universities &mdash; students, staff, the State, taxpayers and the public generally.  The interests of all these groups must be acknowledged and protected.  There were some genuine concerns about the Bill but most of these should have been allayed at this stage.</P>
    <P>Opposition to the Bill has come in the main from a narrow focus of opinion within the university sector.  It may well be that the leaders of universities do not subscribe to all that has been written on their behalf.  I have not heard them deny what has been written and maybe it is time they made their positions clearer.  A particularly offensive element within the chorus of opposition has been the implication that universities are somehow being penalised for the financial misdemeanours of other sectors. Universities are not lily-white in this area.  Some weeks ago a newspaper report referred to a funding body which found it necessary to apply a financial penalty to a university in order to bring it into line with acceptable practice.  I assume I will never get the full information but I would like to know what happened, where it happened, how often it has happened and why a body which is regarded as conservative deemed it necessary to impose this penalty.  It is very difficult to obtain this information when dealing with a sector which has been autonomous for 400 years.  This is one of the reasons I do not understand the Opposition's argument about the need for openness and transparency but no need for change.  This worries me.  The Bill does not provide any greater financial controls of universities than those which already exist in the Higher Education Authority legislation.  It is widely acknowledged that those powers have been used in a fair manner and with restraint.  I am not aware of a call by any college for those powers to be diluted.</P>
    <P>There has been a self-congratulatory note in some of the comments made.  Universities have done an extremely good job since their establishment and they have served the country very well.  They may not have served the people I represent very well but they have done a good job and given us eminent historians, politicians, accountants and doctors who have contributed to society and ensured that Ireland has been recognised internationally.  They have provided a third level education for a huge number of students and have dealt with the many changes in society, sometimes in very difficult circumstances. Having said that, they have been very slow to <Col N="348" /> introduce changes in many areas.  It is only in recent years that they have started to develop serious initiatives to combat inequality and improve access for groups which were not previously represented.  The older universities in particular have been loath to modernise structures and introduce aspects of course design which offer greater flexibility to students.  If courses were offered in modular form this would be of benefit to workers and those who cannot attend university on a full time basis and greatly increase the number of part-time students. Distance learning has been available in other countries for many years but it is still at an experimental stage here.</P>
    <P>Universities will gladly seek co-operative links with universities in the USA, Europe and outer Mongolia but they are notoriously slow to co-operate with one another.  It is very difficult to get co-operation between UCD and TCD or between the universities and regional technical colleges where there is a natural link.  I do not understand how giving universities more autonomy will improve the position.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the opposition to the Bill has come from TCD sources.  There is no outsider on the governing body of TCD, which was extremely reluctant to accept any change.  It is an insult to our intelligence for any university to claim that a 400-year-old charter is perfectly adequate as a basis for running a complex institution into the 21st century.  Even under the new legislation, external representation on the board will be minimal and much too small to make any meaningful difference.  This matter can be teased out further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The universities are arguing for as much autonomy as possible.  This is perfectly understandable, but they are mixing up two distinct concepts &mdash; academic freedom and institutional autonomy.  While the two concepts are related they are not the same and it is intellectually sloppy to argue as if they were. There is not, and never has been, any suggestion that academic freedom is being in any way affected by the legislation.  The best protection for academic freedom is a robust, transparent system of accountability.  Dangers to such freedom arise when accountability is seen to break down and public trust is undermined.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that conditions and entitlements of staff will be arbitrarily changed by the Bill.  The Minister made it clear that this is not the case.  The claim was made by Deputy Martin and assurances of this kind, whether written or verbal, have never stopped the Deputy from such scare tactics.</P>
    <P>The key issues which need to be grappled with were set out fairly and clearly in the recent statement from the Higher Education Authority which points out that there have been major changes in higher education &mdash; and in the social and economic environment within which it operates &mdash; over the past 30 years.  It also states that the transition from elite to mass, higher <Col N="349" /> education and the very high level of public subvention to the universities are key transformations in our society.  Nobody disagrees with this.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority statement goes on to make clear that the critical relationship between higher education and economic and social development is also achieving wider recognition, as is the necessity for provocative innovation to increase levels of participation from those groups which, heretofore, were under-represented. Major issues of public policy in these and other areas, and a very substantial investment of public money, require a recognition of the public interest in new diversities and the appropriate mechanisms to ensure responsiveness and accountability.  This is the approach we are all taking to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority statement stresses the importance of a certain critical distance between universities and the State. Nobody would argue with this.  However, it makes the crucial point that this autonomy does not exist in a vacuum, nor can it.  Universities do not exist in a vacuum.  They are not isolated from society and they cannot behave as if they were.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to establish the proper balance between institutional autonomy and public accountability.  Universities are not State bodies and their governing authorities are not appointed by Government.  The primary relationship between universities and the State is expressed through State funding and it is here that the appropriate accounting mechanism must be focused.  For this reason the provision in the Bill to allow the sacking of a chairperson of a governing authority by the Minister of the day was not appropriate and I welcome the Minister's indication of her willingness to drop it.  This is right because there is a balance to be struck here.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated her willingness to review the section dealing with the suspension of a governing authority.  However, it is vitally important that the power of financial sanction should be retained.  In this regard I ask the Minister to clarify remarks made in her opening speech where she appeared to indicate that this power might be reduced.  The power of financial sanction is for a funding body acting on behalf of the State and its citizens.  It would an abdication of responsibility to the taxpayers to weaken it in any way.</P>
    <P>I wish to see some changes as certain sections have too much detail for general legislation.  The Bill provides that a university may have a charter. This should be strengthened so that all universities shall have one.  If this is done, much of the detail can be incorporated in the charter for each college rather than have it cluttering up the Bill.  This would also strengthen the concept of diversity of institutions, which is an important dimension of our third level system, and make clearer the principles which the Bill seeks to assert.</P>
    <P>However, if the details remain, a number of issues must be addressed.  These include the <Col N="350" /> provision for election, and not merely the appointment, to governing bodies.  This must be retained.  In addition, the level of student representation is too low and gender equality provisions, not just for attenders but also and especially for the staff, need to be strengthened. I know of several cases in universities where women are finding it extremely difficult to get permanent appointment and are losing out to their male colleagues who may not be as well qualified.</P>
    <P>There is much work to be done on the Bill. However, we are going in the right direction and suggestions for change will be made on Committee Stage.  The fundamentals of the Bill are sound but there are areas which need to be changed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, if only because it gives the House a chance to look at the contribution of our universities, not just to education but to the broader, economic and cultural life of the country.  However, I regret that the Bill has occasioned so much controversy and opposition, which could have been avoided by the Minister if she had been consistent between what she proposed in her position paper of last November and what she is now proposing in the Bill.  In addition, she should have consulted more widely with those involved, given that the Bill proposes sweeping changes that affect not only the terms and conditions of employment of university staff, but also seeks to impose a more authoritarian regime on the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware this was an inquisition.  Perhaps the truth hurts the Labour Party on occasions.  There is never anything to be lost by consultation, especially, as in this case, where significant and sweeping changes are proposed to the Bill.  In this case the Minister has ignored her own dictum on transparency and accountability and has hidden behind her programme managers and departmental officials. Against this background how can she convince the House that this Bill is worthy of support when she is not confident enough about it to debate the issues with those who will be affected by its provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will fundamentally and directly change the character of how the universities are governed.  On Second Stage the Minister stated that, in part, the Bill follows some submissions from the Senate of the NUI.  I am sure she was <Col N="351" /> impressed with what the Senate said, but she did not say that it also encouraged her to ensure that universities should not be required to relinquish their educational objectives and ethos.  The Senate stated:</P>
    <P>...the long-term intellectual strength and quality of the NUI constitution universities, and their value to society, are dependent on a degree of autonomy which guarantees that academic decision-making is based on professional expertise and sound disinterested action.</P>
    <P>The response also stressed that the fora for public accountability is already in place and that it was &ldquo;the considered view of the NUI Senate that the proposed additional controls are inappropriate for inclusion in new legislation.&rdquo;  I am sorry that the Minister was not sufficiently impressed by these parts of the NUI submission as she was with others.</P>
    <P>The NUI and other interested parties have much to say about this Bill, but unfortunately most of it is negative.  From a legal viewpoint there are so many vague and inconsistent provisions in the Bill that any good lawyer &mdash; I do not profess to be one &mdash; could ride the proverbial coach and four through it.  I refer here to the ways in which the Bill affects existing contracts, university statutes, university charters and so on.</P>
    <P>In his speech last week, Deputy Martin pointed out a number of these legal anomalies.  As he suggested, they represent a challenge to the way in which employment is currently organised and a breach of faith with those who currently work in, and administer, our universities.  Because of time constraints I will not repeat them this evening, I will merely make one general point. The Minister has chosen to approach these issues in an arbitrary and draconian fashion.  She has ignored the unique place our universities have in our society and how they can be used in partnership, not in conflict, with the Government to improve and enrich our society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister defends her actions on the basis of ensuring the accountability of our universities for the public moneys they spend.  I agree with this objective, but these powers already exist under the Higher Education Act, 1971 and the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  Why is the Minister trying to impose this new type of regimentation on our universities?  Why is it necessary to reinforce the Higher Education Authority if all we want to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy behind me is well able to answer for himself.  Why is it necessary to reinforce the Higher Education Authority if all we want to do is encourage university presidents and provosts to continue the work they engaged in long before a rainbow appeared on the political horizon?  Given the legislation that is already in place, these new powers and structures are not necessary.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is proposing does not amount to accountability.  She is advancing a scheme to ensure that the Higher Education Authority will have an overriding say in all matters relating to our universities and, as the Bill stands, the universities will have no come back. Who can say these draconian powers will not be abused?  Will the exercise of the HEA's powers be subject to review?  That is not provided for in the Bill.  The underlying purpose of the Bill is to create a structure that will not only undermine the independence of our universities, but deny each their unique roles.  It will create a regimented structure which will not allow diversity and create a system that will ensure our universities will have to kow tow to the Higher Education Authority on an ongoing basis and, more worrying, to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Minister has reserved so many important powers, such as the dismissal of university presidents, for herself. These sweeping powers must be vigorously opposed.  Section 18 is another example of a megalomania with which the Bill is infused.  To add insult to injury, in dealing with a serious matter such as this, it is the Minister's advisers who are claiming it should be the Department of Education and not the Government who make these decisions.  They are interpreting the so-called <Col N="353" /> stated reasons for justifying such a course of action.</P>
    <P>All these proposals have important implications for the independence of our universities and for academic freedom.  The concept of academic freedom is central to the role of the university and I am sure Members on all sides would agree with that.  That concept is severely threatened by what is proposed here and we will table amendments on Committee Stage to ensure there is a right to academic freedom and that the concept of tenure, with which it is associated, is explicitly protected in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 9(1) outlines the circumstances in which universities can be established.  Why are these new creations to be decided by the Higher Education Authority.  Surely it would make more sense to draw on the experience we already have in our existing universities to advise on these new creations.  The Minister will not accept that.</P>

      <P>The Minister, and her departmental officials, want to keep all matters within her Department and its extension, the Higher Education Authority.  The Higher <Col N="354" /> Education Authority may present itself as separate from the Department, but it is not.  This is underlined by the convention of appointing outgoing or former secretaries of the Department of Education as chairpersons of the Higher Education Authority.  While I am sure this convention has been useful in the past, departmental secretaries do not have such a monopoly of knowledge in this area as to make their appointments a foregone conclusion. Despite the pretence to the contrary, they do not have a divine right of succession and the convention should be halted.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Martin stated last week, Government policy on universities should be proactive and not confrontational.  The Bill is begrudging towards our universities which I can only assume is based on a determination to curb their individuality, potential and spirit of enterprise.  That same spirit of enterprise which the Minister would rein in and control has been particularly evident in recent years in the success our universities have attained in raising development funds from the private sector, independently of the Minister, the Department and the Higher Education Authority.  The powers the Minister has allotted to herself for scrutinising these initiatives will not encourage universities to develop their private fund raising initiatives.</P>

Unfortunately, the Minister does not have that support for this Bill.

      <P>It is timely to realise that areas still exist where access to third level education is restricted.  This major legislation is timely for our seven great universities and puts their autonomy and development on a firm footing.  I hope it will enable them to offer educational facilities in the future to the areas I mentioned, which unfortunately did not receive them in the past. There has been a massive growth in third level education and this is meritorious.  However, the House must put an end to the vicious inequality which continues to exist in this sector.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Defence Forces Policy: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Michael Smith on 5 November 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Minister for Defence for his failure to articulate a coherent policy on Defence matters particularly in regard to the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the reduction in numbers serving in the Defence Forces, having regard to security requirements in the Border areas, United Nations and elsewhere;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the necessity to strengthen the Air Corps and Navy to deal more effectively with fishery protection and drug interdiction;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ignoring the concerns expressed by Army wives in relation to conditions for soldiers serving in the Border areas;</P>
    <P>&mdash;failure to be honest about barracks closure;</P>
    <P>&mdash;lack of concern for spouses and children of deceased soldiers who did not opt for the Spouses and Children's Pension Scheme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;delay in recruitment and changes in the scheme with regard to age qualification and lack of recognition for the contribution made by young FCA members; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;confusion in the VER scheme and failure to review the five year contract scheme.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for Defence and the Government for the <Col N="360" /> substantial progress achieved to date in implementing a balanced programme of reform in the Defence Forces; for the Minister's personal commitment to a process of full consultation with the military representative associations; notes the Government's commitment to the recruitment of 1,000 persons to the Defence Forces over a three year period commencing in 1996 in order to address the age profile problem; notes the introduction of the VER in 1996 at a cost of £16 million following consultation with the representative associations; and pledges its continuing support for the Minister's policy of a partnership approach to developing the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps with a view to enhancing operational capability.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>An indication of the gravity of this matter is that this is the second occasion in six months Fianna Fáil has been obliged to table a private Members' motion to address the serious problem in this area.</P>
      <P>I support the motion in the name of our spokespersons, Deputies Michael Smith and Power and endorse the statement made last night. Because of the time constraint that applies I will not go through the points raised in it.  I will deal with the position in the Border area.</P>
      <P>I agree with the president of PDFORRA when he stated he was concerned that the Army did not know it would be involved in the prevention of the spread of BSE until after the IFA knew.  It is deplorable that the Army was not informed of that before the IFA, the media or anybody else. He also complained about the long hours involved, an average of 72 hours per week.  The allowance for that work is approximately 30p per hour after tax.  I ask the Minister to address that matter.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Border units operate under strength.  Will the Minister check the workload of men and women in the Southern Command, in the 27th and 29th battalions and compare the conditions in terms of Border allowance and duty money?  I understand those on duty money find it much more beneficial than the allowance for Border duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 October I asked the Minister for Defence his plans to increase the number of soldiers serving in the Border area in view of the increased responsibility, to improve their conditions and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The reply was that it is not the practice of the Minister's Department to give precise details of the number or position of troops <Col N="361" /> serving in the Border area or any changes relating to those matters, that the situation is kept under continuous review and changes are made in the light of operational requirements.  It also stated there are no proposals at present to alter the conditions of service of personnel serving in the Border area and that changes are not being made in the light of operational requirements.  If they were made men and women would not be asked to work an 80 hour week and nobody would have to spend 24 hours on duty.  The Minister must be condemned for being dismissive in stating that he had no proposals to alter the conditions of service of personnel serving in the Border area.  I appeal to the him to seriously consider the position and to reconsider that.  Morale is low in the Army. Army wives are genuinely concerned.  They see gardaí rightly rewarded for their splendid work in preventing the spread of BSE.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to provide proper accommodation for Army personnel.  In Castleblayney there are plans for a new Army barracks but to date only a new officers' mess has been erected.  I ask the Minister to ensure building proceeds on that new Army barracks.</P>
    <P>The FCA unit in that area is working out of two portacabins.  That is not good enough and I ask the Minister to address it.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Army who has served us well at home and abroad and we can be justly proud of it.  Nowhere has it served us better than in the Border area, particularly during the past 25 years.  There is an obligation on the Government to look after it properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important motion tabled by Deputies Michael Smith and Power.  As Deputy O'Hanlon stated, the motion embraces all major issues of concern to members of the Defence Forces and to all others who recognise the importance of having a proper Defence Forces structure and sufficient personnel at all times.</P>
      <P>The commitment by Deputy Michael Smith that Fianna Fáil on its return to Government will bring forward at an early date a White Paper on defence policy is welcome and very important.  A Government statement outlining a long-term strategic plan for the Defence Forces is long overdue and would be welcomed by all Army personnel.</P>
      <P>In previous debates initiated by Fianna Fáil in private Members' time Deputies on this side of the House outlined in detail the wide range of activities covered by the Permanent Defence Forces ranging from service abroad to mercy missions at home.  All too often the diversity and importance of those activities is not fully appreciated by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a strong and sound Army tradition in my constituency.  I know generations of families in my county who have given and continue to give dedicated and loyal service to this State.  Many members of the Defence Forces <Col N="362" /> from my county have served with great distinction on difficult missions abroad.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government has always demonstrated the need to provide ongoing investment in the provision of adequate facilities for members of the Defence Forces.  Our party in Government in 1988 placed a contract for the construction of the new Army barracks in Cavan town, Dún Uí Néill, and the provision of that barracks ensured that the members of the Defence Forces stationed locally have the most up to date facilities available.  It is an excellent headquarters for the 29th battalion.</P>
    <P>The presence of the Defence Forces is of enormous social and economic value to the towns in which they are located.  The people of Cavan and Monaghan realise the crucial importance of those barracks.  The personnel based there play an important and positive role in their local communities.</P>
    <P>Last night my colleagues Deputies Michael Smith and Dermot Ahern and tonight Deputy O'Hanlon spoke about the very low morale in the Defence Forces.  Many members of the Defence Forces and their families expressed concern about the lack of understanding and commitment by the military authorities, the Department or the Minister to resolve many issues.</P>
    <P>It was brought to my attention recently that members of the Defence Forces who took part in a special operation from January to May 1993 have not yet been paid their allowance in respect of those duties.  Some members worked in excess of 110 hours per week on it.  One member who left the Defence Forces some years ago has not yet been paid the allowance due to him in respect of that operation.  It is disgraceful that should occur.  It is not good enough that any arm of the State allowed that to happen to people who carried out their duties in a diligent and conscientious manner.  It shows disregard for the efforts of those people in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>During the past number of months soldiers have yet again been deployed on Border duty, their hours are extremely long and their workload is excessive.  The Border allowance, or the inconvenience allowance as it is known, is not nearly adequate to reward those soldiers for their efforts in difficult conditions.  It must be demoralising for any member of the Defence Forces to put in such long hours and obtain such little reward.  The Border allowance must be reviewed and substantially improved.  Some weeks ago Fianna Fáil raised this matter on the Adjournment when it was pointed out very clearly that the treatment of those people is just not good enough.  The members to whom I spoke have had no work or income since September last and the Department's offer to bring forward payment of part of their gratuity is not satisfactory.  Those people served the State well and now their treatment is totally unfair.  I ask the Minister to have this position remedied so that the people involved receive the entitlements they have earned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan which is fully supported by the military authorities has its roots in the efficiency audit group's examination of the Defence Forces &mdash; I am saying now what I said in response to the motion last May.  Not alone is Fianna Fáil recycling motions, we are forced to repeat ourselves in response.  The problems confronting the Defence Forces, including ageing personnel, layers of red tape and spending imbalance did not arise today or yesterday and the Government is aware that they cannot be solved overnight.  Full implementation of the plan may take about ten years.  The key point is that the pace of change will be managed.  The Defence Forces are faced with new demands in a changing world, yet their structures and organisations have remained largely unchanged since the foundation of the State.  No organisation as active as the Defence Forces could continue indefinitely without facing the type of change that is necessary, and the Defence Forces are as aware of that as we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 many of the problems facing the Defence Forces were highlighted in a report prepared by Mr. Dermot Gleeson.  While that report focused on pay and conditions it also recommended that a thorough review be conducted of the Defence Forces organisations and structures.  We are all aware that Fianna Fáil's preferred response to reports and recommendations of this nature is to leave them to gather dust.  The hands-off school of Fianna Fáil politics has not served Ireland well and would certainly not benefit the Defence Forces as they prepare for the challenges of the 21st century.  Modern times demand modern responses and that is as relevant for the Army as for any business.  The review of the Defence <Col N="364" /> Forces is designed to equip them to meet the challenges not only of today but also of tomorrow.  The alternative to the plan is to sit back, do nothing and hope the problem will disappear of its own accord, but that will not happen.</P>
    <P>The Government is not prepared to follow in the footsteps of Fianna Fáil's passive philosophy of government.  We are already paying the price for that in many areas too numerous to mention. Fianna Fáil's response to the implementation plan can be summed up in one word: scaremongering.  I have seen the results of that, as have Deputies in all parties, with people coming to us who are desperately worried about their future and full of notions that have been put out as facts.</P>

I notice that an attempt is made to resurrect this lie in the motion before us.  They also peddle the myth that the implementation plan will result in a shrinking of the Defence Forces when they know &mdash; this is what I find most offensive &mdash; that 1,000 people will be recruited to the Defence Forces this year to redress the age imbalance.  The new structure will have a total strength of 11,500.  These facts are well known to Fianna Fáil, yet it comes up with these old myths.</P>

We must recognise that the Defence Forces have not only given of their time and energy but at times have put their lives on the line for this country.  The Defence Forces are not only a national but an international asset.  They have served with distinction in difficult circumstances not only at home but in places ranging from the Congo to Lebanon.  Too often the Defence Forces serving outside our country's borders do so in an aggressive capacity.  Ireland's Defence Forces have always served abroad in a peacekeeping capacity, a tradition of which each of us is very proud.  The new structure and organisation will enable us to fulfil our peacekeeping and humanitarian commitments more effectively.  It will allow us not only to maintain but to expand our activities under the umbrella of the United Nations and the OSCE. Our Defence Forces have served this country well and they deserve better than to be made political <Col N="365" /> playthings of Fianna Fáil who does not appear to have anything else to discuss.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to speak on this motion.  I wish to address my comments principally to one aspect of the Defence Forces, the Naval Service which has a particularly important role to play in my constituency of Cork East, but first I wish to make a few general remarks about the motion.  This is the second week in a row that Private Members' time has been used in a cynical electoral fashion by Fianna Fáil.  Last week we were treated to a motion against road tolling from a party that introduced such tolls.  It is no wonder Deputy McCreevy was unable to defend his and his party's position on television on Monday evening.  This week's motion is little better and will carry little weight with the public.  It is no wonder they have grown cynical of politics when politicians are so cynical.</P>
      <P>Times have changed.  The electorate have had their fingers burned and will not have the wool pulled over their eyes by this kind of politicking. I note that in moving this motion Deputy Smith indicated that his party would bring forward a White Paper on the Defence Forces within a year of returning to office.  Such a statement begs a smart response, but I will refrain from making it. I fail to see what the difference is between a White Paper and an implementation plan as proposed.  Does Fianna Fáil believe that just because it enters office all existing problems will be resolved by the mere publication of a White Paper?  If so it is living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, standing still is not an alternative; it rarely is.  It is completely disingenuous of Fianna Fáil to continuously suggest that there will be barracks closures.  The Minister stated that there will be no such closures and until I see evidence to the contrary, that is good enough for me.</P>
      <P>Since I represent a Cork constituency, the plight of the Naval Service is of great concern to me.  The motion suggests the need for the Naval Service to deal more effectively with fishery protection and the fight against drugs.  Very few of us would have qualms about those sentiments. It would be wrong of me to undermine the great work done by the Naval Service.  In the past year the success in the fight against drugs importation conducted by the Naval Service has received a great deal of media attention.  The recent huge haul in Cork harbour is but the latest example. Even tonight a ship is being searched in County Cork.  I pay tribute to those involved in this work.</P>
      <P>I have listened to various Deputies, particularly party colleagues, speak about the horror of drug abuse in our cities, particularly Dublin.  They are correct in suggesting that we must do everything in our power to stem the flow of drugs on our streets and the Naval Service has a huge role to play in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> As the Minister outlined yesterday evening, seven ships are currently in operation.  There is a case for increasing the number of ships.  For instance, not all seven ships can be at sea at the same time and they have to protect an extremely long coastline.  This is currently imposing a huge burden, not only on the ships but on their workforce.  The oldest of the ships, the <i>LE Deirdre,</i> has been in service with the Navy since 1972 and must be due for replacement.  In many cases sailors face three weeks of continuous service at sea and are then allocated duties upon returning to port.  While that may be satisfactory for single men, it is clearly onerous for married men with families.  It compares very unfavourably with the conditions of personnel in the merchant navy or ferry services and it must be looked into.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the first round of the general service recruitment component of the reorganisation plan is under way.  This move has been facilitated by the success of the voluntary early retirement scheme. This is good news for the Defence Forces. Recruitment is essential to preserve the vibrancy of any organisation and the Defence Forces is no exception.  The age profile of the Defence Forces has been skewed for quite some time and this requires tackling.  I congratulate the Minister on his success in this area.  I also wish to put on the record my belief that recruitment should be ongoing.  This is of particular importance in the Naval Service where training takes considerably longer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the action taken by the Minister to improve the quality of our Defence Forces.  He is correct that we cannot afford to stand still.  The Defence Forces continue to be worthy of our investment.  We are entering into new territory <i>vis-à-vis</i> our international responsibilities. Whatever decision we make in this regard, a professional defence force will be an essential component of it.</P>

All this sound and fury and sabre rattling is a cover up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for prompting me.  It is a smoke screen to hide the fact that the Deputy is unwilling to come to the House and <Col N="367" /> engage in a constructive debate to help our Defence Forces.  Nobody should fear honest criticism.  The Deputy has been very mischievous in this debate.  He has attempted to throw a smokescreen over the whole debate.  Deputy Smith knows that he and other Deputies from his side of the House welcomed the Price Waterhouse report.  Fianna Fáil welcomed this report more than anybody else.</P>
      <P>We have nothing to fear from any report.  My only regret is that the report was not extensive enough to cover the Garda Síochána as well as the Defence Forces.  I would put the Garda in first of all.  Deputy Smith supported that review, as I did.  None of us should be afraid to look at the workings of any State body, whether it is the Army, Naval Service or Air Corps.  If we are not afraid there is no reason we should run away from the findings of any report that comes before the House.</P>
      <P>We live in a vastly changing world and our Army is in the front line of that change in far flung foreign fields and in dangerous war zones. We had British garrisons here a long time ago. There were garrisons in my city for 800 years. King John's Castle was built in 1210.  That it was right in 1210 does not mean it is right today.  It is time to look at the role of our Defence Forces in the context of the world we live in.</P>
      <P>To listen to the Opposition speeches tonight one would think we were about to abolish the Defence Forces.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  No one will be forced out of our Defence Forces.  People will be allowed to retire &mdash; the numbers speak for themselves &mdash; on a voluntary basis without any questions from anybody.  Consultation will remain the key note throughout.  I am not here tonight to say that the Army is beyond criticism; that would be foolish. The object of this debate should be to make our Defence Forces more effective and efficient.  If we do that we will have done a good day's work.</P>
      <P>I, more than anybody, respect the dedication and loyalty of our Defence Forces.  Throughout difficult times the Army has been loyal to the State and stood firm.  It has done difficult, dirty and dangerous work, not only in Ireland but in other countries.  It has guarded our Border.  I do not regret the Army guarding the Border in recent times during the BSE scare.  That was an emergency.  We had to call upon the Army and we were served in a very loyal way.  The Army is also involved in the moving of money and in peacekeeping duties overseas.  The involvement of our Defence Forces in foreign activity has been good.  Our personnel are working closely with bigger, better equipped armies, and it has been beneficial for them.  They have gained in stature and experience because of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having praised the role of the Army in our society in a broad way, it would do the Army no service tonight to bury our heads in the sand and pretend it cannot improve.  Of course it can improve.  The reality of a changing situation <Col N="368" /> cannot be ignored.  There is a marked difference between age groups in the Army.  People in this House have called it Dad's army but I would not use that phrase.  There is no reason to laugh at somebody who is no longer young.  Their experience can be valuable.  There is an imbalance in the age structure of the Army and anybody who says otherwise is not telling the truth.  If we have an open and honest debate in this House the Army will benefit from that.  If we have a dishonest debate it will serve no purpose. We cannot treat the Army as some sort of marginalised sector of our society.  The Army is in the front line in the mainstream of our society. That fact must be faced in any debate on the Army's role for the future.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Opposition might say, there is widespread acceptance in the Army, from top to bottom, of the need for change.  The Army leadership is made up of enlightened people. They are mainly men who have worked their way up through the ranks and have served abroad at a very high level of responsibility.  They have no ulterior or sinister motive in regard to the changes which will come about in the Army.  They are there to do a job, to serve the Army as best they can.  Anyone who suspects them of having any hidden agenda or sinister motives is wrong. There is no uisce faoin talamh here.  There is no hidden agenda on this.</P>
    <P>We have to examine all our structures.  The Air Corps and Naval Service must come under similar scrutiny.  Their role must also change to face new challenges such as drug trafficking and other criminal activity.  The three strands of our Defence Forces must also be given higher profiles.  Better, more relevant training must be provided for young people entering the forces. This debate and the change that is taking place must be seen as a challenge, a new opportunity for young people to start careers in the Army. The Defence Forces must give them better training and welcome them in.  The Irish say &ldquo;Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí&rdquo;&mdash; praise the youth and they will respond.</P>
    <P>There is no reason we should downgrade our Army.  If Members keep talking about bad morale, people might believe it.  That is no incentive to young people taking up new careers. To say that morale is bad in the Defence Forces serves no purpose whatsoever.  It is a good career and we should encourage people to take up any chances they have.  We must be more positive and let the Army become more community oriented and more creative.  There is no reason we cannot give the Army a far higher profile in our society. To do that would be to serve the best interests of the Army.  I will now share my time with two other Deputies even though I have lots more documentation and have many more points to make.</P>

It is a great honour for me to address this issue in the House because in 1989 there was tremendous unrest in the Defence Forces and I benefited from an Army wife standing for election in my constituency.  The margin by which I was elected probably reflected that fact and the major party lost out as a result. That is why I remember that election.</P>
      <P>I congratulate our Defence Forces for the marvellous job they are doing, not only in patrolling the Border but in dealing with the BSE crisis.  It is a very difficult job.  We also have 775 soldiers serving abroad with the UN.  They serve this nation and the peacekeeping forces of the world extremely well in 18 countries.  They do justice and honour to us all in that service.</P>

      <P>I am hopeful we will move forward and the Minister should look at the numbers involved.  There are about 200 widows who have missed out on the pension scheme through no fault of their own.  Their husbands opted out at the time and the wives did not know. They were left high and dry when pension time came for them.  There are about 1,600 soldiers still in the Defence Forces who have opted out of the scheme.  Deputy Higgins should suggest to the Minister that those 1,600 people should be approached again and asked to join the scheme. If they want to opt out, as in other circumstances, they should sign to do so but I would add this provision to the opt-out form: that their spouses should also sign it.</P>

      <P>Obviously Deputy Power does not want to hear the truth and he must have no concern for widows when he is not interested in hearing the case espoused in this House.  It is strange to see recruitment mentioned in this motion.  Looking at the recruitment figures, in 1991 when there was a Fianna Fáil Minister, 22 were recruited to the Army.  In 1992, 51 were recruited.  In 1993, three recruits were taken into the Defence Forces and in 1994, 500 were taken in.  Many would say it was because of the Labour influence in Government but they were recruited nonetheless.  In 1995, 60 were taken into the Navy and this year 200 will be recruited.  In 1997 and 1998 400 will be recruited.  It is, therefore, hypocritical of Fianna Fáil to criticise this Minister and Government in relation to recruitment for the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly said there will not be barrack closures.  It is not on the agenda but has been raised in many areas of the country by politicians and aspiring politicians.  We must <Col N="371" /> accept the Minister's word.  When a Minister gives a categorical assurance, as in the case of Columb Barracks in Mullingar, that a closure is not contemplated, we must accept it.  However, there are politicians who will not accept that and will continue scaremongering and upsetting people. Those people are wondering what is in the future for them.  The message coming out clearly is that there are no Army barracks closures contemplated and we should accept that.</P>

Deputies Bertie Ahern, Dermot Ahern, Seán Power and Michael Smith and I had a lengthy meeting with Army people and a deputation of Army wives. They had genuine worries and to rubbish those worries as the Deputy did is sad.</P>

      <P>I am honoured to speak on this issue as I have done on many occasions.  I have constantly defended the Defence Forces in Government as a member of Cabinet and in Opposition and I will continue to do so.  I will assert the right of my party or any other in Opposition to bring matters to the floor of the House.  Those on the other side of the House have spoken as if the Opposition did not have the right to bring an issue to public notice.  The <Col N="373" /> Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, did not develop the points in his speech last night.</P>
      <P>I wish to address two items in this motion, the lack of concern for the spouses and children of deceased soldiers who did not opt for the spouses and children's pension scheme and the delay in recruitment and changes in the scheme as regards age qualifications and the lack of recognition of the contribution made by young FCA members. I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on Army widows.  The answers to those questions were interesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 200 Army widows whose husbands or spouses did not opt for the pension scheme in 1978 or 1985.  I followed that up and asked if a precedent had been set by a previous Minister for Defence in granting Army pension rights to an Army widow whose husbands did not opt for the pension scheme for widows and families.  I was told a precedent was set in February 1986 in relation to five widows and four children, to whom the Department granted pensions.</P>
      <P>I then tabled a further parliamentary question asking if the Army had told other widows who had not been given pensions they could get them by producing a doctor's certificate saying their husbands were not of capable mind to opt for the pension.  The response was that it did not inform the other dispossessed widows that they could get pensions by producing a doctor's certificate stating that their spouses were not capable of making the decision.</P>
      <P>This is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that a precedent was set in relation to five widows.  Although these widows produced medical evidence, no other widow was told that she had the right to do so.  If any of these widows have the money or if a case is made on their behalf, they have a clear case to get their widow's pensions.  I urge the Government to tackle the long running scandal of the forgotten Army widows.  Successive Governments have failed to address a grievous wrong perpetrated on a vulnerable group of women, which sadly diminishes each year.  Army widows now number about 200.</P>
      <P>In 1978 and 1985 inadequate explanations of the pension scheme for spouses and dependants were given to serving soldiers.  There was little attempt to explain the case to Army members or their wives.  The men were gathered together and the facts were given to them in military and legal jargon.  No counselling was given nor was there any follow up explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I heard the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, say he was a member of a party and a Government of inclusion which sought to include, not exclude anyone from this marvellous inclusive Government.  Deputy Lynch espouses the cause of disadvantaged women but she bolted from the House after she made her cheerleader's <Col N="374" /> speech.  I wish she would take up the cause of Army widows instead of bolting from the House after giving three hurrahs to the Minister for Health one week and the Minister for Defence the next.  Every Minister gets the thumbs up from Deputy Lynch.  What a sunny disposition she has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not fault her character, but it is a pity she does not fight for the Army widows as she does for other women.</P>
      <P>The replies to the parliamentary questions show that in February 1986 a precedent was set in which five Army widows got pensions and I am glad they did.  That legal precedent must be taken up.  I want an open case with all documentation being made available, including the letters which passed from the then Minister and successive Ministers to the five widows, the basis on which the doctors certificates were produced and the terms of those certificates.  There must not be any more hidden agendas about this matter.  These 200 women have been denied their proper rights to their spouses' pensions.  This is supposed to be a Government of inclusion and it should see fit to give these voiceless women their rights.  They are living in various parts of the country including Athlone, Mullingar, Cork and Limerick but they are not a cohesive group; there is not any representative body taking up their case in a coherent fashion.</P>
      <P>Until I received a reply to my parliamentary question I was unaware that precedents had been set in February 1986, but if I had known I would have moved much sooner in regard to this matter. I admit successive Governments did not give full consideration to this case.  We are told that money is flush now and if that is the case, these women deserve their proper rights.</P>
      <P>The age limit for Army recruitment will now be reduced to 22 and if one is a day over the required year one cannot be recruited.  The previous recruitment age limit was 27 but persons older than that could be admitted if they had FCA service.  That provision has also been removed in the current recruitment campaign.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment with the Minister, Deputy Barrett, and he gave me an undertaking that he would review the age limit for recruitment after Christmas.  The age limit should be raised to 25.  Who can say that a person is old at the age of 25?  There are many young people with enormous potential who would greatly enhance the Army and add lustre to what is regarded as a fine career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Army for the work it is doing and for its commitment and integrity.  In light of the parliamentary replies I have received I appeal to the Minister of State to examine the precedent set and bring this case to Cabinet so that these 200 forgotten women can get their proper entitlements.  I intend asking the Minister and the Minister of State in writing to make <Col N="375" /> public the full disclosures in regard to the precedent set.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to some points made by previous speakers.  Deputy Lynch seems to have lost her sense of direction because she did not understand the reason people were engaging in scare mongering.  She did not believe there was any reason for Army personnel to be concerned.  Deputy Lynch must not be living in the real world, even though she lives in close proximity to Collins Barracks in Cork.  I saw a wry smile on the Minister of State's face when Deputy Lynch made her contribution.  It is now accepted that Fine Gael have three, not two, TDs in Cork North-Central; they must be very happy that Deputy Lynch joins their ranks on every occasion.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Rourke said, she is a beaming light shining down on them and supporting them in everything they do.</P>
      <P>It was a meek mannered Deputy Kemmy who contributed to the debate this evening.  When he came into the Chamber I expected an explosive contribution but he appears to have had a conversion on the road from Limerick.  He merely told us to have a healthy debate.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil does not have a hidden agenda. Genuine fears are being experienced by Army personnel and that is evident from the difficulties in getting personnel to travel abroad.  I have questioned Army personnel on this matter and they have told me about their fears for the future. They do not know where they are going and they do not trust the Government to look after them.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the reason Deputy Kemmy said Fianna Fáil was in agreement with the Price Waterhouse report.  That report called for the closure of 17 barracks and Fianna Fáil did not support that.  On that question, the Minister said there will not be any closure of barracks during the lifetime of this Government.  That is an important statement.  I recall the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, when he was Minister for Defence, stating on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that barrack closures would take place but before the day was out there was a total reversal of that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give an example of the reasons Army personnel are concerned about this matter.  There are 180 personnel in Ballincollig Barracks in Cork to whom voluntary early retirement has been offered.  What will happen if major redundancies occur in the Army?  If the Minister is criticised for reducing personnel in a barracks by 50 or 60, he will simply say that the Army hierarchy are the people responsible.  There is no long-term future <Col N="376" /> for many of our Army barracks because of the course of action being pursued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Recruitment is now taking place on a five-year basis but at the end of that five years there is no guarantee of continued employment.  Does the Minister expect me to believe that these young people will be happy that they have a career in the Army?  They will be constantly wondering whether they will be kept on or let go when their five-year term is completed.</P>
    <P>The age limit for recruitment is extremely important.  The Minister of State will recall that last week this House discussed equality in employment.  Age was put forward as being a major issue in terms of equality in employment. Is the Minister of State telling the House that a person of 25, 28 or 30 years of age cannot do as good a job in the Army as a 22 year old?  On the one hand the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has introduced equality legislation while, on the other, his Cabinet colleagues are taking action that goes against that equality.  That is ironic and totally incorrect.</P>
    <P>An issue that is causing major concern is unpaid early retirement.  Last August people were told there was no more money available and if they did not sign up by 1 September they could forget about it.  People were railroaded into signing up for unpaid early retirement but in October money was suddenly found for approximately 50 more personnel.  That money was paid to people who had not taken voluntary unpaid retirement but to people who refused it, many of whom were left without social welfare from 1 September to this day when I raised the matter here.  The Minister will provide £1,500 now and another £1,500 at Christmas.  It would be fairer to admit that incorrect information was given, to apologise for that and to redress the situation by ensuring that their voluntary early retirement payments will apply from 1 September, not from 1 January. They deserve no less.  It would not cost much but it would create much goodwill among people who have served this country well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My party and I are glad this issue is being debated in the House, and we support the motion.  It is time we had a debate on defence policy or the lack of it.  Any serving soldier of any rank in today's Army would tell the Minister that morale in the forces is at an all time low.  Never, since the foundation of the State, has it been as low as it has been during the past year.  There has to be a reason.  There appears to be a total breakdown in communication between the Department and those serving in the forces at all levels.  Because of that, and because changes are proposed one day and reneged on the next, there is gross uncertainty as to the future of any serving soldier.  It is sad that any country should downgrade its Defence Forces in this way.  Ireland has good reason to be proud of the manner in which her Defence Forces have served her at all times since the foundation of the State.  They are <Col N="377" /> getting a shabby return for their honourable service over the years.</P>
      <P>There has been no serious thinking on defence policy since the Emergency during the Second World War at a time when Ireland faced a real and unpredictable external threat to her sovereignty and independence.  Since then we have been content to let things happen and to muddle along.  Our approach has lacked coherence.  We have had a number of reports on the structure of our Defence Forces, the most recent being the Price Waterhouse report from which the efficiency audit group made its recommendations.  However, as is characteristic under this Government, we are always one report away from action.  We have policy documents on many other areas of public life &mdash; this Government has a genius for bringing forward lavishly produced documents setting out the national policy on foreign affairs, broadcasting, education, industry and a host of other areas.  We have developed no policy on the future of the Army.  That is not to the credit of the Government.</P>
      <P>We are less than four years away from the turn of the century and we have no clearly defined defence policy to take our country into the changing circumstances of the new Millennium. This is inexcusable.  It is grossly unfair to those currently serving in the Defence Forces.  In addition, it does little to enhance the status of the Army as a career for many young persons who might deem it an honour to serve their country as a member of the Army or the Naval service. There is a tendency to treat serving soldiers as if we were still living in the middle of the 19th century.  There is huge uncertainty, for example, about those serving in the Defence Forces under the new five-year contract.  Some of these people have now served for two years and they are still unclear about the status of their current contracts and the criteria that will be used to determine which of them will be retained for promotion and those to be exited from the Army.  That is no way to treat a workforce.  One would not get away with it in any other area of the public service.  It seems to be good enough for the Army, and that is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is huge uncertainty also about the basis on which the soldiers are serving.  People need to be told which barracks are to be closed and which are to be retained, irrespective of how close or far away the next election is.  Soldiers are citizens like everybody else.  They have families, mortgages to fund, mouths to feed, bills to pay. They have the same right as any other person in the public service to know where their career is taking them and where they will be in five years. It is a scandal that they have been denied that right.  Surely they should be entitled to put forward their own case.  They should have some say in negotiating conditions for themselves, but they have never been given a hearing.  That also is a scandal.  Like any other young citizen, young soldiers should be given some understanding of <Col N="378" /> where their career is taking them and a say in the development of their career.  That has been denied them.</P>
    <P>I give my solid support to the passionate plea made by Deputy O'Rourke on behalf of Army widows.  How we treated Army widows was a disgrace.  I am constantly told by Government Deputies from my constituency that the country is awash with money.  It is a fact that there is more money in the country now than there has been at any time since I became interested in politics, and that was a long time ago.  There is money from Europe and buoyancy in the Exchequer.  Are we waiting until these women die so that we can send a sympathy card?  The numbers are small but their need is great, and it is an indictment of our priorities that proper provision is not made.  It is not as if this has not been asked for; it has.  I endorse what Deputy O'Rourke said &mdash; she has raised the matter on a number of occasions &mdash; if something cannot be done in the current climate of buoyancy in the Revenue, when will it be done?  I make a strong appeal to the Minister of State, if he brings no other message, to bring this one to the Minister for Defence on behalf of the Army widows.</P>
    <P>In preparing for this debate I did not read the Minister's speech in great detail.  To get some insight into this area, because this is not a subject on which I often speak, I read a publication by the Department of Foreign Affairs entitled, &ldquo;Facts about Ireland&rdquo;.  That booklet identified four key roles for our Defence Forces as follows:</P>
    <P>To defend the State against internal aggression, to assist civil power, to participate in UN peacekeeping missions, [I wish to digress to pay tribute to our soldiers who have served and continue to serve abroad with courage and distinction with the UN forces], and to provide a fisheries protection and drug interdiction service as well as a variety of miscellaneous other duties.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the booklet which deals with defence did not mention the concept of Irish neutrality.  We cannot have a comprehensive view on the future of the Defence Forces until we have a rational debate as to where we stand in terms of neutrality and where Ireland proposes to position herself in the next century in a vastly changing Europe.  We owe it to the great contribution our Defence Forces have made not alone to the domestic situation but to the cause of world peace to debate in this House the whole issue of neutrality and to do so now.</P>

This is a rerun of a similar drum beaten by Fianna Fáil in recent months to which it did not get the required response.  For political expediency and in order to engage in a scaremongering campaign it tabled the same motion for Private Members' time after <Col N="379" /> the expiry of six months.  We have been through all this before.  How many times has the Minister for Defence to inform the House and the people of the importance of the Defence Forces review and the Government response thereto?  It is galling to hear the Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil talk about Army widows in 1986 and in 1987.  A selective thought process has been brought to an art by Fianna Fáil in recent times.  Is Deputy O'Rourke serious in shedding crocodile tears about what happened in 1986-87?  Where was she from 1988-94 when the question of Army widows was on the agenda?</P>

      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Flanagan carrying on in that fashion because usually he speaks to the subject matter.  During the past 15 years I have had the honour of representing the constituency of Cork East.  The naval base in Cobh is four or five miles from my home.  After assuming office in the 1980s Fianna Fáil invested heavily in the Naval Service because we recognised the need to upgrade it.  That investment continued for a number of years.  It has become clear in the past number of years that there is a great need for further investment in the Navy in two areas, first, by recruiting new members because the number has fallen from 1,300 to 1,000.  Hardly a day passes when I do not have inquiries from the Cobh area concerning recruitment to the Navy.  I realise there will be some recruitment in the next week or two but there has been no significant recruitment in the past two years.  It will be necessary to have a large intake to the Navy in the next year.  Second, there must be investment in new boats and ships.  Of the fleet of seven ships which are ageing the number at base at any time is way above the percentage that should be there.  An inordinate amount of repairs and maintenance must be carried out on these ships and there is a need for investment in equipment which is not often in dry dock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for investment is greater than ever because the role of the Navy has changed significantly over the years.  It is involved in greater fishery protection needs, drugs and arms interception, search and rescue, pollution control, monitoring of the coastline and of the seas in the European Union zone which makes up 16 per cent of the EU area.  Will the Minister say if EU funds for the purchase of ships for the Naval service will not be made available because the EU Commission consider the manpower is incapable of running the fleet of seven ships?  I am pleased to note the Minister will respond, perhaps by letter, later.  It is time a decision was taken to fill the manpower requirement in the Navy and that funds were available to provide proper ships so that the Navy can perform the duties entrusted to it.  Another reason for a full complement is that sailors could take time off to be at home with their families.  I am aware of sailors, out at sea for weeks on end, who cannot take their leave because of the shortage of <Col N="381" /> numbers and this is causing problems in families. I ask the Minister and the Department of Defence to take note of this.</P>
    <P>Other colleagues have expressed concerns regarding the rumours about barracks closures.  It is all very well to say there will not be any closures; people believe within their souls there will be closures.</P>

The former Minister, Deputy Coveney, in one of his first interviews said on radio there would be barracks closures.  Following a public outcry, he changed his mind within 24 hours and said that no barracks would close during the life time of this Government.  That episode, more than anything else, highlighted the lack of an overall strategic plan for our Defence Forces.  So much for long-term thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EAG accepted the analysis of consultants Price Waterhouse that the permanent Defence Forces age profile was too high, that there was an inappropriate top management structure, that the operational effectiveness was impaired by too many small units which are too geographically dispersed, and that there were too many military personnel engaged in duties which could be undertaken by civilians.  To address this the EAG made a number of recommendations.  These included a policy of continuous recruitment, a severance scheme and the employment of <Col N="382" /> additional civilians to undertake non-military tasks.</P>
    <P>In relation to recruitment, the Government has decided that 200 recruits will be enlisted on 13 December this year.  If memory serves me correctly, that recruitment drive was announced five or six times by the Minister so he had to deliver at some stage.  While I am disappointed at the small number, it is a step in the right direction.  Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, promised 1,000 new entrants into the Permanent Defence Forces during the first three years of the plan.  I hope this happens. Since it took so long to recruit 200 I doubt if that promise will be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Minister has on a number of occasions expressed his satisfaction at the success of the VER scheme and the huge interest shown in it by members.  While I can understand the Minister's satisfaction at achieving the target, I am not so sure I agree with him on why it was so successful. I meet Army personnel every day and there are many and varied reasons why people applied for the VER.  The lucky ones had job offers, more had become disillusioned with the job and some felt they had no option but to apply for the scheme.</P>
    <P>While the Minister said last night that no pressure was put on anyone to apply for the scheme, the truth is there was considerable confusion over the issue.  That point was expressed by many delegates at the recent PDFORRA conference in Waterford.  The category &ldquo;C&rdquo; personnel felt they had no option, given that the EAG report stated the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces was impaired because there were too many medically unfit personnel.  Those people saw the writing on the wall which is why so many of them applied for the scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the major criticisms in the Price Waterhouse report was that too many personnel were engaged in housekeeping duties.  It proposed that civilians should be taken on to do those tasks.  The objective was to have a defence force which was properly structured, well equipped and capable of meeting its roles in the most efficient and effective way.  In other words, Price Waterhouse said too many members were carrying out duties more suited to civilians and that civilians should be employed to do those jobs.  That would ensure more members were available for operational duties, which sounds like a very sensible and logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Government's action on the EAG's recommendations is obviously not having the desired effect.  There are now fewer people in our Defence Forces and they are being asked to carry out more functions than ever before.  Fewer members are available for operational duties, yet the Minister tells us it is the Government's objective to have a leaner, fitter organisation with an enhanced operational capability.  If that is what the Government wants it will have to change its policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> There is a serious imbalance between expenditure on pay and that on infrastructure and equipment.  There is no commitment from the Government to reinvest the savings resulting from the VER in equipment and infrastructure. This is vital if we are serious about reforming and reorganising our Defence Forces.  The indication so far is that this Government has no intention of carrying out the necessary reforms.  It has simply become a cost cutting exercise.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of hot air and criticism of our tabling this motion.  However, if we were honest we would admit that the most contentious decision which will arise from the reform of our Defence Forces will relate to the closure of barracks.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister to keep repeating there will be no closures during the first three years of the plan.  The Minister knows it is not possible to have Defence Forces with an enhanced operational capability under the present system. We are talking about the long-term future of our Defence Forces and it is important to honestly admit that to them.</P>
    <P>Speakers have been very critical of Fianna Fáil tonight.  However, the Minister's record is not one of which he can be proud.  When the first lot of recruits were given five-year contracts the Minister referred to them as the yellow pack brigade.  He has now brought in a similar operation in which soldiers are being recruited under the same conditions.  We all now accept that is not a proper way to conduct business and it will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> We were very critical on this side of the House of the lack of consultation between the Minister and the representative associations.  He criticised us at that stage for scaremongering and said it was not the truth.  The truth is that it was only when the representative associations sought the resignation of the Minister that he realised how serious the problem was within the Defence Forces.  He then decided to take action and instead of talking to the associations he began to listen to them.  I am delighted that change has taken place.</P>
    <P>The FCA, which has given tremendous service, celebrated its fiftieth anniversary this year.  There was no recognition from the Department of the role played by the FCA or the contribution it has made.  The Army apprentice school in Naas, which has done tremendous work, celebrated its fortieth anniversary this year.  It was a big occasion but the Minister or the Minister of State did not attend that celebration.  They have shown a distinct lack of interest in the Defence Forces and it is little wonder morale is so low.</P>
    <P>The Minister is presiding over a crisis in the Defence Forces and the irony is that he is not aware of this.  Morale has never been so low and there is great uncertainty about the future. Members of the Defence Forces and their families are very concerned about this issue.  They have made an enormous contribution but unfortunately it has not been fully appreciated by the Government.  Real reform of the Defence Forces will not take place until the Government is replaced.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Humanitarian Crisis in Eastern Zaire.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for attending the House to reply to this urgent matter.  Will he respond immediately to the request by African leaders at their summit yesterday for the rapid deployment of a neutral force in eastern Zaire to help the 1.2 million refugees who now face famine?</P>
      <P>This is a significant development.  The African leaders indicate that they do not have the capacity to put together a peace keeping force. The establishment of a humanitarian corridor is required in eastern Zaire to provide sanctuary for the refugees.  This can only be done if a political, military and humanitarian operation is now launched by the EU and the UN.  A ceasefire is now in place and the three largest humanitarian organisations, the UNHCR, the International Committee of the Red Cross and <i>Medecins San Frontiers,</i> together with some of our own organisations in the area and the EU Commissioner, Emma Bonino, whom I know to be a very committed humanitarian, have called for a military intervention.</P>
      <P>A multinational peacekeeping force should be immediately deployed along the Zaire-Rwandan border and the EU should be centrally involved in such a mission.  Ireland has a distinguished reputation for supporting human rights internationally, and is respected throughout the world as an honest broker.  However, the response of the Government to this crisis is less than satisfactory.  At this critical time we are well placed to give real leadership to the EU, but sadly we have not done so.  Some of our EU partners, such as France, want intervention, however, Rwanda's Tutsi army does not consider France to be neutral.</P>
      <P>Who is giving leadership to the EU?  Sadly it is not Ireland.  Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs initiate an EU and political and military intervention in this crisis and co-ordinate it under the umbrella of the UN?  Ireland should indicate its willingness to participate in such a mission.  Will he lead a troika of EU Ministers to the region, and include Kigali, Zaire, Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania.  The message from the troika should be that the EU will assist now.</P>
      <P>The EU needs to be present in the region.  The Irish Presidency of the EU should co-ordinate those African countries that can get involved in military peace keeping.  The South African President, Nelson Mandela, has said the EU can count on his Government responding positively to any initiative.  In addition, the EU should contact President Clinton to seek US logistical support and involvement in the peace effort.  The involvement of the US is critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 1.2 million refugees face hunger, disease and death unless immediate action is taken.  They must be rescued.  The task of saving them cannot be left merely to an EU special envoy.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs must now face up to his responsibility as President of the EU Council of Foreign Ministers and immediately co-ordinate a <Col N="387" /> major EU political, military and humanitarian operation in the Great Lakes region of Africa. This means leading the EU Foreign Ministers to the area.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste rightly referred to the need for EU involvement in the Middle East.  We heard speculation about whether we should go to Orient House.  While that would be admirable, our greatest priority should be to place an EU presence in the region because we are talking about saving hundreds of thousands of lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Kitt on raising this matter.  While I might disagree with some of his comments, it is important to have an opportunity in Dáil Éireann to reflect on what is potentially a human catastrophe in the Great Lakes region.  I will outline to Deputy Kitt and his colleagues what we have been doing in the context of our European Union Presidency.  We have been following with deepest concern the further deterioration of the position in eastern Zaire.  The Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for development co-operation, Deputy Burton, and myself have been engaged in active consultations with EU colleagues, the United Nations, the UNHCR and African leaders in the Great Lakes region on possible ways through which an end can be brought to a conflict which has the potential to lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.  I also had direct consultations with the UN Secretary General, Dr. Boutros Ghali, who briefed me on developments in the Security Council and on the role of the newly appointed UN Special Envoy, Ambassador Chretien.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency has been, and continues to be, fully engaged with our European partners and the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, in an intense round of contacts with regional leaders on a possible way forward.  Following discussions in Kigali, Rwanda, Zaire and Uganda last week, Special Envoy Ajello attended, on behalf of the Union, the summit of regional leaders on the crisis in eastern Zaire which was held in Nairobi yesterday.  He did so at the request of the Presidency and partners who have given him an additional and specific mandate to support efforts to resolve the crisis in eastern Zaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and our EU partners welcome the outcome of yesterday's summit as a further positive step towards the realisation of a framework within which the crisis in eastern Zaire can be resolved in a peaceful and humanitarian manner.  The regional summit has given strong support to calls made by the EU and other members of the international community for the implementation of a full and immediate ceasefire to facilitate the intensification of diplomatic efforts to achieve lasting peace.  The summit also strongly supported the establishment of safe corridors and areas of sanctuary inside Zaire with an appropriate protection force, to <Col N="388" /> facilitate humanitarian assistance and the repatriation of refugees.</P>
    <P>At the Nairobi summit the regional leaders called on the Secretary General of the UN to take urgent measures to ensure the establishment of safe corridors and temporary sanctuaries for refugees by deploying a neutral force.  They called on the Secretary General of the Organisation of African Unity to work closely with the United Nations towards the realisation of this objective and to follow closely with the implementation of this decision.  The summit affirmed the readiness of the sub-region to make its own contribution to that effect.</P>
    <P>These positive proposals made at the Nairobi summit are under active consideration by the European Union as part of its ongoing support for the efforts of regional leaders and the Organisation of African Unity to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  They are also under active consideration by the UN Security Council in New York where they will be discussed further today in informal consultations. The outcome of the Security Council's consideration of the issue should provide the broad framework within which a concerted international response to the crisis will be situated.  As EU Presidency, Ireland will maintain close contacts with the United Nations in New York, the Organisation of African Unity and the regional leaders on the progress of this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government supports in principle the idea of the deployment of an international humanitarian protection force or monitoring presence in support of a solution to the crisis in eastern Zaire.  However, such a force would have to be accepted by both sides to the conflict and seen as impartial.  Efforts aimed at the establishment of such a force must, therefore, be seen in the context of the need to get the agreement of all Governments concerned.  It is clear that such agreement is not forthcoming at present.  Continued efforts will have to be made to bring this proposal to fruition in an agreed and impartial manner.  At the same time, we must continue to pursue the present priority for the European Union and the international community, the establishment of a workable ceasefire which will facilitate political dialogue between Rwanda and Zaire and the provision of urgently needed humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>In its approach to the crisis in eastern Zaire, the European Union will strenuously seek to create the earliest possible opportunity for peaceful dialogue between the parties concerned while at the same time addressing the volatile and distressing humanitarian situation.  This reflects the Union's recognition that the humanitarian and political aspects of the crisis need to be addressed together in a comprehensive manner. We will seek to ensure that the necessary conditions exist for essential humanitarian tasks to be carried out as quickly as possible and for the process of dialogue to proceed.  As part of this approach, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, <Col N="389" /> will chair a special meeting of EU development Ministers which will be held in Brussels tomorrow to discuss the humanitarian position of refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire and to assess prospects for humanitarian action to bring about an easing of the crisis.</P>
    <P>In the context of the need for a comprehensive approach to the complex and interconnected problems at issue in the Great Lakes region, the Government and our European partners remain committed to holding a regional conference on peace, security and stability in the region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.  We believe such a conference has a central role to play in the establishment of a lasting regional settlement.</P>
    <P>We are in constant contact with the United Nations, the Government of the United States and our European Union colleagues on this matter.  We are also in contact with the Organisation of African Unity.  We are not leaving it to the envoy.  I single out Mr. Ajello for the work he has done on our behalf in the past few days.  We are in close consultation with him and I expect to spend many hours this evening in contact with the international community to avert what has the potential to be a human catastrophe of unknown proportions.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht len a bhfuil le rá agam.</P>
      <P>In the 1995 budget, the Minister for Finance announced a new scheme of tax relief for traditional seaside resorts.  A pilot scheme came into effect in July 1995 for a period of three years and the scheme operates in 15 seaside towns. Only one town in County Galway, Salthill, was designated.  It was a glaring omission not to include Clifden in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Clifden town was founded in 1820.  It now possesses several large hotels, a wide range of shops, galleries and restaurants and a new 100 house holiday village.  A beach and yachting pier have also been developed outside the town. Clifden is often called the capital of Connemara and provides regional services, such as the fire services, Telecom Éireann and the ESB.  There is also a library, courthouse, hospital and community college for second level education in the town.  Because of its age the of the town is in need of urgent regeneration.  Its active chamber of commerce has been doing all in its power to stimulate development in the town, but an incentive scheme, such as the tourist resort scheme, is necessary to provide the necessary kick start to ensure major regeneration of the core of Clifden town takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the main centre in west Connemara, Clifden is the main population centre along the entire coastline of Connemara and south Mayo between Galway city and Westport, a distance of 150 miles.  The coastline from Donegal to Westport, a <Col N="390" /> distance of only 300 miles, has four designated resorts.  Clare and north Kerry have three designated resorts, Lahinch, Kilkee and Ballybunion.  Cork and Waterford have three designated resorts along a coastline of 50 miles. There is an obvious gap to be filled in Connemara which has the largest land area of scenic landscape in any country.</P>
    <P>I have always found it difficult to understand why the Government passed over Clifden when designating towns for the scheme.  I call on the Minister to redress this omission and include Clifden in the scheme.  Its inclusion would facilitate the necessary investment in tourism related products and would have a major economic impact not only for the town of Clifden but on the entire Connemara area.  In view of the major effort being made by the people of the town, I ask the Minister not to put this proposal on the long finger or to give the excuse that the scheme will be reviewed after three years.  I compliment Galway County Council for making a submission this year in support of such designation on its thorough work in promoting the case of Clifden. Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht éisteacht leis an méid a bhí le rá agam agus beidh mé ag súil le dea-scéala uaidh. Muna mbeidh sé le fáil inniu beidh mé ag súil leis sa Cháinaisnéis &mdash; agus níl mé ag caint faoin dara Cáinaisnéis an bhliain seo chugainn ach faoin chéad cheann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the area in question and the Deputy fails to understand the purpose of the scheme which is not to provide tax assistance or any other type of financial benefit to areas that are growing naturally due to normal market forces.  If any town in the west is growing as a result of normal market forces, driven by tourism and other factors, including the semi-State companies to which the Deputy referred, Clifden would probably get one of the prizes.  It would be in the top five in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was specifically designed to bring an additional non-market measure of financial assistance to traditional seaside resorts which, because of a change in the pattern of domestic tourism, were no longer benefiting from that type of activity and were not naturally generating growth.  As the Deputy is aware, I am familiar with the town during the holiday seasons, including Easter, Christmas and the summer.  The Deputy represents the area with the greatest degree of alacrity and much presence and he is aware that Clifden is a progressive town which is currently expanding and adding each year to the range of facilities on offer.  It would contradict every tenet of the scheme which covers 15 towns to include a town which is manifestly generating economic growth and tourism development.  I do not need to remind the Deputy of the massive development, Clifden Glen, on the main Clifden <Col N="391" /> to Galway road and other developments in the region.</P>
    <P>The origins of the scheme can be traced to the current Fianna Fáil spokesperson on finance, Deputy McCreevy who, sadly, was unable to persuade the current leader of his party of the merits of such a scheme.  The proposal was on the record in the Department of Tourism and Trade and reprsentations were vigorously and earnestly made by Deputy McCreevy.  However, it did not find favour with the current leader of the Fianna Fáil Party when he was Minister for Finance.  It found favour with me, not because of the persuasive powers of the Minister, Deputy Kenny, although he has many powers to bring to bear on such measures, and I introduced a scheme which failed to pass the test of viability by the current Fianna Fáil leadership and the occupant of the Department of Finance at that time.</P>
    <P>The scheme was confined to 15 towns in different parts of the country which were traditional seaside resorts but were no longer enjoying that type of domestic holiday market.</P>

      <P>If Deputy McCreevy was unable to persuade Deputy Ahern of the merits of the scheme in principle, it is not unreasonable that a Deputy who has the ability to persuade me of the scheme's merits could convince me of the unique claims of his constituency.  I had no difficulty including Westport as one of the 15 towns which qualified for the scheme.  However, Clifden does not need the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the economic boom which has been brought about in tourism by this Administration, Clifden does not require the scheme.  The Deputy fails to understand the economics which underpin it.  Given that the scheme has been in operation for only two years, it would be wrong at this stage to add another town on a once off basis to the existing number involved.  When it becomes clear how well the scheme functions, the position may be reviewed. If at that stage the boom in tourism has tapered off and Clifden needs an additional boost, which I suspect will not be the case, it will be sympathetically reviewed.  I hope a Fianna Fáil Administration will not be in place at that time <Col N="392" /> to make a judgement because it will have a negative view as it did previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am convinced of the urgent need to appoint a paediatrician to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, where 1,100 babies are delivered in its maternity-gynaecology department each year.  It also deals with approximately 150 miscarriages each year while the caesarean section rate is approximately 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>A consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist was appointed 12 years ago and a second consultant was appointed six years ago.  This shows that the level of services was improving.  As far back as 1986, Comhairle na n-Ospidéal specified the need for neonatal back-up services for the maternity unit.  In 1979 it recommended that a locally based consultant should be available for populations of 75,000 people.  My constituency has over 80,000 people at present.</P>
      <P>In May 1989 the joint committee of the Faculty of Anaesthesia of Great Britain and Ireland stated that a significant maternity unit which handled 1,000 births or more should also have a consultant paediatrician.  The local consultant anaesthetists have pointed out the danger of leaving anaesthetised women on operating tables for emergencies during caesarean operations to resuscitate new born infants.  This happens reasonably often and exposes the danger to the mothers and children.</P>
      <P>In November 1992 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommended that a consultant paediatrician should be appointed as soon as possible.  In June 1993 the inspection committee of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland reported that its main critical finding was the absence of residential paediatric cover.  All these professionals agree an appointment is necessary and on 16 May 1996 the Minister sanctioned the South-Eastern Health Board to fill such a vacancy.  However, Comhairle na n-Ospidéal has failed to give full consideration or consent to the appointment.  The people of south Tipperary deserve everything which Dublin 4, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere receive and they will not be treated differently by anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The politics of Comhairle na n-Ospidéal and the consultants is the main problem.  At present, there are 13,000 school going children in the Clonmel catchment area and 5,000 pre-school children but there is no paediatrician in the area. If Thurles and parts of the north Tipperary constituency and Mid-Western Health Board region, which is a natural hinterland to Clonmel <Col N="393" /> because of easier access, are included, many more people are affected.</P>
    <P>In Waterford there is a paediatrician for every 20,000 population but in south Tipperary there is no paediatrician for 75,000 people.  An editorial in <i>The Irish Medical News</i> on 17 June 1996 stated that if a community is sufficiently large to warrant the presence of a consultant obstetric service, the paediatric service should be developed in tandem. There is no fail safe method of ensuring antenatal transfer of infants who develop possible postnatal problems.</P>
    <P>This danger exists in south Tipperary and I ask the Minister to ensure it is resolved.  The only way it can be avoided is the immediate appointment of a paediatrician.  The Minister has sanctioned the appointment and provided the funds for it, but Comhairle na n-Ospidéal has not given time to the matter.  Since the Minister made that decision on 16 May last, approximately 500 children were born in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel.  It is not good enough that the fullest protection was not provided to the children who were born in the last couple of months but, more importantly, it must be provided to the children who will be born in the coming months.  I urge the Minister to use his influence to ensure that Comhairle na n-Ospidéal gives the go ahead to the appointment of a consultant paediatrician on 22 November so that all the women, unborn children and fathers in the region may delight in a healthy and proper delivery in full service conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Davern for raising this matter.  The issue of the appointment of a paediatrician to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, is part of the ongoing Cashel-Clonmel hospital agreement.</P>
      <P>The development of services in the Cashel-Clonmel area forms part of a debate which has been ongoing for a number of years.  While it was accepted that the acute hospital services in the area should be located on one site to bring medicine, surgery, anaesthetics and radiology together to provide a comprehensive and integrated service in the best interest of patient care, the issue as to whether the site should be in Cashel or in Clonmel has been ongoing.  In all, the South Eastern Health Board made four separate decisions on where the services should be located. In 1976 and 1986 the board opted for Cashel and in 1990 and 1993 it voted for Clonmel.</P>
      <P>In January 1995 I met a delegation from the South Eastern Health Board.  Following that meeting I announced that £12.5 million would be invested in the health services for south Tipperary over a three year period.  I also confirmed my agreement to the board's decision to locate acute hospital services for the area at Clonmel and the development of an extensive range of new services for south Tipperary at Cashel, Clonmel and Tipperary town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> In relation to acute hospital services, the implementation of the Cashel-Clonmel agreement involves the transfer of surgical services from Cashel to Clonmel.  In addition, acute hospital services in south Tipperary are to be improved through the appointment of new consultant medical staff.</P>
    <P>Following that agreement several consultant medical posts have already been approved in the Department and, I understand, by Comhairle na nOspidéal, the body with statutory responsibility for consultant medical appointments.  Those posts include a consultant surgeon, a consultant geriatrician and a consultant oncologist.</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointment of a consultant paediatrician to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, approval was issued by the Department of Health to the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board on 14 May 1996 subject to approval by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It is now a matter for the South Eastern Health Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the local appointments commission to proceed with the recruitment process.</P>
    <P>I understand that Comhairle na nOspidéal has not yet made a decision on the application pending the receipt of supplementary information, but it has undertaken to consider the application at its next meeting scheduled to take place on 22 November 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter.  While not passing any reflection on the eminent Member opposite, I am disappointed that a Minister or Minister of State from the Department of the Environment is not present to reply to this matter.</P>
      <P>This is the second occasion I have raised this matter.  The Chair allowed me the opportunity to raise it some months ago.  The north Westmeath group water scheme is a large scheme.  It was initiated in 1978 and has passed through the hands of many Government Departments, Ministers, county councils and chairmen.  The issue has ebbed and flowed, people have lost interest in it, subscribed and withdrawn money from it.  The scheme continued in that fashion for many years until a determined effort was made in the past two years to put the matter in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that end several meetings were held in Delvin, the central point where most of scheme's members live.  The three Dáil Deputies representing County Westmeath attended various meetings held there.  On 26 September a public meeting in Delvin was attended by Anne Byrne, the programme manager for the Minister of the <Col N="395" /> Environment, Deputy Howlin, the three Dáil Deputies representing the area, engineers from the Department of the Environment, county councillors and a large representative group of the north Westmeath group water scheme.  The matter was fully thrashed out and the meeting was fruitful in that we reached a conclusion.  The points were put to Ms Byrne and conveyed to the Minister.  Following that the group had a further meeting at which its members ratified the proposal put forward and matters have reached the stage that I, on their behalf, am asking the Minister to give the go-ahead to the scheme in two phases.</P>
    <P>The committee unanimously decided to accept the phasing in of the scheme on the following conditions: that the scheme consist of no more than two phases, that the first phase be approved immediately for at least 50 per cent of the estimated cost and that phase two follow phase one &mdash; that it be a continuation and completion of the work.</P>
    <P>In the face of so many years of delay, unavoidable in some cases and avoidable in others, the patience of the large number of people involved in this scheme is wearing thin.  It is feared that the numbers involved will drop off unless the Minister gives a firm indication that he will give the green light to this important group water scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have been asked to reply to this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment who is unable to be present this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke has made a strong case but, as explained to the House on 9 May last in another debate initiated by the Deputy on this <Col N="396" /> subject, the scheme in question is a large and ambitious one designed to serve some 600 households and associated farms.  The project consists of over 50 miles of trunk and distribution mains and involves the building of two reservoirs.</P>
    <P>The history and technical elements of the scheme were outlined in last May's debate so there is no need to go into them again this evening.  Since then the group has submitted a priced bill of quantities for the scheme showing that the total cost of construction would be of the order of £2.5 million.  Having regard to the limited resources available for the group water scheme programme as a whole &mdash; £6 million in 1996 &mdash; and considering that a typical group scheme serves approximately 40 households, it can easily be seen that north Westmeath is quite an exceptional scheme and that the task of financing it is not an easy one.  Nevertheless, the Minister for the Environment and his Department accept it is vital to the people of the area concerned and, notwithstanding the difficulties, they are anxious to progress the scheme as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment conducted an examination of the technical and financial details recently received from the group. They show that the only practical way of advancing the scheme is on the basis of constructing it over a number of phases.  More recently, officials of the Department met the group and agreed on a phased approach to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for the Environment will give the scheme full consideration in the context of the allocation of grants for group water schemes in 1997, details of which he hopes to be able to announce shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 November 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): There has been a general increase in death rates from cancer in Ireland over the past 25 years.  After taking account of age factors, the death rate per 100,000 from cancer in Ireland has risen from 201.62 in 1970 to 221.71 in 1992, the =397 latest year for which full data of this kind is available.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a higher mortality rate from cancer than the average for EU countries.  However, the rate of premature mortality &mdash; deaths among those aged under 65 &mdash; from the disease has been falling towards the EU average in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national cancer registry now collects data on the incidence &mdash; i.e., the number of new cases per year &mdash; of cancer in respect of 1994 onwards. The registry's first report is expected to be <Col N="398" /> published in the near future.  However, incidence data for a single year should be interpreted with caution.  A better indication of the incidence of cancer will be available when a number of years' data becomes available.</P>
    <P>The causes of cancer often involve a combination of factors including genetics, environmental factors and lifestyle behaviours.  It is estimated that tobacco, alcohol and diet, the three major lifestyle risk factors, contribute to two thirds of all cancers in Europe.  Other factors such as exposure to cancer-causing substances, ultraviolet rays and radiation also carry a risk of cancer.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public be made aware of the scope of preventing many cancers by making appropriate lifestyle changes.  The health promotion unit already has a number of health promotion programmes which are well focused and can show a considerable dividend in adding quality to life and reducing premature mortality. To build upon the work already in progress new initiatives are coming on stream all the time &mdash; the most recent being the National Alcohol Policy which I launched in September.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I launched a series of initiatives in relation to cancer.  These initiatives include the publication of a national cancer strategy, national programmes for breast cancer screening and cervical cancer screening, and publications of guidelines drawn up by experts on the safe administration of chemotherapy.  I also published the report of the working party on cervical screening.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy is aimed at reorganising cancer services to ensure they meet the needs of patients in the best possible manner. The strategy's principal objectives are: to take all measures possible to reduce the rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment, and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to the national cancer strategy, I was pleased to announce further progress in the plans for a targeted national programme of breast screening for women aged 50 to 64, and a national programme of cervical screening for women aged between 25 and 60 years.  The expert chemotherapy guidelines will help ensure safe and appropriate chemotherapy treatments for patients with cancer.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these initiatives will greatly improve the level and quality of cancer services available in this country and will, in the coming years, reduce the death rate from cancer in this country.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): From the official statistics on birth registration compiled by the Central Statistics Office, it is not possible to identify non-residents. However, figures from the perinatal reporting system include a category of &ldquo;other&rdquo; for mothers resident outside the State.  Births to Irish citizens resident outside the State, births to residents of Northern Ireland as well as other non-resident births are included under this heading.  It is therefore not possible to examine citizenship issues from this data.  In any event, figures from the most recent available year, 1992, indicate that less than 0.06 per cent of births fall into the non-resident category.</P>

      <P>Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services for persons with a mental handicap in the period 1990-96 which has enabled health boards and voluntary organisations to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,300 day care places. While I am satisfied that this annual injection of funds over a number of years has made a substantial impact, more needs to be done if the needs of those awaiting services are to be met. The Government is committed to the continued development of the services, as resources become available.  This commitment is outlined in both A Government of Renewal and the Health Strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The national intellectual disability database is providing my Department, the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies with information on both the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a five year period.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As recognised by my Department's Health Strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the rapid rise in the number of elderly people poses a special challenge to the health services.  This challenge is particularly acute in the Eastern Health Board where 30 per cent of the country's elderly population live and the number of elderly is expected to rise from the 1991 figure of 117,443 to approximately 176,000 by the year 2011.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has taken appropriate action to meet the implications of a growing elderly population.  Within the last five years, the number of day hospitals has increased from seven to ten; the mobile day hospital service has been extended; additional places for the appropriate care of the elderly have been provided; five specialist departments of medicine for the elderly and two specialist departments of psychiatry of old age have been established; and community ward teams have been introduced into each of the board's ten community care areas.  Since the introduction of the Nursing Homes Act, 1990, to 31 August 1996, the number of beds subvented by the board in private and voluntary nursing homes has increased by approximately 784.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Eastern Health Board submitted a four-year action plan for the development of services for the elderly in the years 1995-98 to my Department in May, last year.  This plan outlines how the board intends to strengthen the community care services and expand the provision of long-stay places for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Already some progress has been made in 1996 with the opening of the community nursing unit at Navan Road and the introduction of additional community ward terms.  As finances permit, my Department will continue to fund essential new developments for the elderly in the Eastern Health Board.  The priorities for 1997 will be the opening of a community nursing unit on the site of the old Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, plus a 25-bed unit at Peamount Hospital and the further extension of the community ward scheme.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, my Department supports the proposal of the Eastern Health Board to build a number of strategically placed nursing units in the board's catchment area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I refer to the arrangements which exist to serve the interests of VHI members.</P>
      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board is a member of the insurance ombudsman of Ireland scheme.  Accordingly, the insurance ombudsman is available to VHI subscribers where complaints, disputes or claims are made in connection with or arising out of policies of insurance effected or proposed to be effected with members of the scheme.  The insurance ombudsman, who is an independent expert, is able to assist by conciliating between the insured person and the insurance undertaking and by adjudicating on the matter in dispute.</P>
      <P>In December last, the board of VHI established a members' advisory council to provide a forum and conduit for the views of members.  The council has been proceeding with its work since its first meeting on 19 January, 1996.</P>
      <P>There have been recent media reports relating to a difference that had arisen between the board and the council.  I understand the two bodies met recently and identified a number of issues which will be addressed by both parties in the immediate future.  The VHI members' advisory council continues to operate as a body representing the views of VHI members.  It is for the members of the advisory council to assess and determine whether they can operate effectively on behalf of VHI members.</P>
      <P>I have already made clear to the House that I am prepared to bring proposals to Government for the establishment of a statutory body should existing arrangements to serve the interests of VHI members, as consumers, prove inadequate.  As regards the members' advisory council, I said at the time of the passage of the VHI (Amendment) Bill, 1995, through the House that I would see how things developed in 1996.  In that connection, I will be requesting the VHI board to furnish me with a report in early 1997 on the operation of the council and its position or actions in relation to the views which the council has made known so far.  It does not arise, at this time, that I should amend VHI legislation to provide for the establishment of a statutory users' council.</P>

      <Quest>the number of children under the care of each health board, or who have presented themselves to the health boards as homeless, who are currently in bed and breakfast accommodation; the further proposals, if any, he has for providing appropriate accommodation for such children in the context of the Child Care Act and the forthcoming juvenile justice legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, from inquiries made to the health boards, that there were three children in bed and breakfast accommodation on the night of 3 November 1996.  Two of the youngsters were in the care of the Southern Health Board and the third young person was in the North-Western Health Board region.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to go into the details of the individual circumstances of these young people. However the age profile of these youngsters 15, 16 and 17½ years indicates the difficulty of obtaining suitable residential or foster care placements for older adolescents.</P>
      <P>I do not regard the use of bed and breakfast accommodation as an acceptable response to the problem of youth homelessness.  My Department has made it clear to the health boards that if, in cases of emergency, there is no alternative to the placement of a homeless child in this form of accomodation, immediate steps should be taken to secure an appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for the child.  However, I recognise that the occasional case may arise where the provision of bed and breakfast accommodation may be appropriate for a youngster who requires overnight accommodation in response to a specific unforeseen situation.</P>
      <P>It is recognised across the health boards that an integrated range of measures is necessary in order to deal with the problem of youth homelessness.  A number of interventions are required including: yearly childhood intervention to prevent children at risk from becoming homeless; greater provision of services for families and young people in the community; the provision of suitable and varied accomodation and back-up services for young homeless people; and accommodation and support services for children leaving care.</P>
      <P>Accordingly health boards have developed a range of services to help tackle the problem. Since 1993 over £35 million has been provided to develop services under the Child Care Act including family support and community services. Proposals have been submitted to Government for the further development of our child care services over the next three years.  The Government has given approval in principle to this programme and I am hopeful that announcements in respect of its detailed implementation can be made shortly.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming juvenile justice legislation, due to be published within the next few weeks, is not relevant to this issue.</P>

      <P>With regard to the recent patient death referred to by the Deputy, I am seriously concerned about the events surrounding this case. I am informed by the Eastern Health Board that it intends to conduct a formal review of the patient's treatment programme for the time of first referral to the time of her unfortunate death.</P>
      <P>I have to date received preliminary reports from the Eastern Health Board and the Mater Hospital on the case.  In the light of these reports and the need to clearly establish the facts surrounding this tragedy, I have asked the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to investigate and report to me as soon as possible on this case.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the House will join with me in extending its most sincere sympathy to the family.</P>
      <P>As part of a comprehensive community oriented psychiatric service, patients with eating disorders are normally treated by their local psychiatric service.  However, dedicated units with fully trained medical staff to treat young adolescents with severe eating disorders are currently in operation in St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin and Warrenstown House, a facility administered by the Eastern Health Board.  I also understand that similar dedicated units are provided by St. Patrick's Hospital and the St John of God's Service.</P>

      <P>The assessment procedures followed by health boards in investigating alleged cases of child sexual abuse are in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines issued by the Department of Health.  Sexual abuse, as distinct from other forms of abuse, has particular features which require special attention and the child abuse guidelines set out a number of issues which must be borne in mind in such cases.  Procedures for the assessment of child sexual abuse are reviewed internally within health boards on a regular basis as part of the overall management of child care services.  As with the child abuse guidelines in general, any formal review at Departmental level will have to await the outcome of the current debate on the mandatory reporting of child abuse as a decision to introduce such reporting arrangements would fundamentally alter the context in which such a review would take place.  As I have previously announced, I will be taking a decision in relation to mandatory reporting before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, additional resources totalling £35 million have been invested in the development of child care services.  All health boards availed of this funding to strengthen their community care teams to protect children from abuse and specific measures were undertaken to improve services to assess the alleged victims of child sexual abuse. These included the expansion of services at the child sex abuse units at Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin, Temple Street Hospital and Waterford Regional and the development of the child abuse unit at St. Finbarr's Hospital Cork.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the South Eastern Board engaged a consultant to undertake an evaluation of their Child Abuse Validation Unit in Waterford Regional Hospital.  The research material, which confirmed the high quality of the service being provided, is to be the subject of a seminar to be hosted by the board in Kilkenny next week.  Key staff from child sexual abuse assessment units throughout the country as well as a number of my Departmental officials have been invited to attend to examine the issues raised by the research.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Food Safety Board of Ireland will have a full and wide range of legal powers to ensure compliance by all agencies engaged in food controls with their legal obligations.  In effect, its function is to ensure, in the interests of public health and consumer protection, that the best and <Col N="405" /> highest standards of food safety and hygiene are being observed throughout our food industry.</P>
      <P>However, the value of the board does not depend solely on the extent of its legal powers.  I believe that the separate and independent status it will have <i>vis-á-vis</i> other agencies will give it its strength and credibility.  I believe it will very quickly be regarded as an objective, third party guarantor of the safety of our food, whose assessments and reports will be respected both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The board will have power to determine binding hygiene and safety standards for any sector where none currently exists in national or EU law and its staff will have the right of access to all premises engaged in the food trade.  It will have access to all records and documentation and will have powers to seize records as well as products considered unfit for human consumption.  In addition, the board will have power to prosecute for failure to observe or enforce prescribed standards of food safety and hygiene.  The board will also have authority to publish reports of all its audits and I think these reports will have a significant influence on the level of compliance with required standards by both agencies and operators.  It is, of course, also true that our food industry will benefit from the reinforcement of consumer confidence which will result from this innovative structural and legal reorganisation of our food control systems.</P>
      <P>I hope to introduce the necessary legislation early in 1997 but, recognising the importance of consumer protection in this vital area, the Government has agreed to the establishment of an interim board.  The membership of the interim board has already been announced.  It's function will be to establish the structures and formulate the work programme to be carried out.  I am confident that all the agencies currently responsible for food controls will co-operate with the interim board, pending passage of the necessary legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The perspective, in Ireland as elsewhere, in response to BSE-CJD has been determined over <Col N="407" /> the last number of years by the international literature on this subject.  The international consensus arrived at on the basis of this literature has been that there is a possible link between BSE and CJD.  The strength of the evidence of a possible link was increased earlier this year by the publication by the Edinburgh CJD surveillance unit of a paper which described a new variant of CJD disease in the UK.  The conclusion of this research was that BSE was probably causally linked to this new variant of CJD.  Subsequent to the publication of this paper the World Health Organisation arranged a consensus conference of international experts on the subject, which confirmed that the link between BSE and the new variant of CJD was probable but that the evidence remained circumstantial.  My Department was represented at the WHO conference.</P>
      <P>Further evidence of the strength of the link between BSE and the new variant CJD was provided in a recent scientific paper in the journal <i>Nature.</i>  This paper identified significant biochemical similarities between the transmissible agent responsible for the new variant CJD and the agent responsible for BSE. While this evidence strengthens the hypothesis of a link between the two conditions, it does not provide incontrovertible proof of such a link.</P>
      <P>In September of this year I set up an advisory group on CJD chaired by Professor William Hall, director of the Virus Reference Laboratory and Professor of Microbiology in University College, Dublin.  This advisory group consists of experts in all disciplines relevant to this subject such as neurology, neuropathology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology.  The brief of this advisory group includes advising me on research strategies in relation to CJD and on international developments generally in this area.</P>
      <P>Research into many aspects of CJD, including its surveillance and aetiology, is being carried out in this country and my Department has contributed to a European Union research project on CJD surveillance.  The surveillance system for Ireland which I have established has designated two national reference centres at Cork University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  I expect that the information which this system will provide will be of great assistance to me and my Department in monitoring developments in Ireland in relation to CJD.  The Food Safety Advisory Board has also reported to me on the public health implications of BSE and CJD and, at my request, it is keeping the position under continuous review.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, has also established an advisory group, concentrating on BSE.  My Department and other medical experts are represented on that group as well as, of course, representatives of veterinary medicine and other disciplines.  His Department is also participating in and supporting research relating to BSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> I believe that the two advisory groups, with their cross-representation of medical and veterinary experts, together with the surveillance systems now in place and the advice available to me from the Food Safety Advisory Board ensures that the information obtained will be used to maximum benefit.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Making provision for the disposal of medical waste is a matter for the health agency at which the waste arises.  The long-term solution to the problem of the disposal of the waste which arises from the provision of health care is being addressed by a joint waste management body, representative of my Department and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland.  Currently tenders are being sought for the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of health care risk waste within Ireland.  The programme envisages the appointment of a contractor by the end of this year and the commencement of the service before the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, health boards and voluntary hospitals have made arrangements with waste management contractors to collect their health care risk waste and export it for treatment in the United Kingdom.  I am aware that on 10 October the contractor dealing with the majority of these exports wrote to his customer hospitals informing them that collections would cease immediately. My Department wrote to the health agencies advising them to provide refrigerated storage until exports could resume.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department sought disposal routes to other countries and, on 24 October, confirmed its acceptance of the proposals made by an Irish waste management company to have this waste exported to the Netherlands for incineration.  Although exports to the UK have now resumed and the waste stored on hospital sites has been substantially cleared, it is necessary to keep the Netherlands route open in the interest of ensuring continuity of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>All health boards reported increases in the number of child abuse cases being reported last year.  The main reason for the increase in the reporting of child sexual abuse can be put down to an increased public awareness of this tragic problem, which has been heightened by media coverage of specific child abuse cases. In addition, the heightened public awareness has been complemented by an improved ability on the part of health boards to respond to families in crisis as a result of the recruitment of additional staff and the putting in place of extra resources to underpin the implementation of the Child Care Act over the last number of years. These additional staff and resources have ensured a more systematic follow-up and recording of suspected cases of child abuse.</P>
      <P>The highest percentage increase in reports of child sexual abuse occurred in the Southern Health Board area in 1995.  There were 289 reported cases of child sexual abuse in 1995 compared with 166 in 1994 which represented an increase of 74 per cent.  Of the total number of cases reported in 1995, 73 or 25 per cent of the total were confirmed compared with 32 or 19 per cent of the total in 1994.  The rate of confirmed cases of child sexual abuse in the Southern Health Board area at 25 per cent was, therefore, lower than the national average of confirmed cases which was 31 per cent in 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures followed by health boards in investigating allegations of child abuse are in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines issued by the Department of Health. The procedure which I introduced last year for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the Garda represents a major amendment of the 1987 guidelines and is to be used where either agency suspects that child abuse has taken place.</P>
      <P>The 1987 child abuse guidelines specify that where child abuse seems likely and a child appears to be at serious risk, immediate action must be taken to protect the child and any other children in the family.  The guidelines specify that, whether with parental consent or under an emergency care order, the child should be taken from a medical examination by a local doctor and/or, where appropriate, by attendance at the nearest paediatric unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is not possible to state the average time between the reporting and investigation of suspected cases of child abuse.  The timescale for action in response to a report of child abuse forms part of the initial strategy for investigation and is dictated by the circumstances of the <Col N="411" /> particular case.  In all cases, health boards attempt to clarify the position in relation to the report and then act accordingly.  The welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration in deciding upon a particular course of action.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the tragedy of child abuse and of the fact that some families may be distressed by what can be perceived as delays in completing the assessment.  However, over the last two years, I have made it my priority to put in place measures to ensure that, where possible, children are protected from abuse, and where abuse has occurred, that the necessary resources have been made available so that cases are investigated as expeditiously as possible and every possible professional assistance and treatment is made available to the child.</P>
    <P>A sum of £35 million has been invested in the development of the child care services on an annualised basis since 1993 and over 900 additional staff have been employed.  All health boards availed of this funding to strengthen their community care teams to protect children from abuse.  I have recently received approval in principle for a new programme of child care initiatives over the next three years which will further strengthen our child protection services and go some way towards reducing the scale of the tragedy of child abuse.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The increase in the numbers of reported suicides and parasuicides in Ireland over the past two decades is an issue of growing national <Col N="412" /> concern.  If help is to be made available to those at risk, it is essential that reliable information should be available on the occurrence of, and factors associated with, suicidal behaviour.  In order to address this issue, I established a national task force on suicide in November 1995. The ultimate aim of this task force is to formulate a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy.</P>
      <P>The interim report of the task force which I launched in September 1996 contains a detailed analysis of statistics relating to suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland, and includes a preliminary analysis of the factors which might possibly contribute to change in the incidence of suicide.  Since the publication of this report, the task force has been involved in a major consultative process which is required to formulate the national prevention/reduction strategy.  The task force hopes to be in a position to complete the preparation of this strategy by the end of 1996.</P>

      <P>The consultation process on mandatory reporting which I initiated last February with the launch of Putting Children First, the discussion document on mandatory reporting, culminated in The Reporting of Child Abuse &mdash; The Contribution of Mandatory Reporting, a consultative forum which I hosted in the Grand Hotel, Malahide, on 16 September last.</P>
      <P>Over 200 submissions from groups and individuals were received in response to Putting Children First.  The submissions examined, not only the question of mandatory reporting but also provided a useful information and commentary on other aspects of our child protection services. Every person or group who made a submission was invited to the forum.  The submissions reflected a wide diversity of views on mandatory reporting and this divergence of opinion was also in evidence at the consultative forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The morning session of the forum was addressed by speakers representatives of the medical, social service, educational and judicial areas, from both the statutory and voluntary sectors.  The afternoon session comprised a series of workshops with delegates free to contribute their opinions.  The views expressed reflected a spectrum of opinion, but the majority expressed reservation or opposition to mandatory reporting. There was widespread agreement that further development of our child care services is required to ensure that children and professionals can report abuse in the knowledge that appropriate investigation, treatment and support services are available to victims.  However, the idea of <Col N="413" /> mandatory co-operation between agencies as a means of addressing the problems that currently exist in relation to the reporting of child abuse received much attention and support.</P>
    <P>The arguments surrounding mandatory reporting of child abuse are complex and concern such issues as the most effective use of resources, professional judgment, the types of abuse that should be subject to mandatory reporting and who should become mandated reporters.  It is because of the complexity and importance of these issues that I have engaged in a lengthy consultation process on the subject.  Detailed work analysing the conclusions of these workshops is under way and, as I have previously announced, I will be making a decision in relation to reporting arrangements for cases of child abuse by the end of the year.</P>

    <P>A national breast screening programme is one of the initiatives which forms part of the national cancer strategy.  Expert advice is that a carefully organised, quality screening programme targeted at women in the 50 to 64 age group can reduce mortality from breast cancer.  Arising from the evaluation of a pilot screening programme run by the Mater Foundation I announced that an expanded programme would commence as soon as possible.  Phase 1 of the programme will cover the Eastern, Midland and North-Eastern Health Board areas, representing half of the country's population.</P>
    <P>A major factor affecting the success of a screening programme is the establishment of a population register.  Expert advice and experience from international mammography screening programmes indicate that at least 75 per cent of the target population must participate in screening if the programme is to reduce mortality significantly.  To achieve this, a national screening register is necessary so that women in the target age group can be contacted and offered screening.  This register would contain accurate details of names, current addresses and ages of women in the target population.  I am committed to making the necessary arrangements for establishing such a register.  However, there are important data protection issues to be resolved and, in order to meet these, appropriate legislation will be introduced as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General's responsibility to determine legal fees in respect of the tribunal of inquiry only relates to the fees payable to the barristers acting for the State, to the barristers acting for the tribunal of inquiry and to the barristers and independent solicitor representing the public interest at the request of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The fees payable to Counsel have been determined on the basis of what the Attorney General considers proper and reasonable, having regard first, to the interests of the taxpayer, second, to the complexity and difficulty of the issues to be determined by the tribunal, third, to the expertise and experience of the Counsel selected and, fourth, to the present market rate for work of this nature.  The Attorney General has also had regard to what a solicitor in private practice acting reasonably and acting prudently would offer counsel for such services.</P>
      <P>The fees payable to the solicitor engaged to represent the public interest have been calculated by the Attorney General, with the benefit of advice from the Chief State Solicitor, on the basis of what the Attorney General considers is proper and reasonable having regard first, to the interests of the taxpayer, second, to the complexity and difficulty of the issues to be determined by the tribunal and third, having regard to the services which the said solicitor will be expected to perform.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it is essential that in an important matter such as this, the State, the tribunal of inquiry and the public interest must be properly represented and I am satisfied that the criteria applied by the Attorney General in setting the legal fees takes full account of this consideration.</P>

      <P>Salmonella is an infectious disease and is notifiable under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981.  The Health Act, 1947, and the 1981 regulations require the health boards, on becoming aware of suspected case of an infectious disease or of a probable source of infection with such disease, to take the necessary steps for investigating the nature and source of infection, for preventing the spread of such infection and for removing conditions favourable to such infection.  I am satisfied that the health boards are meeting their obligations in this area.</P>
      <P>The numbers of cases of salmonella which have been notified to the Department of Health for the last three years are as follows:</P>

    <P>Controls in relation to imported poultry meat are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry whose Department carries out random sampling on such products at the importation stage.  I am informed that none of the samples taken this year has proven positive for salmonella.  However, should this situation change, my Department, in conjunction with the health boards, will take whatever action is necessary to protect public health.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of dealing with salmonella is, of course, prevention of the disease in the first place by improving food hygiene standards, by raising awareness of the problem and by its prevention.  To this end, the environmental health services of the eight health boards carry out inspections of food premises as part of their work in enforcing the food hygiene regulations.  These inspections are an important factor in the prevention of food-borne infection, including salmonella.  The health boards also offer food hygiene education courses for foodworkers throughout the country.  In 1995 alone, over 2,000 people working in the food industry participated in these courses.</P>
    <P>The National Hygiene Partnership &mdash; a coalition of industry and professional interests in the food hygiene sector &mdash; runs courses on the management of food hygiene for managers and supervisors in food businesses.  I am pleased to say that my Department participated actively in preparing material for these courses.  Although it is only a recent development, indications are that the partnership programme will be successful in raising awareness of good hygiene practices in the food trade.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the work being done by my Department in close co-operation with representatives of the industry in drawing up guides to good hygiene practice in specific industry sectors.  These guides are <Col N="417" /> designed to improve food hygiene standards generally across different sectors of the food industry.  Guides for the catering sector and the drinks manufacturing sector have been finalised. A guide for the food processing sector is nearing completion and guides for the retail and domestic sectors are also being developed.</P>
    <P>I welcome all of these developments and hope that they will ensure we continue to keep the level of outbreaks at the lowest levels possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years is prohibited by law.  The Minister for Justice shares my concern that the law in this area should be strictly enforced.  The National Alcohol Policy outlines a range of actions which will be undertaken to address drinking and young people and, in particular under-age drinking.  These actions include: initiatives with youth in the formal and non-formal sectors; development of the role of parents in helping their children to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours in relation to alcohol; and facilitation by the Department of Justice of the identify card schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition the drinks industry is encouraged to provide for responsible server training for staff; establish a charter for retailers which would incorporate best practices in relation to customers, staff and promotions; endorse and incorporate into their code that &ldquo;no alcoholic drinks sponsorship of youth activities should be undertaken directly or indirectly&rdquo;; and confine advertisements to factual information regarding price, availability, mode of manufacture and be in keeping with the National Alcoholic Policy sensible drinking guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I reported to the House on 26 September last the National Alcohol Policy which I announced on 20 September does not contain specific recommendations concerning the sale of alcoholic fruit drinks.  However, on the basis of expressed public concern about the issue, I made contact with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment concerning the promotion of such drinks.  He outlined to the House on 22 October last the position with regard to the labelling of food and drinks products.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, who has responsibility for the enforcement of regulations in this area has recently examined the labelling of alcoholic lemonades on sale here and found them to be in compliance with the food labelling <Col N="418" /> provisions.  The products are clearly labelled as being alcoholic fruit drinks, as well as giving an indication of their alcoholic strength.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and I are conscious of the concern about the labelling of such products however, and therefore he is seeking the agreement of the European Commission and of member states, to introduce stringent requirements for the labelling of such drinks with the aim of protecting consumer's health.  I propose to keep in touch with my colleague to monitor progress on this issue.  In the meantime, my officials are in discussion with the drinks industry concerning good practice in the sale and packaging of alcoholic drinks in this country.</P>
    <P>I said on 26 September that I believed the Irish industry is willing to play its part in protecting under-age drinkers.  The drinks industry made contact with my Department with a view to discussing its ideas with us and I welcome that development.  I believe that a joint approach to sensible drinking between the public and private sector is the way forward at the present time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Mater Hospital has submitted an outline preliminary proposal for a lung and <Col N="420" /> heart/lung transplantation programme.  The cost of the proposal from the Mater Hospital which would include additional cardiac surgery is: capital cost, £2.6 million and revenue cost, £2.4 million per annum.  This would involve the employment of an additional 45 staff.  In addition, the Mater Hospital has informed my Department that it considers that it would be uneconomic to initiate a lung and heart/lung transplantation programme on its own without incorporating extra open heart surgery.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a successful transplant programme for any specialty is an extremely complex and difficult task.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.  The Department's recent experience with the successful liver transplant programme bears this out.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients requiring lung or heart/lung transplants.  I am considering the issues involved with a view to alleviating the difficulties for these patients, both in the short and long term.  In the light of the experience gained in establishing the liver transplant programme, it is unlikely that a phased approach will be adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcomes for patients.</P>

      <P>The procedures for the reporting of child abuse are set out in the 1987 Child Abuse Guidelines issued by the Department of Health. The guidelines set out the procedures to be followed if a suspected case of child abuse presents at any hospital.  The hospital should inform the local director of comnmunity care/medical officer of health when a child is identified as having been abused or when discharging a child who is suspected of having been abused.  All health boards have confirmed that procedures for reporting suspicions of child abuse are in place in accident and emergency departments of hospitals in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure greater awareness and effective integration between accident and emergency services and the reporting of child abuse a number of specific initiatives have been undertaken by the health boards.  These include training of hospital staff in relation to recognising and reporting child abuse, the formulation by a number of the health boards of regional protection procedures which are complementary to the Department's child abuse guidelines, and the organisation of a pilot project by the North-Western Health Board looking at the frequency <Col N="421" /> of visits to accident and emergency by persons under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>As I have previously explained, I am currently considering the many complex issues raised during the consultative process on mandatory reporting and will be making an announcement regarding new reporting arrangements for cases of child abuse by the end of the year.  The question of further initiatives to promote interdisciplinary co-operation on the reporting of child abuse will be reviewed in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department was made aware some time ago by the Eastern Health Board of its concerns in relation to the involvement of young people in prostitution.  However, information in relation to the issue is very difficult to substantiate and is often based on hearsay.  The board report that many young people are either afraid or unable to give specific information on the matter.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the board's staff are aware of the risk to young people and encourage them to talk about any involvement they have had in prostitution.  Any relevant information is relayed to the Garda and both agencies have worked together successfully on specific cases in the past.</P>
      <P>The health board is concerned with providing care and support to the young people and their families and with taking steps to prevent other vulnerable young people at risk of becoming involved in this dangerous behaviour.  The range of intervention projects currently available in the Eastern Health Board area such as neighbourhood youth projects, day project for out of home young people, after-schools projects, after-care services and child care and family support services generally, all serve to reduce the risk of involvement in prostitution by young people.</P>
      <P>My Department has also been made aware of concerns by the North-Eastern Health Board in relation to this issue.  In this regard the board is providing high support care for a particularly vulnerable child and my Department has approved additional funding to the board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since 1993 over £35 million has been provided to develop services under the Child Care Act including family support and community services.  Proposals have been submitted to Government for further development of our child care services over the next three years.  The Government has given approval in principle to this programme and I am hopeful that announcements in respect of its detailed implementation can be made shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): An initial offer in relation to the settlement of the claim for nurses under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was agreed with the nursing unions, INO, SIPTU, IMPACT and the PNA on 23 March 1996 in discussions with health service management.  Following these discussions the proposals were put to a ballot of the membership and subsequently rejected.</P>
      <P>Arising from the failure of this group, and a number of others in the Public Service, to reach agreement on restructuring under clause 2 (iii) (a) of the Public Service Agreement on Pay, incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, the Government met ICTU and outlined its commitment to achieve the necessary restructuring in a positive and constructive way.  The statement they issued also outlined the development of a framework aimed at achieving the continuation and successful completion of a number of outstanding sets of discussions.</P>
      <P>Following this statement a further series of discussions took place with the nursing unions. As provided for within the framework, the parties agreed to refer the outstanding issues to adjudication.  Both sides entered this adjudication process on the understanding that it represented the final stage of processing of the nurses' claim. Submissions were made to the adjudication board on 22 July 1996.  The finding of the adjudication board was issued to management and unions on Monday 23 September 1995.</P>
      <P>A revised set of proposals incorporating these recommendations of the board are currently being balloted on by the nursing unions.  The unions have recommended the revised proposals for positive consideration by their members and I hope that this new package will meet with the approval of nurses throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services.  New regulations, which will give effect to the provisions of Part VII, will come into operation before the end of this year.  These regulations will apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, creches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.  A draft of the proposed regulations will shortly be made available to the public to enable individuals or organisations to furnish any observations they may wish to make in relation to the proposed regulations.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will have an impact across the various sectors involved in pre-school provision ranging from the voluntary provision for disadvantaged children through to full day care provision in the commercial sector.  A working group was established earlier this year within my Department to prepare draft guidelines on standards for pre-school services. These guidelines will form the basis of the regulations to be made under Part VII of the Act. The group is representative of my Department, the Department of Education, the health boards, the DHSS in Northern Ireland and a number of voluntary organisations which are involved in pre-school provision.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify the costs involved for service providers in complying with the new regulations.  Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged.  This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services.  This policy of supporting certain pre-school services will continue in the future and may include financial assistance to upgrade premises.</P>
      <P>I have not received a copy of the National Children's Nurseries Association submission referred to by the Deputy.  I have no plans to provide financial assistance to pre-school services which operate on a private or commercial basis in the context of the introduction of the new regulations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that there are currently 15 republican prisoners held in Belmarsh Prison in England: one is a sentenced prisoner categorised as exceptional risk category A and the remaining fourteen are on remand categorised as either exceptional risk or high risk category A prisoners.  Four other exceptional risk category A prisoners, until recently held in the Special Secure Unit at Belmarsh Prison, have been moved to the Special Secure Unit in Full Sutton Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the conditions in which both sentenced republican prisoners and prisoners on remand who are categorised as either exceptional or high risk Category A have been held.  The Government has expressed concern to the relevant British authorities, both within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental conference and through the Irish Embassy in London, about humanitarian aspects of the conditions in the Special Secure Unit in Belmarsh.  In particular, we have made representations relating to reports that prisoners held in this Unit are being locked up for up to 23 hours a day and endure other poor conditions. We have also expressed humanitarian concerns about the impact on family contact of the policy of closed visits applying to exceptional risk prisoners, as I indicated in my reply to a written question on this issue from Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív on 5 November 1996, Question No. 87. Officials of the Irish Embassy in London have <Col N="426" /> made consular visits to Belmarsh Prison on two occasions this year.</P>
    <P>The British authorities have responded that the imposition of the conditions which apply to these prisoners is a function of their categorisation as category A exceptional risk prisoners.  They have stated that these prisoners' categorisation is periodically reviewed.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that we will continue to express the Government's concern to the British authorities about the humanitarian effects of the conditions imposed on prisoners in Special Secure Units at Belmarsh and elsewhere. Our representations in this respect in the future will of course include those prisoners on remand who have only recently been imprisoned.</P>
    <P>I would also reiterate that the Government stands ready to receive those convicted republican prisoners who have applied for transfer to prison in this jurisdiction under the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.  I refer to my replies to Questions Nos. 86 of 10 October 1996, No. 123 of 15 October 1996, No. 61 of 22 October 1996 and No. 40 of 31 October 1996 in which I informed the House of the Government's concern at the interpretation of Islamic law being advanced by the Taliban.  The Government has called upon the Taliban Interim Council to respect basic human rights and to ensure that, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the elimination of Discrimination against Women, their policies avoid gender discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 October 1996, a Declaration on Afghanistan was issued by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union which stressed the particular concern of the Union at the widespread violation of human rights in Afghanistan especially discrimination against women and girls. The EU recalled in this context Resolution 1076/1996 of the United Nations Security <Col N="427" /> Council, adopted on 22 October 1996, which denounced such discrimination as well as other violations of human rights in Afghanistan.  The EU strongly urged the leaders of the various factions in Afghanistan to respect and act in accordance with the principles laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter as well as all other Conventions on Human Rights to which Afghanistan is a signatory.  On 16 October 1996, prior to the adoption of Resolution 1076/1996, the Permanent Representative of Ireland to the UN made a statement to the UN Security Council, on behalf of the European Union, in the course of which he said: &ldquo;No society can achieve an acceptable degree of peace, justice and stability without full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The European Union calls therefore on all the parties in Afghanistan to act in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and to respect human rights.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The rights of people with a disability are the same as those of every other citizen with respect to the role of the Ombudsman.  I do not believe it is necesaary to appoint a separate ombudsman in this regard.</P>
      <P>The current position is that under the terms of the Ombudsman Acts, 1980-1984, the Ombudsman has powers to investigate complaints about Departments and public service organisations under his remit in relation to administrative actions which adversely affect persons or bodies corporate.  The remit of the Ombudsman was originally confined to Government Departments and offices staffed by civil servants but in December 1984 a Government order extended his remit, <i>inter alia</i>, to cover health boards and public hospitals, not including clinical matters.  Consideration is now being given to legislation which would extend the remit of the Ombudsman further to cover agencies established since 1980, non-commercial State bodies and bodies including hospitals and other institutions dealing with people with a disability, which derive 50 per cent or more of their funding from the State.  I hope to bring my proposals in this regard to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union, which sets out the provisions relating to economic and monetary union, was the subject of a referendum in Ireland in 1992 and was endorsed by a substantial majority of those who voted.  A White Paper on the Treaty, which included a chapter on economic and monetary union, was published in advance of the referendum.</P>
      <P>In addition, earlier this year I wrote to the chairman of the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and offered to make a presentation to the committee about economic and monetary union; my offer was accepted and the committee held a hearing on economic and monetary union on 7 and 8 March.  The committee has since heard other presentations on economic and monetary union.  I have continued to ensure that economic and monetary union is the subject of frequent ministerial speeches; these naturally generate feedback which I am careful to note.</P>
      <P>Also, earlier this year I commissioned, on behalf of the Government, an independent study of the economic implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union.  This study was carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute which published its report in July. Copies of the ESRI report have been widely disseminated and the report has been the subject of substantial debate which I continue to follow with interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the National Economic and Social Council, on which the social partners are represented, has recently published its conclusions and recommendations for a strategy into the 21st century.  The impact of economic and monetary union on macro-economic policy is considered in Part II of the publication.  The Central Bank of Ireland is engaged in ongoing <Col N="429" /> consultations with the banking and financial sector, which will have a key role in relation to economic and monetary union and the changeover to the single currency.</P>
    <P>As regards the practical preparations for economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro, my Department has set up an informal technical working group to advise it on technical issues in the run-up to the 1998 Council decision on which member states qualify for economic and monetary union.  The Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Irish Bankers' Federation, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Stock Exchange, and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies-Ireland, as well as my Department and the Central Bank of Ireland, are represented on this informal group. The group would probably form the nucleus of a more formal structure, like the Irish Decimal Currency Board which oversaw the decimalisation of the Irish pound in 1971, to oversee the practical arrangements needed to manage the transition to the euro.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The seminar to which the Deputy refers was organised by the National Rehabilitation Board as part of the discussion which is currently taking place in Ireland about the most appropriate way forward for the training and employment of persons with a disability.  The Netherlands is a country which has had considerable experience in this regard particularly in the area of supported-sheltered employment.  The seminar was intended to provide a valuable opportunity for an exchange of ideas and information as part of this review.</P>
      <P>As part of the development of new employment strategies in Ireland the Department of Health and the NRB are currently engaged in a number of initiatives.  My Department is currently reviewing the current provision and structure of all training for people with disabilities with a view to developing a policy statement on the future direction of training in Ireland.  As part of this process submissions have been invited from all interested parties, including people with disabilities, training agencies and trainers.</P>
      <P>The National Advisory Committee on Training and Employment set up by the NRB has two steering committees addressing the issues of open employment and sheltered-supported employment.  The terms of reference for the committee addressing sheltered-supported employment includes a review of the international experience in this area.  Both reports will be completed in 1997.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A draft directive to ban tobacco advertising within the European Union is before the Health Council at present.  It is supported by a majority of member states, including Ireland, but it is opposed by sufficient member states to prevent its adoption on a qualified majority.  This position will change if the support is obtained of any one of the larger member states currently opposed to the draft directive.  My preference, which is also the preference of the relevant Commissioner, Mr. Flynn, is to leave this proposal on the table until such a change occurs.  The alternative would be to bring forward some compromise proposal which did not amount to a complete prohibition, but it is clear from discussions with my colleagues in other member states that any amendment which softened the proposals sufficiently to win over any of the countries currently blocking the directive would lose the support of some of those most in favour of it &mdash; in other words, there is no form of compromise which would secure the necessary support.</P>
      <P>While we await an advance on this issue, there are many other steps which the European Union can take to tackle smoking, and I hope to secure agreement at next week's meeting of the Council on a resolution which I have tabled in relation to a comprehensive anti-smoking programme.</P>

      <P>I understand that the number of notifications of intention to marry under section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 served on registrars of marriages prior to 1 August 1996 was 7,661.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of steps were taken to ensure that the public were informed about the new three <Col N="432" /> months notification requirements under section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 and the other changes pertaining to marriages, including the minimum age requirements.  These steps included a press conference on 18 April 1996, to publicise the new requirements and the procedures which had been put in place throughout the country to facilitate compliance, the production of information leaflets by the General Register Office setting out the new requirements and the provision of application forms for the convenience of couples, which listed contact telephone numbers for registrars of marriages throughout the country.  In addition there was a major information campaign on radio, in national and provincial newspapers, specialist publications, Aertel and the Internet.</P>
    <P>Prior to the official launch of the new procedures on 18 April 1996 contact had been made at an early stage with all the major churches, religious groups and registrars of marriages, who were supplied with copies of information leaflets and notification forms to ensure that couples who had already begun to make arrangements for marriages scheduled to take place after August 1 were informed of the new requirements.</P>

      <P>Total cost of non-civil or public service staff attached to the office of the Minister for Health in 1995 was £127,988.47.  The anticipated total cost of these staff in 1996 is £148,366.5.  A comparative figure for the year 1987 amounted to £7,478 and for 1988 to £12,220.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the eastern region is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £1.4 million was made available to the Eastern Health Board in 1996 which has enabled the board to put in place 21 new residential/respite places, 112 new day care places and to further enhance the level of home support services available in the region.</P>
      <P>Capital funding of £0.91 million was made available to the eastern region to support the additional services which were put in place this year.  This included a further £250,00 to enable the board to continue the ongoing maintenance and refurbishment programme in St. Joseph's Services for persons with a mental handicap at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  In addition to this capital funding, £2 million is being made available to the board over a two year period to provide additional residential facilities on the southside of the city.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that the substantial annual injection of funds over the past number of years has made a substantial impact, I am aware that more needs to be done if the needs of those awaiting services are to be met.  The Government is committed to the continued development of the services, as resources become available.  This commitment is outlined in both A Government of Renewal and the Health Strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database is providing my Department, the health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies with information on both the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a five year period.  I would hope to continue the development of further services for persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the database.  My priority is to ensure that provision can be made to meet the needs of those who are currently without a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> Details of the numbers of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services will be available from the National Intellectual Disability Database in the future.  The initial information given to the Deputy in July of this year regarding waiting lists for services in the Eastern Health Board area at that time, indicated that 414 persons with a mental handicap were awaiting residential services and 420 were awaiting day services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Until 1 July 1996, persons with established eligibility under the general medical services scheme, who were provided with a prescription form on their discharge from a hospital had to request a general practitioner participating in the general medical services scheme to transcribe the prescribed items onto a GMS prescription form, in order for such items to be dispensed free of charge for that person.  This arrangement created difficulties for those discharged from hospital late in the day, on weekends or other times outside normal surgery hours or who required to have the prescribed items dispensed urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New arrangements have been introduced on a pilot basis, with effect from 1 July 1996, which enable medical card patients to obtain a supply of medicine from their community pharmacist in the particular situations outlined above.  It is envisaged that these new arrangements should eliminate any difficulties encountered by patients <Col N="435" /> in having prescriptions dispensed on discharge from hospital.</P>
    <P>A full assessment of the pilot scheme will be carried out when data in respect of six months claims made under this new arrangement become available.  Health boards are monitoring the scheme on a on-going basis and the feedback received from the boards by the Department in respect of this scheme has been, in general, very positive.</P>
    <P>The Department has been made aware of an incident in one particular health board area involving a patient who received medication under these arrangements.  As it is understood that the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): International experience has shown that mobile clinics can be a successful part of treatment programmes for drug misusers.  The services offered by such clinics can range from methadone maintenance programmes for stabilised drug misusers to harm reduction programmes, including low threshold methadone doses for chaotic drug misusers.  The important consideration in the type of programme to be provided is that clear operational policies be drawn up for the clinic and that, in addition, clear objectives, which would be subject to review, be defined.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Eastern Health Board's mobile methadone clinic, which commenced in the south inner city area in September, is being operated in a responsible fashion, with clear objectives and involving the support of both the Garda Síochána and local communities.</P>
      <P>The service commenced in the north inner city at the end of October with the support of the local community.  It is proposed to operate in two further sites, one in the north of the city and another in the south of the city.  It is planned to have consultations with the local community in the selection of suitable locations.</P>
      <P>The board has worked closely with the Garda Síochána in relation to the locations and movements of the vehicle.  The board has carried out any recommendations made to it in relation to security and it is satisfied with the arrangements which have been put in place for the clinic, while it is both stationary and mobile.</P>
      <P>The clinic provides a service only for people who have been assessed by a consultant psychiatrist.  If these people are deemed suitable for treatment, they receive the treatment from staff who are specifically assigned to the clinic. These include three general assistants and two nurses.  An outreach worker from the area also attends the clinic for their particular area.</P>
      <P>Given that the clinic is operating within clear guidelines and protocols I am satisfied that it poses little or no risk to local communities.  The provision of drug treatment services to addicts in their area should allow these individuals to become stabilised and, therefore, no longer need to become involved in stealing or other criminal behaviour to feed their drug habit.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In regard to the average bed stay costs for acute general hospitals, my Department is continuing the development of detailed mechanisms for attributing acute hospital costs to the different elements of a hospital's activity.  At present, this information is available for 26 of the biggest hospitals, and the average in-patient cost per bed day which has been extracted from the cost and activity information supplied by those hospitals ranges from £131 to £257 for 1994.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that there are many factors which affect in-patient cost per bed day and these include, in particular, case mix, workload and teaching obligations.  This figure excludes costs and activity attributable to day cases, out-patient services, long stay cases, dialysis, obstetrics and psychiatry.  It does not take account of capital costs.</P>
      <P>With regard to average bed stay costs for a psychiatric hospital, in nursing home care and in hostel care, the Department is requesting this information from the health boards.  When this has been furnished, I will contact the Deputy.</P>

    <P>The health strategy recognises the pivotal role of general practice in the development of a more comprehensive, integrated and accessible health service and sets out a programme for the organisation and support of general practitioners.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy will be aware that both Houses of the Oireachtas have passed the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1996.  This legislation requires health boards to draw up a service plan within the notified financial determination and to maintain services and spending within the service plan and the determination.

On the matter of what is regarded as demand-led schemes, my Department has an arrangement with the health boards and the Department of Finance whereby excesses on these schemes over the agreed budget are made good in a Supplementary Estimate Discussions on the Supplementary Estimate for 1996 are currently taking place between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Department's position has been that assets realised from any disposal of the hospital sites of the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals should contribute to the overall development of services at Tallaght.  At the same time the hospitals, as legal owners of the assets, have indicated their desire to retain control of these assets.  However, it is now the Department's understanding that in the overall settlement to be negotiated with the transferring hospitals, the assets which the sites represent will not be lost to the health services.  Details of this arrangement remain to be worked out between the Department and the parties concerned.</P>

The annual financial statement must also state whether patients' private property accounts have been independently audited, giving the date of the last audit, and a copy of the auditor's report must be appended.</P>

Tenders to undertake this additional cardiac surgery have been received from four hospitals and these are being examined. However, because of the need to ensure developments are well planned and to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive, high cost infrastructure required for cardiac surgery, it will take some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.  As it will take some time to put the infrastructure in place, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to give a firm projection of what the waiting list will be at that stage.</P>

      <P>I am advised that since the pony and trap service started in the John F. Kennedy arboretum in 1983 it has been subject to an annual concession fee, the level of which has remained unchanged since 1991.  It is considered that the present concession fee of £200 is very reasonable given the fact that the operator has two ponies with traps in operation and is provided with free grazing for the ponies and storage for the traps.  I am disappointed to learn that the concession fee has not been paid for the past three seasons.</P>
      <P>The pony and trap service is not an intrinsic part of the visitor experience and consequently it is not considered that visitor numbers to the arboretum would be adversely affected if the service were to finish.  In fact, I am advised that there has been no significant decrease in the annual visitor numbers to the arboretum over the past four years.  The Deputy may be aware that measures are being undertaken on an ongoing basis to enhance the visitor experience at the arboretum e.g., a children's play area has recently been provided and the access road and viewing point at Sliabha Coillte have been upgraded.</P>

Instead, with the objective of providing an understanding of the general strategy, the programme included an indicative overview of specific projects being considered for the period of the programme.  The list was necessarily tentative, given the complex statutory and other procedures which must be completed before particular projects can proceed to construction stage, the factors which can impact on progress once construction stage is reached, and the fact that many projects for which EU assistance is sought have to be individually approved by the European Commission.</P>

As a result of this meeting, I brought proposals to Government leading to the Government's decision to offer State financial assistance and other support to the residents in respect of specific items of scientific investigation, research and other work to be identified; and seek agreement for the removal of the State as the defendant from the action.</P>
      <P>In order to advance these matters, I will arrange to meet the County Louth residents at an early date.</P>

      <P>Cost estimates were obtained for roof resurfacing and the provision of a security fence at the school to which the Deputy refers.  In view of the scale of the cost estimates, my Department is currently obtaining a revised cost estimate based on a different specification to take account of the vandalism problem.

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has been designated as disadvantaged.  I am also aware that the school is not currently included in the home school community liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>Through its inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school has been allocated an <i>ex-quota</i> concessionary teaching post.  The school also receives special supplementary capitation funding which, in the current year, amounts to £30 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The home-school community liaison scheme is focused on schools which already have disadvantaged area status.  Where resources permit, schools are invited to participate in the scheme on the basis of priority of need.  In selecting schools for inclusion in the scheme, particular regard is had to the prevailing levels of pupil participation in the education process and the level of parental involvement in the affairs of their local school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home school community liaison scheme at <Col N="457" /> primary level was expanded in the 1995/96 school year with the inclusion of an additional 49 schools.  This brought the total number of primary schools included in the scheme to 181.  The schools in question have the services of 105 locally based co-ordinators.  The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of any further expansion of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently examining the overall accommodation in the Wexford Town centre. The purpose of this examination is to ascertain if there is surplus accommodation available which could be used to accommodate the Gaelscoil. This option must be given serious consideration before any commitment is given to provide a new school building.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is incumbent on my Department to make the most effective use of public moneys, particularly at a time when the demand for capital expenditure exceeds available resources.</P>
      <P>Where rationalisation in a centre is not feasible, a school is considered for inclusion in a future capital programme.  The inclusion of a school in a programme would allow the Department to pursue the acquisition of a site.</P>
      <P>Pending the outcome of the present examination in Wexford, I am not in a position to consider Gaelscoil Loch Garman for inclusion in a capital programme or, consequently, to authorise purchase of a site.</P>

      <P>Following the early retirement of the acting chief executive officer of County Westmeath vocational education committee on 24 May 1995, I concluded that exceptional measures, of a short-term nature, were necessary to secure the committee's financial position and to address the grave management deficiencies previously identified in the vocational education committee's affairs.</P>
      <P>To this end, the acting chief executive officer of County Dublin vocational education committee was seconded to County Westmeath vocational education committee.  This secondment arrangement operated from 30 May 1995 to 31 August 1995 at which time the officer in question retired from the service of County Dublin vocational education committee.  During the period of the secondment the payment of travel and subsistence expenses was approved under the current arrangements governing the payment of such expenses.  As the officer was on secondment his headquarters was deemed to be Dublin.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 September 1995 when he retired as acting chief executive officer of County Dublin vocational education committee, revised arrangements for the payment of travel and subsistence expenses were sanctioned by my Department with the approval of the Department of Finance.  These arrangements included provision for the payment of travelling expenses in respect of the one return journey per week made by the officer from his home in Dublin to his place of work in Mullingar and the payment of subsistence expenses at approved rates in respect of overnights in Mullingar.  These arrangements continued until the officer retired on the completion of his term of office on 31 August 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 148, 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources and I have been informed by them that the operation of the Garda juvenile liaison scheme is kept under constant review by the director of the National Juvenile Liaison Office. I should refer the Deputy to my reply to her Question No. 123 of 17 October 1996, which sets out the major improvements and reforms to the scheme introduced in 1991, the additional appointments to the scheme in recent years and, in particular, the appointment of an additional superintendent to the National Juvenile Liaison Office in March of this year.  This reply also referred to my plans to place the scheme on a statutory footing as part of the forthcoming Children's Bill, which I expect to publish within the next few weeks.  I would expect that this step in itself will heighten the awareness of the Garda juvenile liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the scheme is continually monitored and assessed in all respects, including resources, staffing and administrative procedures and that adjustments, including additional appointments, take place whenever and wherever appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The juvenile liaison officer scheme provides for the cautioning and supervising of young offenders of 18 years or under as an alternative to prosecution.  The aims of the Garda juvenile liaison officers operating the scheme are crime prevention, education and the rehabilitation of offenders.  Since its inception in 1963, an annual aggregate of 89 per cent of juveniles cautioned under the scheme have not re-offended within their supervisory period.  In addition, officers may <Col N="462" /> also be given the care and guidance of a young person who, although not known to have committed an offence, may be regarded as a potential delinquent by reason of unsatisfactory behaviour, such as persistent truancy, running away from home, staying out late at night, being unruly at school or at home, etc.  Such cases come to notice through teachers, parents, school attendance officers or other gardaí.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, juvenile liasion officers are actively involved in various youth diversion schemes which are funded by my Department. These projects specifically target young people at risk and are aimed at crime prevention.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are three juvenile liaison officers attached to the Donegal division.  In 1994 and 1995 they dealt with 219 and 221 offenders, respectively. These figures compare favourably with other Garda divisions.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas.  They have informed me that the policing needs of each Garda division are reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to utilising available resources to optimum effect.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that one of the main elements of the anti-crime measures which I announced in July of this year was the recruitment of a further 400 gardaí to the Force over the period July 1996 to October 1997.  This is, of course, in addition to the 350 gardaí already being recruited this year and another 350 planned for in 1997.  The anti-crime package also provided for the recruitment of an additional 200 civilians to the Force, which will facilitate the release of an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.</P>
      <P>As these additional gardaí are recruited or released for operational duties, they will be deployed as deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities.</P>

The number of gardaí, all ranks, and the total number of female members in each of the years from 1990 to 1996 is as follows:</P>

    <P>A total of 600 trainees are scheduled to be admitted to the Garda college in 1997.  The original plan had been to take on 350 in 1997, but that number was increased by 250 under the Government's anti-crime package announced last July.  The package also provided for the intake of 150 additional recruits in 1996, and that addition is reflected in the table.</P>

      <P>The number of criminal cases transferred from Cork Circuit Court to Dublin Circuit Court in 1995 was 87 and between 1 January 1996 and 30 September 1996 was two.</P>
      <P>The transfer of criminal cases from one Circuit to another is now governed by section 32 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  The Act does away with automatic right of transfer of criminal cases from provincial Circuit Courts to Dublin.  Such transfers had exacerbated delays in the hearing of criminal cases in Dublin and had also proven very costly in terms of transporting gardaí and witnesses.  It is also possible that the incentive to transfer these cases was often nothing more than a wish to have the hearing of the case delayed.  There can of course be legitimate grounds for such transfers and therefore the Act provides that an application to transfer a trial to Dublin will only be granted where the Judge is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so.  Since the implementation of the Act of 1995 undue delays in the hearing of cases in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court have been substantially reduced.</P>
      <P>The President of the Circuit Court has assigned an additional judge to the Cork Circuit and there are currently no appreciable delays in hearing criminal cases in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have initiated a major programme of reform of the criminal justice system since I became Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Some of the measures which have taken place under that programme have been designed to deal with urgent specific issues &mdash; such as, for example, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which provides for additional powers to deal with drug trafficking.  Other measures &mdash; such as the Criminal Law Bill and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill &mdash; address some of the existing deficiencies in our criminal law thereby enabling improvements in procedures and the repeal and replacement of outdated provisions.  Other legislation being prepared under the programme &mdash; on which substantial progress had been made &mdash; include &ldquo;root and branch&rdquo; reforms in relation to the law on juvenile justice, non-fatal offences against the person, criminal insanity and fraud.</P>
      <P>It will be clear that the approach taken in that programme is to tackle as a priority the individual areas of criminal law that are most in need of attention and modernisation and I believe that this is the most effective strategy to ensure that our criminal law is responsive to modern realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions in a recent public debate in a university made certain proposals and comments on the admissibility of evidence and other <Col N="466" /> matters.  He has not requested me to examine any proposals but if he does so, I will have them examined.</P>
    <P>As to an independent review of the criminal justice system, I should mention that, in the context of criminal law reform, I have already available to me the advice of the Law Reform Commission and the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  In addition, I recently established an Advisory Group on Criminal Law and Procedure whose terms of reference are &ldquo;To review the existing criminal law and procedure as they currently operate and to advise the Minister on any changes that would enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of criminal law and procedure, with emphasis on identified or emerging difficulties susceptible to early resolution through the mechanism of periodic Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bills&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The deployment of Garda personnel is the responsibility of the Garda authorities.  I have been informed by them that the Navan Road-Kinvara area is policed by the gardaí attached to Cabra Garda station where the current strength of Garda personnel (all ranks) is 82.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also inform me that the Navan Road-Kinvara area receives regular Garda attention by way of mobile and foot patrols from both uniform <Col N="467" /> and plain clothes personnel attached to Cabra station.  In addition the area is also patrolled by members of the Drugs Unit based at Cabra Garda station and by members of the Divisional Task Force based at Santry station.  &ldquo;Operation Dochas&rdquo; is in operation in the area and is proving successful in targeting crime and drug related activity.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the level of crime in the area since 1993 shows a downward trend.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities assure me that the local divisional officer is satisfied that the present deployment of personnel and resources are adequate in meeting current policing needs.  The situation is, however, kept under constant review and changes made as necessary.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly was that my Department introduce a £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary groups in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  The recommendations, which I accepted, was for a scheme of grants to voluntary and <Col N="468" /> community groups, and not a scheme of payments to individuals.  Making the funds available through voluntary organisations, with their local knowledge and expertise, ensures that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people.</P>
      <P>I subsequently established a national advisory committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and the Garda Síochána &mdash; Neighbourhood Watch &mdash; are represented, to advise on the implementation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>Grants towards the cost of conventional burglar alarm systems are not available under the scheme.  The strong advice available to me from the advisory committee and the Garda Síochána is that conventional burglar alarms are of limited use to vulnerable elderly people living alone.</P>
      <P>As the scheme came about as a direct result of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly, it was intended to provide funding for older people, which for the purpose of the scheme includes anyone over the age of 65 years living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people or older people and other vulnerable and dependent people.  Anyone wishing to avail of this scheme could contact any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable or older people, who would make an application to my Department on their behalf.  I have checked with my Department's midland regional office and there is no record of any voluntary organisation making an application on behalf of Mr. Clifford.  I suggest he contacts my Department's regional office in Longford who can put him in contact with a relevant organisation if required.</P>

      <P>Article 6 of the Working Time Directive provides, in the interests of protecting the safety and health of workers, that the average weekly working time of employees should not exceed 48 hours.  The directive allows for weekly working hours to be averaged over a period of six months in the case of certain activities such as the security industry or, in particular circumstances, over a period of 12 months by agreement between the two sides of industry.  While the directive allows for the phasing-in of the provision relating to annual leave, there is no provision for the phasing-in of the 48 hour working week or the provisions of the directive relating to rest time.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am giving very careful consideration to the special concerns of the security industry and other industries in the context of preparing the legislation to implement the Working Time Directives which I hope to publish in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>Arable aid payments commenced on 30 September 1996 when oilseed advances were paid.  Payment of arable aid to cereal farmers began on 18 October 1996 and to date payments amounting to £29,466,944.58 have issued to 7,626 growers of oilseeds and cereals.</P>
      <P>As part of the integrated administration and control system which is required by the EU in relation to all CAP compensatory and headage payments, Ireland has been committed to developing a new land parcel identification system in 1996.  Given the increased level of checks and controls associated with the new LPIS it was inevitable that some delay in making payment, when measured against the 1995 performance, would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU regulations governing payments to cereals farmers under the arable aid schemes allow for these payments to be made in the period 16 October to 31 December in the year of <Col N="472" /> application.  Cereal payments commenced on 18 October and are continuing.  I am confident that significant progress on payments will be achieved over the next few weeks and that payments in all but the most intractable problem cases will be made by mid-December.</P>
