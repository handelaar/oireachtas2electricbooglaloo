      <P>It is proposed to take <Col N="2" /> item No. 13, Finance Bill, 1996: Second Stage (<i>Resumed</i>).

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for passing on the documents and various papers to the Opposition yesterday at an early time.  I have complained about this issue on a number of occasions and I appreciate the advance notice given yesterday.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="3" /> broadly welcomes the document but one point is creating difficulty.  I know it is not within the Government's remit but could it use its influence to ensure that no one is excluded from involvement in the democratic electoral process? Based on what the Minister, Michael Ancram, said on BBC radio this morning the only reason people were excluded was they did not ask to be included.  Will the Taoiseach deal with that matter?  A number of parties are excluded from the list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are legislative implications in that there may be proposed legislation to provide for holding a referendum following the all party talks.  I, too, thank the Taoiseach for sending us a copy of the ground rules and proposed legislation in advance of publication yesterday.  I welcome that and support the efforts of both Governments to ensure that we have all party inclusive negotiations on 10 June.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the ground rules published yesterday represent definitive proposals for the all party talks and the forum and that they are not open to negotiation, as some Unionist politicians suggest?  Will he confirm that there is no question of the Government engaging in consultation on what was published yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The ground rules paper which concerns the ground rules for negotiations has been the subject of extensive consultation and is now a definitive document.  As the House is aware, one or two areas are explicitly left to be settled by the negotiators but other than that they are the definitive ground rules.  The matter raised by Deputy Ahern relates to the elective process and the legislation therefor is subject to the normal processes to which <Col N="4" /> all legislation is subject and which in Westminster includes the possibility of clarification.  For its part, the Irish Government will be willing to convey any reasonable representations it receives on this matter to the appropriate quarter.  I thank Deputies Ahern and Harney for the courtesy they have shown in regard to furnishing the documents to them.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach. The parties will be involved in an unnecessary row if they are not added to the list.  The statement made by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications yesterday evening, which I studied carefully, does not explain the point I and my colleague endeavoured to make yesterday.  Briefly and in an orderly way, I ask the Taoiseach if he will explain how on 29 November&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Adoption Bill, 1996, will the Government support the Fianna Fáil Bill given that the High Court has found that there is no need for change in the legislation?  The issue is to be appealed to the Supreme Court, causing further delays for those parents who wish to adopt Chinese babies.  This matter could be very simply rectified if the Government would go ahead with the Bill which was before the House and deal with the more substantive issues at a later stage.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill, 1996, is a monument to the lack of vision and ideological confusion of this centre-left rainbow Coalition Government. In favourable economic circumstances for tax reform and in particular with every possible reason, politically, socially and morally, to reduce the crippling effect of high employment taxes, the people have been cursed to have in office a Government consisting of a set of parties, none of which has the appetite, vision or competence to bring about what this country needs, a dramatic, pro-employment, pro-enterprise root and branch reform of our taxation <Col N="8" /> system.  The cause of this malaise can be described in one word &mdash; Labour.</P>
      <P>When the Labour Party got into office in 1992 it immediately halted the programme of tax reform which in the previous years had seen the reduction of the top rate of tax from 58 per cent to 48 per cent and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  Labour tore up that strategy of low marginal tax rates and immediately imposed a 1 per cent income levy on all taxable income, which was equivalent to a 2 per cent increase in the standard tax rate for 27 per cent taxpayers, bringing their tax rate back up to 29 per cent.  Three years later the Labour Party's period in office has achieved nothing on the tax front except tinkering, sleight of hand, increasing complexity in our tax system and a stubbornly high dole queue.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, emerged as competitors in the whole area of tax reform.  In a pre-emptive strike Deputy Quinn told the papers on Saturday that he would face up to the question of the middle income tax burden because, as he saw it, in plainly political terms that was what the Labour Party needed to be seen to be doing.  On Sunday Deputy Bruton, determined not to be upstaged, did a trailer for a forthcoming document on tax, PRSI and jobs, to appear in Monday's papers, but this Finance Bill makes political liars of them both.</P>
      <P>To those who have consistently emphasised the need for reform and the reduction of taxes on work, this deathbed conversion on the part of the rainbow Coalition partners on tax policy evokes nothing but the deepest cynicism. We should remember that Labour has been in office for 13 of the last 23 years.  That is an enviable record and I congratulate the Minister for being part of those Governments but the Labour Party cannot now turn to the other parties in this House and say it was not there.  It has been in office for the majority of the last generation.</P>

      <P>Between 1973 and 1977 the bones of our tax system as it is now were put in place.  Every single word on the tax statutes has been either there since Labour was in office or has been kept in place by Labour.  Our tax system is the Labour Party's tax system because it has been in office for a majority of the last quarter century during which that system evolved.  The Labour Party's insatiable spending plans have put a consistent upward pressure on taxation.</P>

      <P>Between 1973 and 1987 Labour and Fine Gael raised the number of taxpayers paying above the standard rate of income tax.  A total of 98 per cent of taxpayers were on the standard rate when Labour and Fine Gael came into office in 1973 but by the time they left office in 1987, Labour and Fine Gael had brought surtax to the masses and increased the number of taxpayers paying above the standard rate of income tax from less than 2 per cent to 43 per cent.</P>

      <P>I spoke to a member of that Government in 1977 and suggested to him that its catastrophic defeat at the hands of the electors might have had something to do with the fact that it had not index linked the tax system. <Col N="10" /> He replied that index linking the tax system would be the end of all social progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Those words ring in my ears because I read occasionally in <i>The Irish Times,</i> particularly on Saturday, about crocodile tears now being shed over the effect of tax on lower paid people but that the Government which brought this about included people who were deeply hostile to any form of tax reform.</P>
      <P>Labour and Fine Gael who presided over the crazy anti-employment tax changes which at one point reached 77 per cent and which they only reduced to 60 per cent to avoid defeat in the 1987 election.  It was a Labour and Fine Gael Government which criticised most strongly the Progressive Democrats in its first year for suggesting we could have a system with a 25 per cent standard rate and a 40 per cent top rate.  It was Labour which, in its first budget in 1993, tried to revoke the PDs' tax reforms by throwing the whole process into reverse and imposing the 1 per cent levy.</P>
      <P>Having declined all sensible proposals for tax reform, Labour and Fine Gael are now vying with each other to recover middle income support by laying the foundation for so-called tax concessions in the next budget.  In the meantime we have a Finance Bill that does nothing on that agenda.  The facts speak for themselves.  In the next year, the average taxpayer will pay £117 more in income taxes to this Government to assist it in its tax and spend policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for a by-election post-mortem in the Labour Party to produce a deathbed conversion to tax reform, nor do we need another postgraduate research paper from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.  We need a Finance Bill that tackles the issue now but what we have is a lamentable evasion of the fundamental problems in our tax system. <Col N="11" /> Our tax system is killing jobs, stifling investment in jobs, lengthening the dole queues and encouraging the black and grey economies.</P>
    <P>Those people to the left, as they like to deem themselves &mdash; they might more properly be deemed the left behind &mdash; should be expected to show a little radicalism now and then and some smidgen of concern for the 300,000 marginalised people and their families to whom this country offers nothing but dole and crocodile tears.  One might expect a party of the working man to take on the greatest single impediment to social justice for those who do not have jobs &mdash; a tax and welfare system that excludes the most vulnerable in our society from any chance of participating in economic life. Instead we have a deeply cynical, self-serving social partnership which has chosen unemployment, high taxation and to keep State control over huge areas of the economy.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the most conservative of economies.  Our conservatism is social democratic conservatism.  We constantly seek derogation from European competition directives and have left our tax and social insurance systems largely unreformed.  We are now governed by a complacent, out-dated and inept governing class supported by self-serving, bureaucratic State machinery.  We do not have any radicals or radicalism in our system and that is strange in a country where so much is so radically wrong.</P>
    <P>This sick and, I suggest, sickening State takes 57p in taxes and PRSI in every extra pound earned by a single worker earning well below the average industrial wage.  This Bill is leaving in place a system which needs more of their extra earnings than a single man or woman earning less than £12,500 per annum.  We do that because nobody will face up to the truth that a tax system which confiscates more than half the extra earnings of a single person earning well below the average industrial wage is sick to its heart.</P>
    <P>The people who justify that system and who talk in public about being of <Col N="12" /> the left and concerned with the working classes and the plight of those on low wages are hypocrites because they offer those people nothing but confiscatory tax rates on below average earnings.  We take more from below average earning workers in Ireland, which has the lowest average earnings in Europe, than any other country in similar circumstances and we justify that by reference to the need to spend more money.  It is not simply confined to lower earning workers because many people find themselves in the position where it is better not to work.  They have more disposable income doing nothing for 40 hours per week than if they worked for 40 hours per week.  That is our problem. It is a sick country which does that to the weakest and most vulnerable sections in the community while, at the same time, claiming it is making progress and that the fundamentals are right.  A country with a centre left coalition, in which a Labour Party postures as being the party of the working man, which fails to remedy that in budget after budget should be ashamed as should any party which accepts it.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new about what I am saying; it has been well appreciated for a long time.  There is nothing unprecedented about a speech of this kind in this House but what is unprecedented is the unwillingness of the parties most interested in high taxation and high spending to face up to the truth that they are part of the problem and not part of the solution.  Why, since coming into office in 1992, has Labour done nothing to change the tax rates that workers earning below the average industrial wage face?  Why, after four years of Labour in office and two years with a Labour Minister for Finance at the helm, do single working people earning well below the average industrial wage still give more than half of their marginal earnings to the State in taxation?  Why is it that people on £14,000 per year living in a local authority house, even taking into account family income supplement, PRSI, tax and other fringe social welfare benefits, <Col N="13" /> are no better off than if they were earning £9,000?  How does the Labour Party explain, after four years in office and two years at the helm, that it cannot reform our tax system to do something for those people?  If we are talking about social justice &mdash; this Government came into office with a mandate to put justice back into economics and trust back into politics &mdash; how can it after two years face an electorate and say it is fine by it that the State takes more than half the earnings of a person earning £1,500 less than the average industrial wage?</P>
    <P>Such a country and the parties which preside over it are sick and hypocritical if they say they have any intention of doing anything sensible about unemployment, while at the same time pursuing and keeping in place such a tax regime.  That is the cost of the Labour Party to the working class.  Where is the social justice in that and where is the conscience of the Left?  I suggest the conscience of the Left has been left behind at the social partners' negotiating table.</P>
    <P>In 1994-95 the Packard Electric company in Tallaght paid the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, £3.5 million in PAYE and PRSI on a total wage bill of £15.5 million. That is equivalent to a 35 per cent levy on its wage bill in terms of employer and employee PRSI and employee PAYE.  That company was trying to hold on to employment in Ireland in a highly competitive world market and the work it offered was highly labour intensive.  It was offering genuine employment to people who were not the most skilled workers but who were willing to work to improve their circumstances and to keep their families' heads above water.  Yet our Government had two Ministers careering around the world looking concerned when there was a redundancy package.  This company was dragged down by the fact that the Exchequer is so organised that it requires 35 per cent of the payroll of such a company in taxes and levies.  That <Col N="14" /> is the truth.  As long as we run a regime which takes so much from those who provide employment for people who need it most, we have no chance of confronting the employment problem.</P>
    <P>I contrast what the Exchequer did to Packard Electric, that is, taking 35 per cent of its payroll spend each week, with what it does to other jobs which are apparently more important to the social partners, like jobs in the semi-State sector. What is wrong with a job at Packard Electric that it must be taxed as if it were a luxury?  Why is it so different from other jobs which must be subsidised as if the country depended on them?  What type of society is this that we tax out of existence the jobs of ordinary working people who are most vulnerable and deliberately load a burden of taxation on their work which makes it impossible for their employers to compete on an international field? What type of society is this that we say to those people to keep paying high taxes because we have a lot of things on which to spend their money?</P>
    <P>There is a different way to look at our economy which does not come from those in this House who believe in radical tax reform and who have in the past done something to change our tax system. It comes from those across the world, formerly of the Right and the Left in politics, who realise that the type of sick state-dominated economy so many people in Ireland feel so addicted to and dependent on cannot survive in modern circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger in conjuring up a vision of another economy, waving it before the people and saying this is the way we should work because every economy and society has its problems. Our economy is very sick because the fundamentals are not right in terms of economic or social justice.  Any society which fails to address the fact that most of those at the bottom of the economic ladder are better off not participating than participating is one which is running away from the truth and which will face serious consequences in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> We have failed to address our fundamental economic problems.  It is not for want of analysis.  We do not need another paper from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, on why the Culliton report was right.  The Culliton report said there was one thing the Government could do to improve the employment situation, which was to radically reform the tax system.  It said it was the one central thing on which Government could deliver, but the Labour Party in Government does not believe in that. The Labour Party does not believe in that publicly or privately or in changing the burden of tax on work.  That is why when the Labour Party got into office in 1992 with Fianna Fáil and in 1995 with Fine Gael the result was exactly the same on both occasions.  A flimsy, intangible set of targets for tax changes was put in place.  Three or four lines, which could mean anything or nothing, were shoved into a programme to allow for flexibility.  The real issue was to get on with the social partnership, driving up public sector pay in gross terms and to forget about the importance of take home pay to the average person and the incentive to work and to give others employment.</P>
    <P>One of the most unfortunate myths which the Labour Party tends to propagate, publicly and privately, is that marginal tax rates do not matter but that what is really at issue is the overall burden of taxation.  With that wave of the intellectual wand, it is saying that it does not matter if the tax rate is 27 per cent, 20 per cent, 48 per cent or 77 per cent, as in the past, but that what really matters is how much one pays on the bottom line.  That is demonstrably false.</P>
    <P>Countries such as New Zealand which have opted for low tax rates of 18 per cent or 20 per cent and a top rate of 33 per cent understand that the marginal tax rate is crucially important when it comes to getting out of bed and going to work, deciding whether to work an extra three hours on a Saturday morning if one's employer asks, deciding <Col N="16" /> whether to take promotion and responsibility, investing in a new machine in one's small business and taking on two extra workers and hazarding one's savings in a small business which might generate employment for others rather than putting it into a house let in flats.  This may not be apparent in the deepest recesses of Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>I know the difference between having two thirds or one third of a fee confiscated in tax and the incentive to me.  I sometimes say I would prefer to go on holidays this week because all I am doing is giving the Minister for Finance a present of most of what I earn &mdash; that is not personal.  I know how ordinary people tick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They tick by reference to the effect on them of getting up, working extra hours, taking extra responsibility and putting money into some remunerative investment.  It is crucially important to a businessman who invests in a particular concern to know whether the return, taking into account the risk that it could all go wrong, will be taxed in a way that he gets only half into his own pocket.  That doubles the risk of failure as far as he is concerned. If the positive return on an investment, which can lose money, is taxed at half the return then the odds on success are effectively halved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the notion, propagated and peddled by the Left in Ireland in particular, that there is something intellectual and abstract about the difference between facing a 48 per cent tax rate and a 33 per cent tax rate.  It is demonstrably wrong.  Those societies which understand what drives people to fend for themselves, to work harder to improve society, and which are not caught up in ideological befuddlement, which suggests to them that there is something wrong with somebody wanting to work harder or to better themselves and which do not make a complete icon of the culture of dependency, cannot be told if they are earning less <Col N="17" /> than the average industrial wage that the state needs more of any extra money they earn than they do.</P>
    <P>Societies such as New Zealand have learned a hard lesson as to how one can throw away, across a whole generation, the opportunities for growth and self-sustaining economic development if one has a high tax, highly regulated economy. I ask the Minister to bring the Labour Party into the real world.  Do not be part of the &ldquo;left behind&rdquo;, become part of the radical left, bring the Labour Party to the point where the New Zealand Labour Party was, in a mood to challenge, on a radical basis, the ill effects of the state through its taxation and control in that economy.</P>
    <P>Why can Felipe Gonzalez in Spain privatise but the Irish Labour Party cannot? Why can even the French Left take on the issue of state ownership of assets but the Irish Labour Party cannot bring itself to do it?  Why is it that across the world parties of the left have woken up to the new agenda in politics but in Ireland they have not?  The reason is that at the heart of the Labour Party's thinking up to this point &mdash; and I think it will change &mdash; there is a notion that going into the next election if they keep faith with the 250,000 Irish voters in identifiable industry such as the semi-State sector, the public service and the State sector generally in terms of teaching, nursing and council employees they will return with more or less the same number of seats into the next Dáil.  That is the strategy but it is in tatters because the Labour Party could think only in conservative terms: let us service this political constituency, let us bash ahead with a little more of the social partnership economics, let us keep the show on the road and look after our own.  That is a fundamental political mistake and it will not work.  It will be blown out of the water because an economic window of opportunity will not be availed of.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and the year 2001 this country will have a huge opportunity to effect a dramatic transformation.  We could have a divestment of State control in a large area of our economy to allow <Col N="18" /> competition, to reduce public indebtedness and the calls on the Exchequer to capitalise various projects.  In relation to Aer Rianta we could say, for instance, that the State has no particular interest in owning that company any more and does not need to capitalise its £100 million investment plan we read about today.  It does not need to do that.  It does not need to control airports.  I do not want to control airports any more than I want to own shopping centres, both of which are equally vital for our economic life but I see no reason one should remain in State ownership rather than another.</P>
    <P>We do not need a system of semi-State sea ports as opposed to State sea ports.  We need a system whereby every Irish port of any size is competing with Larne to ensure that Irish traffic going through the Republic's ports faces charges which are on a line to make them competitive with those in Northern Ireland.  We do not need a system in which the State does all the generating of electricity.  We do not need to derogate from the European Union directives in relation to telecommunications competition.  We do not need any of these things if we have the strength of character and the sense of purpose to effect in the next four years a dramatic transformation in the Irish economy. We have uniquely favourable circumstances to do it: transfer of funds from Europe, a good position internationally, good growth in some portions of the economy here.  Now is the time more than ever for someone with a radical vision of how this country can transform itself to be in office.  Unfortunately, now is the time when we stand cursed with a Government with no vision, no united sense of purpose and no programme.  To compound all that, the Government thinks it should have the right to determine a successor programme to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> What a tragedy that would be.</P>
    <P>This Government lacks the basic understanding of what is needed over the next four years and should not, in its declining days, be allowed to set the <Col N="19" /> agenda for the next four years.  It is for an incoming Government to do that and it is for the people to set, by their votes in the next election, the mandate and the parameters as to how Ireland can be transformed in the next four years.  It is not for a confused group of ideologically bewildered partners who are wed in a coalition only because of the need to be in office.  It is not for them to set the agenda for tax reform in the next four years.</P>
    <P>I have no deep seated objection to a further programme if it produces industrial peace, but not at any price.  Any programme that does not have as its starting and its ending points radical tax reform and which does not factor into every agreement about wages the issue of tax reform, take home pay and restraint on growth in public sector pay and private sector pay and is not built on that cornerstone is a programme that we cannot merely do without but one which we would be cursed to have foisted on us by a Government in its dying days.  We need something radically different from what is available. We were far better off not to have had a programme negotiated during the lifetime of this Government, to let the people have their say about what they want to happen in the next four years in terms of taxation reform.  There is no way one can map out a strategy for three or four years of a successor programme without facing up to taxation. This Government has not the political will to do the basic political ground work to deliver on the issue of taxation and it does not have the ideological cohesion to put before the people a single vision to that end.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be a political clairvoyant. It would be a foolish person who would predict what will happen at the next general election.  Parties which appear to have the backing of only approximately one-third of the voters should not set the agenda for their successors. Parties which do not have the confidence of a working majority of the electorate and, in particular, those <Col N="20" /> which do not have any reasonable prospect of getting the support of a working majority of the electorate should not tell the electorate how the country will be run after they lose office.  It would be a great tragedy if an incoming Government was stuck with an agreement it could not rupture or renegotiate without it being in bad faith.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to reply and, undoubtedly, he will do so in his usual trenchant way.  He should not talk to me about arrogance.  He should reflect on a single woman earning below the average industrial wage, from whom he is taking 57p of every extra pound she earns, and then tell me he is a party of the left.  If he can tell me that he has her interests at heart, when in three years he has not changed her position significantly, he can address the issues I am raising with a greater degree of confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill is not merely an adjunct of the budget, it is the law of the land.  Our tax system is the law of the land.  Our tax system is in its present state because each year for a quarter of a century Members have voted to leave it as it is.  We have done less than any other country in Europe to address the issue of taxation on work but, curiously, we have the most reason to do something. We have had commissions, Culliton and OECD reports, we have set up the NESC, working parties and forums and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, proposes to introduce another paper on the importance of taxation, but we have not had action.  I have studied the details of the Bill and I do not propose to deride them because much work has been done <Col N="21" /> on its drafting.  Effectively, it is a fine tuning and tweaking of an existing tax system.  It does not propose significant reform.  In real terms, the changes in allowances are all within a few percentage points of zero.  People will discover in the next few weeks that the Bill will make little difference to anybody.  This is a missed opportunity to deliver on taxation reform.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being too arrogant in saying that I regard it as somewhat bewildering that coming up to election time, a Government should flag that tax reform will be on the agenda for its final budget.  It is disappointing that it is a question of party political interest rather than doing what is right.  It is also disappointing that the Minister should be quoted in the newspapers as saying he will now do something for the middle income groups for which he has done little in the past.  He should start from his socialist roots and do something for single workers who earn £1,500 per annum below the average industrial wage and must pay 57p of every extra pound earned to the Government.  If the Minister does something for those workers and forgets about the middle income group he might have some authentic socialist credentials.  If he does something radical for them he might be seen as a radical socialist but if he does nothing, the political, economic and electoral consequences are inevitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Finucane.  I welcome the opportunity to commend the Finance Bill, 1996 to the House.  Deputy McDowell's colourful speech should not surprise me.  He is continuing to reiterate views and policies, with which many people agree, but which are in sharp contrast to his party's performance in Government, particularly in terms of growth in public expenditure and increased taxation.  His views do not gel with his party's performance and this is a serious criticism of what he constantly preaches.  I listened to him preaching similar sentiments when his party was in <Col N="22" /> Government but he was not a Member of the House.  It is amazing that when his party was in Government it did not do something about these matters. Unless and until Deputy McDowell and his party confront that reality the electorate will view them with a degree of cynicism.  Public life is being diminished by the continuous assertion about what the Progressive Democrats would do about taxation and public expenditure control when that party's performance in Government left a great deal to be desired.  I do not know why Deputy McDowell does not confront that subject when he speaks on this topic.</P>
      <P>I was also amused at his unfounded comments about the parties in Government being confused and bewildered. The Government's cohesion on the Estimates, the budget and the Finance Bill has been marked.  Of course, the parties in Government have different points of view but we respect one another.  We have conducted debates and dealt with our differing views in a sensible manner, reached conclusions and are working well together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill is the most complex legislation laid before the House each year.  Many of its key provisions have been widely discussed since the budget speech in January.  However, for the first time this year there has been extensive consultation on some of the Bill's more technical aspects prior to its publication. This applies not only to the discussion paper released some time ago but also to specific areas, such as the amendments to the BES scheme, on which there was extensive consultation with interested parties, practitioners and so on between budget day and the publication of the Bill.  That process of consultation is essential to the efficient preparation of complex technical legislation such as the Finance Bill.  The initiatives taken this year will be expanded in future years and this can only enhance the quality of our legislation and allow for more efficient use of the House's time in debating such technical provisions.  The Bill also provides for the initial legislative stages in <Col N="23" /> the process of consolidating approximately 30 years of taxation law.  This is a major project which will be welcomed in particular by professionals and practitioners.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unusual in one other key respect, that is it does not contain the provisions which give legislative effect to many of the key priorities addressed in the budget.  The economy is prospering as never before and is growing at a faster rate than that of any of our fellow members of the European Union. The level of job creation has improved significantly.  However, not everyone who desperately needs to work has been afforded that opportunity.  The central thrust of the Government's policy in the budget was to direct resources towards the long-term unemployed and low paid.  These measures are not appropriate to the Finance Bill as they are administered by the Departments of Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment.  The Finance Bill does not, therefore, give the full picture.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of those measures lest they be forgotten.  The Government introduced an £80 per week subsidy for employers who provide jobs for the long-term unemployed. Special provisions have also been introduced to help 18 and 19 year olds avoid the trap of long-term unemployment. The low rate of employers' PRSI has been extended and now covers more than 600,000 employees.  A range of tapering arrangements, including the retention of medical cards, have also been introduced.  The Bill reaffirms the Government's commitment to the creation, through enterprise, of real sustainable jobs.  It provides for the exemption from tax of grants received from county enterprise boards and grants paid under the Leader and area partnership programmes and back to work allowance scheme.  The subsidy of £80 per week paid to employers in respect of the recruitment of long-term unemployed persons is also to be exempt from tax.  This provision will allow these employment creating incentives to be <Col N="24" /> maximised to the full by small and micro-sized businesses.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is the single most complex piece of financial legislation brought before the House each year and it therefore merits careful thought and attention.  It is sometimes regarded as the sum total of the Government's deployment of the benefits of economic growth, which of course is not the case. The Finance Bill is but the final stage in a long process which involves the settling of the Estimates, the Budget Statement, the Social Welfare Bill and a host of other measures.</P>
    <P>The fruits of economic growth are spent not just on tax concessions or measures to help the unemployed but also on the improvement of services in hospitals, schools and other areas of society.  None of this would be possible without the underlying prudent management of the economy to which the Government is totally committed.  Economic prosperity which to some extent is taken for granted is not an accident; rather it results from proper policies and prudent management of the economy. There can be no improvements to services or significant reductions in the tax burden without continuous strong economic performance and prudent financial management.  These are the key challenges facing the Government which has managed, and will continue to manage, the economy with the prudence necessary to promote sustained economic growth and real sustainable jobs.  No package of employment subsidies or other pro-employment measures can deliver the kind of real sustainable jobs created by a prospering economy.  A total of 45,000 new jobs were created last year and more than 30,000 new jobs will be created this year.  Special interventions are necessary for those who have not been able to avail of economic prosperity, but in the end it is the overall management of the economy which will create real long-term employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>A broadening of tax bands or a reduction in tax rates is guaranteed to make the headlines.  The improvements <Col N="25" /> in take home pay which these desirable changes can deliver are modest when contrasted with the savings to households arising from sustained low mortgage interest rates and low inflation. These are the ways in which economic prosperity is primarily shared.</P>
    <P>Modern history textbooks rightly deal at length with the &ldquo;economic miracle&rdquo; of the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, the final years of the 20th century are the most exciting for this economy since the foundation of the State.  As a nation we stand at the brink of becoming a founder member of a true single European market.  This is a dream the founders of this State could scarcely have contemplated.  In order to realise that dream we must manage our growing economy in a prudent and sensible way.  The economic planning and policies which underpin this year's budget and the Bill reflect this necessary prudence and sensible management.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal at length with the individual sections of the Bill as my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has already done so and I have no doubt they will be discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  A significant number of the provisions reflect decisions already announced but there are some new items to which I would like to refer. I am particularly pleased that the relief granted for the installation of alarms for the elderly has been extended in section 5 to the relations of elderly people living alone.  The extension of the relief will make it more accessible to those who need it most and the Government recognises that it is needed.</P>
    <P>The provisions to curb abuses of the patent income relief have received much publicity.  I fully support these measures as the level of abuse could, in a relatively short period, undermine the entire system of relief in this area.  The new proposals which, in certain circumstances, relate the level of distributions to actual research and development expenditure should assist the genuine innovator and promote research activity <Col N="26" /> in the State.  The Bill also includes a separate provision, section 48, which broadens the scope of the special tax relief for research and development expenditure introduced last year.  Any measures which foster innovation are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the two budgets introduced by it since it took up office the Government has increased the level of relief from capital acquisitions tax on the transfer of family business from zero to 75 per cent.  This relief is crucial in ensuring that long-established family enterprises, most of which have created employment, can pass to a new generation without a significant tax charge requiring the sale of assets.</P>
    <P>The small and medium-sized business sector is a major creator of employment and will deliver many badly needed jobs in the future.  The risks taken and the commitments given by these business people must be recognised.  In this context I welcome section 52 which makes the 27 per cent lower rate of capital gains tax available to a wider range of genuinely entrepreneurial business people who dispose of their businesses. I look forward to the further extension of this lower rate in the future.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the economy will continue to perform strongly this year. All of the indicators are that the low interest rate and low inflation environment will continue in tandem with strong growth and job creation.  The pro-employment measures introduced this year will be effective and the Government priority will be to reduce the burden of personal income tax next year.  This year we concentrated largely on targeting the long-term unemployed, and we make no apologies for that.  In future it is my desire to reduce the burden of personal income tax.  This cannot be done at once, but it is an area that this and future Governments must address in future.</P>
    <P>I look forward to constructive discussion on this Bill, on which there was extensive early consultation prior to its publication.  It is a continuation of the same prudent economic principles <Col N="27" /> which underpin the Estimates and the budget announcements and reflects the Government's commitment to job creation through enterprise and through the maintenance of a low interest rate, low inflation, high growth economy. The creation and maintenance of such a climate is much more important than any individual measure in the Bill.  The Government is determined to continue sensible policies and not to be thrown off course, even by electoral considerations, as mentioned by the previous speaker.  The Government has a duty to manage the economy in a sensible way not just to proceed, under the Maastricht Treaty, towards a single currency but because the policies operated by it brought about high growth, low inflation and other positive economic factors which have not filtered down to everybody yet &mdash; that will take time. The Government recognises it is also necessary to tackle the question of taxation which everybody agrees is a disincentive and must be reduced.  It will be reduced in the months and years ahead by this Government and its successor which I believe will be this Government.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I was fortunate or unfortunate to listen for 30 minutes to Deputy Michael McDowell's contribution.  Although he appeared to focus mostly on taxation &mdash; and there have been successes in that area &mdash; at no stage did he recognise that we have a very buoyant economy. People who have mortgages are extremely happy with the relaxation of mortgage interest rates.  Inflation is low and there are low interest rates in the banks.  All these factors contribute to the present state of the economy.  I would love to take Deputy McDowell to where I live in Newcastle West where he would see the housing boom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that obviously reflects an enhanced economy.  I prefer, <Col N="28" /> however, to deal with the technical aspects of the Bill, some of which are good.  I am glad the Minister decided to change the budget provision regarding the installation of security systems by pensioners over 65 and make relatives of older people eligible to avail of the facility.  There was further recognition of the particular vulnerability of older people when the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, announced a further £6.5 million to cover extra provisions for the elderly.  I am sure Telecom Éireann will row in with a reduced telephone installation cost.  The Government does reflect on the situation outside the House and has responded positively.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that this Government is pro-enterprise.  In 1995 it created 45,000 jobs and another 30,000 jobs are projected for next year.  The Finance Bill states that grants from county enterprise boards, area partnership boards, Leader groups or grants under the back-to-work schemes will be exempt from taxation.  That is desirable because, as a member of a county enterprise board, I have seen at firsthand how, at a relatively small cost, a county enterprise board can help to create many jobs in its local area.  The Government is to be complimented on setting up such organisations in every part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to sound a note of caution about county enterprise boards.  The Government is at present conducting a study to evaluate where funding will go in future.  I am afraid that one of its recommendations might be that a greater amount of funds should go to city areas.  Although that might be desirable in itself, I would not like it to be at the expense of county enterprise boards around the country which, in many cases, are getting a reduced amount. Most county enterprise boards are allocated £90,000 every three months and must operate within that budget.  My county enterprise board is already exceeding its budget.  The number of people interested in the various grants is an indication of the success of the <Col N="29" /> county enterprise boards.  I would like to think the Government would consider increasing the finance for the operation of those boards because they are creating many jobs at local level, far more successfully than some of the more renowned bodies.</P>
    <P>Another element of the budget is the concession to encourage the transfer of farms.  There has never been a greater incentive to do this.  The Government is encouraging the transfer of farms to younger people and this Finance Bill contains concessions on leasing and capital acquisitions tax.  Parallel with that is a very successful EU farm retirement scheme.  The young farmer, if he avails of a particular Teagasc programme, is entitled to an installation grant of £5,600.  All these elements are conducive to encouraging the transfer of farms, which is desirable.</P>
    <P>One thing that concerns me is whether the priorities of the various organisations are sometimes misplaced. This struck me very forcefully during the week when I accompanied a deputation from a small rural community called Fianna who have been trying for the past five years to get a sewerage scheme for their village.  Unfortunately the news from the council was disappointing, it would not even submit this scheme to the Minister for the Environment because so many other applications for similar schemes were stockpiled and awaiting approval.  This is disappointing for a community which is typical of most rural villages around the country.  It has a vibrant community council and, over a period of time, achieved third in the county in the tidy towns competition.  It is one of the areas selected under the urban and village renewal schemes introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus.  It is located in an area subvented by Leader funds, yet those villagers are threatened by the loss of a teacher, the relevant local authority not allowing them planning permission because of septic tank considerations.  This is a contradiction in terms &mdash; a rural community <Col N="30" /> endeavouring to advance while being constrained by bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>One can talk about the Leader programme, partnership boards and urban or village renewal but local infrastructure must be a first priority.  If one cannot implement a sewerage scheme for such a community &mdash; even at a cost of £200,000 &mdash; that community will wither through its inability to construct houses there.  Having recently led a deputation of ten on this subject I was very disappointed with the official response as were the other members who returned to their area without any great confidence. That is what happens in many villages.  While acknowledging the spending parameters of Leader programmes and partnership boards, it appears the Minister for Finance cannot entertain such demands within his budgetary constraints.  Somebody must seriously examine the position and ascertain where funding can be provided for such community plans and requirements.</P>
    <P>A good aspect of this Bill &mdash; and here I agree with Deputy Michael McDowell &mdash; relates to the incentive to work. There are many industries located in west Limerick, the gross income of most of whose employees, including some overtime, would amount to approximately £10,000 annually which is subjected to income tax.  Many people with four or five children come to our clinics for advice and tell us that it is more beneficial to be unemployed than to work. That is something to which I referred when speaking on a Finance Bill some three years ago.  One important anomaly &mdash; the loss of a medical card &mdash; has been removed.  Heretofore, whenever an unemployed person returned to work he lost the benefit of a medical card estimated to be worth approximately £500 annually to an average family.  The abolition of that anomaly is some incentive to return to work.  There is also the positive incentive to employers who, on recruiting people who have been unemployed for three years, will be eligible for the employment subsidy of £80.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the environmental <Col N="31" /> controls on forestry introduced in the past few days by the Minister for the Environment in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I particularly welcome the proposed consultations with local planning authorities on projects to be grant-aided, including forestry projects.  In the western part of my county small communities, comprised of older people, live in isolation and in fear in the homes in which they resided happily for many years.  They perceive many local forests almost as havens for the thugs who prey on them.  This phenomenon is leading to rural decline, as some people are forced to move into larger communities.  I welcome any tightening up of regulations in this area.</P>

      <P>So far, the tone of contributions, particularly from Members on the Government side of the House, has been very interesting.  While listening to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and Deputy Finucane I was fascinated that they almost ignored the failures inherent in this Bill and its objectives.  I was struck forcibly by their obvious difficulty in identifying any provisions their party could clearly state it had carried forward from Opposition and implemented in Government. Indeed the Minister for Finance had very little to say yesterday about overall policy thrust, or any concrete achievement by him in his second budget.  He failed to point to any notable legacy worth retaining in terms of taxation after his term of office.  He unenthusiastically commented on the various sections of this Bill in a very lack lustre fashion without making any radical change in the development of fiscal policy. It appears the type of policies he might want to implement are not capable of being implemented under this tripartite Government and he realises his failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the recent by-elections I was struck by the Minister for Finance's promise that his next budget will deal with the most fundamental problem of <Col N="32" /> taxation as it affects middle income families. He almost held out a bribe to the electorate in advance of next year's general election.  It is reasonable to interpret such remarks as a bribe.  He hopes the very serious failing fortunes of the Labour Party and this Government can be rectified in the interim.  Over the next 12 months, no doubt we will be treated to a regular diet of such statements from the Minister for Finance and the many spin doctors associated with this Government, but the electorate will not be fooled.  In the past two years the greatest opportunity in 25 years existed for tax reform when, for the first time, a Labour Party Minister had control of the Department of Finance.  Yet there was the greatest failure on the part of any Minister who had espoused a particular radical ideology over recent years and the Labour Party, when afforded that opportunity in conjunction with Fine Gael and Democratic Left, to do anything that could be construed in any way as beneficial for PAYE workers.  It is reasonable to suggest that it will be difficult to sustain the high levels of economic growth experienced in recent years, facilitated by Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987, into the next century.</P>
    <P>The electorate will not be fooled into believing there will be an overnight change of direction in next year's budget.  They will perceive any carrot held out to them as merely being offered in advance of the next general election.  There should be a health warning on the package that the spin doctors will make public in the next few months. Let us remember that there is provision for a further budget in the autumn of 1997.  The electorate should take on board that whatever bribes the Government may try to offer in early 1997 in conjunction with the general election, if it is returned to office, it will have the opportunity to bring in a second budget that year.  I have no doubt that whatever concessions, packaged as real tax reform, may be given in the early part of 1997 will be reversed in the latter half of the year should this Government be <Col N="33" /> returned to office.  This country cannot afford the luxury of the policies pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>I have read the Official Report for the period when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, was Opposition spokesperson on Finance.  His statements from these benches are a world away from what the Fine Gael Party is doing in Government. It is failing to deliver on a shred of its radical proposals professed in Opposition.  The Fine Gael Party simply abandoned any thought of radical tax reform when it entered Government. Apart from the fact that it is a tragedy for the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One only has to walk the streets, the highways and byways and talk to Fine Gael supporters who will tell you exactly what I am asserting in this House.  My point is that the electorate will not be hoodwinked or fooled by messages emanating from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, since the by-election and the &ldquo;4 per cent&rdquo; Labour Party.  The Minister for Finance has suddenly found the Holy Grail and realises that middle income families have been decimated by his lack of action in the past two budgets.  Given the substantial increase in productivity and the wage restraint shown by the PAYE sector, it would have been reasonable for the PAYE sector to have expected a pay back in terms of real tax reform that would put extra money in their pocket.  They had expected to benefit from the substantial economic growth, but that did not happen.  It did not happen because the rainbow coalition Government of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left was unable to deliver on a package that would have led to continued economic growth, a reduction in unemployment and sustaining the jobs that are available.  That is a real tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can look to independent forces for some indication of where our economy is going.  At a time of increasing economic expansion in the European Union and the strengthening of various world markets, it is extremely worrying that the competitive position of the Irish economy is slipping.  In the recent OECD report we can see that we have fallen very far from our competitive position a short time ago.  We compete for mobile international investment in order to create sustainable jobs which in turn creates further jobs.  We know the benefits of international investment by some of the biggest companies in the world markets that have set up in this country.  We know that the cost of employment in this country is turning potential investors away from investing <Col N="35" /> in Ireland.  We simply cannot afford this. Not alone will we lose potential jobs but the companies already here are beginning to think in terms of expanding in other countries.  If that happens, the existing jobs will shrink, there will not be continued growth and the unemployment crisis will be further compounded. Tragically, this stems from this Government's decisions.  There is no use in blaming outside forces such as the German, American or Japanese economies for the problems we have created for ourselves.  My colleague, Deputy McCreevy, rightly stated last evening that many workers on low wages are better off when they are out of work and live off the State and have made a decision not to work because of the punitive taxation of low paid workers.</P>
    <P>This problem has been on the agenda since I was elected ten years ago.  We have had reports from independent consultants and departmental assessments have been carried out.  We do not need any more reports, we simply need to take the sort of action that is necessary if we are to make a real impact on our levels of unemployment.  It is reasonable to interpret the policy of the Government in this Finance Bill as not being committed to doing anything worthwhile in creating employment and reducing unemployment.  In 1995, 45,000 new jobs were created but this year the Government expects somewhere in the region of 30,000 new jobs to be created. That is extraordinary considering the level of economic growth we are experiencing. It is an extraordinary admission by this Government that it has no answers and is literally depending on outside forces in the hope that something might happen.</P>
    <P>When we talk about monetary union &mdash; I have spoken on it many times in this House &mdash; and its effects on this economy, the one question we all keep coming back to is whether Ireland should participate in it if the United Kingdom does not because of our close relationship with the British economy. It is a real and difficult question. <Col N="36" /> However, we are doing nothing to create the conditions in our economy that would greatly lessen the negative impacts if we participated in economic and monetary union and the United Kingdom stayed outside.</P>
    <P>Employers and employees alike do not have room to manoeuvre because punitive levels of taxation have removed any scope within a company when a problem arises.  When various sectoral problems arise in our economy &mdash; there have been problems in the beef industry recently &mdash; its immediate impact is job losses.  It would not have to be that way if these companies had room to manoeuvre with their employment costs.  Since employers are bearing the major proportion of the cost burden, job losses seem to be the first and only alternative in a crisis.  This is not the case in other economies.  Many other measures can be taken long before jobs are lost.  However, that is not the case in the Irish economy.  This is coming more into focus and will worsen when sectoral problems arise because the employers' room to manoeuvre has been removed. That is very much in keeping with our slipping down the scale of the world competitiveness league.</P>
    <P>We can argue about monetary union forever but our decision would be a million times easier if we made tax changes, which is within our own remit, to reduce employment costs and the burden on employers.  If there was more scope and room to manoeuvre in those areas and if those costs were substantially reduced, the impact of the United Kingdom staying outside economic and monetary union would not be as great and our companies would be able to cope with it in a far better way than at present.  There is currently no room to manoeuvre because of the punitive costs involved in employment.  There is no point in talking in this or other fora about plans to reduce unemployment if substantial and radically different changes are not made to our taxation system.</P>
    <P>There was movement that made a difference from 1987 onwards.  There was <Col N="37" /> growth in employment and real benefits began to filter through.  However, all this came to an end when the Labour Party got its hands on the Department of Finance.  It is impossible to have a high spending Government and a low taxation regime at the same time.  This high spending Government's performance has been substantially masked by the economic growth it was fortunate to inherit.  It did not create the current levels of economic growth in this economy. They were created and built upon during the last eight years by Fianna Fáil led Governments.  It would be ludicrous of the Minister to suggest that he created that economic growth, but he had the opportunity to benefit from them.  However, he slammed the door on continuing the move towards the downward trend in levels of personal taxation and employment costs.  It is extraordinary that the party that failed the most in this matter was that which purported more than any other to represent the PAYE worker.  Of course, those of us who have been in politics long enough know that most of what the Labour Party says is hot air and suited to a short-term agenda.  It has never had a proper, committed long-term strategy that it was prepared to espouse in Opposition and deliver when it came to Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has spent 13 of the last 23 years in Government but what has it contributed?  Every time it has been in Government there has been a crisis in its removal from office.  It spent large amounts of money, did nothing about taxation and crippled the economy and this pattern is repeating itself. However, this time the economy is in such good shape that it is masking its lack of ability, commitment and real dedication to do something about taxation.</P>
    <P>Another aspect absent from this Bill, from a party that had much to say about it in Opposition, is that of local government. There is no mention or reference to it in the Bill.  The local government strategic management initiative was announced last week.  While this is <Col N="38" /> important, how can the Minister be serious about taking a radical approach in that area and say nothing about funding and finance and the framework of the dreadful property tax?  We know about the anger of people with regard to the way service charges etc. are structured. The Labour Party introduced them and hounded members out of every council chamber.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health do nothing, their county council colleagues are still opposing everything.  There would have been no development of local government if it had been left to the Labour Party.  Fianna Fáil has saved local government in extraordinarily difficult times.  We have suffered a lot of pain for doing so but many local communities have benefited from our stand.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a county council that has seen much strife and difficulty in that area.  However, it is extraordinary that this Government, which consists of the Labour Party Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health, has not even inserted a line or a reference to local government in the Bill, as if it exists in other countries but not here.  It is quick to tell us at committee meetings about the success of the Nordic countries, including Denmark and Sweden, Spain or France but it does not refer to the level, contribution or status of local government in those countries and the commitment to it by socialist parties &mdash; which the Labour Party is supposed to be &mdash; to encourage people to pay for necessary services. Most county councils and corporations are involved in major sewerage schemes and dump sites which will cost substantial sums to operate on a current basis, irrespective of the capital costs involved, yet there is no reference to local government in this Bill.  It is as if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, accepts that when this issue arises next year he will be in Opposition on his old hobby horse shouting about it and somebody else will have to take responsibility for the difficulties, unlike <Col N="39" /> the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Democratic Left which have not done so.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two aspects of the Finance Bill.  I applauded the seaside resort renewal scheme introduced by the Minister last year to invest in and rejuvenate seaside resorts.  However, within 12 months he excluded accommodation from capital allowances under the scheme as if addressing the needs of resorts like St. Moritz and Cannes.  Does he realise the condition of our seaside resorts and the struggle encountered by those engaged in the tourism industry in those areas?  The welcome radicalism initiated by my colleague, a former Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, in devising that scheme left a legacy for the Government to introduce it to protect seaside resorts and assist tourism development. We supported the Minister in introducing that scheme last year but this year he excluded accommodation from capital allowances and ring-fenced rental incomes.  He might as well abolish the scheme.  He must be aware of the number of projects seriously affected by that measure which is a nonsense.  The scheme was hardly up and running when the Minister introduced that severe measure.  It is typical of the Labour Party that, when its members thought some people might make a few bob out of the scheme, they imposed a restriction on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Profit&rdquo; is a dirty word and the Minister was the person to put a stop to it.  The Labour Party did not stop to think that such a measure might ruin a projected investment package required over the next five years to upgrade hotel accommodation in our seaside resorts to the required standard, but in less than 12 months the Minister came into this House and did a <i>volte face</i> regarding a provision under that scheme.  The Minister was wrong to <Col N="40" /> introduce that measure and we hope to amend it.</P>
      <P>The restrictive changes introduced in the area of research and development are ironic.  The lack of research and development is raised at all forums I attend.  Such facilities are badly needed. When companies become involved in this area, the Minister adopts the attitude that they may be abusing the system to reduce taxation on profits.  That would be all very well if this country had some of the largest development and research plants in the world.  We badly need major European companies that locate here to invest in research and development.  Bausch and Lomb, located in my constituency, requires research and development facilities, encouragement and supports to compete with its mother plant in the United States and plants elsewhere to make it worthwhile to locate here and to bring the necessary expertise and provide training for Irish people.</P>
      <P>Despite the publication of a well researched report recommending the upgrading of the regional college in the south-east region and the deficiency in third level education there, I heard nothing from the Minister for Education about that.  While the report recommended upgrading Waterford regional college to an institute of technology, it did not make any recommendations concerning other areas, yet the Minister chooses to deal with other areas.  Putting this matter on the long finger is no longer acceptable to the people of Waterford and in other parts of the south-east region.  The people of that area want and demand action now to upgrade the regional college to an institute of technology.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is from Wexford, I expect her support on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us do not realise the extent to which the public service impacts upon our lives.  We take the delivery of public services in their present format and standard very <Col N="41" /> much for granted.  For instance, the public service provides our public bus and train service, postal service, health care through hospitals and clinics, social welfare benefits, personal taxation, motor tax, the provision of telephone and electricity services, the range of services provided by local authorities, primary, secondary and third level education and radio and television service.  The list is apparently endless.  The public service impacts on us all every day of our lives. There are more than 200,000 people employed in the public service, both appointed and elected, including civil servants, doctors, nurses, Army personnel, gardaí, local authority workers, teachers, politicians and all those employed in the commercial and non-commercial State sectors.  We are talking, therefore, of almost one in five of the labour force employed in the public service paid by the Exchequer on behalf of the tax paying public.</P>
      <P>One of the commitments in A Government of Renewal concerns the introduction of reform in the delivery of the large range of public services I listed, with the aim of achieving and demonstrating value for money, high standards of service, efficiency, courtesy and accountability.  A central objective will be to assert the authority of the customers of public services.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the whole area of quality of public services, including standards of service and redress, is a major component of my area as Minister of State with responsibility for the Strategic Management Initiative, an integral part of which is quality of service to users of public services. A primary function of my brief is to develop and implement a package of measures designed to make public organisations more accountable, more efficient and effective and, crucially, more responsive to the needs of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it critical that structures are put in place to implement change to ensure that these systems and structures are reviewed on an ongoing basis and, most importantly, that customers of <Col N="42" /> public services are provided with clear and easy-to-use means of redress.  This is especially important in my appointment to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications whose wide variety of commercial State companies will constitute a key part in the improvement in the delivery of service to the public, to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>I was particularly impressed with some of the findings and recommendations of the recent National Economic and Social Forum report on quality delivery of social services published last February.  While primarily relating to the provision of social services, the report is of direct concern to everybody as most of its findings and recommendations can be applied to the provision of all public services.  The forum reports that the traditional emphasis on systems and procedures in the public service must be complemented by attention to &ldquo;people, purpose, performance and value for money&rdquo;.  This indicates that we now require a number of strategic initiatives central to which will be the requirement for profound attitudinal and cultural changes in the way we deliver services to the public.</P>
    <P>Proper training and staff development will be imperative, particularly for frontline staff, as will effective leadership, support and commitment from management.  The delivery of the service will have to become much more customer-focused and it must be recognised and accepted by all that quality is a constantly changing target.  What was considered a quality service ten years ago is no longer sufficient or of high enough standard.  Staff consultation, involvement and support are also of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>Integrated action on four fronts will, therefore, be necessary for the delivery of a quality service.  The first is quality of communications.  This would embrace such areas as formal consultation processes being established through, for instance, customer service advisory groups comprised of customers, representatives of customer organisations as well as representatives of staff and <Col N="43" /> management with customer perceptions and expectations being regularly surveyed and customers being kept informed of rights and procedures plus mechanisms for complaint and appeal.</P>
    <P>The second is quality of specification, performance indicators and value for money.  A quality service must cover issues such as definition of objectives, priorities and policies, accessibility and availability of service, speed of response, staffing levels and qualifications of staff.  Performance indicators for the delivery of services will need to be developed in consultation with staff representatives and customer service advisory groups.  They will also be initiated so as to provide an examination of existing activities in delivering services.  Value for money concepts in relation to service delivery will comprise economy, efficiency, effectiveness and equity.</P>
    <P>The third is quality of delivery.  A quality service will monitor the delivery method and take action when standards are not met.  Correcting faults and failures are only the first steps in the process. It will be vital also to identify the causes of difficulties and take measures to prevent recurrence.</P>
    <P>The fourth is quality of staff and systems. A quality service can only be delivered by suitably trained and motivated staff supported by good management systems.  The forum recommends that action be taken in the areas of recruitment, motivation, internal communication, training, health and safety, industrial relations and organisational development.  In addition, staff will need to be equipped to deal with two levels of interaction &mdash; one a service provider and the other a guardian against fraud.</P>
    <P>I fully support the NESF report and I am committed to implementing its recommendations as part of the Strategic Management Initiative.</P>
    <P>Another recent timely input into this important area came from the second report to Government of the Co-ordinating Group of Department Secretaries <Col N="44" /> established under the Strategic Management Initiative.  This important initiative was set in train by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and is being continued by the Government. The primary objective of the SMI is to put in place in each Department and public service agency a management process that is focused on ensuring continuous improvements in the performance of the civil and wider public service in relation to the contribution they can make to national development, the provision of services to the public and the efficient and effective use of resources.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating group's mandate was to review existing systems for making decisions, allocating responsibility and ensuring accountability in the Civil Service and to bring forward Government proposals for an integrated programme to modernise the systems and practices in operation and for the consequent modernisation of existing personnel and financial management in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating group dealt in detail with the issue of the delivery of quality services.  Its report identified that the essential task of the Civil Service is to ensure the delivery of high quality services to all those who are the customers and clients of the Civil Service across the whole range of its activities from the provision of policy advice to the delivery of particular services to the public.</P>
    <P>The report considers that the approach to service delivery, whether in dealings with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Telecom Éireann or local authorities to give just a few examples, needs to be clearly focused on achieving specified results to agreed standards and targets and being more open and transparent in its approach. The importance of doing so in the most cost effective manner also needs to be reaffirmed.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for the SMI, I am taking a keen personal interest in implementing the recommendations of the Co-ordinating Group of Department Secretaries.  Deputies will recall <Col N="45" /> the successful debate held in January by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and the total support across the House for the Strategic Management Initiative.  I very much welcome the contributions of Deputies from all sides.  I recommend the report of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to those who were not in a position to join us on that occasion as excellent reading in this most important area.</P>
    <P>Progress in the area of quality service delivery in the public sector can best be achieved through the approach which has underpinned the Strategic Management Initiative from the beginning.  This has focused on the way the Civil Service is managed and not just on plans and implies a strong emphasis on how work is done and value delivered.  This approach will form the basis for the deepening of the Strategic Management Initiative within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A particular focus on customer satisfaction, output quality, the time taken and cost involved in delivering the services in question will provide the basis for measurable assessment of performance. This is the approach I would like to see taken.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating group identified and sought support in the first instance for the adoption and implementation by the Civil Service of new approaches to quality service delivery.  This new approach will be based on the following principles: a specification of the quality of service to be provided by Departments-Offices to their customers, whether internal or external; consultation with and participation by customers on a structured basis; the provision of quality information and advice to customers; reasonable choice for customers in relation to the methods of delivery of services; the integration of public services at local, regional and national level; a comprehensive system of measuring and assessing customer satisfaction involving such issues as customer feedback, questionnaires-surveys, periodic reviews and audits by independent organisations, customer advisory <Col N="46" /> groups and others, and complaints and redress mechanisms which operate close to the point of delivery.  The group recognised the substantial progress which has been made in improving the services delivered in some areas of the Civil Service in recent years and saw its recommendations as underpinning the provision of even better quality services.</P>
    <P>I single out and compliment the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare for the steps they have taken towards improving the quality of the service they offer to their customers.  I understand that the Department of Social Welfare intends to publish shortly fresh initiatives in this area, but already there is ample evidence of a more customer-focused approach in that Department's dealings with members of the public through the development of one-stop-shops in place of the traditional employment exchanges, the facilities to receive payment of benefits from post offices and the easier access to information regarding benefits, but these are only the start.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also taken steps in the area of quality service delivery to their customers with the publication of a charter of rights of those dealing with the Office.  This charter sets out in a clear and concise manner the level of service the customer has a right to expect and covers such issues as access to information, impartiality, privacy and confidentiality, consistency and the right to an independent review. The Revenue Commissioners might consider providing a copy of their excellent charter to their customers on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Publicly articulated, the principles outlined by the co-ordinating group will underpin the provision of a high quality public service in Ireland.  They are geared to achieving a qualitative improvement in service delivery and one which will be perceived as such by the customers of the public service.  This is vital because the reality that a fair and efficient service is being delivered by the Civil Service is lost if the public as <Col N="47" /> customers do not perceive the service received as efficient and helpful.  There is a gap between the perception and the reality which must be closed urgently. An open interaction between community-voluntary organisations and the public service will help create a culture of mutual trust and build a deeper relationship between them in the interest of delivering better public services. Tensions can arise where the Civil Service not only provides a service but also has a regulatory function.  The tension generated by this dual role will be fully addressed in the development of appropriate policy guidelines and, critically, in the training of the civil servants who provide services directly to customers.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the co-ordinating group's recommendation seeking the immediate introduction of a quality service initiative.  This must be based on the principles I outlined and it will be implemented as part of the current phase of the Strategic Management Initiative.  This initiative will provide a new groundwork for enhanced customer focused administrative procedures and these will be appropriately underpinned by a legislative framework. In this regard, I restate the Government's commitment to bring forward legislation in the area of administrative procedures and freedom of information legislation.  These will be an integral part of the overall renewal programme.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating group, involving Department secretaries, also recommended extending the Strategic Management Initiative to the Irish public service in general.  This will involve setting all chief executives of public service bodies, for example, State-sponsored bodies, local authorities and health boards, the task of producing a strategic statement within the Government programme and in the parent departmental context.  This must be completed within 12 months.  An integral part of such a statement will be the focus on customer service and the quality and delivery of same.  Given that such statements will <Col N="48" /> be published and will, therefore, be in the public arena, it places the onus on the organisations in question to deliver on the promises and objectives set out.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, I recently requested an update on the customer service initiatives in existence in the ten commercial and one non-commercial State companies operating under the Department's ageis.  The House will be interested in the details of how some of these companies deal with this important issue.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's customer care initiative has been ongoing since 1986.  A series of quality systems which comply with Irish and international industry standards have been put in place on a company wide basis.  A quality, or &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, mark model documented in 1993 is currently used and each business unit has developed and put in place a quality management system.  Quality agreements were also made between Aer Rianta and the other services that operate from Aer Rianta managed airports.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark model includes a mechanism for dealing with customer complaints.  The procedures include provisions for recording complaints and reporting them to senior management on a monthly basis.  Customer comment cards are placed at convenient locations in airports and collected and acted upon weekly.  Internal audits are carried out by Aer Rianta twice a year to ensure compliance with the quality system. Having obtained the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark in 1992, the company has expressed ambitions to achieve the ISO 9002 standard and ultimately to receive the European Quality Award.  I commend Aer Rianta for its recent work in the area of customer care and quality service delivery.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aviation Authority provides a service to a small, homogeneous group of customers.  The Authority has recently initiated a programme of regular consultation with customers and other measures for customer service.  A variety of customer consultation groups <Col N="49" /> have been established and the possibility of setting up an advisory council to the Authority is currently being considered. In addition, a process of consultation between top management and all major customers began in January 1996. Performance indicators on service level to customers are currently being developed and will be finalised by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has a number of mechanisms to ensure excellent customer service. These include a mission statement which enshrines customer service in its corporate ethos; published service standards for frontline staff; intensive customer service training programmes and an established customer relations department which handles liaison with customers who have problems with any aspect of the company's service.  Aer Lingus considers that, because it works in a competitive service environment, it must pay particular attention to its customers as its success is determined by the marketplace.  The excellent progress made in this area in recent times by Aer Lingus is evident.  It is interesting that the semi-State bodies which operate in a competitive market seem to be well ahead of the rest in relation to customer care.  A strong message is contained in that point.  I also commend Aer Lingus for its excellent attention to quality service delivery.</P>
    <P>It will not come as news to Members or to the public that CIE has not been to the forefront in terms of customer service.  Accordingly, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, recently announced a series of new measures as part of an investment strategy for CIE.  An integral part of this includes the negotiation of a series of public service contracts.  These contracts are a new idea and they will spell out clearly, for the first time, what services the company is required to provide and what the State will pay to support non-commercial services that are socially necessary.  Performances under the contracts will be monitored and the results of that monitoring will be made public. <Col N="50" /> Customers of CIE will, therefore, be able to see, for the first time, what service standards have been set for the company and how it performs against those standards.  I am sure this measure will be welcomed by all customers of CIE.</P>
    <P>The principle of customer service is a central element of An Post's mission statement.  To ensure the attainment of this aim, An Post has employed the Market Research Bureau of Ireland &mdash; MRBI &mdash; to independently monitor elements of its quality of service.  These results are published regularly in the national press.  The performance of its post offices is also monitored and reported to its major customer, the Department of Social Welfare.  An Post has also established a customer care department which responds to customer complaints on an individual basis, both corporately and within the individual businesses of the company.  From the complaints sources of problems are identified and, as far as possible, rectified.</P>
    <P>In response to Minister Lowry's request in June 1995 for a review of An Post, the company appointed Price Waterhouse to make recommendations on its role, method of operation and effectiveness.  The report contains over 400 recommendations on such matters as quality of service and strengthening of management.  The board of An Post accepted the report as a framework for the future direction of the company and the recommendations are being implemented.  A new business plan will be put in place and will include a number of initiatives, including the production of customer charters for its businesses together with customer service quality committees throughout the company.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Minister Lowry, has reported our concerns in relation to the still unacceptable delays in the delivery of mail in certain areas and the service provided by An Post.  While I accept that measures are in place, which have resulted in a situation where the quality of service has reached the level which <Col N="51" /> existed prior to operational changes introduced in 1994 &mdash; a figure of 90 per cent next day delivery has been published &mdash; there are many difficulties regarding the delivery of mail in the Dublin area.  The company is currently addressing these but Minister Lowry and I have expressed our ongoing concern. The Minister reported our mutual concerns to the Cabinet in recent days about the ongoing delivery problems. Apparently, only 10 per cent of the public do not receive next day delivery service, I meet many of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to accept that 90 per cent of the public receive a next day delivery service, Members who raise their concerns about the quality of service from An Post must meet all the remaining 10 per cent.  I must accept the figures which, apparently, were arrived at by an independent service.  However, the 10 per cent is very vocal and those people are most unhappy with the quality of the postal service in terms of next day and time of day delivery.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised at Cabinet level by my colleague, Minister Lowry. As a result, it has been agreed that I will undertake a special mission to determine the extent and cause of the problem and examine what proposals are in place and if they are sufficient to resolve it or whether we need to go further to determine the cause of the difficulties and the necessary resolution.  The Minister will make a statement later today on this initiative sponsored by the Government in relation to the delivery of services by An Post.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann has a number of customer service initiatives under way at present.  A customer charter is in preparation and the company intends to finalise it in the near future.  It will be sent to all its customers and will detail the levels of service which customers can expect from Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past number of years its call centres have been running a programme <Col N="52" /> of customer satisfaction measurement, the results of which are used to improve operations.  It has established five customer panels made up of representatives of its various customer groupings. These panels meet in various locations around the country.  The company has also invested resources in training its frontline staff to meet its customers' needs.  I recognise recent improvements in customer service care from Telecom Éireann.  It still has a road to travel and I encourage it in its endeavours.</P>
    <P>A recent consultants' report reviewed quality of service as an integral component in Bord Gáis Éireann's competitiveness in the energy market.  The recommendations of the report have been accepted and a chain management initiative, including a comprehensive strategy for customer service, is in the first stages of implementation.  For a range of customer groupings, a series of benchmarks and targets have been set within a phased timetable.  Customer satisfaction with various aspects of the service features strongly as a benchmark and a mechanism for monitoring and reporting progress is to be set up in the first half of this year.  Time is running out.</P>
    <P>An existing system of complaints monitoring is to be given a higher profile to encourage staff ownership of registered complaints.  In the longer term a comprehensive complaints management system will be established.  The consultants' report recommended the production of a customer charter for Bord Gáis at a later stage in the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>The ESB has a number of structures in place to deal with the issue of customer service.  Fundamental to its treatment of customers is its consumer charter which was issued in 1989 to all its customers.  I do not believe I have ever seen it.  The charter, which is under review at present, specifies the standards of service customers can expect in dealing with the ESB.  The company employs independent consultants to track complaints to test its achievement of the targets set out in the customer <Col N="53" /> charter and compare it with the other utilities.  Its information technology system allows complaints to be devolved to the first point of contact in regional offices.  The ESB, in common with other State-sponsored bodies, will face a new liberalised market in the years ahead. Among other things competition will force the company to pay greater attention to the issue of customer service.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna focuses on product quality rather than customer service.  All its factories have the ISO 9000 and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark quality awards and there is a continuous process of new product development. It carries out regular customer surveys and is in the process of adopting a set of company values the first of which is responsibility to customers. This must lead to a greater degree of commitment to customers.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are two bodies with which I do not have time to deal.</P>
    <P>All the companies in question have in place, to a greater or lesser extent, some mechanism for dealing with the issue of customer service.  It comes as no surprise that those companies which are operating in a competitive environment, where there is a choice of suppliers, appear to have put the customer first.  If they fail to do so, they run the risk of losing customers and market share with consequent loss of revenue and profitability. In that sense competition and choice is good for all customers in the public sector.</P>
    <P>But not all our commercial State companies are operating in competitive environments and some of them are comparative newcomers to the competitive environment, having operated as monopolies since their inception.  These will, therefore, need to devote considerable attention to the issue of delivery of a quality customer service.  The adage of &ldquo;the customer is king&rdquo; is very true and with further deregulation and increased competition, customers can and will choose alternatives when confronted with a standard of service which they consider to be less than satisfactory.  In <Col N="54" /> the era of choice, customers cannot be taken for granted.</P>
    <P>In order to bring about a more focused and integrated approach to this area within the public service at large, I am pleased to inform the House that I am establishing a group chaired by a senior official in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and including representatives from a wide range of commercial State companies. The group's terms of reference will include an in-depth examination of the current state of play in commercial State companies with a view to drafting a code of practice for customer services in the commercial State companies.  I am anxious that we put in place as soon as possible an agreed standard to which all relevant organisations will comply. At some stage in the future legislation may be necessary to ensure the provision of quality services but I am not contemplating that at present.  My preference is to seek a consensus approach to this important issue and to allow for the development of a voluntary code of practice.  I have requested that the group submit to me a draft code of practice for quality service in commercial State companies by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious that, on an annual basis, an independent audit would take place of the current standard of customer service in the commercial State companies.  I would like to make an annual statement to the House on the progress being made by the State companies in implementing a programme of quality service for customers.  What I have outlined above for the commercial State companies is the current baseline and I hope to be able to record major progress when next I report on progress.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would refer to the benefits that can accrue to organisations that pay the necessary attention to the quality of customer service.  As my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has emphasised on numerous occasions, a five strand strategy for the commercial State sector <Col N="55" /> exists comprising competitive not monopoly pricing, effective management of change involving quantifiable performance measurement, emphasis on long-term strategy rather than short-term tactics and, most importantly, customers. It is a <i>sine qua non</i> that, in today's increasingly competitive environment, unless you are fully customer driven your future is one of decline. Customer focus and delivery of a quality service can be the main engine in companies achieving and sustaining real growth.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my regret at any inconvenience caused to members of the public as a result of the closure of some Government and public offices on Tuesday 9 April, because of a privilege holiday.  In light of the concerns expressed I wish to again assure public service customers that, in my capacity as Minister with responsibility for customers of public services, I am examining the issue of the availability of public services to ensure that the public receives the continuous quality service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Following adverse publicity at the same time last year over the same issue, I initiated new arrangements in relation to the privilege days.  These arrangements involved a two-strand approach, involving a review by Departments of their opening arrangements at Christmas and Easter and the placing of a single advertisement in the national newspapers detailing those opening arrangements for the benefit of public service customers.  I am pleased to note that as a result of the former initiative, as well as the largest Civil Service offices and Departments with which the general public would have considerable contact on an ongoing basis, there were a number of additional offices open on the day in question compared to Easter Tuesday last year.  These included, for example, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork and the Government Publication Sales office.  There should be cover in all Department and Offices on Easter Tuesday.  That does not mean all <Col N="56" /> public servants must be in place.  They are entitled to their day's leave but not all on the same day.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, anxious to ensure that, when there is to be an unavoidable reduction in the level of public services available, the customers of those services are made fully aware of the relevant arrangements.  In order to meet this objective and as part of the second strand of the approach I have already outlined, I arranged for an advertisement, setting out the opening arrangements for Government Departments and offices over the Easter period, to be placed in the national newspapers in the run-up to the Easter holiday.</P>
    <P>I again emphasise my determination to ensure that our public service becomes much more customer-orientated and customer-driven.  For this to happen, the necessary structures and initiatives need to be put in place to deliver on the commitments covering public service reform contained in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> Similar ideas are also referred to in the recommendations of both the National Economic and Social Forum and the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries established by the Government under the Strategic Management Initiative. We must be honest enough to admit and accept that the level of service offered in the past by all &mdash; in that I include those appointed and elected public servants &mdash; and currently by many, has not always been of the highest standard. Much more attention and emphasis need to be devoted to it so as to develop a more vibrant and responsive service to the public.  We as public servants are not ends in ourselves, we are the means to an end &mdash; the delivery of quality service. The change will not happen overnight, it will take time to implement and get right, but we cannot wait forever.  Significant attitudinal and cultural change will need to be adopted and public servants at all levels will be expected to buy into and support changes to the traditional way of delivering services to the public.</P>
    <P>I am determined that this new process <Col N="57" /> will involve all players from the outset and that staff at all levels of the public service will have an input into whatever changes are discussed and eventually agreed.  Any new system that is imposed from the top down is doomed to failure.  There is a challenge here for us all, but one which the public will thank us for if we take it up and deliver quality services to our customers.  They deserve nothing less and I will endeavour to ensure that they get the very best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two brief comments on the Minister's long speech.  On the independent survey carried out on behalf of An Post &mdash; as an independent survey I have to accept it &mdash; the 10 per cent of people who do not receive their mail on the day after it is posted must live in Wexford, and some in Limerick, I being one of them.  I am delighted the Minister has cast a jaundiced eye on that survey.  This matter needs to be considered more closely. Perhaps the people conducting the survey did not ask the right questions.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned charters, and apparently there is a commitment to introduce further charters and update some of those already in existence.  At present there are charters for taxpayers, hospital patients, occupants of rented accommodation and farmers and for the past 12 months we have been awaiting a charter for crime victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be next.  We will arrive at a stage where there are as many charters as there are famous Blarney stones, and they are about half as useful.  The effect of charters in practice is nil.  In a professional capacity I represent a number of people, particularly taxpayers, and in a political capacity I represent a number of other groups for whom charters have been made available, but those charters have no basis in law.  People cannot take legal action <Col N="58" /> based on charters.  They are mere pie-in-the-sky, pious, platitudinal, aspirational documents which read very well but have no effect whatever in practice.  I do not object to them, they do no harm, but from my experince of charters, both in a professional and political capacity, they certainly do no good.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Finance Bill is to give statutory effect to the tax changes introduced in the budget.  I am on record as stating, without intending a personal insult to the Minister for Finance or his civil servants, that I regard the budget as basically fraudulent and directionless.  It follows therefore that the Finance Bill, which is based on the budget, can hardly be otherwise.  One point &mdash; it may be a minor point to some people &mdash; which has not been made relates to the general structure and content of the Finance Bill.  I have read the Finance Bill and as far as I can see it adds a further 144 pages of mainly mind-numbing complexity to the arcane jigsaw puzzle for the taxation code.  All Ministers for Finance pay lip service to the notion of simplicity and clarity in the tax system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>All Ministers for Finance pay lip service to the notion of simplicity and clarity in the tax system.  For the past quarter of a century they have felt compelled at one time or other to mutter some mantra about simplifying the tax code and the present Government has been particularly voluble in this regard.  There was supposed to be a policy of openness, transparency and accountability &mdash; it was a subplot of the general plot.  The promise to simplify the tax code has proved as hollow as the promise to conduct the affairs of Government behind a pane of glass. This Finance Bill plays no small part in the further complication of the tax code. No effort is spared to add mystery to mystery, complications are heaped on complications and fine distinctions which already exist in the tax code are further refined and in many cases increased and multiplied.</P>
      <P>For all but a small coterie of skilled accountants and tax advisers the taxation system has become an impenetrable maze.  Many of the complications introduced by this Bill have no basis whatever in logic.  In many cases they fly in the face of logic and common sense.  They will not encourage enterprise and risk-taking; they will stultify and restrict it in many instances, which I will demonstrate if time permits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn, the Minister for Finance, is on record as saying that we must let the light in, we must simplify and clarify our tax code.  I will give some examples of what he means by simplification of the tax code and letting in the light.  Section 29 (4) which deals with mining relief states in terms of qualifying mines:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> The amount of the allowance shall be an amount determined by the formula&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>E × N/12 × 1/L</P>
    <P>Those figures and letters are explained and some of them are subject to a number of other qualifications.  Section 37 (2) of this Bill that is supposed to let in the light and simplify the tax system states in dealing with corporation tax relief, which is ludicrous&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply accountancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am an accountant and for any member of the public this is not simple.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of subsection (1) and subject to subsections (3) and (4), the specified amount in relation to an accounting period of a company shall be an amount determined by the formula&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>£50,000 × N/12 × 1/A</P>
      <P>Section 125 (3) (a) which deals with stock relief states:</P>
      <P>In any case where subsection (2) (a) applies, a person's increase in stock value in the accounting period shall be determined for the purposes of section 122 by the formula:</P>
      <P>A (C-O)</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>N</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means something to me but it means nothing to the general public whom we are supposed to represent.  It does not represent a simplification of the tax code.  I would say to the Minister of State who talked about delivery of service to the public that what we should try to deliver to the taxpayers is a rational, clear tax system to which <Col N="61" /> they can have access and which they can understand to some degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome extra work, but we are supposed to represent taxpayers as a whole and the Finance Bill should be drafted in such a way that the public at least understands the rudiments of what is involved.</P>
      <P>The core of the Finance Bill is sections 1 to 3, inclusive, which deal with increases in tax free allowances and tax exemption levels and widening of the tax bands.  The changes introduced in these sections and the way they have been represented are nothing less than a fraudulent charade.  This Bill has been represented as a tax reduction measure, but the net effect of those measures will be to extract an extra £730 million from taxpayers in 1996 over and above what they handed over in 1995.</P>

The reality is they extract another £730 million from taxpayers in 1996 over and above what they paid in 1995.  If the Labour Party persists in ignoring that fundamental fact, it will have certain consequences next February or March or whenever it has the guts to face the people.</P>

The increase in taxation yield of 8.2 per cent in the total volume of taxation is in addition to a 7.5 per cent increase in volume in 1995 over 1994.  Using simple arithmetic, £730 million in a full year represents £2 million per day or an average of £14 per week for every taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The figures in the principal features of the budget give examples of families who, in terms of gross income, will be better off, depending on their circumstances, by the following princely amounts: 0.7 per cent; 0.7 of 1 per cent; 0.6 of 1 per cent; 2 per cent; 1.9 per cent; 1.8 per cent; 1.7 per cent; 1.5 per cent; 0.8 of 1 per cent, etc.  However, the principal features do not factor in the mortgage and VHI changes and when that is done the relevant figures fall to amounts such as a quarter of 1 per cent; 0.2 of 1 per cent and 0.1 of 1 per cent.</P>

    <P>Section 37 implements the budgetary promise to reduce corporation tax from <Col N="63" /> 38 per cent to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of corporate profits.  I welcome any tax reduction, particularly a reduction in corporate tax, because our rates of corporation tax are very much in excess of the rates in most of the countries with which we trade.  It is necessary to reduce corporation tax and I welcome any move in that direction but the approach adopted by the Minister for Finance is weak-minded and will lead in many cases to a reckless squandering of taxpayers' money.  The maximum tax saving from this measure will be £4,000 &mdash; 8 per cent of £50,000 is £4,000 &mdash; but the problem with it and the way it is drafted is that it applies to all companies, regardless of size or profitability. For example, among the companies which will benefit from this munificence will be Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Cement Roadstone, Smurfit, Fyffes, Avonmore and Elan. Those companies will receive a gift of £4,000 from the taxpayers but the directors of some of those companies are paid approximately £4,000 per day.</P>
    <P>This measure will cost taxpayers the not inconsiderable sum of £23 million and much of that will be dissipated needlessly through paying out £4,000 to people who do not need it and to companies such as those I have mentioned where it will obviously have no effect. The Government, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners could have displayed a scintilla of imagination by focusing this £23 million on areas where it could most benefit the economy in terms of creating and maintaining employment, which is the stated ojective of the measure.  If the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners could not devise a more imaginative way than this of spending £23 million in corporation tax reductions, they should have examined the S corporation system in the United States and adopted some variation of that appropriate to the needs of this country.  Why squander a large part of this money on areas where it is not <Col N="64" /> needed?  It should be spent in areas where it will have an effect.</P>

      <P>Section 27 amends the law relating to tax relief on patents.  As Deputy Cullen rightly said, over a long period of time we have been treated to continuous homilies about the need for industry to invest in innovation.  We are told that unless we invest in research and development and innovation we will fall further behind because that is the only way we can be competitive in today's world.  I recently received a glossy White Paper from the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, outlining the money the Government is spending on research and development, directly and indirectly.  Successive <Col N="65" /> Governments have been conscious of this but I do not believe they have spent enough in this area.  Other measures were put in place, however, which assisted innovation, one of which is section 34 of the Finance Act, 1973, which allows patent royalties to be distributed tax free in certain circumstances. This measure has had a beneficial impact in relation to innovation. It was not perfect; it had to be amended in 1992 and 1994 but it is now exclusively confined to the manufacturing sector. Apart from those misuses &mdash; I will confine myself to using that term &mdash; of the section 34 relief that were identified and plugged in 1992 and 1994, no other abuse has been identified.  The case has not been made that there is a need to restrict it further yet it is severely restricted in section 27 of the Finance Bill for reasons which remain a mystery to me and which the Minister has not explained.  I hope he gives an explanation when replying to the debate or changes his mind in this matter.</P>
      <P>Section 34 of the Finance Act, 1973, has rewarded innovation.  There has not been any evidence adduced that it was used as a tax avoidance mechanism.  It was more clearly focused in 1992 and 1994 and it is now confined to manufacturing. This tax concession, which has served the economy well and which is of major relevance today, has now been severely constrained in section 27 of this Bill.  I want the Minister to give a reason for that in his reply.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, there is a let-out clause in section 27 and while I welcome any let-out clause, I cannot understand how this one will work in practice.  The restriction in section 27 will not apply if the Revenue Commissioners determine that the invention patented constitutes &ldquo;radical innovation&rdquo;. The Revenue Commissioners are the last people I would consult about what constitutes radical innovation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is not aware that in order to get a patent, the applicant must consult a patent agent and make a presentation to the Patents Office.  It is on the advice and preparation of one's application by a patent agent whose qualifictions are recognised by statute and on the sanction of the Patents Office that one gets a patent.  If the Revenue Commissioners want advice on this surely they will not ask an official in the office to determine on his or her initiative whether something is a radical innovation.  They would need to hand it to a patent agent, that is, get advice from the experts in this small area.  The Revenue Commissioners will need to consult patent agents to second guess other agents or the Patents Office.  It does not make sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, but the Patents Office does because it determines this.  Although the Patents Office may say something is an invention, the Revenue Commissioners now must ask a patent agent, other than the one who <Col N="67" /> made the original application which was upheld, if it is a radical invention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners want advice, they must go to another patent agent who will second guess the first agent and the Patents Office.  This is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have ample power to audit a company or concern to ensure that the payment of patent royalties is bona fide and not a type of transfer pricing arrangement.  There is a general anti-avoidance section in the 1989 Finance Act where measures taken, with their main purpose being tax avoidance, can be deemed null and void and nugatory by the Revenue Commissioners. The effect of the blunderbuss approach taken by the Government in this section is that a small manufacturer who discovers a new way to make or refine his product will be penalised.  Why should that be that case when these people are creating employment and engaging in innovation?  Why should foreign companies, a number of which have come to Limerick &mdash; for example, Analog, Dell and AST, which have brought their R&amp;D to Ireland, be penalised, particularly when they will often be in competition with their parent company where there is a more generous regime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 25 deals with the restriction on relief for resort areas.  In last year's Finance Act the Government introduced tax concessions for expenditure incurred in certain resort areas.  This relief was supposed to continue until 30 June 1998.  However, section 25 changed the goalposts after one year.  People who were told to go ahead and to spend money because this relief was in place now find that it has been restricted after one year.  I know there is a clause relating to those who got planning permission before a certain date, but the Minister should bear in mind that other people who might not have availed of this relief incurred expenditure as a <Col N="68" /> result of the relief announced in the 1995 Finance Act.  Where does this leave these people?  I do not understand how the legislation has been framed.  It proposes to ring-fence the capital allowances on two categories of expenditure &mdash; expenditure on holiday homes and self-catering apartments.  By what monumental process of logic has this decision been reached?  Why have holiday homes and self-catering apartments been singled out?  Other tourist facilities mentioned in the 1995 Act, such as hotels and guest houses, which are also beneficiaries of the relief have not been so restricted.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are armed with a vast array of powers and if they are worried about abuse they can secure the services of Bord Fáilte to check this matter out.  I have information that Bord Fáilte has already hired a Welsh company based in Cardiff to do this.  It seems those on the left of this Government are afraid that the 1995 relief has proved too successful and that people are making or might make money.  As I said, profit is a dirty word.  The restriction in section 25 is needless tinkering which adds significantly and unnecessarily to the overall complexity of tax legislation.  It restricts investment where it is more clearly needed.</P>
    <P>The changes in the BES add another layer of bureaucracy.  The investment proposed is over £250,000 and one must get a certificate from a State agency to certify that one is adding significantly to employment.  This adds another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to this complex area, as those who have worked in it or who have applied for relief will know.  Film relief has been restricted in an incomprehensible way. Now only 80 per cent of one's investment qualifies for tax relief.  The holding period of capital gains tax has been reduced from three years to one year. There are, however, improvements in that some amounts have been increased &mdash; for example, for corporate investment. One approach contradicts the other.  If this was being abused &mdash; no <Col N="69" /> evidence has been adduced &mdash; one would understand certain restrictions. However, there has been no explanation as to whether something has gone wrong.  Apparently it has been a success. There are restrictions on one side and improvements on the other which seem to contradict each other.  It has been heavily criticised by people working in the industry.  Those investing and their advisers have intelligently, cogently and comprehensively criticised these restrictions which they say have no logical basis and which will have disastrous consequences in practice.</P>
    <P>I will not lower myself to comment on section 5 which deals with tax relief for people over 65 years who install an alarm system.  It is like an unfunny Irish joke.  Some changes have been made to capital gains tax, but it is largely tinkering. This and successive Government have failed to recognise that we have gone beyond the law of diminishing returns as regards the rate of capital gains tax.  There would be a greater yield to the Exchequer if capital gains tax was set at realistic levels.  I know people who have engaged in once-off investments and lost their money.  The Revenue Commissioners did not come to their doors to sympathise with them but had the risk been successful, they would have looked for 40 per cent of the profit.  That is an inordinately high figure.  Academic papers have been written on this which have mainly related to the United Kingdom and which stated that the rate of capital gains tax is way beyond the law of diminishing returns.  That is why &mdash; I believe the Minister will readily admit this &mdash; there is wholesale evasion of capital gains tax.  Who wants to take a risk and then fork out 40 per cent if they are lucky?</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, like the budget on which it is based, is lacklustre and directionless. It reflects the ideological conflict within the Government and is a typical example of Government by committee. The hand of Democratic Left is evident.  Some 2 per cent of the electorate support Democratic Left, yet its <Col N="70" /> view is paramount in formulating economic policy.  Presumably the 98 per cent of the electorate who do not support Democratic Left do not agree with its economic policies which are, in large measure, being implemented.  This is surely a negation of democracy &mdash; it is the very antithesis of democracy.</P>
    <P>The left, in particular Democratic Left, will continue to insist on spending taxpayers' money with all the gay abandon of French aristocrats before the revolution. Fine Gael has been neutered or, to use the words of one of its distinguished parliamentary party members, castrated.  Never since the Bolsheviks seized control of the Soviet economy has so much been inflicted on so many by so few.  This Finance Bill represents merely a fine tuning &mdash; a tinkering &mdash; with a taxation system which is complex, confused and gets more aggressive and penal with each year that passes.</P>

Will the Taoiseach explain the reason there was no official commemoration to mark the bicentenary of the Bantry Bay Expedition by way of a stamp or attendance at the opening of the recent exhibition at Bantry Bay?  Many of the groups involved believe that because of our close involvement with France, our <Col N="71" /> EU partner, who did participate, we should in some way commemorate that event.</P>

      <P>I understand that the philatelic advisory committee which advises the Government regularly on stamp programmes did consider this matter but did not recommend that a stamp be struck to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bantry Bay Expedition.  I would make the point, however, that this particular epoch in our history which did involve France will be commemorated as part of the broader 1798 200th anniversary celebrations. I think the Bantry Bay Expedition needs to be seen in that wider context.  I will ensure that as part of the broader 1798 commemorations special account is taken of the slightly earlier naval expedition led by Admiral Hoche.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that information.  Many people thought it was part of the Government's policy of dropping history not to commemorate these events.  Is there any plan to issue a stamp to mark the 350th anniversary of Owen Roe O'Neill's famous confederation victory at the Battle of Benburb?  I asked about this last year. We commemorated the Battle of Fontenoy and it intrigues my historian colleagues why we commemorated that battle and not what was probably the most famous battle of 1646.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the Deputy should raise that.  I asked that question about a year ago.  I raised the question of commemorating the Battle of Benburb which was significant, as the Deputy correctly stated, during the confederation wars of the 1640s.  I cannot recollect the detailed answer I was given on that occasion but I did have the same interest as that expressed by the Deputy.  As far as I can recollect, we were advised &mdash; I am speaking from memory &mdash; that there was a possibility <Col N="72" /> as there were two sides to that battle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it might be considered to be divisive by some of the population in Ulster.  That is not a reason for not commemorating events, as long as the commemoration is done in a way that emphasises that people fighting on both sides in these battles fought out of a sense of what they thought was a just cause.  Now, in the light of history and with the passage of time, we can appreciate that more fully. I agree with the Deputy's concern to ensure we remember events of this kind. It is important that we should remember it in a healing way and not in a way that seeks to demonstrate the rightness of one side in any battle at the expense of another side.  From the point of view of the European dimension, it is important to remember that all war is disgusting and involves the most appalling sacrifice of human lives.  As one who saw, for example, the recent television programme about the Battle of Culloden in 1746 I realise what a savage event this was and yet only in the region of 1,500 people were killed in that battle.  In the Battle of Aughrim, fought on our soil, 9,000 people were killed.  The largest loss of life ever in war either in Britain or Ireland took place at the Battle of Aughrim.  Those people died in the most appalling pain and suffering.  The lesson from all of this recollection of battles past must be not to celebrate the battle as much as to ensure we create structures and conditions to ensure that such battles never occur not alone in this country but in this continent ever again.</P>

      <P>In respect of the FCA I do not understand why it was not possible to have a commemorative medal to mark the 50th anniversary of its formation. My colleague, Deputy Michael Kitt, tabled a question on that issue recently and it was ruled out of order. My view on wars is similar to that of the Taoiseach, but they are part of our history. I did not agree with the Chinese Revolution but I know the Government is trying to remove history as a core subject from our educational system.  I merely asked why we could commemorate the Battle of Fontenoy and not commemorate the 350th anniversary of Owen Roe O'Neill's famous victory of the Battle of Benburb which was the most important battle of that period. Such events are of historical interest to many people.  The Government sets out the guidelines for commemorating them and makes the final decisions.  Some of them were terrible events but they are part of what we are.  Our ancestors were involved in them.  As I stated when we debated the issue previously, I would have no difficulty with Orangemen commemorating 1690 in O'Connell Street and would attend such a commemoration. Neither have I any objection to saving Sir Edward Carson's house. However, I do not like the selective way in which some events are placed on the agenda and others dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not dropped some events in favour of others.  I indicated already that the Bantry Bay <Col N="74" /> expedition, which did not land, will be commemorated as part of the overall 1798 commemoration.  I also indicated that commemorating the Battle of Benburb was raised but a decision was taken not to do so and I have outlined, to my best recollection, the reasons given for that.</P>
      <P>It is important to strike a balance in commemorating warlike events.  In all wars there are winners and losers and in all battles there are victors and vanquished. We must also strike a balance in commemorating events that are not of a warlike character.  For example, this year we will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Michael Davitt, who achieved an enormous amount for this country without the use of violence.  He transformed agricultural conditions and the dignity of people working on the land by non-violent pressure.  Commemorating Michael Davitt's birth will commemorate the effectiveness of non-violent, but firm, protest in conjunction, of course, with the commemoration of events from other traditions and activities.  This year we will hold a special commemoration for the 80th anniversary of 1916.  When all events are considered in conjunction with one another, I am sure the Deputy will realise a reasonable balance is being struck.  Irrespective of the judgment or selection one makes on events to be commemorated, we cannot commemorate all of them.  Choices based on judgements must be made and they will be open to criticism.  I do not have any difficulty with criticism, but we must bear in mind that irrespective of what judgement is made it will be open to criticism. Hindsight is a very exact science.</P>

      <P>That is correct, but he may have got it right.  Michael Davitt advocated non-violence in agrarian matters. That tenet dated from his injury during a sad childhood.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I want the social partnership process to be as inclusive as possible.  I have received requests from a number of organisations for inclusion in the Central Review Committee which monitors the implementation of national programmes but it is not possible to accommodate all of these.</P>
      <P>The existing committee is working well and I have no plans to change it. However, I intend to ensure that in the preparation of any new programme, mechanisms will be developed to allow for a contribution from a wider number of groups than at present, including ISME.  Contributions by these groups would be limited to particular areas of direct relevance to their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inputs of NESC and NESF in developing a framework for any new national programme have been sought. I have requested the council of NESC to prepare a strategy report which will inform the negotiations on any new programme and the NESF, which has an even wider range of representation than the NESC, has also been invited to prepare a report on the elements and consultative process for a new programme. The INOU &mdash; the organisation for the <Col N="77" /> unemployed &mdash; is represented on both NESC and NESF.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by a number of social partners as to a new programme and the need to develop the partnership approach at company level. Social partnership as a whole has served Ireland well.  Taxation changes, including increased allowances, widened bands and other improvements such as increases in children's allowance over the last three budgets, have contributed to increased net real pay, and most significantly for those on low pay with families. For example, between 1993 and 1995 net real pay, for a married single-earner household with two children on the average manufacturing wage, has increased by 5.4 per cent, and for a similar family on three quarters of this wage, the increase has been almost twice that at 9.8 per cent.  As partnership has served the country well, it would be unwise for Government, employers, farmers and trade union members to abandon it lightly to return to local bargaining. However, the Government will be concerned to ensure that the terms of any new national programme will meet the economy's need for competitiveness and continued fiscal responsibility in the interests of tackling unemployment and meeting the European Monetary Union criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that, increasingly, the CRC is seen as an insider's club where the traded sector in the economy is not represented and that giving ISME consultative status is not appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All the participants in the Central Review Committee represent the traded sector of the economy. It is important to point out that the trade union movement represents the traded sector of the economy to a great extent given that many trade union members are in this sector and that their jobs depend on the competitiveness of the economy.  IBEC clearly represents the traded sector of the economy and its delegation includes the Small Firms' <Col N="78" /> Association which is part of the traded sector of the economy at the smaller and more vulnerable end.  We all recognise that the farming community which is represented is affected in the same way by developments in the traded sector as any other occupation.  It is affected by changes in taxation, interest rates etc., in the same way as businesses in other sectors.  The traded sector is represented on the Central Review Committee and the Government, as a partner, has a responsibility to take account of the needs of this sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of ISME representation on 30 January and I dealt extensively with it at that time.  There is not much advantage in repeating what I said then beyond saying that following that question a very useful meeting took place between ISME and the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Peter Cassells has said that any new agreement will have to be radical while Bill Attley has said the party is over.  Does the Taoiseach agree that any new agreement must be radically different in nature?  ISME and the INOU should not be on the outside looking in at previous participants in agreements.  Does the Taoiseach agree it would be much better for all groups to look after the needs of society rather than give them a consultative role, which seems to be the intention in regard to ISME and the INOU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed is represented on the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum, both of which have been specifically asked to make an input to the basis for negotiating a new national agreement.  Other organisations are also seeking inclusion but if one admits one organisation there are demands for others to be included.  For example, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland are seeking separate representation. If one admits one additional organisation three or four other organisations will say they have as good a case <Col N="79" /> for inclusion.  Having looked back on what happened, the existing system has worked well.  It is important to point out that since social partnership was instituted economic growth has been 21 per cent while, during an equivalent period prior to social partnership, it was only 1.2 per cent.  Other factors such as international interest rates affected the earlier period.  During the period prior to social partnership the net take home pay for a single person fell by 7 per cent while in the period since social partnership the net take home pay for a single person has increased in real terms by 20 per cent.  Similar examples could be quoted for married people.  From the point of view of trade union members, the record in terms of actual take home pay, disposable income in the light of inflation, has been good under the social partnership model and the existing CRC arrangement.  I am reluctant to change arrangements which are working reasonably well, if it is not broken do not fix it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of negotiations in Northern Ireland the Taoiseach rightly advocates the idea of inclusiveness and emphasises the importance of everyone being involved. It is important that social partnership is as inclusive as possible.  Will the Taoiseach accept that it is not inclusive if key sectors of the economy are outside the process or treated as second rate players in it?  Will he further accept that if we are to have a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; and I favour social partnership on balance &mdash; it must be based on real tax reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are degrees of involvement which are appropriate depending on the size and representative character of particular organisations. We have tried to strike a balance by allowing a larger number of organisations into the NESF than are in the NESC and by allowing a larger number of organisations into the NESC than are <Col N="80" /> in the Central Review Committee.  All those organisations are involved in the process, other organisations which are in none of those three bodies have been invited to make submissions and will be consulted by the CRC and others who are directly involved in the process.  One must be realistic and accept that there is a trade off between representation and efficacy.  If a huge number of organisations is involved it will be difficult to get agreement.  The smaller the number of organisations the easier it is to get agreement.  It is easier to get agreement between two organisations than between three organisations and it is easier to get agreement between three organisations than five organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing what a car and driver can do.  I am concerned that the bigger players, such as the main social partners, are the ones inside.  The smaller groups who are knocking at the door and demanding entry should be fully included in the forum where the decisions are made.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Harney about the need to reform taxation.  However, will the Taoiseach agree that a reduction in unemployment should be the main focus of the next programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will strike an appropriate balance between the divergent opinions expressed by the Opposition parties on the appropriate priority of tax reform and employment creation.  The two complement one another.  Tax reform assists in employment creation but obviously it has to be done in a way that takes particular account of the needs of the low paid, because it is the take-home pay of the law paid that is important in terms of establishing an incentive to work for families.  We will take that into account in the work we are doing, and have done <Col N="82" /> so.  The Government has put particular emphasis on the position of families in its work.  For example, there has been a 45 per cent increase in child benefit since this Government came to office, the largest increase ever in child benefit. I would make the point that, in looking at take-home pay and the disposable income of families on PAYE, the abolition of third level fees would be worth up to £2,000 a year to families with children in third level education.  That is a very substantial improvement in the annual budget of families.  It is important that that should be taken into account in making calculations about real income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I always like to hear the Taoiseach announce how much he has changed his opinions on social partnership since he went over to that side of the House.  I would like him to consider a point I made before about ISME.  I accept what the Taoiseach has said about the number of groups.  From March 1987 to December 1994 I was a Minister in two different Departments, including the one centrally involved in the social partnership concept and in the partial success of it &mdash; not everything about it was a success.  At that stage the CII, the Federation of Irish Industries, and the Federated Union of Employers were the two employer bodies.  They amalgamated and many of the people who were in those organisations, mainly in the FUE, split away to form ISME <Col N="83" /> because they believed their interests were not being represented.  ISME is still fighting the case.  The SFA was formed as a reaction to that and, I am sure, is doing a very good job within IBEC.  It is not increasing the numbers. All we are advocating is giving representation to ISME by returning the position to what it was prior to the formation of IBEC.  That is the case as articulated by ISME and it is totally consistent.  The people who represented the small industry associations in all my early discussions and with whom I dealt for four years were the people who are now the central figures in ISME.  They are the people who are seeking representation and that should be considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is historically accurate. I raised this issue before and the Taoiseach said he would look into it but never came back to me.  Regarding my second question, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> promised workers that, in line with the Government's concern with taxation and employment, the proportion of tax on income as a share of revenue would be reduced.  The Taoiseach will agree that the proportion of direct tax as a share of total revenue was reduced in my last budget from 39 per cent to 36 per cent. This Government, in its two budgets so far, has let the proportion rise again in breach of its commitments under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> by giving no worthwhile tax relief. Will the Taoiseach accept that this is what is causing the present large-scale unrest throughout the country?  How is he going to address it?  It is hopeless to have his Minister for Finance talking about what he intends to do in the next <Col N="84" /> budget when we have not yet ratified the legislation following what he did in his last budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to be accurate about this.  The people to whom the Deputy is referring have seen an improvement in their take home pay in all cases.  The level of mortgage payment that they are paying each month is about £100 per month less on average than it was in the early 1990s.  Third level fees are being abolished and child benefit has been increased by 45 per cent. All of these are direct benefits in addition to the increase in net take-home pay that people in that category have.  That needs to be taken into account.  It has arisen not by accident or as a result of the munificence of the Government but because we have had industrial stability, a climate for investment growth and responsible management of the public finances which has led to low interest rates.  The formula has worked from the point of view of the people concerned.  They are better off now than they were last year, and they were better off last year than they were the year before.  It is important that people should recognise that that prosperity is a direct result of social partnership and of arrangements that are working well.</P>
      <P>As far as ISME is concerned, the Small Firms Association which is part of the CII existed prior to the amalgamation of the CII and the FUE to form IBEC.  The Deputy will recollect that the chief executive of the Small Firms Association is now the chief executive of ISME and that in his first capacity he worked under the CII umbrella.</P>
      <P>I hope what I have to say will be helpful to Deputies, but perhaps it will not be.  I do not want to encourage the splintering of organisations by giving representative capacity or strength in numbers that rewards splitting organisations.</P>

      <P>I was hoping the Taoiseach would take this question.  Would the Minister of State agree that positive action is required to employ people in the worst affected areas?  If this is not within the remit of the Minister of State, will he consider raising with the relevant Ministers the possibility of setting aside a certain proportion of jobs within the public sector and anywhere else the Government can exercise influence for qualified applicants from areas of high unemployment?  This is a scheme, raised by the social partners on a number of occasions, on which we had been working for some time.  If the Minister of State can answer my question, well and good but, if not, perhaps he would take it up with the relevant Minister.</P>

      <P>We shall have that matter examined but, in the context of the 1991 figures available, some 198 out of a total of 3,500 district electoral divisions had an unemployment rate in excess of 30 per cent, as shown in the table circulated with my reply.  In regard to the forthcoming Census to be held on the last Sunday of this month, it will be interesting to see how the most recent figures relate to those returned in the 1991 Census.  I will bring the point made by the Deputy to the attention of the relevant Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="95" /> only source of comprehensive information on employment and unemployment is the Labour Force Survey which covers annually a sample of about 45,000 households.</P>
      <P>Some direct sectoral surveys of businesses and other employers are conducted more frequently.  For example, the CSO publishes quarterly series on employment in the industrial, financial and public sectors, as well as a monthly index of employment trends in building and construction.</P>
      <P>However, none of these sources provides the economy-wide picture of the current employment situation which the Labour Force Survey does.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the positive feedback from over 100 users of statistics during 1995, the CSO has examined the feasibility and cost of conducting a quarterly household survey covering labour force and other social topics, to replace the existing annual Labour Force Survey.  The results of this examination are being given careful consideration at present.</P>
      <P>I would not consider a monthly Labour Force Survey to be a realistic option as the costs would be prohibitive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept it is unsatisfactory that the most recent detailed Labour Force Survey statistics published, on a mix of full-time and part-time jobs, relate to April 1994?  Does he accept that employment policy cannot be planned in such a statistical vacuum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office is examining detailed submissions from more than 100 companies, in addition to which there is strong evidence to support the contention that a quarterly Labour Force Survey is now required; it appears to be the trend within the European Union and more and more member states are moving in that direction.  The matter is being considered by Government whose decision will be conveyed in due course, but all available evidence points to the fact that <Col N="96" /> from the point of view of employment, unemployment statistics and accuracy we should move in the direction of quarterly Labour Force Surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that the Minister of State does not advocate monthly surveys, I am concerned about the delay in publishing the details of surveys once conducted.  Would he accept it is unsatisfactory that it takes two years from the time a survey is conducted to have the relevant details published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know from her term in office as a Minister of State, these are complex figures which must be collated, cross-checked and finally published.  We do our best to furnish interim reports on the relevant data and publish the final figures once available.  I can assure her that everything possible is being done to expedite their publication.  Indeed, the Government is as anxious as anybody else to have the relevant figures as soon as possible to enable it make general economic forecasts and evaluate the current overall position at any given time.</P>

      <P>How frequently are long-term unemployment figures produced? Does the Minister of State agree that the absence of regular updated numbers of long-term unemployed detracts from the degree of attention all political parties should devote to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures on the long-term unemployed are available from the annual Labour Force Survey. We do our best to publish preliminary figures and, in due course, the final ones.  In regard to the focus on the figures, it is desirable that they be made available more frequently to enable us evaluate the general economic position. All of the indications are that, on the general jobs front, the last Labour Force Survey showed a dramatic increase in the numbers at work &mdash; 49,000 &mdash; compared with the preceding 12 months <Col N="97" /> during which period the Deputy was in office for approximately six months. Preliminary indications suggest that the relevant figures for the current 12 months period will be equally gratifying in terms of the general positive economic outlook.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Labour Force Survey is conducted over 45,000 households in the months of April and May and is at present being compiled for the current year.  As soon as we have the figures available for last year they will be brought to Members' attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to long-term unemployment.  While not castigating any Government, does the Minister of State agree that we can all conveniently forget the numbers of long-term unemployed through not receiving regular updated figures which, once published, lead to an annual brouhaha? Will he seriously consider publishing at least a quarterly report on the long-term unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Cost would be an inhibiting factor in the Government deciding to adopt the proposal to conduct quarterly Labour Force Surveys. Deputy O'Rourke having been a Minister, as was the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, will remember that in 1991 a very positive recommendation was advanced, on foot of the report of a task force, for the publication of a quarterly Labour Force Survey.</P>

    <P>For the information of the House I will give the costs involved.  Total initial development costs would be in the region of £400,000.  The main cost factor would be the acquisition of approximately 160 lap-top computers and peripherals such as modems, printers and so on costing an estimated £250,000. There would also be the need for considerable statistical development work in addition to the development of computer processing and analysis systems to address the key issues of timeliness and data quality.  The total field cost of the current annual survey was just over £1 <Col N="98" /> million in 1995.  It comprised field staff pay of £830,000, travel and subsistence costs of £108,000 and other miscellaneous costs amounting to £74,000. The corresponding estimated field costs of a continuous quarterly survey are £2.2 million for pay, £460,000 for travel and subsistence and £300,000 for other expenses such as rent of local offices, telephone, electricity charges and so on, giving a total field cost of £2,960,000. Thus, the additional field cost of continuous quarterly surveys would be just in excess of £1.9 million per annum, the total additional cost being £2.1 million. With regard to staff requirements, the new survey would involve 125 interviewers and approximately 16 supervisors on a continuous basis compared with present staffing levels of 430 interviewers and 48 supervisors employed on a once-off basis for the specific purpose of compiling the annual Labour Force Survey.</P>

      <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Island Development sets out new mechanisms to deal with the key issue of access services to the offshore island in a strategic and integrated way.</P>
      <P>Under these proposals, the relevant local authority islands committees, in consultation with islanders and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, will prepare a programme of works for bringing the level of access services to the offshore islands up to a socially desirable minimum standard.  The proposals will reflect the priority needs of the islands concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These submissions from the relevant local authorities will form the basis on which funding will be allocated in 1996 <Col N="99" /> by the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development.</P>
    <P>Funds will be allocated on the basis of need and the quality of proposals submitted.  Individual projects will be assessed not only on their own merit but in the context of the overall strategy for islands as set out in the report.  The feasibility of connecting certain islands by means of cable car, where there is a demand will be considered, along with all other options, as part of this integrated and strategic approach.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that a cable car is a possible solution where the distance between the island and mainland is short as this would lower the risk involved in small craft sea crossing and might be the best solution for some of the islands such as Inish Biggle?  Will he consider implementing that proposal?  Judging from what the Minister of State said, we could wait at least another 15 years before we get to the conclusion of all of those reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that one cable car proposal is being considered by the newly formed island co-operative and its development officer has investigated other processes.  If this proposal is put to Mayo County Council's island committee, I am quite certain it will get the priority it deserves and the service may well be established in 1996-97.  As long as it meets the criteria set out in my reply and if the money is available it will be done.</P>
      <P>A proposed cable car to Inish Biggle Island was previously investigated by Mayo County Council.  The council engineer who investigated the proposal suggested more cost effective methods. That is not to say, however, that the current proposal will not be examined thoroughly and given due consideration. I agree with Deputy Bertie Ahern that a cable car crossing would avoid the dangers associated with sea crossings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 13 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 14 March last, the Minister Deputy Bruton and I had a meeting on that date with Packard management.  At the meeting, the latter indicated that, as business prospects for 1996 remained poor, a redundancy programme would have to be implemented and that, in accordance with the June 1995 agreement between the company and the unions, details of the programme, including its impact on the workers laid off, would be communicated to the employees by 15 April 1996.  No further details of the likely programme were available at that stage. The company reiterated its commitment to increasing the competitive position of the Tallaght plant with a view to winning new business.</P>
      <P>However, the company subsequently advised us on 4 April that, due to difficulties in obtaining final details of its future business, it would not be in a position to inform the workforce of the proposed redundancy programme by 15 April 1996.  For the information of Deputies, the company's agreement with the unions, covering the situation that arose last year when, on 23 June 1995, 400 employees were laid off, provided that:</P>
      <P>the company will advise the unions by 15 March 1996:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  of business prospects for 1996.  If prospects are such that a <Col N="102" /> majority of those laid off will be reengaged over the first half of 1996, no redundancies will take effect until June 1, in accordance with previous practice.</P>
    <P>(b)  If business prospects at 15 March indicate that a majority will continue on lay-off over the first half of 1996, then a phased redundancy programme, again in accordance with previous practice, will be on offer from 15 April for those on lay-off for whom a return to work date has not been determined.</P>
    <P>(c)  In the case of either (a) or (b) above, the period of lay-off will be included in reckonable service for redundancy calculation and minimum notice calculation purposes.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the position outlined by the company at the meeting with us on 14 March last, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment Deputy Richard Bruton and I were extremely concerned at the failure of the company to honour its commitment on this issue. This unwelcome development created an additional layer of uncertainty about the future of the plant and compounded an already difficult situation for the workers involved, including those on lay-off.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, apart from voicing serious disquiet at these developments, we requested Packard management to meet the union representatives immediately to ensure that there is no further breakdown in communication.  It was again impressed on the company that information and consultation are cornerstones of our industrial relations system and that the Labour Relations Commission is available to assist in promoting change to enhance productivity and performance in the Tallaght plant. I understand the meeting we requested the company to convene with the unions took place on 12 April and that the company now expects to be in a position <Col N="103" /> by end May 1996 to make an announcement about the future of the workers laid off.</P>
    <P>Trade unions' representatives at Packard Electric came to see me last evening to tell of their grave concerns and uncertainty as a result of that meeting with the company last week and to ask for intervention by us to clarify the proximate and longer term intentions of the company for the Tallaght plant.  My colleague Deputy Richard Bruton had already written to the company in this connection to ask for an early meeting to ascertain its plans for the Tallaght plant.  We will seek such information in an effort to see how we can help this company to turn this plant around. Deputies should be aware that the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission has assisted several firms to overcome similar problems and to increase their productivity.</P>
    <P>It is essential that trust between management, unions and the workforce is restored without further delay and the problems confronting the company, which have been well documented, are tackled vigorously to put the plant on a competitive cost structure and secure its future.  If this is not done soon, one must be pessimistic for the future.  The State has done everything possible to assist the company but in the final analysis the necessary action to tackle the existing serious problems rests with the company.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance the Government attaches to securing the future of the Packard Electric plant at Tallaght and to the future plans of General Motor in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is getting more confused by the day.  The whole story of Packard Electric is a very tangled web.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my question &mdash; to which I did not get an answer &mdash; I asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the recent contacts he has had with the international management, the local management and the unions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said in <Col N="104" /> reply that a group from the unions came to meet him last night.  Was this the first contact of a union group with him? What formal contacts have been made with the international management and the local management of Packard Electric? Let us remember that we are not talking about Siberia or Indianapolis when we speak about local management, we are talking about a firm in the Minister of State's constituency.  I accept the Minister of State's bona fides that he wishes to see the company retain as much employment as possible but surely the intervention with management to which he referred should have been undertaken on a weekly basis since the three agreements were made, the company agreement, the union agreement and the eventual signed agreement. What interventions were made with management since then because all of the signs seem to point towards a very difficult management situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy means by a confused and entangled web.  There is only one agreement, that of last June between the unions and management.  That agreement is crystal clear and I have put its relevant parts on the record today.  If the Deputy had been listening, she would know that I did address her question. Both international and local management were met by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our meeting with the trade unions last night was not the first; there has been a number of them.  In so far as one can intrude into the affairs of a private company, we have intervened almost without precedent at all times to facilitate a settlement.  I remind the Deputy that there is a long tradition in this House, when a major industrial conflict occurs, that it is not exacerbated here in a manner that is likely to be to the detriment of the workers and their livelihoods.  If the Deputy had asked Deputy Ahern before he left the House, he would bear that out.  He would also have confirmed that when I was in Opposition, on several such occasions <Col N="105" /> we had to demonstrate care in what we said.  The practice has continued in this Dáil as recently as the Irish Steel affair. I am concerned that while we would be willing to put on the green jersey in various other difficult disputes that arise, for some reason an insinuation that is not justified by the facts seems to have been made across the floor in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Brevity all around is important.  I will not take any lectures from the Minister about what I can or cannot raise in this House.  I am fully entitled, as Opposition spokesperson on enterprise and employment, to raise what I like.  I take my job seriously and work hard at it and I shall raise whatever issue I see fit.  Many people from the Minister's constituency with connections to Packard Electric have been in touch with me, especially over the past week.  We operate under a democracy and will continue to do so.  The Minister's party was not a great believer in democracy not too long ago.  I hope it has learned the new methods.</P>
      <P>When did the meetings to which the Minister referred, apart from the initial ones with Packard Electric, take place? How many meetings or contacts did the Minister or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment have, following the June agreement, with international management, local management and the unions?  While I accept the Government machinery already exists to assist at labour relations level, the June meeting primarily concerned productivity, new markets, helping the firm to increase its productivity and the retention of employment.  What meetings have taken place with international and local management and unions since last June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of meetings took place.  Packard Electric is a private company.  Notwithstanding that, we <Col N="106" /> have met it on a number of occasions. The meeting I referred to on 14 March was attended by the heads of the European and Irish companies, the latter functioning from Coventry.  A number of tangible matters arising from those meetings were agreed to, apart from making the Labour Relations Commission available to assist in any way possible.  For example, the Exchequer brought in and paid for a team to advise on the engineering and productivity of the line staff.  A committee, known colloquially as the &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo; was set up; the IDA nominated a relevant consultant from the IPC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions nominated a similar consultant, as did an independent person.  They drew up a report on world-class manufacturing at the plant.</P>
      <P>In so far as one could intervene into the affairs of a private company, we have done so many times.  I am not questioning the right of Deputy O'Rourke to raise this matter in the House.  I am merely talking about the manner in which she is doing it and the mischief making with which she has been concerned.  The last thing this dispute needs is somebody with a ladle, dolloping out from a witches' brew of confusion, ill-considered advice, half-truths and misinformation and I hope it will stop.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent comments of the former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald on the long-term unemployment crisis; the plans, if any, he has to introduce the local employment service on a countrywide basis in view of these comments; and if he will make a statement regarding his plans to tackle long-term unemployment.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7632/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Dr. Garret FitzGerald on 23 March 1996, which I have noted.  Dr FitzGerald's article is thoughtful and, as one would expect, contains sound analysis and some thought provoking ideas.</P>
      <P>Dr. FitzGerald has observed the good progress we are making in job creation and in reducing the number of people out of work.  He quotes the sharp fall in unemployment as measured by the labour force survey.  Between 1993 and 1996, an estimated fall in unemployment of 46,000 has occurred which is bringing the Irish rate of unemployment closer to the European average.  In contrast, he points out that the live register does not reflect this fall and comments on the inappropriateness of the live register as a measure of the number of people out of work and seeking employment. However, he also draws attention to the disturbing features of Irish unemployment, namely the high proportion of people who have been out of work for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government shares his analysis and has been responding to the particular problem of long-term unemployment through a variety of targeted measures.  These include the development of a more employment friendly taxation and social welfare regime and the introduction in this year's budget of a series of precisely targeted employment measures, which include: the splitting of the community employment programme into two distinct options, a part-time integration option and a part-time jobs option and the better targeting of the programme at the long-term unemployed; the introduction of a new <Col N="108" /> pilot whole-time jobs option; the introduction of a new recruitment subsidy scheme called &ldquo;Jobstart&rdquo;; the introduction of a new work experience programme called &ldquo;Work-Place&rdquo;; the introduction of special measures for 18 and 19 year olds; the extension of back to work allowance scheme; and the introduction of retention of certain benefits for those returning to work.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the local employment service also represents an important component of the Government's response to tackling long-term unemployment.  The distinctive additional elements of this service, in providing an individually tailored progression path towards employment for its clients and in ensuring that there is a well co-ordinated employment service delivery at local level, should yield real benefits in terms of securing employment for long-term unemployed persons as the service develops.  The fact that it is initially launched in 14 areas, including the major unemployment black spots in the country means that it is first being targeted where it is most crucially needed.</P>
    <P>As I already informed the House on 28 February last, my plans for 1996 are that the local employment service should be consolidated in these 14 areas and subject to an initial evaluation before the service is expanded on a planned basis to other areas.  In this way we can ensure that the service is developed to maximum effect for its client population.</P>
    <P>Training is another important component in any measure of active labour market interventions aimed at addressing the problems of long-term unemployment, given the strong link between low levels of education attainment and long-term unemployment.  I will be addressing this problem in the White Paper on human resource development which I will be submitting to the Government shortly for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his long answer.  Dr. Garret FitzGerald wrote a newspaper article on 23 <Col N="109" /> March 1996 which stated that long-term unemployment is a most disturbing feature. He stated that, irrespective of what measures are being undertaken in the area of employment, what is most disturbing is the continuing accelerated growth of long-term unemployment, a subject to which we will return on another occasion.  The Government has been nearly a year and a half in office and long-term unemployment continues to accelerate.  I await the document containing some magic formula, but we should not hold our breath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the growing consumer concern about the potential health risks associated with beef consumption, I assembled on 29 March an expert group to advise consumers, Government and the trade on the implications of the European Union export ban, which <Col N="111" /> remains in place, on products derived from cattle slaughtered in the United Kingdom.  The group, which was chaired by the Director of Consumer Affairs, comprised consumer, Government, industry, scientific and trade representatives. It met on 30 March and on 2 April 1996.</P>
    <P>In addressing the group at its inaugural meeting, I emphasised that it was being given a completely free hand in conducting its affairs and that there would be no attempt to influence its work in any way.  Even more importantly, I assured the group that, if during the course of its work evidence was uncovered which would point to real or potential health risks associated with the consumption of beef or products containing beef, that information would be put into the public domain without delay.</P>
    <P>Arising from its meeting on 30 March, the group issued a statement that, based on the medical, scientific and veterinary advice currently available, there was no need for consumer concern relating to foodstuffs on the shelves containing minimal beef derivatives or products such as Irish beef, gelatine or dairy products, and consumer help lines had been installed in the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 2 April the group finalised &ldquo;Guidelines on Beef and Beef Products&rdquo;, a copy of which is being circulated in the Official Report.  The guidelines are in the form of a series of questions and answers relating to products and issues which had been most commonly voiced by consumers.</P>
    <P>In particular the guidelines address such questions as: What is the effect of the EU export ban?  Are Irish beef, Irish beef products, products which have an Irish beef content or Irish dairy products safe to eat?  What parts of the animal are affected by BSE and is there a risk of the spinal cord or the brain of an affected animal entering the food chain? What is the position of animals in herds where there is a case of BSE and can products from these animals enter the <Col N="112" /> human food chain?  What is the safety of products such as meat pies or stock cubes made from UK beef or with a UK beef content?  What is the safety of beef fat, lard, gelatine, UK dairy products, cosmetics and pet foods?</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that, in the view of the export group, all the products referred to are safe to consume. This view is based on the best scientific, medical and veterinary advice available to the expert group.</P>
    <P>The guidelines, which have the endorsement of the group, are intended to allay any remaining consumer concerns and were made available in shops and supermarkets throughout the country from 3 April and from the offices of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Consumers' Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>According to information provided by An Bord Bia, sales of beef on the Irish market declined by as much as 70 per cent during the weekend following the announcement regarding BSE in the UK House of Commons.  Sales have now returned to within 10 per cent of normal levels, a development which has been helped by the consumer reassurance programme organised by An Bord Bia and by the work of the expert advisory group.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for food safety and hygiene does not rest solely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The question of any overlapping responsibilities which may exist between Departments is being kept under review.  Any suggestion that the decline in sales of Irish beef is attributable to the inadequacy or failure of health controls is quite incorrect.  I refer the Deputy to the statement issued by the Government on 4 April.  That statement, which followed a comprehensive review of recent developments on BSE, made clear that the controls being implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry go far beyond those recommended by scientific evidence or by international organisations and that Irish beef and products derived from it are safe.  A similar conclusion was reached by the Food Safety <Col N="113" /> Advisory Board which reported to the Minister for Health last week.</P>
    <P>Existing food labelling regulations, which are based on EU Directives, stipulate that pre-packaged foods must be labelled with name of the food; list of ingredients; net quantity; date of minimum durability or &ldquo;use-by&rdquo; date; any special storage instructions; name and address of packer, manufacturer etc.; country of origin, only if its absence is likely to mislead consumers; instructions for use, where necessary; alcoholic strength over 1.2 per cent; and, indication of irradiation or treatment with ionising radiation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the regulations is to inform consumers of the content of the food they eat.  The regulations are enforced rigorously by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>Produce labelling would relate to wholesale-manufacturing cuts of beef. The Commission of the European Union intends to bring forward a proposal for a labelling system for meat and meat products.</P>
    <P>Guidelines on Beef and Beef Products.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What is the effect of the EU ban?</i>
    </P>
    <P>The effect of the EU ban as implemented in Ireland is to ban the importation from the UK into Ireland of all cattle, beef and beef products for human consumption and for animal feed which come from animals slaughtered in the UK.  Materials from such animals for use in medicinal and pharmaceutical products and in cosmetics cannot be imported.  In addition to action taken by the UK authorities, licensing arrangements operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will ensure that the ban is fully implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Is Irish beef safe to eat?</i>
    </P>
    <P>Yes.  Irish beef is safe to eat.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Are Irish beef products which have Irish beef content safe to eat?</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Yes.  These products, whether they have a high or a low beef product content, are safe to eat.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Are Irish dairy products safe to eat?</i>
    </P>
    <P>Yes.  Irish dairy products are safe to eat.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Does BSE affect all parts of the animal?</i>
    </P>
    <P>No. The sites of BSE infection in an animal are the spinal cord and the brain.  This means that unless these parts of an infected animal enter the human or animal food chain there is no risk to humans or animals.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Is there a risk of the spinal cord or the brain of an infected animal entering the human or animal food chain?</i>
    </P>
    <P>The practice in Ireland has been not to use these parts of animals in food for human consumption.  Since 1989, Irish beef herds in which BSE has been detected have been subject to a total slaughter-out policy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What about animals in herds where there was a BSE case?  Can products from these animals enter the human food chain?</i>
    </P>
    <P>As of now, no.  However, in the past they could.  Despite the lack of scientific evidence of potential risk, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in response to consumers' concerns.  since March 1996 has decided to exclude the meat from such animals from the food chain.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What is the situation in regard to beef products, such as, for example, meat pies, which are made with UK beef?  Are they safe to eat?</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is now a ban on the importation of these products.  However, many of these products will already have been available here before the ban was put into effect.  The medical. <Col N="115" /> scientific and veterinary advice available to the group is that consumers who have eaten these products have no cause for concern.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Is the situation the same in regard to products with a beef content, such as stock cubes, which may be made from UK beef?</i>
    </P>
    <P>The situation is exactly the same.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What about beef fat or lard?  Is it safe to use them?</i>
    </P>
    <P>Yes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What about gelatine?  Is it safe to use it on its own or when used in confectionery products or in vitamin or medicinal capsules?</i>
    </P>
    <P>Yes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What about UK dairy products?  Are they safe to eat?</i>
    </P>
    <P>Yes.  As in the case of Irish dairy products UK dairy products are safe to eat.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What about cosmetic products?</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is no ban on the importation of these products.  There is no established risk between the use of these products and BSE.</P>
    <P>
      <i>What is the situation about pet food?</i>
    </P>
    <P>The veterinary advice available to the group is that there is no cause for concern.</P>
    <P>General Advice</P>
    <P>It is important to read the labels of all foodstuffs to check their contents and to ensure that the &ldquo;use by&rdquo; or the &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; dates are strictly adhered to. Food Labelling Regulations do not require that the country of origin be shown on the labels of pre-packaged foodstuffs unless its absence would mislead.  The ingredients of every foodstuff have to be listed in descending order of weight and there <Col N="116" /> is no requirement to show the origin of any of these ingredients.</P>
    <P>Finally, the group would emphasise that the above information is based on the best current available scientific, medical and veterinary advice. The group would also emphasise that it continues to be the responsibility of each and every consumer to make up his/her own mind in regard to the purchase and consumption of products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the chequered past of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, does the Minister of State accept that this Department is not the appropriate one to restore consumer confidence in beef?  Does he agree that sometimes there is a conflict between the interests of consumers and producers and, if so, does he not consider it necessary to establish a separate food agency under the auspices of his Department to ensure consumers are reassured and confidence is restored in beef and in other products as the need arises?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for food safety does not rest with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry alone, a point about which there is a good deal of misapprehension.  The situation is a great deal more diffused than that.  I referred to the expert Food Safety Advisory Board located in the Department of Health which reports to the Minister for Health.  Health environment officers who are employees of the Eastern Health Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Yes.  They carry out health inspections and so on.  I cannot answer for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I have responsibility for consumer affairs in <Col N="117" /> this area.  I draw Deputy Harney's attention to the make-up of the expert group which, justified or not, was deliberately not located in the Department of Agriculture. It comprised representatives of the Consumers' Association of Ireland and experts from the veterinary, scientific and medical areas and was chaired by the Director of Consumer Affairs who is an independent officer with a watchdog role under legislation.  Most Members are aware of the track record of the present Director of Consumer Affairs.  He would not put his name to anything unless he was satisfied, on the best advice available to him, that he could say with confidence that it was the optimum in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that it would be more appropriate for An Bord Bia for which I have huge regard &mdash; I know many members of the board and its chairman well &mdash; as well as for the expert group to report to his Department given that the consumer's interest is extremely important if we are to have confidence in beef?  Is he satisfied that the meat of pigs and poultry fed on animal bone-meal is perfectly safe for human consumption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point raised by the Deputy has also been voiced by the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  I accept that there is a distinction to be drawn between the interests of the producer and the consumer.  We are dealing with a consumer population that is very alert and a great deal more informed than it might have been in the past.  I agree also that the maintenance of consumer confidence is imperative, as we have seen since this extraordinary hysteria broke out following the statement in the House of Commons on 20 March. If consumers vote with their feet, as they tend to do, the scientific evidence is almost irrelevant.  The precautions taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his predecessors go far beyond the scientific advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the food industry <Col N="118" /> might well be located in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  That is a view I have always held not just in terms of public safety and consumer confidence, but of industrial policy and strategy.  I do not regard the food industry as different from any other industry, it is important because it is based on indigenous resources.  That may be a lesson we should study, but it is not at issue here.  There is a mistaken view that responsibility for health, safety and hygiene is reposed alone or solely in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but that is not the case.  For example, the report published by the Minister for Health last week provides a separate independent assessment of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be trumpeted by everybody that the consumer buys products.  It is right that the worries of producers should be met in an agricultural country, yet it seems they find it difficult to realise that they will not be able to sell their product if the consumer is not satisfied.  That is a very simple message.  I never ceased to be amazed at the response I received when Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs when I raised industry-related matters and put the consumer first.  Surely a satisfied consumer means that a particular product has a better purchaser.  It seems to be difficult to get that message across.</P>
      <P>Let me give some advice to the team sitting opposite.  In my three years in the Department &mdash; trade and marketing encompassed consumer affairs &mdash; I always felt that there should have been a Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs.  For instance, the travel trade regulations are dealt with by another Minister.  Yet, in Europe there is a Commissioner for Consumer Affairs who deals with Departments and Minister in different countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lesson is that consumers are clearly more alert &mdash; I would not call it hysteria, but proper alertness.  I ask the Minister of State to keep the expert group in place, perhaps on an <i>ad hoc</i><Col N="119" /> basis initially.  In that way he might secure for himself an even fatter portfolio when he would have far more leverage than he has now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Alas, I do not know that I want a fatter portfolio.  I do not disagree with the Deputy, the position of the consumer is central.  I did not refer to the concerns voiced by consumers and the Consumers' Association of Ireland on behalf of consumers as hysteria, I referred specifically to what happened and the manner in which this issue was handled in the House of Commons.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy, there may be lessons to be learned.  I do not know what happened at the time the particular structural decisions were made in respect of An Bord Bia and the allocation of the food industry, it may be a case of power and lobby politics, but the lobby responsible may have cause to reflect on where it would be without the consumer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister for Finance for presenting it in a much more accessible way.  It is the first time a Finance Bill has been on hard disc and this makes it much more simple for tax practitioners and accountants to study it in detail and examine areas which may require fine tuning and alteration.  I congratulate the Minister for his initiative in that regard.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister in relation to the complexity of the Bill, a point raised earlier by Deputy O'Dea. The Deputy also has some accountancy training and he found that aspects of the Bill are difficult to follow, even for qualified practitioners.  Part of the solution to this problem is to take the major elements of taxation and consolidate them in legislation.  I am delighted the Minister has embarked on this process. For example, a range of matters are consolidated in Parts XI and XII of the Bill.  The Minister promised to bring forward major consolidation legislation and the Department is engaged in that process for 1997.  Undoubtedly, this will be of major assistance to our constituents and the public, particularly professionals who advise investors, businesses and others on taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his sure footed handling of the economy over the past 18 months.  The macro performance of the economy, with the glaring exception of employment, in the past 16 months has been outstanding.  The key indicators include employment growth of almost 45,000 last year and 31,000 this year, a 7 per cent increase in GNP last year and 5 per cent this year, the successful efforts by the Minister to <Col N="201" /> keep inflation below the Maastricht criteria, averaging approximately 2.25 per cent this year, and the maintenance of the rates of investment at major levels, 11 per cent last year and an expected rate of 8 or 9 per cent this year.  The Minister must be commended when these are combined with strong export growth of approximately 13 per cent this year.  He has shown outstanding competence in running the Department of Finance, which is perhaps the most difficult and complex Ministry.</P>
    <P>As the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> stated in its editorial last weekend, the Labour Party has a good story to tell.  Many parts of the story are excellent, including the party's handling, through its leader, of the difficult Northern Ireland situation, the creation of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the delivery of important social measures by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  The performance of Minister Quinn is definitely part of the good story, both in the Department of Finance, where he is holding the country's financial affairs together so well, and previously in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>His efforts mean he can credibly indicate that Ireland, if it wishes, could be part of the core group of the European currency, as he said at the recent meeting in Verona.  However, I urge caution in that regard because many major food companies, such as Cadbury's which is located in my constituency, are deeply affected by the interaction of the exchange rate between the punt and sterling.  If Ireland wishes to become part of a European core group the guarantees and facilities put at our disposal must be significant.  Discussions may be held in the future on how the outer rings of a European currency will work.</P>
    <P>A disappointing aspect of the Finance Bill each year is that a large portion of it is taken up by the provision of tax reliefs for business and enterprise but only a small proportion of the Bill refers to the taxation of workers and their <Col N="202" /> families.  I wish it was possible to reverse that and examine areas in which workers and their families deserve tax relief also.  I welcome the new reliefs in relation to workers' taxation.  For example, some people will be exempt from tax and the standard rate band has been increased.  There is an attempt to take more people completely out of the tax net and there are other measures relating to people who suffered as a result of the hepatitis C problem. However, there is a need to embark on a major programme of tax restructuring for workers and their families.  This was highlighted recently by media discussions and commentaries on the recent by-elections.</P>
    <P>As the leader of the Labour Party on Dublin City Council I am proud that there are no water charges in the city. The council has successfully managed its finances without imposing service charges for the past five years.  It is no accident that Dublin and Limerick cities, where the Labour party is also the leading group, are the only areas which do not have service charges at present. Unfair and inequitable regional taxes, which are linked to an already inequitable national taxation system, should be abolished.  I strongly advocate the abolition of service charges.  This would ensure that discussions, such as those in the mid-1980s in Dublin, do not arise again.  In 1985 Dubliners voted overwhelmingly in local elections against such charges.  Those elections were a referendum on service charges; I heard that message and I have opposed such charges since.  They should be abolished.</P>
    <P>From my questioning of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners at the Committee of Public Accounts, it is also obvious that residential property tax is primarily a Dublin tax.  Approximately 70 per cent of the £14 million raised comes from the Dublin region, this cannot be justified.  Dubliners are most unhappy about the tax and I ask the Minister for Finance to remedy that. I favour the abolition of residential property tax and water service charges in the Dublin region because they are <Col N="203" /> inequitable, particularly in terms of a national taxation system which needs to be geared more in favour of workers and their families.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the entire regime of personal taxation.  It is outrageous that one hits the top tax rate on a modest income of £250 a week.  I urge the Minister to cut the top rate of tax &mdash; 48 per cent &mdash; to 45 per cent. Deputy Ahern may be disappointed because the Fianna Fáil Party will not be in a position to offer these goodies in its next manifesto as the Labour Party will, as in so many other areas, have delivered them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider introducing a tax rate of 42 per cent which would cost £220 million.  The psychological advantage of that would be important for workers.  In the mid-70s a former Labour Minister was instrumental in having the Government of the day introduce a basic 20 per cent rate and the Minister should examine that.  I advocate a 20 per cent rate for the first £2,000 or £4,000 of taxable income.  At present tax reliefs are primarily for enterprise and business, rightly so in many cases.  However, such measures would redress the balance in favour of workers and their families.</P>
    <P>We know that a large section of the population would benefit from job sharing yet we have not tried to bring this into the tax system.  Why did we not give a tax break in the budget to people returning to work?</P>
    <P>Many State companies must be restructured.  They operate in a competitive climate with a market of 300 million people.  It is essential that they remain competitive, particularly if we join the European Monetary Union.  In future national agreements &mdash; I hope we will negotiate the next one &mdash; we must compensate workers through tax reforms and encourage them to acquire shares in the companies in which they work.</P>
    <P>As part of a Dublin City delegation I travelled recently to America.  The workers in United Airways have a 55 <Col N="204" /> per cent stake in the company.  Under the US tax code employees get significant tax breaks if they acquire shares in their companies and hold on to them for a number of years.  The Minister has moved in this direction and I congratulate him and others such as Deputy Ahern who tried to encourage people to go down this road, particularly in TEAM Aer Lingus.  However, such a measure will be successful only if it is encouraged through the tax system.  We could encourage banks to lend money to companies where there is a significant employee shareholding.  Nothing inspires workers with a sense of determination to succeed than to own their companies.  In United Airways, pilots, air hostesses and so on own the company.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for expanding BES to the artistic area and I welcome the involvement of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. As expected, the Minister for Finance strengthened the anti-avoidance section of the legislation and has tried to improve the financial landscape for entrepreneurs.  All Members rightly gave credit to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for his wonderful initiative in creating an Irish film company. Almost every second person we meet has been involved in &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; and &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo;.  The Minister for finance is to be congratulated for reforming the old section 35, raising the maximum levels of qualifying expenditure and introducing other measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister found the patents area a difficult one.  I agree with some of the comments made by Deputy O'Dea. R &amp; D is vital and it is worrying when foreign companies seem to leave their R &amp; D hat in silicon valley.  The Minister has tried to ensure that we get real change without putting managements and Irish boffins who are developing new concepts under too much pressure. There were abuses which the Minister had to examine.</P>
    <P>I welcome the exemptions from corporation tax and the back-to-work and <Col N="205" /> other schemes which have been a weapon in the Government's arsenal to try to redress unemployment.  Corporation tax is an important element in an enterpreneurial climate.  The Minister's initiative in introducing a 30 per cent rate is welcome and valuable.  We should aim for a 25 per cent rate by the year 2000 because comparable rates in the British economy with which many of our companies compete are lower and our companies must retain that vital edge.  The Minister might examine that area in successive budgets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the island relief scheme. Bere island will benefit under it as will other island communities.  Could anything be done for the islands of deprivation in the Dublin region?  We know where they are on the north, west and south side of the city.  Could we introduce tax exemptions and reliefs to help refurbish houses in some suburban areas?  More power to the island populations but there are some people living in deprived areas in Dublin who could benefit from similar support.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. This year's Finance Bill is being introduced at a time when the economy has never performed better.  Growth is at record levels and far surpasses the performance of our EU partners.  Labour force surveys confirm that this growth is leading to extra employment and the unemployment rate is falling considerably in real terms.  The tax burden continues to ease, although slowly.  At times like this there is a sense of impatience among taxpayers.  They see the economy performing well and want tax reforms and reliefs introduced quickly.  While there has been some criticism of the rate at which the tax burden is declining, it should be borne in mind that in European terms Ireland's unique demographic profile imposes burdens on us that do not apply to many of our partners. Rather than view this in a negative light, however, this augurs well for our future despite the burden it imposes on us at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> I have listened on the monitor to many contributions to this debate and there is a schizophrenic approach to public spending.  There have been numerous calls for a reduction in public spending.  There has been severe criticism, particularly of Labour influence in Government, that there is provision for increased public spending.  The most vociferous suggest that public spending is out of control, but recent Exchequer returns give the lie to that view.  We make no apology for spending.  We love spending money on education, housing, the social services, particularly hospital services and waiting lists, and the aged and infirm.  I make no apology for declaring publicly that we love spending money on providing housing for the homeless &mdash; our record is to be seen in the whole area of public housing. Because of neglect of our road system over many years we need to spend much money in that area.  I remain of the view that public spending, when properly focused, is an essential investment in the future of this country.  The Minister for Finance can be proud of his record since taking office.  There was a time when the financial markets and some elements of the private sector would have baulked at the thought of a Labour Party Minister for Finance, but that fear has proved unfounded and the economy has never fared better.</P>
    <P>Tax has two functions.  Through tax we collect the revenue to pay for essential public services, the most important of which I have mentioned.  The record of this Government and its predecessor in this regard is impressive.  When we came to office some years ago many things needed to be done, particularly in terms of waiting lists, hip and heart operations and other hospital procedures were in a crisis.  For more than a decade there had been little or no public sector housing and our road system had been totally neglected.  All these matters are now being addressed.  Unfortunately all the problems cannot be solved overnight; it will take many years to put right some of them, particularly our road system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> One area in which our performance has been very good is in education. Despite the criticism at the recent teachers' conferences, the record of the Minister for Education far surpasses that of any of her predecessors. Nowhere is the link between public spending and investment so close as in education.  Much of our recent improved economic performance comes on the back of a well trained and educated workforce.  Regardless of whether we accommodate it, a new social order is descending on us.  Young people will spend a greater number of years in education and that is recognised in this year's budget &mdash; the Social Welfare Bill provides that certain child dependant rates will continue up to 23 years of age.</P>
    <P>Trends in the EU and other developed countries indicate that the productive working life of a person will decrease.  Provision must be made, therefore, for early retirement for a generation of people who will live longer as a result of improvements in medical science.  There is a great need for public spending in education and the provision of services to care for a generation of people who will retire from employment at an earlier age.  As people live longer increased resources must be provided for care and attention.</P>
    <P>The second role of taxation is to focus and direct activity in the economy to maximum benefit.  There is a view, shared by many people in this House, that we continue to have a problem in this regard.  Too much of our tax take is from income, thus reducing the incentive to work, and the primary source of wealth generation is work.  I share the view that taxation on work is far too high although some progress has been made in this area in recent Finance Bills.  I am proud that since my party entered Government tax relief has been directed at the low paid and middle income groups, as is evident from a report issued earlier this year by the well known Davy stockbrokers.</P>
    <P>The justification for such an approach <Col N="208" /> is twofold: first on grounds of social justice and second, and perhaps most importantly &mdash; this approach is for the betterment of all &mdash; by removing employment traps at the lower end of the scale and encouraging people to enter and stay in the labour market we improve the overall performance of the economy.  The long-term reasoning is that the tax burden can be reduced by reducing the number of dependants on the taxpayer.  I welcome this trend of recent years.  It is clear, however, that much more needs to be done.  With the present Minister for Finance we are pushing an open door in this regard &mdash; we will encourage the Minister to continue in that direction &mdash; but one would not think that was the case from listening to Members opposite.</P>
    <P>We have benefited enormously from the social consensus approach of recent years, and we must ensure that consensus continues.  That approach has created conditions of stability whereby businesses are able to plan for the future.  It is welcomed not only by indigenous firms but by all sectors of the economy.  Management can have no excuse for failing to invest in and plan the future of their firms.  The social consensus of recent years has provided that opportunity.  While workers have benefited in real terms from national agreements much more can be done.  The economy has grown significantly in recent years and workers are entitled to reap a dividend for the restraint and responsibility they have shown in making that possible.  The Minister is aware that workers are getting impatient in that regard and I look forward to his views on the subject.</P>
    <P>There is much to be welcomed in the Bill.  The increase in personal allowances for single and married taxpayers is a further step in the right direction and complements measures in the Social Welfare Bill.  The increase in the relief payable to carers from £5,000 to £7,500 is a huge step forward in one year and is to be welcomed.  The introduction of a corporation tax rate of 30 per cent for <Col N="209" /> the first £50,000 of profits is also a welcome measure.  The need for a tiered system in this area has been evident for many years.  If small firms are to fulfil their potential as employment creators, they must be given every encouragement. Businesses have fared reasonably well in recent budgets.  There have been reductions in their PRSI contributions and the overall corporation tax rate.  I hope that type of progress will continue but businesses must give as well as take. In the context of the forthcoming negotiations for a new national agreement, which I sincerely hope will take place, they should seek to involve workers in true co-operation in the workplace. Even in the United States, the bastion of liberal capitalism, the benefits of partnership through employee share ownership plans are evident to all.  This is an area we should investigate further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the expansion of tax incentives to encourage firms to invest in research and development.  This is an area in which we have not performed as well as we might have but it is crucial to ensuring the long-term well-being of the economy.  Without new products and ideas, companies cannot hope to maintain or expand market share.  Without market share new jobs will not be created.  Moreover, with an improved research and development environment, we may be in a position to encourage trans-national firms, on whom we depend so much, to increase their added value to the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a streamlining of some of our more successful schemes such as the BES and the section 35 tax relief scheme.  I welcome the changes made to them which will ensure the continuation of the merits of each scheme and increase the benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues the steady management of the economy that has been so successful in recent years.  Given the level of growth in the economy in recent times we cannot have been doing much wrong, as Senator Lee stated in an article earlier this year.  More needs to be done and I look forward to next <Col N="210" /> year's budget which hopefully will address some of the remaining issues such as simplification of the tax code and delivering on promises made to the PAYE sector.</P>

    <P>The present Government of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left seems to believe that, provided it can succeed in giving some tax relief in an election year, all will be well with the electorate and the social partners.  It could not be more mistaken.  The public and the social partners will judge the Government on the whole record of its budgets and, as I pointed out during Question Time today, find it seriously wanting.  If the public want to know the sort of tax relief they can expect from <Col N="211" /> Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left in future years, the 1996 budget will probably be a better guide than the 1997 flash in the pan give-away budget we are being promised, although we were promised that for 1996 also.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party has deserted the trade union movement again.</P>
      <P>The PAYE workers, the trade union members and the small entrepreneurs have been let down by this Government. The principle of social consensus put in place by Fianna Fáil in three successive national programmes from 1987 to 1994 has been placed in severe jeopardy by the failure of this Government in its two budgets to fulfil its side of the bargain.  The underlying philosophy of social partnership, which underpinned our outstanding economic performance since 1987 and to which many Deputies referred today, is based on the simple <i>quid pro quo</i> that significant tax concessions, together with income restraint and moderation, provide in normal circumstances for steady increases in real incomes.  This happened under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but it has not been happening since 1995 under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> since it became the responsibility of the rainbow Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the country was in a period of economic slowdown or stagnation, or when we were in the midst of the currency crisis, people understood that it was more difficult for the Minister for Finance to be generous.

      <P>The so-called champions of the PAYE worker have let down the workers and trade unions.  No wonder Democratic Left did not dare show its face in either of the two recent by-elections, and we know the Labour Party fared worse than Sinn Féin in both.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of workers and employees will barely notice a difference in their pay packets since 6 April, the reason being that all the resources which could have been used to lower income tax have been pre-empted by extra spending of 13.7 per cent over two years or, in real terms, 16.4 per cent, as the once off 1994 amnesty spending should have been deducted from the base.  Prices increased by 4.7 per cent.  In other words, Government spending has grown in two years by three times the rate of inflation.  The Government, in its programme of renewal, set itself targets which it breached.  The targets were a 6 per cent nominal increase in 1995 and a 2 per cent real increase in 1996.  If the Government had adhered to its original spending targets, it would now have at least £230 million to give away in additional tax relief in the Bill before us. Everyone would have noticed the difference. Even an additional £100 million would have made an enormous difference to Deputy Broughan's constituents in north Dublin.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, nothing could be done other than eliminating the £286 PRSI allowance for his hard pressed constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was honour bound by the commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which promised to focus resources in improving the position of lower and middle incomes, alleviate the burden on lower income workers and families and raise the income threshold at which the <Col N="214" /> higher rate comes into play.  The Government's main concern in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was to seek to redress the long running tendency for earned income to contribute a growing proportion of total revenue.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Finance in the year of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and supported by Deputy Broughan, I reduced the proportion of revenue raised by income tax and the income levy from 39 per cent of tax revenue to 36 per cent.  Last year, that increased to 36.5 per cent and this year it will be approximately the same, while the out-turn may rise even further.  While in the first year of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> I carried out the Government's commitment in a convincing manner, nothing further has been done about it by my successor.  The rise in the proportion of tax revenue from earned income represents a breach of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> in each of the last two years by the rainbow coalition.  The main concern in the reform of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has been ignored since I left office.</P>
    <P>The increase in personal allowances, which was 8 per cent in my 1994 budget, was reduced to 6.4 per cent in 1995 and 6 per cent in 1996.  The widening of the standard rate band, which was 6.8 per cent in 1994 and 8.5 per cent in 1995, was down to only 5.6 per cent this year. When account is taken of the ongoing reduction in mortgage and VHI relief to the standard rate, the position this year for most taxpayers is, to all intents and purposes, one of no real change.</P>

      <P>Middle income and lower middle income earners benefited in my 1994 budget from the lifting of the 1 per cent income levy, in addition to the other tax changes I have mentioned. This year the budget changes will make the most minimal difference to real incomes and will not provide any real reward for income restraint.  The Government is simply marking time. None of the growth dividend will go to the PAYE sector this year.  At least the Minister had the decency to drop all pretence of any commitment to tax reform from this year's budget speech. We acknowledge that he never mentioned those words in his long speech.</P>
      <P>The biggest handicap to employment growth is our tax system.  We need, particularly over the next couple of years, effective expenditure restraint so that we can bring spending and revenue into balance by 1999, as the ERSI recommended, and reduce what we spend on debt servicing &mdash; over £2 billion per year.  We can argue about what the priorities should be in reducing the tax burden.  The first priority is to create the scope in which to do it.  Our priorities should be to lighten, as far as possible, and remove the tax burden from the lower paid, particularly those with families, and to ensure that lower and middle income earners are not subjected to a marginal rate of tax of 56 per cent as at present.  Nobody should have to pay more than 50 per cent on any portion of their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned that militancy over pay by the public sector could undermine the basis for current economic dynamism.  I am glad of the many signs that the Government and unions want to resolve their problems in a spirit of partnership without destroying industrial peace.  What matters is not so much nominal pay as take-home pay and this is where the tax system can be decisive. While we are rightly attached to the maintenance of a caring social system, we cannot completely ignore or disdain the American experience of continuous dynamic employment expansion.  Many <Col N="216" /> jobs created are low paid and, in general, they have not moved ahead. However, that does not stop the income of many individuals rising through promotion and seniority.  There is irrefutable evidence of a relationship between employment and wage increases which should be borne in mind by everybody. There should be strict adherence by all parties, including the Government, to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which provides scope in the public service for productivity-based increases but which precludes industrial action.</P>
    <P>The jobs embargo in the public sector is a blunt instrument which runs counter to the spirit of a more enlightened arrangement of the public service as represented, for example, by the strategic management initiative.  The embargo also contrasts sharply with the uninhibited expansion in the number of special advisers and programme managers, all equipped with expensive mobile phones, drawn from outside the Civil Service.  We need more flexibility in the system at any particular time. While a tight control of numbers is needed, we may for example need an increased number of gardaí and prison and court staff to deal with the crime problem.  There are other areas in the public service where we may not need as many staff.  Where possible, we should create autonomous self-financing agencies which can recruit whatever numbers are needed for optimum efficiencies.  Job embargoes obviously increase pay pressures because they tend to block promotion.  This has always been the case and the reason we moved away from them in the past to the administrative budget system.</P>
    <P>I detected from what the Minister said on the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme last week that he is going back to the administrative system and he will have the support of this side of the House. He found himself conned by Fine Gael which influenced the job embargo system in the 1970s and 1980s.  As soon as the Minister entered his Department, it stuck this on him.  However, he now sees that it does not work.  We want to <Col N="217" /> encourage him in his efforts to get away from the blunt instrument embargo, which will not solve his difficulties.  A tighter control of Government expenditure across the board would pay handsome dividends.  If we could achieve balance by showing restraint, we could probably sustain in the long-term lower tax levels and a higher quality of public services through increased numbers at work paying tax.</P>
    <P>The function of the Finance Bill is to encourage enterprise and employment. A limited move has been made to further reduce the rate of corporation tax on service industries.  Fianna Fáil reduced corporation tax from 50 per cent to 40 per cent, while the Minister reduced it to 38 per cent last year.  He claimed it was a first step towards securing a standard rate comparable with overseas competitors.  This year a start has been made by introducing, somewhat on the lines of a proposal made in the Task Force Report on Small Businesses, a lower rate of corporation tax for those with a threshold income under £50,000.  The task force recommended £80,000.</P>
    <P>As far as the small business and much of the service sector is concerned, the competition is not international but mainly with Britain where the standard rate of corporation tax is 33 per cent, while a lower 25 per cent rate applies to profits of less than £300,000 with tapering relief up to £1.5 million.  This is clearly an area where the long-term aim should be to align ourselves with Britain, as this would have hugely beneficial and positive employment effects.</P>
    <P>We have seen in a number of sectors of the economy what a favourable tax regime can achieve.  The publishing and the bloodstock industries, writers and artists all benefit from a zero tax regime. The Minister, no doubt under the Tánaiste's influence, has extended the bloodstock regime to greyhounds, which is a good idea.  A lower VAT rate on restaurant and hotel accommodation, which we introduced, has had a favourable effect on that industry.</P>
    <P>The concessions I introduced in 1993 <Col N="218" /> for the film industry under section 35, on foot of the review group into the film industry commissioned by Fianna Fáil in 1992, were having a similar impact.  I regret the uncertainty in this year's Finance Bill as the regime was the envy of other countries.  People throughout the country were involved in successful films.</P>
    <P>Since 1993 the availability of section 35 was successful in the generation of film production activity with the resultant potential for the growth in the Irish film industry, which we all support. Momentum has been established in relation to the development of the infrastructure and job creation.  The high profile for Ireland associated with the production of some of these films and the international status of many of the actors involved has created a focus on Ireland which has provided promotional opportunities in areas such as tourism and many other related industries.</P>
    <P>Between 1993 and 1995 section 35 successfully fulfilled its purpose in stimulating production activity and generating momentum for growth.  Film production activity amounted to £133.2 million in 1994, compared to £58.5 million in 1993.  Prior to the amendments of 1993, this was not viable legislation and was not utilised to a great extent.  No other legislation framed for industrial growth is expected to yield a net return in its initial development period in such a limited time span.</P>
    <P>The limited benefits available to the film industry from section 35 have had a remarkable impact.  Instead of building on this growth, it has been decided to introduce restrictions.  This not only forfeits the possibilities of significant additional growth, building on the momentum which has been created to date, but it seriously jeopardises the growth which has already taken place and has sent out negative messages to the international industry as to the attitude of the Irish Government to the development of the film industry.  Since the budget, and notwithstanding subsequent amendments introduced in the Finance Bill, the industry has already <Col N="219" /> experienced a reduction in production activity planned for 1996.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt my former colleague in Government, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, who worked on this is aghast at these changes.  He would not have supported them and will probably agree with our amendments on Committee Stage, but will vote against them.  Many other Ministers and backbenchers would probably be like-minded.</P>
    <P>The film and audio visual industry is one of the growth industries in the latter part of the 20th century.  There is considerable potential for job creation. Ireland has demonstrated the potential for capturing a percentage of this market. Section 35 has proved to be an important part of the process.  It defies logic &mdash; my colleague Deputy Ó Cuív will highlight the situation relating to the islands &mdash; that, notwithstanding the series of recommendations contained in the Indecon report commissioned by the Department of Finance and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the amendments and restrictions now introduced will negate many of the achievements to date and forfeit future potential.</P>

      <P>I am trying to highlight and give support to my good friend the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, to prevent the Government's decision on ruining section 35.  I was the Minister who worked with Deputy Michael D. Higgins in the preparation of this amendment.  All the groups with whom we worked then have all been in touch with me to say that the amendments to the Finance Bill are a disaster and must be changed if we are to save an industry which was successfully built up in the past few years from ruin.  The uncertainty which had been removed from the section is now under threat.  The Minister should go back to the drawing board and pay close attention to the representations made to him by the audio visual production federation of IBEC.  We have a thriving film industry, indigenous and foreign, and its important spin-off effects in terms of tourism and general promotion of the country go far beyond employment in the film and ancillary industries.  The Minister for Finance should resist the fatal temptation of killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a long tradition in this House about how the Finance Bill is handled.  I agreed some years ago in the interest of efficiency, to alter the form <Col N="221" /> of the debate.  This was an issue on which the former Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, ran a campaign, which had much merit advocating that the debate should go to the Seanad where it would be debated at length.  It was always a three or four day debate. Subsequently it was moved to the committee. I notice with regret an effort to corral the major item of legislation for the year into a back committee room, where, for the past couple of years, it has received no media coverage or publicity. This is now being reduced to two days.</P>

In case Deputies across get carried away I do not agree with it all.  There are a few points in the budget I do not like and that I would like to have changed.  Twelve months ago the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, announced a pilot scheme for Westport and Achill. There is no doubt that that scheme bred life into both these areas.  That scheme has worked and has given life which was needed to Achill and Westport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got the grants, do not worry about them.  Achill experienced a high level of emigration to America, England and all over the world.  At last a change has taken place in that the number of people who wish to develop in Achill is unbelievable. Sites that could be bought for £2,000 and £3,000 five years ago cost £15,000 to £20,000 if they are available.  The same applies in Westport so the pilot scheme has been successful.  I concede the Minister should have continued the tax exemption for the three year pilot scheme.  Nevertheless, I compliment the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, for putting the scheme in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used to read in my local newspaper every week that Deputy Hughes raised all these issues at the parliamentary party meetings.  I spoke to him last week on a radio programme and said nobody must have attended the parliamentary party meetings because nothing was <Col N="224" /> happening.  I used to read every week about various pilot schemes, including urban renewal, coming to Westport, which he had raised at the parliamentary party meetings.

Castlebar was the only town in County Mayo that received money for roads. No other area received money for roads or water and sewerage schemes.  I am glad the position has been reversed. There have been more improvements in County Mayo in the past year then occurred in the past 20 years.  I am proud to be a Member of this Dáil at a time when the Government, which includes Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Enda Kenny as Ministers, has helped County Mayo.

The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Carey has spoken on behalf of the islanders.  They accept that the Government cares about them.  The Minister of State must keep up the good work.</P>
      <P>In the past Fianna Fáil, and other parties in Government, at election time promised to do a great deal for the people of County Mayo and the islands.

I compliment the Minister on this.  The Minister responsible for introducing this scheme made a mistake.  We are not afraid to admit that we made a mistake and have corrected it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On public housing, I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus who has announced that this year an extra 10,000 houses will be built.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government two years ago the figure was 7,050.  I am glad <Col N="226" /> that more local authority houses are being built.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed that people buying new houses are entitled to a grant of £3,000, while those buying second-hand houses, even though they are first time buyers, do not.  Will the Minister and the Department reconsider this matter? A young couple who buy a house, new or second-hand, should receive the first-time buyers grant.  Most people buying second-hand houses must redecorate them while those buying new houses receive a grant of £3,000 but do not incur any decoration costs.  I am not afraid to be critical of the Government.</P>

      <P>Many grants are provided for big businesses and people who can pay accountants to advise them on how to obtain tax relief.  Those people can look after themselves.  The Government should consider reintroducing housing grants.  Opposition Deputies are silent on this issue because their party abolished those grants.  Private citizens are as entitled to receive grants as those involved in big business who can obtain special tax reliefs.  The Minister should introduce grants for those earning £20,000 per annum or less who wish to redecorate or improve their houses. Such people pay their water charges, income tax etc. and do not receive anything in return from the system.  The only grants available are for the disabled and the elderly.  Local authority houses bought some years ago are in need of new windows, doors and, in some cases, need to be reroofed.</P>

I do not have his expertise on island or west of Ireland policy but I certainly share his sentiments about the efforts of various Government Ministers, particularly the attempt by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to assist the people who live on offshore islands.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the Finance Bill.  It is the most important financial legislation debated by Dáil Éireann each year.  It attempts to set the agenda for the economy for 1996 and 1997.  I take on board what was said by the Opposition Leader.  Deputy Bertie Ahern about the need to debate this Bill as openly and fully as possible.  I am not familiar with the procedure on Committee Stage but it is important that as many Members as possible on all sides of the House get an opportunity to have their say, not just on Second Stage but on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's announcement on budget day that the 1998 budget will be <Col N="229" /> published in late 1997 is a welcome development.  It is important to plan ahead and it is good policy to announce the budget for a particular year in the autumn of the preceding year.  It helps planning and allows time for the different political and economic interest groups to respond to the budget and prepare for the Finance Bill.  I look forward to what the Minister will do in 1997, namely, introduce the Coalition Government's first budget of 1997 and a second budget later in 1997 in advance of the Finance Bill of 1998.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Finance Bill was published against a positive economic backdrop. There was a time when budget and Finance Bill debates were stormy and controversial. In recent years that has all changed.  Most politicians and political parties recognise that the economy must be run in a particular fashion.  There must be strict control of public finance, a moderate increase in spending and a genuine effort to share resources as evenly and fairly as possible.  In the past few budgets, various Ministers from different parties have worked in that direction.  As a result it has become difficult for the Opposition parties to make political capital out of the budget and the Finance Bill.  It was the same this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition tried to paint a negative view of the Finance Bill and a glowing picture of what he or his party would do if they were on this side of the House.  One would have to take that with a grain of salt.  I listened to my Fianna Fáil colleagues on Cork County Council give their economic view of the world.  It is a local authority view but the leader of the Opposition said more or less the same thing this afternoon.</P>
    <P>On one hand he called for more tax reform and reduced taxation and on the other he called for increased spending. He talked about the need for greater increases in social welfare benefits although it was pointed out to him by Deputy Broughan that he had called for lower social welfare last year.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot call for higher spending and simultaneously <Col N="230" /> for lower taxation.  I take with a grain of salt the alternative economic presentation made by the Opposition because if it held the reins of power the budget and Finance Bill would not have been dramatically different.</P>
    <P>The one welcome difference resulting from this combination of parties being in power is that there is a genuine effort to use both the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill to give people an incentive to work and create work.  To some degree, the fruits of that have been seen over the past number of months.  A record number of jobs were created during 1996 and we hope to see that repeated, during 1997.  There are positive economic statistics in the form of low interest rates, a lower rate of inflation and job creation.  We cannot ignore the fact that we still have a totally unacceptable level of unemployment, particularly a high level of long-term unemployment.  All policy decisions, both from a financial and social welfare point of view, must have one thing at the top of the agenda and that is trying to put people back to work.</P>
    <P>Tax reform plays a major role in that regard.  The 1996 budget was cautious. The Minister made his priorities plain but there have been strong signals from the Minister and other Government Ministers in recent weeks that we will see a more pro-active budget in 1997 as far as tax reform is concerned.  Across the political and economic spectrum people will expect significant progress on tax reform.  Tax reform does not simply mean more money in the millionaire's pocket.  It must mean more money into every taxpayer's pocket.  That money can only be found by cautious management of spending and by attempting to put people back to work. I look forward to Government progress during the year in putting in place a tax package for the 1997 budget because we need to move towards lower personal rates of tax which must benefit every sector of society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring mentioned some sections of the Bill.  I welcome the <Col N="231" /> improvement in tax relief for the installation of alarms.  The political landscape can change quite dramatically.  When the Minister for Finance rose a few months ago to read the 1996 budget, crime was on the top of the political agenda, on the front page of every newspaper and on the lips of all our constituents.  The Minister and the Government were obliged to respond and one response was tax relief on the installation of alarms.</P>
    <P>The measure as initially proposed did not perhaps go far enough.  I welcome the fact that the Government was big and brave enough to admit that more would have to be done.  The tax relief on alarms will make it much more attractive for the elderly to have alarms installed in their homes.  It is not the answer to the fear and threats faced by the elderly but it is a welcome step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I also welcome some of the improvements in stock relief for farmers and the regime of leasing of land.  Section 10 increases the exemption for income derived from leases of farmland in certain circumstances.  We must try to keep the maximum number of people employed on the land.  It is extremely important to ensure the early transfer of farms from the more elderly farmers to younger, trained farmers.</P>
    <P>A difficulty always arose due to the fact that leased income was taxed at such a high rate.  Leased income, taken in conjunction with a farm retirement pension, often left the farmer who transferred the land paying a prohibitive amount of tax.  By increasing the exemption, section 10 will make it more attractive for a number of elderly and retiring farmers to transfer their land to younger, better trained farmers.  This is good for rural Ireland and the agricultural economy.  It will also help to keep extra people on the land and in rural Ireland and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The changes in the stock relief regime are also welcome.  These changes are needed, particularly by those taking over land or a farm under the farm <Col N="232" /> retirement scheme.  We must maximise the take up of the farm retirement scheme.  One of the obstacles to the scheme was the difficulty with lease income and a second was stock relief.  It was important that those are tackled in the Finance Bill and I welcome the fact that section 11 makes progress in that regard.  I hope it will result in extra transfers of land to younger trained farmers.</P>
    <P>Section 67 improves the situation of disabled drivers.  The definition of a disabled driver or passenger is not addressed in the Bill and I would like to see the matter tackled.  The definition is decided by the health boards in conjunction with the Department of Finance but it is extremely narrow.  As public representatives we often have to deal with the cases of people who try to qualify under the disabled driver's scheme, people who are clearly disabled but who do not come within the limited scope of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance should review the regulations governing this scheme.  The amount of money the State would have to forsake would be minimal if the definition was revised.  A more generous definition would greatly alleviate the disadvantage faced by people who are genuinely disabled and would enable them to play a better role in society.  I hope the Ministers for Finance and Health will liaise to see if improvements can be made in the classification of disabled drivers.  The present definition is extremely restrictive.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget an incentive scheme was announced for tourist resorts.  It is a positive scheme and it will take time for its full impact to be felt. Youghal which is in my constituency in Cork East, was included in the scheme. There was a good degree of interest in the scheme and over the next few years I hope to see a significant investment and a regeneration of tourism in Youghal.  Given the scheme is new I urge the Minister to be cautious in changing or restricting it.  The scheme <Col N="233" /> should have been left to operate for three years as originally intended before consideration was given to changing it. We should leave well enough alone.  It is working well and has the potential to transform many of our seaside resorts and create many jobs.  If the Minister deems it desirable to change the scheme I would be interested to know why the changes are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille Airgeadais.  In discussing this Bill it is important to consider the broad thrust of policy.  The public is not impressed by consensus in this House if it thinks policy is wrong.  One of the present dangers in politics is that one can get a bogus consensus whereby issues the public perceives to be important are not being tackled.</P>
      <P>With regard to income tax, the views of the Department of Finance bureaucracy and the public are totally different. Is it right to publish the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill separately when they are linked? An employee looks at the net take home wage whereas an employer looks at the gross cost of paying the wage.  One deduction only should be taken from an employee's wage.  Our goal should be to amalgamate levies, PRSI and income tax.</P>
      <P>The attraction in this course of action is that we could close the gaps in the present system.  The first step would be to combine the levies and PRSI as one deduction.  Thus, we would not have the farcical situation whereby an increase in wages results in loss of the medical card or a decrease in income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present single people pay tax at 48 per cent rate on an income of £12,050. Most of these people also pay 7.75 per cent PRSI.  More than half their modest income is taken by the State.  It surprises me to hear the Progressive Democrats argue for a reduction in the income tax rates when what is needed is a widening of the tax bands.  The exemption limits as set out in the Bill are £3,900 a year or £75 a week.  It is farcical to have <Col N="234" /> people with an income of less than £80 per week paying income tax.</P>
    <P>Rather than reducing the 27 per cent rate by 2 per cent I favour a different approach.  We should give everybody a decent tax free allowance.  People earning less than £100 a week, or £5,000 a year, if they are single and double the amount if married, should not pay income tax.  Taxing people who earn less is farcical.  The advantage of the system I propose is that one would not tax those who cannot afford to pay and would take out of the system many people who should not be in it and who only clog it up with small tax returns. We also have to move to a regime whereby nobody earning under £20,000 a year would pay the higher rate of tax. It would be simpler to do this over a number of years than people imagine. Rather than reducing the 27 per cent rate, one would have to adjust the tax rates to ensure the target groups, the less well off, are net gainers in whatever changes are made.  It appears that this Government is not willing to go down this route.  It is not interested in fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the situation of those on very low income but above the exemption rate of £3,900 per year. What is their tax rate?  It is the commonly forgotten rate of 40 per cent.  I cannot understand why that rate is not reduced to 35 or 33 per cent, for example, to make the system more gradual for those people on very low wages who wind up paying 40 per cent tax, on top of which they pay PRSI.  I find that incredible.  I have spoken about this often enough and my words always appear to fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated with the changes in vehicle registration tax because they favour two car middle-class families but do not give any relief to those who cannot afford to buy new cars.  The change being introduced refers to a married couple where one spouse has an old car, the other a new car, which is common where two people in a household are working.  They can now trade in the older of the two cars and get the £1,000 <Col N="235" /> relief.  They can also trade in the newer of the two cars, get another second-hand car in place of the older car while using the £1,000 to buy a brand new car. This is handy for the well off but it does nothing for the majority of families who have only one car, cannot afford a new car and would in no way be trading in a ten-year-old car for a new one.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out when the House discussed the budget previously, the measure is anti-rural because smaller cars are much more common in the city. The roads and type of use cars are put to in rural areas dictate that people need larger cars, but people in rural areas cannot afford to buy new cars and rely on the second-hand car market.  The measure is also environmentally unfriendly.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this scheme and replace it with one which would allow relief of £100 or £200 on all scrapped cars against the purchase of any car.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also examine the problem of imported cars.  One of the great causes of this problem is the fact that there is a lower VAT rate on cars on our neighbouring island.  When one imports a car, one is not obliged to pay VAT, only VRT.  It seems sensible to consider reducing the VAT on cars to the 12.5 per cent rate and compensate by increasing VRT.  The net cost of the car to the purchaser could come down but in that situation there would be no attraction to import cars and the State would not lose a lot of revenue on cars by virtue of the fact that the VAT payment on imported second-hand cars is made to the state of original purchase. In that way, we could reduce the net cost of cars between VRT and VAT.  It could be done in such a way so that the combined rate of VAT and VRT on a new car would be less than that which applies at present.  I understand such a measure might be quite complicated.  In simple terms, by ensuring it is more attractive to buy cars in this country we could make cars cheaper.  The way to achieve this is to reduce the VAT rate on cars and compensate for some of it <Col N="236" /> by increasing the VRT rate, leaving the total cost of cars lower than at present.</P>
    <P>The increase on excise duty on diesel operates seriously against rural industry. It was introduced at the stroke of a pen and nobody seems to comment on it.  A west of Ireland timber mill which processes about 100,000 tonnes of timber will pay about £150,000 per year in excise duties on diesel for haulage, which is a large amount of tax from a small company.  There is pressure to reduce the allowable loading weights on trucks &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; and to insist on compliance with the law.  I am in favour of this because the roads will not be able to withstand the type of battering they will get if the overloading of lorries continues.  However, economic pressure due to the huge tax rates for people operating out of peripheral areas in particular is exercising huge economic pressures on hauliers to load up to whatever level they can get away with.  It seems there is quite a simple approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>We should impose strictly the weight limit.  In doing so, we would save our roads and create quite a large amount of employment.  Some mechanism would then be necessary to reduce the excise duty on haulage for those businesses which have a huge haulage content in the cost of the final product.  It is often forgotten that haulage costs of timber can amount to 20 per cent of the cost of the final product.  In the case of microchips, the figure might be 0.001 per cent.  We must bear in mind that some of this country's major industries are resource based, such as agriculture, livestock, timber and fisheries where haulage forms a significant cost.  The industries which thirve on the west coast and in peripheral areas to which so much lip service is paid tend to be those with a high haulage content.  Such companies, which are competing with companies in Britain or on the Continent, are finding that haulage costs are making them uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>How can this problem be tackled? One way would be to say that hauliers involved solely in transporting timber or <Col N="237" /> raw materials of that type should be able to use green diesel or marked gas oil as long as their trucks do not leave the jurisdiction at any time and are used solely for the purposes of hauling timber, for example, to a timber mill. Another way to tackle the problem would be to create a third grade of oil, that is, a special commercial rate diesel oil which would be different from the marked gas oil used in agriculture but would also be different from that used in cars.  It would give commercial hauliers some relief from the huge cost associated with the taxes on white diesel.  Something must be done and I hope to see it done in the near future.</P>
    <P>The tax relief on alarms for the elderly is incredible.  Many people in my constituency will not be able to claim the relief because neither they nor any of their relatives have taxable incomes. I cannot understand why the measure which would have favoured the poorest section of our community, to which this Government gave so much lip service, was not realised.  I cannot understand why a simply grant was not introduced for pensioners living alone to install alarms.  The tax relief on alarms is not enough.  That is not the answer to the problem.  Unfortunately the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, failed to tackle one of the greatest causes of rural burglaries by not dealing in the Social Welfare Bill with means testing capital held by pensioners after a long life of hard work and frugal living.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring spoke about the islands but I was surprised he did not mention the special relief for island houses.  I would remind Deputy Ring that a great deal of development has taken place on the islands over the last 20 to 30 years. Much remains to be done but the islanders and those of us who have been familiar with the islands since the 1960s, recognise the huge changes that have taken place during that time.</P>
    <P>I remember going to Inis Meáin as a student when there was neither electricity nor an air service, the pier was totally inadequate and there was no public water supply.  To make a phone <Col N="238" /> call one had to crank a handle until ones arms were sore.  Those and other services have been provided but I would not claim they are enough.  It is untrue, however, to say that nothing was done for the islands.  Every Government has done something.  Since the 1960s Fianna Fáil Governments made significant progress in improving the lot of offshore islands.  One only has to talk to the islanders to appreciate how the provision of electricity, water schemes, piers and telephone services has transformed their lives.  Much more remains to be done and I hope we will see more action from the Government than the £1 million allocation proposed by the Minister which would not even build one island pier.</P>
    <P>The tax break for providing houses on islands is an incredible provision and it is significant that it was announced after the Social Welfare Bill had been passed. We must encourage more people to live on the islands and make it easier for those who wish to live permanently on the islands to build houses there, but this proposal will not address that problem and many islanders feel sore about it.  By linking this incentive to the tax system the Minister is favouring islanders with a taxable income but, more significantly he is favouring those with a taxable income on the mainland.  The Minister is saying that if someone has enough money and is paying tax he can get relief if he buys an island site with a run down house and does it up.  The person does not even have to let it to a dweller all year round.  All he has to do is let it to someone who will take out a 12 month lease, which would be easy for rich holiday-home owners.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister inquire whether the vast majority of islanders are taxpayers or, because of the lack of economic opportunity, social welfare recipients with no annual net tax liability?  If I am right in thinking the vast majority of islanders do not fall into the tax paying category, then this measure will not create any economic opportunity for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> Because of the Social Welfare Bill, we will now have a crazy situation whereby taxpayers on the mainland or the islands will get a tax break for building accommodation. However, if a person is on social welfare and happened to build a house ten or 15 years ago, and through his own hard labour can now renovate an old thatched cottage, the Democratic Left's Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, will inquire about the value of his house.  If it is valued at £30,000 and he is in receipt of unemployment assistance, irrespective of whether he is earning £1,000 or £3,000 a year from the house, the Minister will reduce his social welfare payment by approximately £3,000 a year or £60 per week.  Does this favour poor islanders or does it provide a tax break for those with huge incomes who can afford to become involved in speculation on the islands?  If this is the Government's answer to the provision of island houses, then God help the islands.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that before this was proposed the social welfare recipient was at a major disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the taxpayer, this caring Government has unilaterally decided to further widen the gap between the haves and the havenots. It did so without referring to the islanders or giving them an option on social welfare relief so that an islander could let a second property.  Instead of doing that, so islanders could have an income to live on, the Government made its decision without consultation and without giving the islanders proper choices.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most incredible decisions from a so-called caring Government.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister for Finance has to say on Committee Stage to explain this extraordinary provision which is not in the interests of the long-term development of the islands.  Nobody has worked harder for the development of the islands than I have, but work must be done in such a way that the islanders control development.  It must not be done in a way that is open to abuse.  The <Col N="240" /> objective must be to provide the maximum income for islanders so they can enjoy a proper standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance did not check out the plans of counties with offshore islands, but when he does he will find a major problem with his proposal. Unco-ordinated development is taking place.  We have just reviewed the Galway county plan and the county council will meet tomorrow to put its proposal on island development together for the interdepartmental committee.  This proposal will look extraordinary when placed alongside the Galway county development plan which states who should get planning permission on islands and in what circumstances.  It is an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>I accept that I am in a small minority in the House, and probably in a minority within my party, in not favouring, as a general principle, schemes such as the resorts scheme.  I do not favour BES schemes or schemes that seek wandering cash because they can create the most amazing distortions in an area.  I am at sea as to the criteria used in selecting the resource to be developed.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a town that needed redevelopment or a scheme such as this because of its run down character and an incentive to lift it into the next millennium, it is Clifden.  It is a major tourist centre because of historical factors but it is in need of major development because some parts became run down during the bad times.  It is extraordinary, and maybe it shows the lack of influence by local Deputies, that this town was not designated under the tourism development scheme.  It appears that by the time it becomes a designated town the scheme will be so curtailed that it will not be of any advantage.  I ask the Minister for Tourism and Trade, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to designate that town this year to ensure it can benefit and will not be a loser because it does not happen to be in the Minister's county of Mayo, which already has two designated towns.  That <Col N="241" /> scheme should apply to the most peripheral seaside resorts and I hope this plea will be heard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to examine the procedure of presenting budgets in this House.  The current practice might have been fine many decades ago but not for this modern age.  While budget day is hyped up <Col N="242" /> to be a major event, there are no very dramatic changes from one year to the next.  Every Government will say their budget is one of the best and most radical ever while the Opposition will say there was nothing in it, it gives nothing to anybody, it is too little too late etc. All the standard slogans are heard on budget day.</P>
    <P>The Minister must stand before the House and outline his proposals.  His speech should be shortened, the hype surrounding budget day should cease and many of the arrangements should be announced beforehand.  It is not proper use of Dáil time to spend weeks after the Budget Statement speaking for or against it.  Most Members on the Government side will praise it while nearly all of the Opposition will find faults.  That adversarial practice will continue irrespective of whatever system we have in place.</P>
    <P>We will spend three days this week discussing the Finance Bill which implements the provisions of the budget.  What will be achieved after the Budget Statement and this debate? What will change in the Bill? Could we not have begun Committee Stage immediately and broken with tradition? I do not think this will happen but is there anything wrong with avoiding Second Stage of this Bill and starting with Committee Stage, where the Opposition will table amendments and the Minister will do likewise?  I am not sure the Minister is depending on our contributions to make any changes to the Bill and it will not help the Opposition if it criticises any part of the Bill on this Stage.  We could be using our time in a more constructive way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the many good points of this budget.  Paying excessive amounts of income tax worries most workers and I hope next year's budget will make a definite attempt to give more money to them.  Unions on all sides seem to be arguing for an increase in wages, but this is of little value if it is gobbled up in income tax.  If Deputy McDowell, who specialises in this question, is to be <Col N="243" /> believed, a reduction in tax would be the answer to everyone's problems.  It might not be as simple as that; one must also look after the other issues.  Having a one-theme message may not be enough.  It would be far better for workers if there was a broadening of the tax bands and an increase in tax allowances so that one was left with all of one's pound earned.  Giving a £3 a week wage increase if one is paying back 55 per cent of it to the Government is not a great stroke of ingenuity.  Trade unions should switch their emphasis from wage increases to tax concessions.  If a Government is forced to give money from taxes in wage increases, we will lose in the long term.  We must target those on low wages, they exist even in the public sector. Their problems must be tackled but it would still be better for them to get more of what they currently earn than to receive a nominal wage increase and end up with almost nothing extra.</P>
    <P>We are lucky that many workers are benefiting from its economic boom, even though we hear it is not being passed on.  Because it is happening quietly, most people forget that mortgage rates are so good they are saving vast sums of money.  However, if we damage the economy, increase inflation and as a result bank charges go up by 1 per cent, people with a £40,000 mortgage will pay £8 per week more.  If they could receive a similar cut in income tax they would be delighted, yet we hear nothing about the reverse &mdash; they are currently saving on the mortgage.  Similarly, if inflation increases, it is amazing how one can spend money.  Unions should consider whether the country can afford to pay vast sums in increases while at the same time keeping inflation and bank charges as low as they are at present.  It is not possible if it is not done carefully.</P>
    <P>We can use tax breaks to encourage people.  This budget introduces tax breaks to encourage farmers to lease land.  If a tax break was introduced for people who improve their shop fronts, it would do much to brighten up and <Col N="244" /> embellish our towns and cities.  Tourists would see a vibrant townscape, done not with plastic but to the standards of olden times.  The tax break for those on short-term work is also most valuable.</P>
    <P>An Teachta Ó Cuív described the tax break for alarm systems as incredible but the only incredible thing is that his party spent seven years in Government and did nothing about alarms for the elderly.  Unfortunately, not everyone can gain but that applies to any advantage introduced in the budget.  Allowing relatives to claim has broadened the scheme; I admit that as originally announced it was not workable.  I regret that some bachelors and single women, who may live alone with no close relatives, will not be able to avail of the provision but many people will gain.  It is at least a start, with next year's budget still to come.  If something had been done in the past ten years, it would be unnecessary for us to do this now.</P>
    <P>As I have had dealings in this area, I welcome the advantage given to disabled drivers.  Up to now, they had to spend 20 per cent of the pre-tax cost of a car on adjustments to qualify for exemption: the Minister has reduced this to 10 per cent.  This is important because a disabled driver may not be able to afford to have his car adjusted.</P>
    <P>One provision I disagree with is the reduction of taxes on alcoholic lemonade. I only became aware of this drink in the last few weeks but it should not be on sale.  If it is lemonade, it should be called lemonade and if it is alcohol it should be called alcohol.  The idea that young people were able to buy this in ordinary shops is incredible &mdash; here Deputy Ó Cuív's word is valid.  It has been withdrawn from supermarkets but the concept of an alcoholic lemonade is a huge oxymoron &mdash; it is one or the other.  I call on the Minister to raise the tax because I do not understand why he reduced it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, spoke earlier about the role of An Post. The company's claim that it makes 90 per cent of deliveries on the following day is the greatest piece of fiction since <Col N="245" /> Santa Claus.  Anyone in Dáil Éireann who rushes out letters can prove beyond question that this is not the case.  Even when they are well addressed they may be sent all over the world &mdash; one of my letters went to Australia.  An Post should stop making this claim and I am glad the Minister is taking on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea, in a contribution I enjoyed, mentioned the complex systems used in the Bill.  There is one calculation which will give me nightmares, as it brings me back to studying honours maths:</P>
    <P>In any case where subsection (2) (a) applies, a person's increase in stock value in the accounting period shall be determined for the purposes of section 122 by the formula:</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time.  Like him I believe we could do without this extended debate, it should be tightened considerably. Almost six months elapses between budget day, the passing of the Finance Bill and the completion of departmental Estimates.  It would be more appropriate to deal with these in a tigher timescale.  The Minister for Finance has proposed an autumn budget, which would presumably be completed, debated, implemented and legislated for by Christmas, so that we would go into the new year with the parameters fully laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Ó Cuív and previous speakers, it amazes me how the Opposition harped on about small issues and blew them out of all proportion. The example raised in virtually every contribution from the other side was the tax allowance for the installation of alarms by the elderly.  This is <Col N="246" /> the first time any budget has addressed the question of providing security through the provision of alarms, so to knock it as being the beginning and end of security for the elderly is ridiculous &mdash; a committee is also sitting to look at that issue.  It is a welcome innovation.  It does not reach some areas, but it is the beginning of a process of providing a State support mechanism to deal with people living in fear who can now benefit from an allowance to instal alarms.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate today. In macro terms, since about 1990 we have been enjoying by far the best period of sustained growth in the history of the State.  We are top of the list in terms of the European and OECD economies. The Minister for Finance is to be congratulated for his role in sustaining this growth.  However, we are now at a crossroads. I draw the attention of the Members to an article written by the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 13 April 1996.  The article is entitled &ldquo;Unique opportunities exist to transform our country&rdquo; and it details why we can expect improved living standards for a number of years.  The reasons include a reduction in the dependency ratio, continued economic growth and increases in worker productivity.</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald questions whether these developments will be used to transform our society into a more inclusive and equal society.  He says they could lead to a deeply divided society or, under wise leadership, could be turned to advantage by using the extra resources to improve the living conditions of the more disadvantaged sections of our society.  The choice presented to us is whether the resources will be applied to deal with the disadvantaged sections of our society.  What will divide political parties in future is whether the surplus profit and resources created by extra production are to be used for the benefit of the individual or of society.  There are those who press for economic growth for growth's sake and <Col N="247" /> those who argue that growth should serve the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>This debate has concentrated on tax reductions.  There seems to be a school of thought in this House that tax reduction is the only vehicle to secure economic growth.  The reduction of the tax burden on the PAYE sector should continue and accelerate but should arise as much from an increase in the take from other sectors as from a reduction in income tax levels.  Our tax is not exceptional by European standards. Furthermore, contrary to the view of many, we do not spend excessively on our social services by European standards. This seeming discrepancy is explained by the level of dependency largely due to demographic patterns. The bottom line is that while tax is central to economic performance, it is not the be all and end all of successful economic performance.  Most successful economies in the world, such as the so-called Asian tigers, are based on high levels of social cohesion.  Our task is to maintain that cohesion while addressing the issues in our tax codes which inhibit optimum economic performance.</P>
    <P>Given the strong performance in the economy in recent years, one might expect a stronger &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor among the public.  This, however, is not the case, because of the perception of the level of the tax burden and the message being sent out that there can be reductions in this burden without a consequent knock on effect to the social services.  Other problems like drugs, crime and long-term unemployment, also contribute to this phenomenon.  There is more to the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor than money in the pocket.</P>
    <P>I welcome the continued progress in tax reform in this Bill and the complementary measures in the Social Welfare legislation.  Despite the Opposition's rhetoric, they represent the most concentrated attack on long-term unemployment to date.  That is not to say there is not much more to be done.</P>
    <P>New approaches need to be examined. I would like to see considerable <Col N="248" /> tax incentives for companies to invest in economic blackspots.  If we look at any budget or Finance Act that follows, we will see that a whole range of capital tax breaks are available right across the board.  There are tax breaks for inner city development, for seaside resorts for offshore islands, for film making, for business expansion schemes, and for farmers.  How do we provide tax breaks for the unemployed?  That is an area where we have not had tax breaks; we have to look at that.  We can use the tax system to encourage companies to invest in black spots, in areas of high economic depression and high unemployment. We should give sufficent tax breaks in those areas to attract business to them.  We have not embarked on an approach whereby it is a condition of tax breaks that there be a level of employment in certain defined areas.</P>
    <P>It is virtually impossible to get companies to locate in certain areas, such as Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Clondalkin, Ballymun, and parts of the inner city.  They simply do not want to locate there because location is still the most important factor in establishing businesses. Where people are living and looking for employment the companies move to other areas.  It is difficult to persuade companies to locate in areas where the greatest pool of labour exists, including the long and short-term unemployed. That is an area we should address in planning tax breaks.  I would like the Minister for Finance to look at those areas where the cycle of deprivation currently exists and where the State can no longer directly create jobs. It is not certain if the State could ever properly do so, but we must seek to positively discriminate in favour of these areas.  We would benefit the economy enormously by doing so because by creating more unemployment in areas of endemic unemployment we would raise the tax take and reduce the tax burden on the existing tax paying community. That has to be the focus of attention, given that unemployment <i>per se</i> has not increased since this or the previous Government came to power. <Col N="249" /> Since 1992 the levels of unemployment have been roughly the same.  In 1992 the expectation was that unemployment would exceed 300,000 but it has remained somewhat below the 280,000 mark.  What is alarming, however, is that the percentage for long-term unemployment has continued to increase and long-term unemployed people are now a very significant proportion of the overall employment cohort.  That is why we have to target the economic blackspots in this city and in other urban areas throughout the country.  I suggest to the Minister that he examines it in those terms.  Where the possibility exists to locate enterprise centres and industrial parks adjacent to high areas of employment, as proposed in Ballyfermot, the Government should respond with tax breaks to ensure that a large proportion of employees are from the local community.</P>
    <P>A strong case can also be made for fundamental reform of the tax and social welfare systems to eliminate poverty and other traps which inhibit employment growth as a result of anomalies which are created.  The case for basic family income or family tax credits should be examined carefully in this regard.  We have made some progress in recent years in reducing employment traps but they can never be eliminated. Employment traps are directly related to poverty but poverty is not absolute, it is relative to the standard of living enjoyed by others in our community.  It is damning to hear of the large, growing percentage of children living in poverty.</P>
    <P>What constitutes an employment trap today may not endure if people's expectations of their living standards increase. If we embark on measures that further widen the gap between rich and poor, I envisage that the problems currently associated with poverty will be exacerbated. It appears the often unspoken view that the long-term unemployed should be forced into any type of work by reducing their unemployment payments underlies this view.  I do not agree it will work and I could not support it.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of <Col N="250" /> measures which will prove useful.  The reduction in the level of corporation tax from 38 per cent to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of profits is a worthy move when one considers that the tax rate for export related multinationals is 10 per cent.  It comes on top of a series of measures in recent budgets to improve the employment potential of the small business sector.  I also welcome the move to increase the amount of tax relief available to businesses for research and development.  This type of move can generate long-term rather than short-term benefits to the economy and I congratulate the Minister for introducing it.  I look forward to more progress in this area.  I am also pleased with the increase in tax relief available to employ carers to look after people. The measures in the Bill represent an increase of 50 per cent in a year and I am sure they will be appreciated by all those involved.</P>
    <P>A stark decision faces us in the remaining years of this decade.  With a burgeoning economy and the creation of surplus value, we must ensure that these gains are distributed equally among the population.  People who call only for tax reductions, and a consequent reduction in the social services which are provided, are being less than fair and honest.  This is the real challenge facing any Minister for Finance. I am glad the Bill makes a start in that direction and I hope we will continue along that path.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Quill.  In his first budget speech last year the Minister announced a new tax incentive to attract investment to traditional seaside resorts.  Details of the tax concession were published in the subsequent Finance Bill and it was stated it was a three year pilot programme. However, people who took the Minister at his word and made plans based on the procedures laid out in last year's Bill were astonished to discover, when this year's Finance Bill was published, that there has been a major <Col N="251" /> change in the terms of the tax concession available in designated areas in traditional seaside resorts.  These were named in the Schedule to the Finance Act, 1995.  I wish to query the Government's policy in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>How can a Minister for Finance expect people to accept his credibility regarding everything he says when he announces something on one occasion but withdraws part of the concession within 12 months when only a third of the term of the pilot project has expired?  How does the Minister think this affects people who drew up plans and made investment commitments with regard to availing of the facilities?  The position is unsatisfactory and extraordinary. It is shady practice for any Government to indulge in because it undermines the confidence of the business and investing community in a Government which takes such a step and makes such a major change.</P>
      <P>Many investment decisions, which ultimately result in employment creation, are determined by people who seek to understand and study the Government's policies.  These are most clearly and comprehensively set out each year in the Budget Statement and particularly in the Finance Bill.  I wish to register my protest and serious concern about the reneging by the Minister for Finance and the Government on commitments they openly and public entered into in the House and in the Finance Act last year.  They said this tax concession in the designated areas would be available for three years.  This move is an extraordinary new twist in the cavalier way in which this Government treats the people.</P>

      <P>Mrs. Maggie Thatcher once said that it is a funny old world. She was not the first person to say it, but it sticks particularly in one's memory because she said it at such a pivotal point in her career.  Listening to contributions in the House today, that thought came strongly to mind.  It is indeed a funny old world.  For example, <Col N="252" /> Deputy Costello said that perhaps our taxation system was not too severe after all and that the tax take in Ireland was not as high as that in other countries. That is the case because the tax take in other European countries is higher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>One example is Denmark. The tax take is high, but the social services are so developed and good there that one cannot make a comparison. The level of public and social services in that country are so good that taxpayers get a much better return.  Their services are much better than those we receive in Ireland.  One cannot put forward one side of the argument without acknowledging the other side.</P>
      <P>We should acknowledge that the biggest single problem facing this country is unemployment and that the biggest single challenge facing society and the Government is the creation of jobs.  One must acknowledge that the annual budget and Finance Bill provide a major opportunity at least to attempt to create the conditions in which additional jobs can be created.  Anybody who does not seek that objective in a budget and who does not try to put it in place is living in cloud-cuckoo-land.  At present, there are 280,000 people on the live register.  In addition, about 80,000 people involved in various schemes are without work but are excluded from the register for administrative reasons.  This means that a total of 360,000 people are out of work.  One person in four in the workforce cannot find a full-time, permanent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances it is hardly surprising that solving the unemployment problem ought to be the priority of all political parties.  What is surprising, however, is the manner in which we set about solving the problem.  Instead of rewarding work, encouraging people to move into paid employment and encouraging investors to generate jobs we do the opposite.  Through our taxation system we penalise people who want to enter employment and investors <Col N="253" /> or employers who would, in other circumstances, be able to generate additional employment.</P>
    <P>We impose no fewer than four taxes on earned income &mdash; income tax, employees' PRSI, the health levy and the training and employment levy.  This means that the same income is taxed four times; we pay tax on tax.  The combined effect of these impositions places an enormous burden on workers.  Taking account of all levies, the real marginal rate is an incredible 56 per cent.  It might not be so bad if this exorbitant rate were incurred only by the well off, but that is not the case.  A single worker on PAYE is hit with the punitive 56 per cent rate as soon as his income exceeds £247 per week.</P>
    <P>An ordinary worker on an average income is paying tax at 56 per cent.  If that worker earns an additional £10 for overtime, the Government takes £5.58 leaving the worker with £4.42.  That is how we tax work in this country.  Under our crazy taxation system a single person on a relatively modest income of £300 per week pays a total of £93 per week in tax.  Short of making work illegal, there is little more we could do to discourage people from taking a job.</P>
    <P>The situation is compounded by the payroll tax, employers' PRSI, that is levied on all wages and salaries.  This is effectively a tax on jobs and acts as a further disincentive to the creation of new employment.  Let us take the case of the person earning £300 per week, to whom I referred earlier.  That individual takes home £207 per week.  However, it costs the employer £336 to give that employee £207 into his hand.  In other words, the Government steps in and collects £129 from this single transaction. That is the scale of our taxation problem. Should the worker seek a pay rise, it would cost the employer £2.53 to put an extra £1 in take home pay into that worker's pocket.</P>
    <P>Our taxation system is in urgent need of fundamental change, not change that fiddles around with the margins.  If any country in Europe needs such change, it <Col N="254" /> is ours and we need it now.  A generation of young people is growing up. They will be wondering what kind of system we have in place that will enable them to get work in their own country. We must look at our taxation system. We need change in order to relieve the pressure on hard pressed workers, to create more jobs and to encourage investment, both domestic and external. We must encourage the type of investment that will generate enough jobs to meet at least some of the needs of the young generation.</P>
    <P>Tax reform is the key to solving the problem.  Deputy Costello did not agree with me in that regard.  I am not saying that tax reform is the total solution, but if there is one single instrument at our disposal &mdash; we forge the taxation system and it is at our discretion to change it &mdash; which is not influenced by any outside factor, it is our taxation system.  There are outside factors which sometimes militate against job creation.  There are factors over which we have no control that can and do lead to job losses.  There is little or nothing we can do about that but we have control of our taxation system. It is my earnest belief that tax reform is the major key to solving the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The job creation agencies do the best they can but we must recognise that Governments do not create jobs.  They create the conditions under which jobs can be created.  If agencies, boards, committees and commissions were the answer to the unemployment problem, we would have had full employment in this country years ago.  We do not have full employment and it is time we acknowledged that our approach is not working.</P>
    <P>Official figures show that the economy is growing.  They also show that employment is growing.  Why is unemployment so high and why do so few people feel that they are participating in this much vaunted economic miracle?  I believe the official statistics overstate the performance of the economy.  Much of the growth is produced by transnational corporations who concentrate <Col N="255" /> taxable profits in this jurisdiction and repatriate the money to their home countries.  Last year they did so to the tune of £5 billion.  That is one element that helps to give a false picture.  The economy is growing but not as fast as we think and not fast enough to generate significant numbers of jobs.</P>
    <P>What about the employment figures? The most recent detailed assessment of the employment situation is the labour force survey for April 1994.  It is a pity we must work with data so out of date but it is the only data available.  That survey showed that 67,000 jobs had been created in the previous three years.  It also showed, however, that 45,000 of those jobs were part-time.  In other words, two out of every three jobs created during that period were part-time. I am all in favour of part-time work and such job sharing ought to be encouraged.  However, we must be careful when we use these statistics.  If we are honest we must make a very clear distinction between part-time and full-time jobs.  How can we plan the future if we do not have accurate statistics which give us the true picture, rather than statistics where a part-time job can be represented as full-time?  That gives a false picture of how the economy is doing.</P>
    <P>It may be leading the planners astray but it is not leading astray the people who know the situation on the ground. My constituents know how many full-time and part-time jobs are being created.  It is very foolish not to acknowledge the nature of jobs when we are compiling the statistics.  In supermarkets in my constituency jobs which were full-time six or seven years ago are now shared by three people.  That is a feature of the retail trade at the moment.  I prefer to see three people working but we ought to advert to that reality.</P>
    <P>State sponsored employment schemes have become an integral feature of the economy.  The number of people participating in these schemes now stands at 41,000, an increase of 25,000 over the <Col N="256" /> last three years.  I am not saying this work is not valuable or of benefit. Nevertheless, we ought not to delude ourselves that these are new full-time jobs because they are not.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Cork North Central an in-depth survey was carried out within the last two months which demonstrates that the level of unemployment has risen by 2 per cent in Cork North Central in the last 12 months.  The survey was carried out by an independent and highly respected social researcher and is a detailed and painstaking report.  Why is my constituency at variance with what is being promoted as the great national trend?  What are we doing wrong in Cork North Central? Why is Cork North Central being left behind?  I would love to pose these questions to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment if he were here to listen to me.  There are very serious questions to be answered, particularly in respect of my constituency.  I will raise this point again in a more structured way at Question Time and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If we exclude part-time jobs and positions on Government schemes, this country is not doing nearly as well as we would like to pretend.  There is a great deal of the politics of pretence going on at the moment.  My thesis is that the country will not do well until we dismantle our taxation system.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats put forward a clear and coherent strategy for taxation and tax reform in January this year.  The main proposals in that strategy included reducing the basic rate of tax from 27 per cent to 20 per cent, reducing the top rate of tax from 48 per cent to 40 per cent, abolishing employees' PRSI and the health and employment levies, and cutting employers' PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 7.5 per cent.  In addition, we proposed the standard rate of corporation tax should be reduced from 38 per cent to 25 per cent to encourage job creating investment in labour intensive service sector industries, particularly tourism.  It is envisaged that all these measures would be phased in during the lifetime <Col N="257" /> of one Government.  We provided detailed projections to illustrate how these tax reductions would be funded. Essentially, we believe some of the fruits of economic growth should be applied to reducing the tax burden on workers and rewarding risk takers.</P>
    <P>The tax changes I have outlined would transform the economics of work. In the case of a single worker earning £300 per week, the tax reduction would result in an extra £42 in take home pay per week.  A worker earning £200 per week would be better off by £23 per week in take home pay.  These tax breaks would give people a real reward for work and would provide an incentive to move off the dole and into paid employment.  Compare these measures with the penny pinching ones in this year's budget which gave the average worker a tax cut worth less than the price of a pint per week.  Low paid workers in the public service fared even worse.  A clerical assistant in the Civil Service earning £190 per week gained the princely sum of 87p per week in the 1996 budget.  That is just enough to buy a can of Coke and a Mars bar.  We should not be too surprised that these people feel aggrieved and are engaged in an increasingly bitter dispute with the Government.</P>
    <P>Is it realistic to think in terms of tax changes as radical as those I have proposed ?  I think it is.  The key to tax reform is prudent management of the public finances.  We can generate the resources to fund tax reduction, provided we keep the rate of growth in public expenditure in line with inflation. The route to tax reform lies not in cutting public spending but in controlling it.  For proof of this one need only look at the expenditure figure for the current year.  Government spending this year will rise by about £650 million over the 1995 base level.  If spending had been kept in line with inflation that would have released about £400 million to fund a reduction in personal taxation, enough to cut the basic rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 22 per cent in a single year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> It is possible to contain public spending and cut tax rates while still preserving, or even improving, the quality of services provided by the Government to the people.  We, as a nation, and our Government have the choice.  The choice is not between spending cuts and tax cuts but between a spendthrift approach to the public finances which will ruin us all in the long-term and a prudent approach to fiscal management which will reward work, reduce unemployment and restore social cohesion. The choice is in our hands.  This is the battleground on which the next general election will be fought.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some specific points in relation to the environment, for which I am my party's spokesperson.  It was my hope that a number of taxation changes would have been made in the Bill which would have enabled some of the promises contained in the programme.  <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to be implemented.  This is the Minister's second budget and it is reasonable to expect that there will be one more budget &mdash; a third &mdash; from the Government.</P>
    <P>The programme for renewal set out the policy basis of the Government. One promise contained in the programme was that a number of conservation measures would be made in the Government's budgets.  These specifically included the promise to give effect to the principle that the polluter pays, which is the basis of the Waste Management Bill, one of the most important Bills that has passed through the House. However, there is no evidence in the Finance Bill to suggest that effect is being given to this principle.</P>
    <P>The programme for renewal also promises that incentives and charges will be put in place to reduce the amount of hydrocarbon being used &mdash; a hydrocarbon tax was hinted at &mdash; and that something will be done to address the conservation element of energy. However, there is no evidence in any of the provisions of this Bill that any effect is being given to even the most incipient element of this promise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> There was also a promise to create incentive mechanisms to conserve listed buildings, which has received no mention in the Bill.  The environmental promises, and the vision set out in the programme for renewal that a series of mechanisms would be in place not alone to promote a good, healthy green environment but also to protect the built environment, are not acknowledged, adverted to or incorporated in the Bill. This is very disappointing.  If there is only one more budget to be introduced by this Government, how can it address the promise it held out in this area, a promise that gave a sense of anticipation and suggested that this was a sensitive Government determined to preserve the green environment and to do something practical and specific to preserve the built environment?  There has been no effort in the two budgets introduced by the Government to give effect to this promise.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to advise the Minister for Finance of my views on this because I do not see the fine targets set out in the programme for renewal being met in the one budget remaining to the Government.  It is not possible to overturn procedures and practices that have been built up over almost a century in the context of one budget. However, if one commences the process in a given budget for any year and it is phased in over stages the chances are that real change will be effected in the lifetime of one Government.</P>
    <P>This also applies to tax reform and tax reduction.  No Government can achieve everything in the context of one budget, but any Government that does not attempt to do so in a serious way through every budget at its disposal is being negligent with regard to its obligations.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Bell.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  The debate enables us to consider the Government's proposals over the coming 12 months.  When the Bill is <Col N="260" /> passed the statutory power of the Dáil is in place with regard to the taxation changes introduced by the Minister for Finance.  I welcome these changes.</P>
      <P>This is the Government's first full budget.  Last year it took office half way during the term of the Dáil and half way through the budgetary preparations of the previous Government.  We therefore inherited the bones of the previous budget and had to put flesh on it.  Some of the Government's policies were included in that budget, but this year's budget contained the full thrust of the Government's policies for the remainder of the term of this Dáil.  The budget next year will be a further step in this regard following which I look forward to a full five-year programme for the Government when it can complete the programme of work it has outlined.</P>
      <P>I am very happy with the management of the country which the Government has provided, from the Taoiseach to all of the Ministers and Ministers of State.  They have provided good management and leadership, which has been noted by the people.  Confidence has been restored.</P>
      <P>I have never seen so much activity across the economy.  The yardstick of the development of any nation is its building industry.  The building industry in this country is flying in every respect. I travel to this city three mornings a week and everywhere see the cranes in the sky like flags waving.  Major construction developments begin every week.  The refurbishment of retail outlets indicates that people in business are reinvesting, giving a face-lift to their business because they have confidence that their products have a market and that people are prepared to spend their money and buy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only our cities which are in this state.  It often angered me when I first started to come to Dublin regularly in 1987 to see the amount of development taking place around our capital city &mdash; roadworks, by-passes, ring roads &mdash; while rural Ireland was being neglected. I addressed the issue of road structures in rural Ireland, which were <Col N="261" /> being neglected and devastated, while on the Opposition benches.  Indeed, a Cheann Comhairle, you had reason to ask me to leave the House on a number of occasions.  It was not because I wanted to be difficult but because the message was not being listened to.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad this policy has been reversed and that the wealth of the nation has been spread equally all over the country.  This is right and proper.  No section of the people should be deprived of the benefits when the country is booming and when there is reasonable hope of progress and development.  The people of rural Ireland are satisfied that their case is being listened to.  Substantial improvement has taken place in road structures in the past 12 to 18 months and confidence has been restored.  It is only necessary to take a drive any Sunday afternoon to any byroad or county road to observe the sites that are being developed.  Fine two-storey houses are being built.  People have confidence that rural Ireland is a place to which they can return to live.  It is all about people living in an area and the developments, including businesses, that will ensue.  I am happy to see it.</P>
    <P>I am also happy that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is so capable at a time of crisis and that, with the Government we have, the farmers will not be neglected during the beef crisis.  Agriculture is one of our most important industries.  It is still the bedrock of our economy.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of the beef industry in Ireland and the essential national interest involved, calls on the Government to confront the deep crisis in the <Col N="262" /> industry by achieving a determined practical response at European Union level to the immediate situation and further calls on the Government to restore customer confidence in Irish beef both at home and abroad by taking the required political action necessary to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of the beef industry in Ireland and the essential national interest involved, commends the efforts of the Government to confront the crisis in the industry, to restore consumer confidence in Irish beef and to secure the reopening of vital export markets&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share time with Deputy Sargent.  I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the serious situation which has developed in the meat industry.  The BSE scare has affected many livelihoods and serious costs could be incurred by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is unfortunate given that this country was responsible in ensuring that all infected animals were slaughtered.  There were virtually no outbreaks of BSE.</P>
      <P>Recently we spoke about the 40,000 beef producers.  In areas like mine three quarters of farmers are cattle producers, while only one quarter are milk suppliers. This crisis has come on top of the fines in relation to export refunds, which were reduced, the substantial increase in feed prices and the high cost of store cattle.  Cattle producers face considerable problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda surveillance must now be provided along the Border.  I pay tribute to the Garda in this regard.  A heavy demand has been placed on it since it was decided to close the Border to <Col N="263" /> cattle and meat products.  The Garda must provide surveillance 24 hours per day seven days per week and also keep check on heavy traffic across the Border, which includes refrigerated and grain lorries.  Since the opening of Border roads, traffic in both directions has increased.  It will be a costly operation for the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>It was regrettable that following the restoration of beef slaughtering and the agreement with the rendering plant the plants came out with 88p to 92p per pound for cattle.  The IFA and a number of other sources claimed that it should have been 97p.  I appeal to the slaughter plants not make heavy losses more severe by cutting back on that 5p or 6p per pound which would make a difference. I hope this matter will be resolved to the satisfaction of the Department.</P>

      <P>Teastaíonn uaim cupla rud a rá mar gheall ar an bhfadhb seo, fadhb na mairteola.  I ndáirire, baineann sé le hÉirinn ina iomlán.</P>
      <P>It is a sad day that we must discuss this crisis in the House, but we must say what needs to be said.  We must make sure actions and measures are taken which will ensure that we do not find ourselves in this sorry situation again. Over the past number of years there were opportunities to establish and enhance the good name of Irish food, but, I am sorry to say, the Green Party feels that many of these opportunities were squandered.  When we had an opportunity to opt for a less intensive and more healty type of food production, we circled so to speak the cosy cartel which supports intensive and conventional agricultural methods which have, in many ways, led to this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity An Bord Bia did not market Irish beef with the country of origin marked clearly and unequivocally so that there would not have been confusion in the international market.  It is also a pity that consumers have been kept in the dark as regards the contents of food products as this has resulted in a reactionary response.  Consumers are <Col N="264" /> fast catching up in terms of the deficit of knowledge which they have experienced until now.  Consumers will be aware from the newspapers that BSE is difficult to destroy, it jumps from species to species, mutates in the receiving host and its incubation can last for up to ten years.  The political system under which we operate is helpless when it comes to dealing with short-term pressures and the overriding need to ensure that we do not face this crisis again, even if it is one of perception rather than reality.</P>
    <P>The Green Party wants eight measures to be taken on board.  First, a monitoring and inspection task force should be available to all farms where there has already been a case of BSE to check regularly animals, soil and water, etc., and to track down all imported animals over the past five years and the progeny of imported embryos.  Second, we must pursue relentlessly here and in Europe a policy of country of origin to enable both the responsibility of the producer and the loyalty of the consumer to be forged.</P>
    <P>Third, we must immediately establish an independent statutory food safety council comprising representatives from grass roots consumer groups, small food producers, farmers and environmentalists. Fourth, we must establish a standing Dáil committee on food safety. Fifth, we must end the cartel in the meat industry and give grant aid instead to the farmer owned meat co-operatives which would not leave farmers open to exploitation when they could least afford to combat it and which would help bring about a realistic debate on live exports and phasing out that practice.</P>
    <P>Sixth, we must genuinely support organic farming which is governed by rigorous standards which must be reached before symbols can be granted in areas such as soil, inputs and the humane treatment of animals.  Seventh, we must look for methods to protect the taxpayer from having to pay for the mistakes of this and previous Governments, the European obsession with transboundary trade and the real price of <Col N="265" /> intensive agriculture.  This crisis shows that the cost of conventional agriculture is often not taken on board when we look at this price in the beginning. Finally, we should stop the ambiguous talk about lifting the ban on feeding bonemeal to pigs and poultry.  I warn the Government that consumers will not tolerate such ambiguity and, ultimately, their decision will be crucial for the future of agriculture as we know it.</P>
    <P>The Government should take on board the fact that An Bord Bia is not a food safety council.  It is designed to promote the production and marketing of produce, not to deal with food safety implications and the health worries of consumers.  This needs to be taken on board because otherwise confidence will not be restored as it ought to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak for five minutes, to give five minutes of my time to Deputy Crawford and the remainder to Labour and Democratic Left.</P>
      <P>This issue is most serious and its full gravity is not grasped by most people. From the point of view of the people I represent, it is sheer disaster.  I know farmers who have sheds full of cattle and no place for them to go.  Their income has gone and we should start from this point.  I cannot address in five minutes an issue which one could talk about for five hours.  I have no problem with some of Deputy Sargent's points but he is taking some licence with the idea that BSE can jump from one species to another.  There is no professional, veterinary or medical evidence that this is so.  It is important to stress that there is no lateral spread of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1989 we have taken a sensible and responsible approach in the way we handle BSE in our national herd and I congratulate the Government of the time.  However, we did not get this across to the rest of the world in the way we should have.  Our first priority at present is to get a reasonable sales outlet for the 40,000 cattle.  I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the revised intervention <Col N="266" /> scheme and I hope factories will not play footsie with it.  If the boning allowance is increased, as I hope, there is no reason factories should not be able to pay substantially more than 92p, 93p or 94p per pound.</P>
    <P>Our second priority should be to make the most concerted effort imaginable from a sales point of view in every market in the world, whether it is for live or dead meat.  We have a product which the world wants to buy.  We have become aware of this priority, particularly in the past week or ten days.</P>
    <P>I am taken aback by the fact that it has taken our marketing people so long to get our message across in the UK.  A few days ago a survey was carried out at a meat counter in greater London in which ten housewives were asked for the countries of their preference with regard to beef.  None of them mentioned Ireland.  Some of them mentioned Aberdeen Angus beef from the hills of Scotland. This is a myth but a good tactical marketing ploy from the Scottish marketing board.  An Bord Bia will have to do more than it is now doing.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems facing the industry and the community is what to do with offal after the next five or six weeks.  It cannot be burned because this would pollute the atmosphere, it cannot be buried because this would pollute water and it cannot be spread on land because this would spread TB and brucellosis. All we can do with it at the moment is to put it into meat and bonemeal which will not be used.  Environmentalists, farmers and everybody else need answers to this problem extremely quickly.</P>
    <P>From a marketing point of view, every animal in future should have a CV showing for each stage from farm to processor to export market, where it came from, what it was fed, the medicines it was given and, from a veterinary point of view, that it is clear of disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for giving us the opportunity to speak on this, but for a different reason than it put forward.  It is important that we <Col N="267" /> put the record straight with regard to what the Government has tried to do in a difficult situation.  The world market for beef was closed down as a result of two days' discussion in the House of Commons.  Our Government stepped in immediately to take whatever steps were necessary.  The Minister for Justice, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, above all, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Taoiseach did everything possible to deal with the situation.  The use of gimmicks to suggest nothing was happening was a disservice to farmers and the nation at a time of great catastrophe.</P>
      <P>The European market is important but the issue of third country markets became very important once the ban on British beef was imposed.  Russia bought 120,000 to 130,000 tonnes of our beef last year and that market was kept open by the Government.  Egypt bought 40,000 tonnes of our beef and 160,000 live cattle last year and that market was reopened in a matter of days by the intervention of the Minister and his officials and the direct intervention of the Taoiseach with the Egyptian prime minister.  It took three years previously to open up markets in a much less difficult situation.  The Saudi Arabian and Gulf markets remained open and they are buying 40,000 tonnes.  Iran was highlighted as being a major market but it only bought 25,000 tonnes last year. Despite the best efforts of the Department's officials, all that is happening there is that meat is going into bonded storage and I hope the Minister and his officials will be able to get this released as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been criticised for the lack of effort by An Bord Bia to market our beef.  Shortly before this Government came to power, the previous Government allocated a budget of over £3 million for the promotion of food.  This has now been increased to £15 million but much more must be spent.  We should look at the amount spent by Heinz on promotion.  It takes a <Col N="268" /> great deal of money to promote a product and get it placed on the market.  It is easy for people to say Irish beef should be on all the shelves in the UK and we would all love this to happen. The Minister made an effort a few months ago to start a major promotion of Irish beef there.  However, a few people decided, supposedly in the interests of the country, to plant a bomb in Canary Wharf and that promotion had to be quickly dropped.</P>
    <P>I am sick, sore and tired of the Opposition suggesting that the changes in the intervention system were easily achieved.  This system as it existed three weeks ago was the result of negotiations by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, and the then Irish EU Commissioner and former Minister for Agriculture and Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry.  It was they who introduced the 340 kilogram rule and the 82p per lb. base for an intervention price.  They have to be shown up for what they provided as a safeguard for this country if the problem arose.  When the problem arose the Minister had to save us from a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>A person I spoke to a few minutes ago said he was offered 95p per lb. for beef by a factory.  Farmers in Northern Ireland are been offered a little over 80p per lb.  Those cattle cannot be moved and the farmers do not know what will happen.  Some people say that the British Government got a bonanza from Europe and that our Minister did not get anything.  For the sake of this nation, its farmers and those employed in the industry we should deal with the facts and make it clear that we have had a problem.  For once let us work together as parliamentarians to ensure that every market possible is reopened to our beef, the slaughter lines are maintained, the workers get paid and farmers get a reasonable return.</P>
    <P>Mention of Commissioner MacSharry reminds me of the meeting attended by hundreds of farmers in Portlaoise last night.  They were encouraged to get <Col N="269" /> involved in deer farming as an alternative enterprise to beef production. However, they are now bankrupt.  They believed deer farming was great when an individual bid £27,500 for a stag. Commissioner MacSharry was portrayed as the saviour of the Irish nation. The person who will be seen to be the saviour of the Irish nation, as far as agriculture is concerned, is none other than Minister Yates.  He has worked tirelessly on behalf of Irish farmers and was supported by his Minister of State, his civil servants and diplomats in our embassies. We must vote confidence in the Minister, the Government and the Taoiseach for the tremendous efforts they have made to deal with the beef crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather Deputy Cowen said that Dublin and urban TDs do not understand the problems of rural Ireland.  I do not think that is quite fair or the case.  Some of us remember them and I have a certain understanding of them.  However, as a Dublin TD I wish the shoe was on the other foot and the challenge reciprocated.  Many rural representatives do not understand the problems of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Many Dublin public representatives have a great deal to learn from our rural colleagues in the art and science of lobbying at which they are first class.  They may even be world leaders; I suspect that some of them are the best in the world.  Other countries must look at them very carefully to imitate the tremendous technology, commitment, capacity and persistence they have developed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Dublin public representative I am doing my best to learn from them.  I have a great deal to do before Dublin constituencies are represented to anything like the same level of effectiveness as rural areas.  The amount of income tax collected in Dublin city, which has a huge drug and unemployment problem, is the highest of any area in the country yet the effectiveness and lobbying on matters is dismal compared to the <Col N="270" /> efficiency and effectiveness of representation with which our rural colleagues are able to act.</P>
    <P>On the more substantial question of BSE, I agree with Deputy Connaughton that every animal should have a CV. More precisely, every piece of meat should have a CV to the extent that its origin can be traced.  If that is to occur great changes are required in the outlook of those who run and control Irish agriculture.  Irish agriculture, and the Irish beef industry in particular, will have to restructure its approach to business. A marketing approach must be adopted as distinct from simply producing commodities and dumping them on the most convenient market or unloading them to the highest bidder. That is no way for a serious business with a turnover of almost £2 billion to operate in a developing economy.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly those in the farming sector and Opposition Deputies suggest that more money should be spent on marketing.  That is incredible because a marketing strategy cannot be put together in a week, a fortnight or a month.  Product perception, or the consumer's view of a product, is developed slowly and painfully over time.  A significant effort has been made to do that. The same is true of research into BSE. One must build that capacity slowly and painfully over a prolonged period. Unless we are prepared to make that investment, we are simply going to have more of these crises.</P>
    <P>To some extent what we are seeing now is an exaggerated form of what happened on a number of occasions since this disease was first encountered about 1986.  If we were serious about confronting the great damage it could do to our economy we would not be relying on somebody in a supermarket chain in the United Kingdom sticking a green stamp on packages of meat.  That is no way to do business.  We should have developed the brands and we are now paying a very serious price for not having done so.</P>
    <P>While this storm may blow over it will not disappear.  We will be left with a <Col N="271" /> residue of damage and I hope we will have learned from the painful lessons.</P>
    <P>There are some central aspects to those painful lessons.  For example, we will have to eliminate some of the carryon in the beef industry, including the use of hormones and angel dust.  Some farmers have given their lives for angel dust.  In the way that this end of the market accommodates itself, they changed it from a dust preparation to a liquid in order to save lives.  It is much more difficult for people to kill themselves unless they drink the liquid.  This activity has been well documented and we seem, as a country and an industry, to be unable to learn from the lessons of the past.  It is high time we cleaned up our act.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, BSE is not a great problem in this country.  There have been about 124 cases, a number of which are directly traceable to animals and foodstuffs which came from the UK.  It would be worthwhile trying to trace the cause of BSE in those cases which cannot be directly linked to food or animals which were imported from the UK.  A greater effort should be made to figure out the cause.</P>
    <P>Consumer attitudes and values will be crucial in this matter.  We should learn to deal with food scares.  It is a dull year when there is not a decent food scare. Most of the major food products have been the subject of scares: there was a scare about eggs in the UK which was made more colourful by Edwina Currie; radioactive fish are coming in from the seas off Sellafield; mutton and lamb from mountainous regions of the country picked up fallout from Chernobyl and there have been various food poisoning scares about poultry.  We have not learned to deal with such scares. Our management of such problems is inadequate.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry should set up a unit to deal with these problems and develop some damage limitation expertise in handling scares.  We must learn from the past because another scare cannot be too far away.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> I agree with what has been said with regard to the efforts made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry with regard to intervention.  The Taoiseach has spent a lot of time telephoning world leaders on these issues and I compliment him on his work.</P>

      <P>Last night I watched a couple of minutes of Deputy Cowen growling, snarling and venting his frustration at how effectively this Government has mobilised to confront a crisis not of its making.  Deputy Cowen kept repeating a new mantra about how prominent members of this Government who made their political names from ballyragging the agricultural industry are now refusing to defend it.  Deputy Cowen is wrong on both counts &mdash; no member of this Government, prominent or otherwise, ballyragged the agricultural industry and no member of this Government has refrained from pulling his or her weight in seeking to protect this industry and to restore consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>I have never attacked this industry, although I have attacked some of the malpractices in the industry and the skulduggery, tax evasion and orchestrated wrongdoing of a small number of the main players in it.  There is a wealth of conclusive findings about the extent of that wrongdoing and the record of the House will show that I and others raised these issues precisely because damage was being done to the industry and competitors were being unfairly done down or squeezed out.  The most charitable thing &mdash; and it is charitable in the extreme &mdash; one can say about Deputy Cowen's party is that it turned a blind eye and the chickens have since returned to roost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there is a silver lining to the cloud that has come across the Irish Sea.  Perhaps the industry has learned lessons about the need for the <Col N="273" /> industry itself to take ruthless measures to protect its high quality reputation from the small number who have no qualms about putting that reputation at risk to feed their own greed.  We can have the cleanest, purest, high quality beef product in Europe, which I believe we have, and the best medical, scientific and veterinary experts testifying to that standard, but without consumer confidence it is worthless.  Therefore, producers and processors must be prepared to publicly acknowledge the centrality of the consumer.  We have an informed consumer policy and the livelihoods of producers and processors are inextricably linked to the choices they make.</P>
      <P>In this crisis, it is a matter of some gratification to the Government that beef sales are back up to 90 per cent of normal levels and I acknowledge the contribution made by the expert advisory group I set up to restoring that level of consumer confidence.  It is pathetic, therefore, to watch Deputy Cowen flailing around because I did my job effectively as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs.  It is churlish in the extreme that Deputy Cowen cannot bring himself to acknowledge the extraordinary industry, energy and tireless commitment of my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, in dealing effectively with a crisis foisted on him from outside.  If he could overcome his political bile, Deputy Cowen could make a positive contribution although sending him abroad in the role of ambassador is like sending Mike Tyson to ballet lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, on 29 March I assembled an expert group to advise consumers, the Government and the trade, on the implications of the European Union export ban, which remains in place, on products derived from cattle slaughtered in the UK.  The appointment of the group resulted from a meeting which I had with a delegation representing the grocery trade and RGDATA on 28 March.  The terms of reference of the advisory group were to advise the Government, consumers, the <Col N="274" /> retail, wholesale and distribution trades, food processors, and farmers, and to make such recommendations, if any, as the expert advisory group concluded were necessary in consequence of, or in order to implement, the decision of the European Commission of 27 March 1996.</P>
    <P>The group was chaired by the Director of Consumer Affairs, an independent statutory officer.  The group included representatives of: the Consumers' Association of Ireland; veterinary and administrative staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health; the Chairman of the Food Safety Advisory Board &mdash; a statutory body established by order of the Minister for Health in 1995; staff of the Department of Enterprise and Employment; RGDATA; five large retail multiples and IBEC.</P>
    <P>I felt it important that the group should have a strong consumer voice as well as being supported by scientific, medical and veterinary personnel.  The group met on 30 March and 2 April.  In addressing the group at its inaugural meeting, I emphasised it was being given a free hand in conducting its affairs and that there would be no attempt by me or any other member of the Government to influence its work in any way.  More importantly, I assured the group that if, during the course of its work, evidence was uncovered which would point to real or potential health risks associated with the consumption of beef or products containing beef, the information would be put into the public domain without delay.</P>
    <P>Arising from its meeting on 30 March, the group issued a statement that, based on the best medical, scientific and veterinary advice currently available, there was no need for consumer concern relating to foodstuffs on the shelves containing minimal beef derivatives or products such as Irish beef, gelatine or dairy products, and that consumer helplines had been installed in the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> At its meeting on 2 April, the group formulated guidelines on beef and beef products, a copy of which I circulated earlier today with the reply to a parliamentary question.  It is important to note that these guidelines received the whole-hearted endorsement of all group members.  The guidelines are in the form of a series of questions and answers relating to products and issues which had been most commonly voiced by consumers.</P>
    <P>In particular, the guidelines address such issues of concern as the effect of the EU export ban; whether Irish beef, Irish beef products, products which have an Irish beef content or Irish dairy products are safe to eat; the parts of the animal affected by BSE and if there is a risk of the spinal cord or the brain of an infected animal entering the food chain; the position of animals in herds where there is a case of BSE and whether products from these animals can enter the human food chain; the safety of products such as meat pies or stock cubes made from UK beef or with a UK beef content and the safety of beef lard, gelatine, UK dairy products, cosmetics and pet foods.  I am pleased to inform the House that, in view of the expert group, all the products referred to are safe to consume.  This view is based on the best scientific, medical and veterinary advice available to the group.</P>
    <P>Moreover the Food Safety Advisory Board, a statutory body established in 1995 by the Minister for Heath reaffirmed last week that Irish beef and products derived from it are safe.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to imagine a more important area than food quality and purity where the rights and expectations of the consumer must be paramount.  If consumers cannot trust the quality and purity of our food, we are in trouble. Ireland, as a major world producer of food, must have the highest standards, rigorously enforced and effectively policed. Because of the importance of food production and processing to our economy and international trade, we must not have a shadow of suspicion <Col N="276" /> attaching to our production.  That is why, in the case of BSE, Irish Governments have acted decisively from the moment the disease was identified and shown to be transmissable.  From the outset, we have developed a policy based on: making BSE a compulsory notifiable disease; the establishment of an active BSE surveillance programme; a ban on the feeding to ruminants of protein products originating from ruminants; complete destruction of all infected cattle; and the slaughter and exclusion from the food chain of all cattle in herds in which the disease has been diagnosed.  Would that the United Kingdom authorities had acted in the same fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Nolan, Moynihan and O'Malley.  We are not here to score political points.  If the scare is not overcome, there will be tremendous and horrifying consequences for this country. I wish I was as confident as the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that there is only a 10 per cent reduction. Most people involved, family butchers, in particular, have found the reduction to be much bigger.  They also find the return to beef consumption is not as fast as it was in the case of other scares which affected the industry some time ago.</P>
      <P>We are worried about the future of the industry.  We dealt with and controlled BSE but we are worried about the damage being done by this scare. BSE is now seen as being a major source of health problems.  This crisis has been caused by our near neighbours, the British Government, who failed to take positive action and who were responsible for allowing wet rendering in meat and bonemeal plants, which led to the present crisis.  It was a money saving exercise and we all know that a penny saved can sometimes later cost many pounds.  That is exactly what is happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no need to examine the background.  Irish Governments have <Col N="277" /> dealt with the disease in a positive manner since it first appeared.  The slaughter policy gave consumer confidence which enabled the meat industry to continue and enabled farmers to stand over the produce they sold.  There is now a need to introduce full tests for residue on every carcase.  The estimated cost is approximately £7 per carcase.  The consumer confidence that would be induced by spending that £7, or approximately 1p per pound, would outweigh the cost of providing such tests.  I appeal to the Minister of State, as I appealed to the Minister at question time on a previous occasion, to examine the possibility of introducing the test for all carcases.  It would create confidence and remove any question about carcases which might contain clenbuterol or any other jungle juice.  These substances are used unscrupulously by some people and, as Deputy Upton said, have led to the death of greedy people.  It is sad that people are prepared to put their lives on the line and other people's lives at risk for enormous personal financial gain. Until such tests are implemented we will have confidence problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister should press at European level for a restoration of the refunds on exports to September 1995 levels.  The problems with intervention are well known and the grading of intervention carcases must be clarified in the not too distant future.  The prices proposed for intervention carcases are not what anybody expected.  In fact, the President of the IFA stated in a press release today that the proposed intervention should yield no less than 97p per pound.  That is only the &ldquo;break even&rdquo; position for those who have winter cattle.</P>
    <P>The need to restore long-term confidence to consumers is a more serious problem which must be examined. There is not any danger to anybody from the consumption of Irish beef. Indeed, it is unusual to see our friends in the north now decide that all their cattle are Irish.  However, we all know they have imported cattle directly from England and Scotland for several years <Col N="278" /> because there are no health regulations in Northern Ireland on imports from Britain.  If they wish to achieve the same status as this part of the island, they should impose a ban on the import into Northern Ireland of cattle from countries which do not meet the same health regulations.</P>
    <P>The BSE scare has brought a crisis but presents a golden opportunity to make a new efficient positive market image for Irish beef.  If the Minister decided to introduce a mandatory test for all carcases, European consumer confidence in the Irish product would rise quickly.  Consumers in world markets want to buy a superior product and are willing to pay a handsome premium for it.</P>
    <P>It is sad that certain factories once told farmers that if their cattle had not been treated with growth promoters or clenbuterol, they would not take them. I hope such practices have now ceased. However there is a need for a clean bill of health for every carcase.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Minister to introduce mandatory post and pre-mortem tests on all animals at the first available opportunity and ensure that anybody found to be in contravention of the regulations will pay the necessary price by being banned from involvement in the production of meat.  It is unfair that those who do the job right should be penalised for the sins of others.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this second Fianna Fáil motion in a number of weeks on this matter.  The complacency of the Government is incredible.  It is unfortunate that the Fianna Fáil Party must put down another motion to highlight the inaction by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his colleagues. Indeed, the Taoiseach had to be brought roaring and screaming to telephone President Mubarak when two Irish shiploads of live cattle were bound off the coast of Egypt.  He was pressurised by my party, the IFA and the beef industry to pick up the telephone. <Col N="279" /> Although we succeeded in landing those two shipments, I understand another ship was lying off the Egyptian coast up to last weekend.  It is incredible to see the lamentable efforts being made by the Government.  The Tánaiste has effectively side-stepped this issue.  He travels all over the world to various engagements but when we want him to visit our important export markets he is not available.</P>
      <P>The Government has been strong on rhetoric concerning their efforts on behalf of the beef industry but they have done little to effectively reassure beef producers that the problem will be resolved.  There is a distinct lack of confidence among consumers, not just here but on the European mainland, about eating beef.  A recent survey showed that German housewives do not differentiate between Irish and British beef. It is well known that as far as German and French consumers are concerned the problems in England reflect on the purchase of Irish beef in continental supermarkets.</P>
      <P>Some 50 cases of BSE are being discovered every day in England.  As Deputy Ellis said, meat factories here have a lot to answer for in so far as the problems experienced with the illegal use of promoters like angel dust are concerned.  If this problem does nothing else, it will focus the attention of meat producers on what consumers are looking for, which is higher production standards for carcase beef and meat production generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the Government to respond in an effective political manner in our export markets underlines its apathy to the beef industry.  Because of the problems with export refunds in the latter half of 1995, and the strength of the Irish punt in relation to sterling, beef farmers have been experiencing a difficult time.  Coming on top of it, this will cause severe problems for many producers.  I understand the Minister for Agriculture has embarked today, although somewhat belatedly, on a tour of continental markets to try to reassure <Col N="280" /> consumers about the safety of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said:</P>
    <P>The food safety advisory board, a statutory body established in 1995 by the Minister for Health, reaffirmed last week [which is six weeks after the crisis first broke] that Irish beef and products derived from it are safe [to eat].</P>
    <P>This is typical of what the Government has failed to do for beef producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm an seans seo a bheith agam labhairt ar an bhfadhb seo.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The beef industry comprises 6 per cent of domestic produce yet the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry does not seem to realise the crisis that farmers and the nation as a whole face.  He has allowed the REPS to grind almost to a halt preventing the payment of badly needed grants to the farming community in their hour of need.</P>
      <P>I have a number of grant application approvals to farmers for the control of farm pollution scheme for which work was completed last year.  These farmers are now being told they will have to wait 18 months to two years for their money. They are less well off farmers who, up to the introduction of this scheme by the former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, could not afford to build housing and control of farm pollution tanks.  The Minister has placed them in a worse position because they borrowed money from the banks with the intention of paying back the biggest part of the loan with a grant for such buildings from the Department.</P>
      <P>We should not wait while others destroy our beef industry.  We must get to foreign markets early and promote our organic produce.  The Minister is like the fire brigade, waiting for damage to be done before he acts.  He should have organised a Government blitz to promote our beef so that we could obtain the best possible prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> Some left wing members of the Government have little sympathy for the farming community.  Their comments have been scornful of the beef industry and farm taxation, but they fail to realise that when farmers do well the country benefits, and when farmers do badly so does everyone else.  The Government is not coming up with the goods and this will have an effect on the country.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the intervention deal but it is not such a good deal. Cattle that are being graded and put into intervention this week will be worth 92p per lb. but, according to the intervention tender, next week cattle will be worth 87p per lb. which represents a drop of about £40 a head in one week. Before the BSE crisis broke, a cow weighing 700 lbs. was worth 88p per lb. at the factory which amounts to £616. Now the same animal is only worth 70p per lb., or £490, which is a drop of £126.</P>
    <P>English farmers are receiving £500 per cow from the Government and Brussels which is about the same price they got before the crisis.  Therefore, English farmers are not at any loss as a result of the breakout of BSE because the British Government negotiated a good deal with the EU.  Irish farmers, however, are selling BSE-free beef at a great loss.</P>
    <P>Instead of putting beef into intervention, the Minister and the Government should consider negotiating a deal with Brussels whereby the shortfall of beef sold on the open market could be subsidised for Irish farmers thus providing the same price animals were worth before the collapse of the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the current state of the beef industry and the uncertain position of beef producers.  I am not happy with the way in which the Government handled this issue.  The Minister, and in fairness previous Ministers, told us that one of the features of <Col N="282" /> BSE was that it could not be transmitted from one species to another.  Science has advanced since that statement was made; we now know it can move from sheep to cattle, it can be transmitted to cats through pet food and it has been transmitted to rats in laboratories. If it can be transmitted to those species, it would be unsafe to suggest it cannot be transmitted to man.</P>
      <P>We must look at this as first a public health problem, second an animal health matter and third a financial problem &mdash; the latter two issues may be important but they are secondary to public health.  Since human health is of paramount importance it strikes me as curious that the Minister for Health has succeeded in keeping entirely out of this controversy, despite the fact that the British Secretary of State for Health took a leading place in the debate there. The contribution of our Minister for Health consisted in publishing, within the last few days, a report from a food advisory group on this question.</P>
      <P>It seems to be the accepted wisdom here that we blame the British, in particular their Government, for this.  I inquired recently as to what the British are alleged to have done wrong in their handling of the matter in the last month. Although it will never be said directly in public, what they did wrong was tell the truth.  They placed before Parliament and the British public the facts which had been conveyed to them by the Edinburgh research institute about BSE and its relationship to CJD.  Telling the truth in this field is regarded by many as culpable, but if they had not placed the facts before the British Parliament and public, what attitude would have been taken when the truth came to light afterwards? It is frightening and unacceptable that the official attitude in Ireland is that we would be better off it we did not know the truth and the facts were concealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central to the British position is their decision to challenge the EU's order in the courts, and they have a reasonably good prospect of success.  The difficulty from their viewpoint is that it will take <Col N="283" /> many months to establish that, which gives everyone else a breathing space. Do we really have the leeway?  The official attitude here is not to disclose all the facts.  I am reminded of that by events in Britain over the past few weeks which seem not to have been adverted to or reported here but will have a serious effect on Irish beef exports to our largest single export market. On 28 March Mr. Douglas Hogg MP, the British Secretary of State for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, introduced Statutory Instrument No. 961 of 1996 called the Beef (Emergency Control) Order, 1996, section 2 of which prohibits the sale of beef from older bovine animals:</P>
    <P>No person shall sell for human consumption any meat derived from a bovine animal slaughtered after the commencement of this order which at the time of slaughter showed signs of more than one pair of permanent incisors.</P>
    <P>Our beef must be seriously affected by that order because a large proportion of the beef we would normally send to Britain is caught by that prohibition. Much of our cow beef goes to Britain for burgers, etc., all of which would be over two and a half years old and have more than two permanent incisors, and a lot of our heavier steer beef would be in the same position.</P>
    <P>It would be bad enough if everyone was caught by the same regulation but on Friday last, 12 April, Mr. Hogg made an amending order, No. 1091 of 1996, called the Beef (Emergency Control) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1996, which provides that:</P>
    <P>The previous order shall not apply to meat from a bovine animal slaughtered in any of the countries specified in the schedule to this order.</P>
    <P>The schedule contains 16 countries, none of which is in the EU: Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Mauritius, Namibia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland, South Africa, Swaziland, <Col N="284" /> Uruguay, the United States of America and Zimbabwe.  The British are entitled to import beef of any age from those countries and the quotas at present for the EU are 53,000 tonnes under GATT, 53,000 under the Hilton quota and approximately 18,000 under what is called the &ldquo;balance sheet scheme&rdquo; for manufactured beef.  They are hitting back on two levels &mdash; through the courts, which is a longer-term measure, and in imports from other countries. Since Ireland is not exempted from this measure, we are in a worse position than we thought because the British may well decide to import large quantities of beef from these other countries with or without the agreement of the Commission.</P>
    <P>This is a serious development which has not been adverted to yet in this country.  It seems a significant proportion of our normal beef exports to Britain will be prevented by this order, which has not yet been realised.  I would like to hear what the Minister proposes to do about this.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Since my time is short, I cannot answer the various questions raised, otherwise I would not have time to make my contribution.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the debate on behalf of the Government and to support the amendment to the motion which was tabled by the Minister last night.  The Government, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in particular, have pulled out all the stops over the past four weeks since the commencement of the BSE crisis to restore consumer confidence and to secure the reopening of vital export markets.  Furthermore, we have persuaded the European Commission of the severity of the crisis facing the beef sector and the intervention system has been overhauled, at our request, to provide an effective support for the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> The Minister outlined in some detail last evening the various measures taken to restore consumer confidence in beef as a safe, healthy and high quality product. These measures include the destruction of the herd where a BSE case is diagnosed to ensure that the meat from animals in the herd does not enter the food chain.  A special expert advisory committee has been established under the chairmanship of the Director of Consumer Affairs to provide an independent evaluation of the facts relating to BSE.  The Food Safety Advisory Board, which reports to the Ministers for Health and Agriculture, Food and Forestry, has also reviewed recent developments.  I am satisfied that these measures have been successful and their effectiveness has been demonstrated by the opinion polls carried out by some of our newspapers.</P>
    <P>Our efforts have also been concentrated on providing assurances to authorities and customers in our major markets about the safety and quality of Irish beef.  These efforts have ranged from political intervention at the highest level to diplomatic offensives and technical discussions at official level.  The successful outcome of these efforts is reflected in the fact that Irish beef is accepted in all countries of the European Union and in most countries of the Middle East, North Africa and Russia.  I have no doubt that these actions have paid handsome dividends and that but for the prompt action of the Government at all levels a far greater number of countries would have imposed a ban on Irish beef. I emphasise that there is no justification for any ban on Irish beef and we are committed to making every effort in ensuring that any such ban is removed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Minister is travelling to Libya later this week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to put our case to the Libyan authorities to secure the reopening of this most important market for Irish live cattle and in particular <Col N="286" /> to ensure that this market is reopened in time for the forthcoming tender.</P>
      <P>Both my Department and An Bord Bía will be working hard to ensure that Irish beef remains on the supermarket shelves in every member state of the Europen Union.  I am also asking the Commission to increase the funding for the promotion of beef to promote beef as a quality product.  Such a measure would encourage increased consumption, which would be very much to the advantage of the Irish beef trade.  A concerted promotion campaign at the right time is vital to recovery from the effects of the BSE crisis.</P>
      <P>Apart from reassuring consumers and securing the reopening of major markets, my Department's efforts have been directed at providing assistance to Irish beef producers, particularly through the reintroduction of intervention. While I am dissappointed that intervention purchasing is necessary, it is the most effective support available in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased with the major improvements in the intervention system which were agreed last week and I am convinced that we now have in place an intervention system which is capable of dealing with the problem. These improvements, particularly the lifting of the weight limit, were hard won and only came after the direct intervention of the Minister with Commissioner Fischler.  I ask producers and processors to fully avail of the system, in particular to dispose of the heavier animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that intervention is not the complete solution to the current market difficulties.  For this reason, the conclusions of the emergency council in Luxembourg last week provided for additional income aid to be given to beef producers through the premium system should market conditions so require.  I intend to avail of this provision to seek additional aid for our producers. My view is that any additional aid should be targeted at those producers who have suffered most from the <Col N="287" /> current crisis and my Department will be analysing the situation as it develops.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have just outlined and from the information given by the Minister to the House yesterday that the Government does not have to be forced by a motion before this House to act swiftly to protect the interest of the Irish beef industry.  The Government at all levels has put enormous energy into confronting this crisis and has been extremely successful in its efforts.  There has been a co-ordinated approach and total commitment has been forthcoming from our diplomatic corps and the various agencies, including An Bord Bía. Most third country markets have remained open to Irish beef as a direct result of the intervention by the Government and, equally importantly, a comprehensive intervention system has been put in place to deal with the market consequences of the crisis.  I strongly commend the amended motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Cowen.  I commend my colleagues for bringing this important debate before the House. This is the second time there has been a major debate at our instigation.  It says something about this Government that it takes a watchful and vigilant Oppostion to be in place so that a major concern like this can be usefully and properly addressed.  Despite the Government Deputies' statements, it did not attach any weight or importance to the issue or address it with any urgency.  Our colleagues had to travel abroad over the Easter weekend and give a strong push to restore confidence in our beef products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coincidentally, we also put down a priority question to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment relating to the &ldquo;expert group&rdquo; established by the Minister which met on two occasions. Only that this is an important issue, one would be inclined to laugh.  It met on 30 March and 2 April.  The Minister listed the individuals involved in the group. <Col N="288" /> While they are expert in their own way, it took them only two brief meetings under the chairmanship of William Fagan to conclude that the situation was all right and that consumers were satisfied as they pushed their trolleys around the supermarket on a Saturday morning.</P>
    <P>Our spokespersons have taken a twin-track approach to the matter.  All the efforts made by the producers, including the introduction of intervention &mdash; it is sad that this has to come about &mdash; will be of no avail if the consumer is not satisfied.  After all, they purchase the product.  I cannot understand why there is a perceived dichotomy between these points of view.  If one has a satisfied consumer, one will have a good product. The consumer will not buy a product unless they are satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>This group should operate within the Department of Enterprise and Employment &mdash; I do not care where it is sited eventually.  There is a need for a standing committee of such a group which would not only meet when there is a crisis, as was the case with this one, but would be available within its various realms of experience to meet, discuss, proffer, advise and act on same.  It is not good enough to believe that all wisdom resides in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry on this matter. Of course, the Department knows its business as far as producers are concerned but it does not exist for the benefit of consumers.  It is mainly there because producers, who have great strength and influence, get what they want.  This is a short-sighted point of view.  If they got everything in the world but the consumer was not satisfied or does not have a tranquil mind about the product they wish to buy, one is building more and more for intervention and we do not want to go down that road again.</P>
    <P>Consumer issues, which are nobody's issue when all is well and everybody's issue when all is not, should be operated by a single Minister who would look after their needs in food, travel and a host of other issues.  Apart from the motions we put down on two occasions <Col N="289" /> and the many opportunities our spokesperson has taken to bring consumers into the equation, the references to them and the efforts towards satisfying their fears are paltry and unsatisfactory. I suggest that the committee which has been set up should meet regularly on a standing basis so that they are not hauled out when there is a crisis and pushed back into the shadows when things return to normality.  The consumer is king in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate, which has been acknowledged as important, not just by the Fianna Fáil Party but by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Rourke has said, it is quite clear that the customer is king. When Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987 there was a reorganisation in the Department of Agriculture and Food to ensure that a Minister of State with responsibility for food was appointed to the purpose of redirecting the Department's orientation from producers towards consumers and processors, so as to build a modern food industry which would look towards the consumer and the processor as being just as essential in the production of quality food as the producer.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with the perception of this industry since this new Administration took over is the fact that the Government has refused to build on the good work done by Deputy Brown and Deputy Walsh.  The Minister of State with responsibility for food had a responsibility not simply to deal with producer interests but to ensure that the consumer was also informed and involved in what has to be a continuing education about what we eat and how pure and quality driven our food industry has become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception that since the Minister, Deputy Yates, took office, we have had a farm-oriented ministry as distinct from an agriculture and food oriented ministry.  The one agenda which he has constantly pursued, as I have had to point out on a number of <Col N="290" /> occasions, is the idea that the producer is king.  It is not realistic to think that producers could in some way secure their future without reference to the processor and the consumer at home and abroad.  This fact has escaped the Minister in deciding on his strategy and in building on the excellent work done by his predecessors in previous Fianna Fáil-led Administrations.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the Minister's response, which is critical.  However much we highlight the current situation, we must also focus on our political responsibility and find a way to work our way out of this catastrophe which has enveloped the Irish food industry, and beef producers particularly, over the past months.  The Minister said that a lot has happened in the four weeks which have elapsed since 20 March when the House of Commons announced its decision.  I agree with him.  He listed what happened, but failed to list, because it is impossible to do so, what he has actively done about it.  He refers to the fact that there is an alleged connection, that there is a scientific debate going on.  That debate did not begin on 20 March, it has been going on for eight or ten years since it was first proven that BSE was in the UK beef herd.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no question of the Department having anticipated what the outcome would be were it to be suggested, even in a tangential sense that there might be a certain variant of BSE which is transmissible to humans and that the ten cases they discovered perhaps have their origin in the fact that contaminated meat and bone meal were fed to cattle in the UK.  There seems to have been a panic stricken reaction.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs speak in this House tonight about the fact that Irish trade is back at 90 per cent of its usual level.  I have noticed the media talking about this as well, without any reference to the export trade.  We do not have normality in the trade.  Consumption may be up, but producers are taking heavy losses and if price levels <Col N="291" /> are to remain the same, with the elimination of margins and the accumulation of losses which have occurred as a result of what has been going on during recent months before the BSE scare started, then there is no future for this industry at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State for consumer affairs did not mention &mdash; one would have to excuse his ignorance since he does not know a lot about it &mdash; that the domestic market represents 5 per cent of the total.  We are the biggest exporters of beef in the Northern hemisphere, we are in the business of exports, of satisfying international markets. The whole point of our motion is that no political assurances have been given to the industry abroad.  No political assurances have been given in terms of a physical presence and a physical presence is required.</P>
    <P>There was some suggestion from Deputy Crawford that political gimmickry is involved.  There is no political gimmickry involved in trying to maintain the essential national interest. When he spoke about the relative unimportance of the Iranian market, I would refer him to the Minister's speech which referred to the importance of the Iranian market.  If we expect to be able to reopen markets by coming into our national Parliament and running down the significance of these markets, the Minister should not be surprised if he does not get a welcome when he goes to those countries on the basis that their trade is not very important to the Irish beef industry.  At the moment, any outlet that will take the overhang off the market is critical to the future of the beef industry and to the producers and processors who are taking heavy losses.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Liam Burke is in here to represent the farmers of Cork North Central but I am trying to reach beyond the housing estates of Knocknaheeney to people with a far more significant contribution to make to the Irish agriculture industry.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is here and <Col N="292" /> I would respect his potential contribution if he were allowed to make a contribution to ensuring our markets are secured abroad.  He is well qualified and capable of going to those markets and speaking to his opposite numbers. Deputy Deenihan was sent to Sweden, which the Minister said is a very discerning market.  I have the Bord Bia figures for beef exports and I am sorry to say that Sweden does not rank amongst the most important.  Deputy Crawford wishes to run down the fact that we seek to secure a market of 25,000 tonnes.  I am sure the Minister of State will get an opportunity to confirm that the Swedish market is not of the same significance. My argument is that the Minister of State should be allowed to travel to all of our markets, as he is well capable of doing, while the Minister is involved in Council of Ministers meetings or trying to deal with the domestic situation.  It appears the Minister feels that he is the only one in the Department of Agriculture at a political level who is in a position to deal with this issue and that is to the detriment of this administration. I say that genuinely, although the number of Ministers of State in that Department was reduced by one when this Government took over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte came into this House with his usual smart comments. He talks about people being ambassadors and I wish to make a comment about that.  I have had the privilege of serving in two Administrations.  I hope, and there is certainly no evidence to the contrary, that I have served this country with distinction on any of the visits I made.  Anything I did in Iran was in support of the technical experts who were giving technical assistance to the Iranian veterinary people and they received only praise from the Fianna Fáil delegation. I have never been involved, as Deputy Rabbitte has been in seeking the furtherance of his political career, in impugning the integrity of civil servants by making unfounded politically-based allegations which were the prelude to the beef tribunal report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> The Deputy made a smart aleck analogy about my being an ambassador. Many farmers throughout this country, whose livelihoods are at stake, doubt his interest in the Irish beef industry, given his track record both inside and outside this House and his refusal to deal with the tribunal in an open manner by revealing his so-called sources, which we all know were either anonymous or unknown.  His interest in this matter is akin to Al Capone being in charge of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with this situation responsibly let us remember one thing &mdash; the national interest of this country is <Col N="294" /> at stake.  If one takes the most important industry in any European Union country and multiplies its importance by four, one will get an idea of the significance of the beef industry to this country. The intervention system that has been put in place, given the price that will be tendered for next Friday, will result in accumulated losses for thousands of farm families.  We look to this Government to bring forward a compensation package, which will gain EU approval, with the purpose of maintaining farm families in rural communities both now and in the future.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Asthma Sufferers' Benefits.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting my matter on the Adjournment.  I am also grateful to the Minister of State for attending to reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, in recent weeks, hundreds of drug costs subsidisation scheme cardholders have had their cards withdrawn in the Southern Health Board region; this may also have occurred in other health board areas.  The result is that severe hardship has been inflicted on cardholders and I ask the Minister to take immediate action to resolve the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was introduced in 1990 mainly as a result of long and hard lobbying by the Asthma Association of Ireland.  The main victims of the move to withdraw the cards are asthma sufferers. As the scheme is currently administered, DCSS holders are required to avail of the scheme in 11 of the preceding 12 months.  Those who fail to meet the criteria have had their cards withdrawn.  The Minister will agree that this approach goes against the spirit in which the regulation was made in the House in the first instance.  He will also agree that it is unrealistic and highly impractical to put this requirement on holders of DCSS cards because asthma suffers can be clear of their condition for a number of consecutive months. When they are clear of their condition, they do not need treatment for that period. That is the nature of their ailment. However, when asthma strikes, these people need their cards because of the high cost of essential medicines.  It should be borne in mind that inhalers can be dispensed to an asthma sufferer in January which, depending on the <Col N="297" /> weather and other factors, may not be used until March.  When that happens, a month is skipped and the recipient of the inhaler is deemed ineligible for the scheme.</P>
    <P>When questioned the health board argued that cardholders can be reimbursed under the assistance towards the cost of prescribed medicines scheme. The net effect of this arrangement is that a cardholder would be required to carry the cost for each quarter and could then apply for reimbursement at the end of the quarter.  However, in practice, reimbursement often does not occur until the fourth, fifth or sixth month.  That puts a crippling burden on families and, as a result, a number of families suffer severe hardship, many of whom have spoken to me and whom I know well.</P>
    <P>We have to confront this issue.  As I understand it, only one of two actions can be taken.  The Minister can use his office to direct the health board to apply a more reasonable degree of flexibility and understanding in the administration of the scheme.  If that cannot be done, the only alternative is to include asthma in the list of classified long-term illnesses. One of those measures must be taken.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure action is taken immediately because the present position is critical, will become more critical, and cannot be allowed continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition, such as asthma, can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme caters for persons who are certified by their medical practitioner as having a long-term medical condition, such as asthma, with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to pay more than £32 in any month in respect of prescribed medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> The drugs cost subsidisation scheme is one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines to persons with ongoing medical conditions.  I understand the Southern Health Board has carried out a review of the drug cost subsidisation scheme in its area.  That review showed there were a significant number of people who, although holding a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, had ceased to use it, thus indicating they no longer had an ongoing monthly requirement for prescribed medicines in excess of £32 per month.  The board wrote to each person concerned nothing this fact and suggesting they should contact the board to discuss their present situation.</P>
    <P>I understand the board subsequently wrote again to each person who did not respond to the board's initial letter, indicating that it would be withdrawing their drug cost subsidisation scheme card and suggesting they should avail of the drugs refund scheme.  Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the Southern Health Board did not unilaterally withdraw the drug cost subsidisation scheme card.  The board has confirmed that if a person's situation indicates an ongoing monthly requirement for prescribed medicines in excess of £32 per month, the card will not be withdrawn.  I would point out that should a person at a future date have an ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month, the person may apply to the Southern Health Board for a new drug cost subsidisation scheme card.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, for example, general practitioner fees or prescribed medicines, <Col N="299" /> due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State and the Southern Health Board through the operation of these various drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as asthma.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate being allowed to raise this very important matter.  Over the past week newspaper articles have suggested the Minister for Social Welfare is preparing plans to close about 70 social welfare branch offices nationwide.  I am seeking clarificiation of this matter tonight because the track record of this Minister in relation to the less well off is not good and his record in relation to branch offices is appalling.  For example, in my area he has already closed the social welfare office in Castletownbere.  That area is as far as it is possible to be from Dublin and is at the end of an isolated peninsula. It is a tragedy this happened and makes no sense.  It is economically stupid because it costs much more to service that office from outside the area. Most of all, it is a slap in the face to those who have to rely on social welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not just referring to payments because people also receive good advice in those offices.  They are usually associated with FÁS training as well which enables people to get out of the rut they are in.  People receive a service rather than just payments in those offices.  Is the Minister serious about closing down these offices which have given sterling <Col N="300" /> service over the years to those who need the services of the Department of Social Welfare?  They provide these services economically and sometimes at great inconvenience to themselves by opening at unsocial hours.  There is such an office in Kinsale, for example, and another in Clonakilty where I live and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> Regrettably, there is a growing trend for people who have to collect their social welfare payments outside their own area to spend money in cities and large supermarkets.  In consequence, the small shopkeepers and traders are put under severe economic pressure.  This is another downside to the Minister's plan. Will he assure the House that there is no truth in this speculation and that the dole offices in towns throughout the country, especially in west County Cork, will be left open to provide an essential service for social welfare recipients?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rumours are alive and well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare provides its services throughout the country through its headquarter offices and through its network of social welfare local offices and social welfare inspector locations.  In addition, 72 branch offices are operated on a contract basis for the Department by branch managers.</P>
      <P>The branch offices currently deal with approximately 28 per cent of unemployment payments.  Each branch office reports to a designated social welfare local office.  The designated local office is responsible for the authorisation of claims presented at branch offices and is also responsible for making any changes in rates of payment in such claims.  The majority of branch office claimants are paid through post offices and others are paid in cash at the branch offices.  By contrast, however, all local offices and departmental offices' customers are now paid either at their local post office or by cheque or, in a small number of cases, by electronic fund transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Branch managers are remunerated by reference to the number of unemployed claimants dealt with by their office.  The direct cost of running the branch offices is in the region of £5 million per annum. Out of this, the branch managers must <Col N="302" /> provide suitable accommodation and staffing for the work of their offices.</P>
    <P>Since the end of the 1980s the Department of Social Welfare has been engaged in a programme of fundamental change in the way it delivers its services to the public.  This programme has been underpinned by far-reaching agreements with staff unions and associations on establishing a regional management structure, with arrangements for the local delivery of a much broader range of services, more modern systems of payments and better systems of control. The agreements cleared the way for the significant changes required in the social welfare local offices in order to deliver on the major elements of this strategy.  This switch from payments in cash to alternative payment methods. mainly through post offices, is a central feature of the new service.</P>
    <P>The main fuctions of the branch offices at present are to take claims for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, to pay people in receipt of unemployment payments and sign them on a weekly basis.  Branch managers are responsible for the safe custody of any public moneys received and paid on behalf of the Department. The changes which are taking place in the way in which the Department delivers its services have implications for the traditional role and type of activity carried out by branch offices. The processes associated with signing clients and calculating and making cash payments to the unemployed will change significantly.  The computerisation of the calculation process, the removal of cash payments from the offices and the transfer of these payments to the customer's local post office will further reduce the work of the offices as will the replacement of weekly with monthly signing.</P>
    <P>In view of the above, it is now the case that the branch office operation must be reviewed in order to see how best the benefits flowing from the <Col N="303" /> changes in service delivery can be extended to existing social welfare customers and the public generally who are currently catered for by the branch offices or living in their catchment areas.  This review has been under way in my Department for several years now and predates my occupation of this office.  I might add that, in the normal course, when a branch manager retires or when his or her contract expires, the Department reviews the situation in the relevant area.  In doing so, various factors are taken into account and a decision is made on the appropriate level of service, having regard to the other developments that are taking place.  On this basis, a number of branch offices have been closed in recent years, including the period when Deputy Woods was Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my absence this morning.  It was an aberration on my part.  I thank the Minister for his presence here this evening.  I was a member of the last Government which gave its support to the staging of the world equestrian games in Ireland in 1998.  This support was well placed and the games continue to represent an immense opportunity for the country.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because Ireland's hosting of the games is in some doubt, if not in jeopardy. A meeting is to take place tomorrow in Geneva which may decide if Ireland retains the games.  I call on the Government to immediately take action to ensure that the competition is retained on this island.</P>
      <P>This can be achieved only if a Minister or Minister of State makes representations at tomorrow's executive committee meeting of the International Equestrian Federation in Geneva. Unless Ireland can definitively say at the meeting that it is hosting the games the State will lose this fantastic opportunity, and future ones.  I understand that already Germany and the UK have made pitches to take the games if Ireland cannot.  If a Minister is not standing strong with the Irish representatives at the meeting this major event may well be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis facing the games has arisen in part because of the inflexibility of the Government, especially of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny. <Col N="306" /> Rather than showing vision and leadership, the Minister has allowed the problems of the games' organisers to escalate. He has sat on the fence.  Rather than viewing this as a national opportunity, he has tried to wash his hands of any involvement.  The World Equestrian Games could and should take place in Ireland.  We have the capability and the personnel in place.  It should be viewed by the Government as similar to the attraction of a major industrial project because there would be considerable paybacks for the economy.  It represents a fantastic marketing opportunity for Ireland.  If a governing role were taken by the Minister, the existing problems could be ironed out.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to exercise caution about taxpayers' money but what is required is not necessarily more State money but solid support and intervention by the Minister to break existing logjams.  The Minister needs to stand strongly with the people who are organising the event who can make it work.  If the games do not go ahead more than an opportunity could be lost.  There could also be a £1.5 million risk to the Exchequer as a bond has been signed by Bord Fáilte in relation to the staging of the games in Ireland.  Thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in tourist spending will be lost to the country.</P>
    <P>The games represent an opportunity to promote to the widest international audience the most positive image of Ireland, both in the lead up to and during the games, from which long-term benefits should accrue.  Inward visitors of the order of 75,000 should contribute £45 million at least to the economy.  If it surpasses that order, the return to the economy should substantially exceed the investment involved.</P>
    <P>An urgent decision is required from the Government and Bord Fáilte to allow the planning and marketing of the games to proceed and to ensure that no credibility is lost internationally.  This débâcle raises the question of what is <Col N="307" /> going on in this Government in relation to sporting events.  It makes no sense for one arm of Government &mdash; Deputy Gay Mitchell &mdash; to promote the staging of the Olympics if there is not even support at Cabinet for Ireland hosting a smaller and more manageable but equally prestigious event.  If these games do not go ahead, it is certain that never again will Ireland host a major equestrian event.  Others who try to promote major sporting events here will be ridiculed the world over.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to support the case made by Deputy Andrews for the holding of the World Equestrian Games in Ireland.  I understand the Department has been aware for at least a month &mdash; perhaps longer &mdash; that the games were in jeopardy. What action has been taken?  Has the company any creditors who are in that position because of the commitment of the Government to the holding of the games and, if so, what will be done on their behalf?  Will the Government be represented at tomorrow's meeting which, as Deputy Andrews outlined, is extremely important?  This issue is important not only for the games but also for the credibility of Ireland's ability to hold events and promotions of this nature.  We need to show a commitment to equestrian sports and I hope the Minister will indicate that he is doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy for Deputy Andrews that he has finally succeeded in having this matter raised.  The allocation of the World Equestrian Games to Ireland and the organising of those games are matters in the first instance for the <i>Federation Equestre International</i>&mdash; the FEI &mdash; and World Equestrian Games (Ireland) Limited &mdash; WEG.  The policy of both this and the previous Government has been to encourage and assist WEG in its work, <Col N="308" /> where appropriate, to ensure a commercially successful games that would reflect well on this country in equestrian and general promotional terms.  To this end WEG (Ireland) Limited was given, via Bord Fáilte, an initial grant of £250,000 in 1994 to assist with start-up costs with no commitment to funding in later years.  That was made very clear, in writing, by my predecessor, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>However, deterioration in WEG's financial perspectives became apparent to me in early 1995, soon after I came into office, when the company confirmed escalation by £6.3 million in projected costs on figures used for the successful bid.  New costs included revelation, for the first time, by WEG to the Department that provision had now to be made for a fee of £4.5 million which it had agreed to pay the FEI for hosting the games.</P>
      <P>At meetings in March 1995 with the chairman of WEG I made plain my serious concern at the manner in which WEG had managed events, underlining the fact that the company had been told repeatedly that the Government would not underwrite the games.  On foot of certain assurances from the WEG chairman, including strong expressions of company optimism about prospects for generating up to £6 million in corporate sponsorship which would turn the games into profit, a further grant of £250,000, again with no future commitment, was provided by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>To enable WEG retain the games at that point, Bord Fáilte also agreed to guarantee an undertaking given by the company to the FEI for payment in respect of hosting the games in this country of not more than £1.5 million from proceeds in 1998.  This guarantee is subject to the fulfilment of the terms of the contract governing the granting of the games.</P>

    <P>In December, 1995 WEG indicated to the Department that the FEI had still not put a TV strategy in place and that <Col N="309" /> to meet cash flow requirements it would need a further grant of £500,000 in 1996 and a bankable commitment for a similar figure in 1997 otherwise they would be unable to continue trading.  Despite repeated indications that commercial sponsorship would be signed up, no contracts had been negotiated, WEG's only source of funding continued to be the Exchequer and the company was now in deficit.</P>
    <P>I made it clear that I would still like to see the games going ahead but obviously not at any price.</P>

      <P>I asked the company to reconsider its proposals, examine possible ways of reducing costs and to come up with hard evidence of adequate levels of sponsorship in the light of their own approximately £10.9 million cost projections for the event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of a satisfactory response to my request from the company, I completed a review of the State's involvement in the games with particular reference to the exposure of the Exchequer and the credibility of the figures in WEG's business plan.  Specific points which I felt should be taken on board included the failure to deliver a TV strategy by the FEI, who retained the TV rights but still have to complete negotiations on a TV strategy; absence to date of any contracts with WEG for commercial sponsorship despite repeated indications, especially in recent months, that negotiations with potential sponsors were advancing; growing concerns about WEG's credibility in delivering on its own budget projections, given that in the two years since the successful bid of <Col N="310" /> March 1994 WEG expenditure projections had increased by 79 per cent while income projects rose by 35 per cent almost half of which was accounted for by the insertion of a higher figure for commercial sponsorship; a key element of WEG's income projections is provision for a title sponsor of £3 million which would appear to be way beyond anything achieved to date for a sporting event in Ireland with no credible evidence from WEG that it is achievable; further slippage on costs by WEG over the next two years, a not inconsiderable risk given company experience to date with its own projections coupled with a serious shortfall on their income projections, could leave the games with losses of the order of £6 million or more; and I have seen no evidence that any Irish or international financial institution or commercial business is prepared to invest its funds in this enterprise.  The Irish taxpayer is the only person being asked to take the risk of investment here.</P>
      <P>I subsequently brought the matter to the attention of the Government following which WEG were informed on 27 March that it had been decided to cease further State financial support for the games.  On 4 April representatives of WEG met with senior officials of my Department.  While they briefed my officials on some contacts which they had had since being informed of the Government's decision, there was no substantial case put forward to address Government concerns warranting a reconsideration of our decision.  The future of the games is now a matter for the board of WEG.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to cease Exchequer funding for this project was not an easy one.  The concept of hosting the World Equestrian Games in Ireland was attractive, especially based on WEG cost projections as presented in March 1994, which deserved and got support from the previous Government.  It is a project which I continued to support <Col N="311" /> even amid growing concern about the direction in which it was heading.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, for reasons beyond my control and in some areas beyond the control of the Irish organisers, we have reached a stage where my responsibility to the taxpayers requires me to cap Exchequer liabilities in respect of a project facing such a serious and growing risk of major losses.</P>
    <P>I could have taken a soft option and continued to drip feed some funds into WEG in the hope that something will turn up, but I do not believe that would have been in the best interests of the Irish taxpayer, Irish equestrianism or the future of the World Equestrian Games.  I did a full analysis of the project and came to the conclusion that in the absence of any other significant source of funding for the games emerging, the correct course of action was to cease Exchequer support.  Nothing has happened since that decision was taken which would merit it being reconsidered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is availing of the opportunity of this Adjournment debate to stand over the charges it made in relation to the light rail controversy. We remain of the view that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has grossly misled the Dáil, Seanad and the public on as many as ten different occasions between December 1995 and April of this year when he deliberately concealed the information that in November 1995 he had agreed to an investigation of the entire light rail project by the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a statement last night the Minister accused Fianna Fáil of being mischievous and of making allegations founded on a deliberate distortion of facts.  It is ironic that in the statement he has engaged in the very behaviour he has <Col N="312" /> accused others of perpetrating.  In the four page press release he deliberately distorted a large number of facts and he also selectively quoted from the Dáil record in an effort to try to distract from his concealment of information from both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I wish to detail the Minister's distortion of the facts in his press release and then in his comments in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  No matter what he now tries to argue, there is no doubt that on 12 December last when he was badly in need of good news to distract from his difficulties, he announced with a fanfare of publicity the light rail lines to Dundrum and Tallaght.  He expressed regret on the day that the Government had decided not to proceed with a proposed third route to Ballymun until after the year 2000.  He made no reference at the announcement to the EU investigation which was questioning this phasing and which meant that the funding for the two lines was conditional.  It is incomprehensible that he decided to announce the two lines while a question mark hung over the project and the £114 million in EU funding.</P>
    <P>We believe this raises serious questions about the Minister's political judgement and about the judgment of the Taoiseach who robustly defended his actions on yesterday's Order of Business. He claims in last night's press release that last December he only launched a public consultation process and that he did not announce the two lines.  He further tried to suggest that this was a public consultation process about a general plan for the city of Dublin rather than specific light rail routes. This dancing on the head of a pin by the Minister is, unfortunately, laughable.</P>
    <P>It was abundantly clear on 12 December that the Minister was announcing the two lines and that the public consultation process he launched was only in relation to those two lines. This is also recorded in the Official <Col N="313" /> Report, 5 March 1996, vol. 462, col. 1181.  At Question Time he said:</P>
    <P>The routes have been announced. They will be made known to the public, and people who wish to comment on how a route might affect them or how it could be best placed or changed to accommodate the concerns of local people will be listened to during the public consultation process and also at the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister moves on in his press release to quote from a Dáil question in January asked by Deputy Shatter.  He quotes very selectively from the reply. All he gives of the reply is that &ldquo;No final decision will be taken on the precise routes until the public consultation process is completed, until a public inquiry is held later this year and the EU approval procedures have been completed.&rdquo; Turning to the Official Report, 31 Janaury 1995, vol. 460, col. 1919, it is interesting to read the full paragraph.  It states: &ldquo;I launched a public consultation process on the planning light rail links to Dundrum and Tallaght on 12 December 1992 following the conclusion of detailed work undertaken by the project team to identify the preferred technical route alignments for both links.&rdquo; He goes on to say what I said in the previous paragraph.  Again, it is clear that all that are in question are the Tallaght and Dundrum lines.  No mention is made of the fact that two weeks before the Minister announced the two lines he agreed to an investigation by the EU into the light rail plan and the phasing of the project.  He tries to convey in his press release that the EU investigation is a routine procedure; it is clearly not so.  It is a serious development and threatens the timescale for the entire light rail plan.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of this was evident when the EU Regional Affairs spokesman was interviewed on last Monday's 1 o'clock news.  Mr. Tommy Gorman, the RTÉ correspondent, said that the <Col N="314" /> Government had already announced what it intended to do.  He asked the Regional Affairs spokesman if he was now saying that the Government, in November, had agreed to postpone this until after another study was done.  The EU Regional Affairs spokesperson responded: &ldquo;That is our information, that is what we have agreed with the Irish Government &mdash; to ask an independent consultant to analyse all three options and then decide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the first confirmation of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> story of 14 April which revealed that the EU had ordered an investigation into the entire project. Until then nobody had got wind of the development which had occurred on 29 November 1995 when officials at the Department met EU officials.  This meeting, where the decision on the light rail investigation was finalised, took place just two weeks before the Minister announced the two lines.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Minister made no reference to such an important outstanding issue.  In fact, in the Seanad on 14 February he said that we could not afford the luxury of more studies to re-examine the fundamental basis of the DTI strategy which we recently adopted.  On the few occasions when he referred to the EU he made it appear as if only the hoops had to be gone through with the Commission and that they were minor and procedural.  In the Official Report, 28 March 1996, vol. 463, col. 1452. he gave the impression that the European Union had actually agreed the process when he said: &ldquo;The Operational Programme for Transport, agreed by the Government and the European Commission, makes provison for an expenditure of £200 million on the implementation of the first phase of the on street light rail network as recommended by the DTI.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to explain why he misled the Dáil and the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to cut through the welter of abuse and allegations that have been made against me and to set down the facts surrounding the proposed light rail study.  Opposition Deputies, including Deputy Cowen, who are pretending to be surprised about the EU study knew all along that a study was a legal requirement, a legal requirement that they negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community Support Framework, which the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, negotiated with the European Commission when he was Minister for Finance, made it quite clear that a socio-economic cost benefit analysis would be needed for any elements of the DTI package costing over £20 million.  It is in black and white on page 46 of the CSF document and I <Col N="316" /> quote the relevant extract which deals with the DTI investigation package:</P>
    <P>Individual elements of the package which exceed a cost of 25 million ECU will be subject to socio-economic cost-benefit analysis, in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation 2083/92.</P>
    <P>A similar point was made on page 62 of the Operational Programme for Transport which was negotiated when Deputy Cowen was Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>I am astounded that experienced former Ministers on the Opposition benches, who negotiated the current EU programmes, are deliberately ignoring the requirements governing those programmes because it suits their purposes for cheap political point scoring. The relevant EU regulations require a study for all Structural Fund supported infrastructure projects costing over £20 million.  The light rail project will cost in excess of £200 million, more than ten times the EU minimum threshold for studies.  These former Ministers now in Opposition, who played pivotal roles in agreeing the stipulations that are now being implemented, should be well aware of the requirement for studies and should be supportive of full and exhaustive evaluation in the interests of the Irish and European taxpayers.  It is the job of the Commission to use these studies to ask hard questions on behalf of the European taxpayer.  This is the practice across a wider range of projects. Examples of projects in my own Department are the peat fired power station which has been the subject of an independent study and the biomass power station project which will be the subject of a further study.</P>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that what is being carried out is a comparative evaluation of the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum routes.  We always anticipated that there would be a need for an evaluation of a number of <Col N="317" /> alternative route options, to meet European Union requirements and to deal with issues raised at our own national public inquiry.  In anticipation of that the CIE project team and its consultants have been working on this since 1994 and the study now agreed with the Commission will build on that work in respect of two particular options.</P>
    <P>It is not a fundamental re-evaluation of light rail.  There is a commitment in the Operational Programme for Transport to provide EU funding for light rail.  The Commission has already agreed to provide assistance for the preparatory work and £3 million has been paid to date to CIE.  This clearly demonstrates Commission support for the light rail project and makes a nonsense of the suggestion in the Opposition motion that the European Union funding for it is at risk.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are the only parties attempting to put the funding for this project in jeopardy.  They are trying to deliberately sabotage the project by their reckless and irresponsible behaviour over recent days.</P>
    <P>The light rail project is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Dublin to tackle the chronic congestion which is impairing economic activity and the quality of life for everyone in the city. By their deliberately mischievous actions, the Opposition are attempting to undermine the Government's efforts to ensure that this badly needed facility is made a reality for the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I emphatically reject any suggestion that I misled the Dáil, or anybody else for that matter.  I have consistently made it clear that no final decisions on routes will be taken until the public consultation process had been completed, a public inquiry held and European Union approval procedures finalised. My position has been clear, unambiguous and consistent.  Indeed, a mere eight weeks ago, in response to a Seanad motion on 14 February 1996 I made it <Col N="318" /> clear that the proposed statutory public inquiry into all aspects of the proposed light rail network would &ldquo;enable people who believe that light rail is not the appropriate solution to Dublin's transport problems or that other routes should be given priority to put forward their views and challenge the DTI recommendations and the detailed planning work of CIE's project team&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The public consultation is open as to its conclusions and the socio-economic study is consistent with that open approach.</P>
    <P>Let us also be clear to what the previous Government decided.  On 5 October 1994 it &ldquo;noted and approved the provisional finding of the CIE project team that light rail links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed during the period of the National Plan with the remaining links to be constructed thereafter&rdquo;.  Take note of the words &ldquo;provisional finding&rdquo; which make it clear that the previous Government was aware that this was not a final decision on route priorities.  Deputy Berite Ahern is the only person guilty of the very thing of which he has wrongfully accused me.  When he announced the construction of the Tallaght and Dundrum lines in his speech to Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 20 October 1994 he neglected to mention that the decision on route priorities was not final.  In contrast, when I replied to a parliamentary question on 31 January 1995 I was careful to reflect accurately the terms of the Government decision.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that every possible effort is being made to keep to the implementation timetable by proceeding with a range of activities in parallel. The CIE project team has already carried out a substantial amount of additional preparatory work for the study and this will be passed over to the consultants who will be appointed shortly and report within about three months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> There will be no delay in the light rail project.  While the study is going on the public consultation programme will continue, legislation will be introduced in the Oireachtas and the CIE project team will continue its detailed preparations for the statutory public inquiry. It is my firm objective to have the new legislation in place by the summer recess, to have the statutory procedures completed in time to let construction start as early as possible next year and to have light rail in operation in Dublin during the year 2000.</P>
    <P>To sum up, far from being a surprise, the European Union socio-economic <Col N="320" /> study is something that is legally required by European Union rules negotiated by Fianna Fáil in Government. Legally, the project could not go ahead, with European Union aid, without a study.  The fact that the Opposition Deputies, so recently in Goverment, forgot this suggests that they were not very attentive to what they were doing when they were in Government and it confirms the wisdom of the Dáil in sending them over to the Opposition benches where their inattentiveness will do less harm.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 April 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The prices for magazines imported into Ireland from the United Kingdom have been a source of concern to consumers and indeed to Members of the House for some considerable time.  In purchasing or contemplating the purchase of such magazines they can peel off the adhesive label showing the Irish price and in doing so have revealed to them a much lower UK price.  Inevitably this gives rise to the impression that consumers are being grossly exploited and are being habitually &ldquo;ripped off&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On 15 February last I announced in the House that the Director of Consumer Affairs had, at my request, commenced an investigation into magazine prices with the following terms of reference: to undertake a survey of the retail prices of UK magazines in Ireland; to ascertain the movement of these prices in the period since 1 January 1994 in the light of the appreciation of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling; and to determine the components of these prices by reference to such elements as cost from the producer, applicable value added taxes, importers/distributors and retailers profit margins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recently as yesterday afternoon, I received the report of the director's investigation.  It requires careful and detailed study by me and my officials. However, even at this stage there are a number of the director's findings which <Col N="121" /> should immediately be brought into the public domain.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the matter is the fact that, whether the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pound sterling is above or below parity, the prices of magazines imported into Ireland from the UK are always dearer here, largely due to value added tax.</P>
    <P>Magazines are zero rated for value added tax in the UK, whereas magazines sold in Ireland are subject to VAT of, in most cases, 21 per cent and 12½ per cent in others.  Thus the Irish price will, even discounting other factors, always be higher unless there is an extraordinary depreciation of sterling <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>There are only two main importers of UK magazines into Ireland &mdash; Easons and Newspread.  In addition to VAT, there are two other dimensions to their pricing system comprising sterling punt conversion and what is known as a margin for &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; which is designed to cover distribution and other costs associated with the sale of such magazines throughout the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Both Easons and Newspread engage in what is prudent and well recognised business practice of the buying forward of the UK currency.  In this regard the director has found that they buy forward four times a year, but what is significant is that they both complete their currency deals at or about the same time.  This is a most unusual ocurrence. The importers contend that this locks them into a currency rate for a three-month period during which they leave mazagine prices unchanged.  It is not clear what benefit consumers derive from these arrangements but it is safe to conclude that it is not to the disadvantage of importers.</P>
    <P>Whereas there is evidence that some price reductions have occurred because of the appreciation of the Irish pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling the Irish consumer is still greatly disadvantaged by the operation of what is known as the uplift.</P>
    <P>A formula for the uplift was agreed with the now disbanded National Prices Commission back in 1983.  It was fixed <Col N="122" /> at 5 per cent at a time when the Irish pound was worth only 85 pence sterling. In the meantime the importers have, to their own benefit, operated the formula in such a manner as to increase the 5 per cent uplift to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the Irish cover price for magazines is calculated in the following manner: Sterling Cover Price at a rate of exchange of purchased currency plus an &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; for distribution costs etc., plus VAT.  There appears to be no justifiable reason for this and it means that Irish prices are higher than they would be if the original National Prices Commission formula of 5 per cent was being adhered to strictly.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing finding revealed by the Director's investigation is that the same pricing arrangements, which are complex, are operated by the only two importers and both of them provide ready reckoners or conversion tables which result in the same Irish retail price for the same UK cover price.</P>
    <P>Thus we cannot conuntenance the continuation of these uplift and ready reckoner arrangements which clearly operate to the detriment of consumers and the development of free and fair competition.  I shall therefore without delay decide on what course of action will best bring about an end to these arrangements either on a voluntary or statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The central policy consideration of this Government is the need to create employment and to provide opportunities for those seeking work.  At national level a wide range of initiatives has been implemented to encourage the recruitment of additional workers and to create the environment within which this can most effectively <Col N="123" /> happen.  The last budget focused particularly on the long-term unemployed and those who are most marginalised on the labour market.  Severe unemployment problems are also affecting other member states of the European Union and these are informing the deliberations of all Council of Ministers meetings.  The Irish Presidency in the latter half of this year will ensure that political concern at the European level continues to focus on the central problem of unemployment and that all policies are informed by the need to create work for those currently unemployed.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency will put particular emphasis on ensuring that the strategy decided at the European Council in Essen in December 1994 is followed through with determination.  This focuses on ensuring that there is increased investment in vocational training, on improving the employment intensiveness of growth, on the reduction of non-wage labour costs, on greater effectiveness of labour market policies and on the implementation of specific measures to help groups particularly affected by unemployment.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of the strategy agreed by the Heads of State and Government at Essen, the Social Affairs Council, ECOFIN and the European Commission will report to the European Council to be held under the Irish Presidency on the progress in their mutual surveillance of the multi-annual employment programmes being implemented by all member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Pact of Confidence on Employment recently proposed by Commission President Santer has further concentrated attention on the importance of the issue of employment. This seeks the active involvement of governments and the social partners in agreeing policy initiatives at a European level which will further facilitate higher employment growth levels in the member states of the European Union.  The Irish Presidency will support positive developments in this context, and these <Col N="124" /> will be informed by the convergence criteria which have been established for membership of the European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>There is general acceptance that, given the scale of the problem of unemployment and the urgency of effective policies to address it, the Intergovernmental Conference should also consider this issue.  Ireland has always insisted, and with considerable success, that the European Council should seriously focus on unemployment and support policy proposals to effectively address this central problem.  In this vein, the Irish Presidency will also be actively involved in the Intergovernmental Conference in exploring the scope for constructive treaty amendments so as to improve the effectiveness of the employment policies of the European Union and their impact, in particular on those member states, such as Ireland, which have higher than average levels of unemployment.</P>

    <P>The Labour Relations Commission also provides the help of its advisory service to entities that seek assistance to resolve industrial relations difficulties of <Col N="125" /> a deeper seated nature.  I have no plans at this stage to conduct an examination of industrial relations in the aviation sector, nor do I believe that it would be productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has allocated additional funding of £4 million in 1996 to begin the process of implementing the STIAC recommendations. These funds will be disbursed through a variety of existing and new schemes operated by Forbairt.</P>
      <P>The main features of the £4 million allocation include: a £700,000 boost to applied industry research in third level colleges; an increase of £700,000 in the allocation for the techstart scheme, for small firms taking on college graduates; an extra £500,000 for basic research and £200,000 for strategic research in 1996; allocating an additional £300,000 for the development of technology service centres by the regional technical colleges; a doubling of the PhD student grant to £2,000 a year; the provision of £100,000 to fund five two-year post doctoral fellowships per annum; a further £200,000 for international research collaboration; £200,000 extra for company technology audits and £250,000 for company technology brokerage; £200,000 towards a new programme involving collaboration, in research, among clusters of small firms; and £250,000 to be spent on the promotion of science, technology and innovation to remove the generally negative public perception towards science and technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Science, technology and innovation is about people and jobs.  It is therefore <Col N="126" /> central to our industrial development strategy.</P>
    <P>The creation of employment derives from the survival and growth of companies and spin-off of that growth into the wider economy.  Over the longer term, companies can only survive and compete in the market-place on the back of innovation, where their product is based on quality and uniqueness.  This is more and more the case as international trade barriers come down and markets become more globalised.  Innovation is more and more influenced by scientific research and technological development and is being applied at an ever quickening pace.  Companies, therefore, require people trained in these disciplines to the highest international standards.  All of this requires a significant change of attitude towards science and technology on the part of decision makers, industry, the scientific community and the public at large.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the strategy behind the allocation of the additional £4 million is to improve the public perception of science and technology, improve companies' ability to absorb technology, encourage business to invest more in R &amp; D, encourage the third level colleges to provide the relevant skills and other resources to meet industry needs, and to forge better links between colleges and companies.  This all-encapsulating approach, summed up as the national system of innovation, is at the heart of our approach to science and technology policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The progression opportunities for community employment as set out in the Human Resources Operational Programme are 25 per cent placement into jobs and 15 per cent into further education-training by 1999.  However, a target of 35 per cent placement into jobs and 25 per cent into further education-training by 1999 has been set following recent changes to the community employment programme.  As community employment has only been in operation since April 1994, it is too early yet to evaluate the full impact of the programme.  However, a preliminary sample survey of participants who left the programme having completed their 12 months participation period indicated that 29 per cent had found full-time employment; 20 per cent had found part-time employment; 7 per cent were self-employed and 10 per cent had entered full-time education programmes or progressed to specific skills training programmes.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the preliminary results.</P>
      <P>With regard to FÁS mainline training programmes, approximately 60 per cent to 70 per cent of participants on specific skills training courses obtain employment following completion of their course and in respect of other foundation or reintegration courses, approximately 50 per cent of trainees obtained employment or progress to further education or training.  The targets for progression from FÁS mainline training programmes, as set out in the Human Resources Operational Programme are 60-65 per cent into jobs and 5 per cent into further education-training by 1999.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Human Resource Development is one of a number of key national strategy papers that I have been working on over the past year, which together will constitute the framework and focus for employment policy into the next century.</P>
      <P>The importance of the human resource factor in this overall framework cannot be underestimated.  There is an increasing recognition that the development of our human resources potential is crucial to future economic growth and employment expansion in Ireland.  The primary objective of the White Paper will be to define the strategies and programmes which will encourage and support Irish business to improve its overall skills and thus enhance its capacity to prosper in an increasingly competitive national and international business environment; and improve the knowledge and skills of individuals in or entering the labour force particularly those on the margins of the labour force.</P>
      <P>In addition to the research and analysis that has been undertaken by my Department in the preparatory stages, there has been a substantial level of consultation involving many parties with an interest in the ideas for the development of our human resources. This is a significant national policy area and I am anxious to ensure that before drawing final conclusions, all possible avenues have been explored.</P>
      <P>The drafting of the White Paper is now in the final stages, and I will be submitting my proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>As I already informed the House in reply to Questions Nos. 233 and 235 on 12 March 1996, my plans for 1996 are that the local employment service should be established and consolidated in 14 key areas.  These consist of the 12 original partnership areas and two non-partnership areas &mdash; Clare and Kildare.  I believe it is preferable to assess the progress of these 14 areas before extending the service countrywide.  What we learn about the current phase will be of benefit to other areas in establishing the service in the future.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the special circumstances in the Clondalkin area, in particular the relationship to the Tallaght Partnership and the operation of the FÁS pilot employment action centre.  I am currently considering how best the Clondalkin partnership can be accommodated in the establishment of the current phase of the local employment service.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the funding currently being provided to all 35 county enterprise boards will enable them to achieve the broad targets set for the initiative in the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99, under which the boards are supported by EU funding.  The planned investment by both the State and the EU under the operational programme for this initiative amounts to over IR£81 million for the period 1995 to 1999.</P>
      <P>The level of public expenditure on direct financial assistance to small firms by the county enterprise boards has already exceeded the projections in the operational programme.  In total, over £18.5 million has been provided to date in grants by the 35 CEBs since their establishment resulting in the creation of 4,663 full-time and 1,078 part-time jobs by the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the need for a balanced programme of grant approval activity to be undertaken by boards throughout the course of the year, I have confirmed the availability of two successive tranches of £90,000 in the form of grant approval ceilings for all county enterprise boards in the first and second quarter of this year.  Approval of grants is now a matter of day-to-day responsibility for each CEB.  The phasing of the grant assistance they can make available over the course of the calendar year is a sensible means of scheduling their activity and prioritising projects in accordance with their enterprise plans.  In this context, the boards were advised, as in previous years, to prioritise projects in accordance with their enterprise plans.  A balance must be struck between addressing the pressing claims of projects already on hands and retaining some flexibility to cope with anticipated demand at later stages in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at present examining proposals for the differentiated allocation of the funding for 1996 between each county enterprise board.  A final decision in the matter will be communicated to each <Col N="133" /> board as soon as possible.  I am confident that the current budgetary arrangements enable each board to operate on the basis of a balanced programme of approvals throughout the year.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 which prohibits below cost selling of many grocery products, including essential foodstuffs.  The order, which remains in force, also outlaws the payment or receipt of what is known in the grocery trade as &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, which could constitute an inducement to stock and place on sale a particular product in preference to those of competitors.</P>
      <P>I have consulted the Director of Consumer Affairs, who is responsible for the enforcement of the groceries order, about the claims by the Deputy in relation to excessive variations in the retail pricing of food products.  The director has informed me that he is not aware of any such variation as regards essential foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary concern is to ensure that competition works effectively in the provision of goods and services on the Irish market and that competition is fair and rebounds to the benefit of consumers by providing greater choice, improved quality and lower prices in particular.  In this connection, I should say that I am not satisfied that existing competition law is operating to the best effect.  In my view, it is not geared to tackling anti-competitive activity, because of the lack of public enforcement and inadequate penalties for breaches of the law.  I would add that, in line with the policy agreement for Government, I propose to strengthen <Col N="134" /> competition law, through the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition. I intend to seek to have the Bill, which has completed Committee Stage in the Dáil, enacted at an early date.</P>

      <P>The availability and quality of skills of our labour force is one of the key competitive advantages we have in attracting inward investment. It has a central influence on investment and location decisions of overseas companies. It is imperative that we maintain this competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>In the light of the pace of technological change, and difficulties which accordingly arise in making accurate and timely forecasts of manpower needs, skill shortages can develop.  At present, for example, there are worldwide shortages of software skills and of experienced electronics engineers and technicians.  Potential difficulties in these areas in this country have also been identified.  My Department is taking steps, in conjunction with the Department of Education, to ensure that the future needs of industry for these types of skills will be met through the universities and the regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>Another area where the availability of suitably qualified workers is becoming an issue is that of telemarketing and technical and customer support.  This is a business which has grown quickly in Ireland over the past three years, drawing on foreign language resources which had previously been under-utilised in terms of occupational outlets.  With further substantial growth anticipated in this business over the next few years, it is important that language skills continue to be available to meet projected requirements.  Accordingly, my Department is in discussion with FÁS to ensure that required foreign language skills are available in the short term and with the Department of Education in regard to longer-term language training policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has identified the area of emerging skills shortages in industry as a major strategic issue to be <Col N="136" /> tackled.  In co-operation with the industrial development and education and training authorities, it is actively involved in both the identification of emerging and current skill shortages and in making provision to address them.  This is being done in the context of a broadly based review of the short and long-term skill needs and the training and education requirements of the industry and services sectors.</P>
    <P>The issues of meeting future occupational skill needs will also be dealt with in the White Paper on Human Resource Development.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy to maximise accessibility for people with disabilities to its various services and to the buildings where such services are provided.  FÁS is no exception in this regard.  When selecting new buildings, for example, a fundamental criterion is that it be accessible to people with disabilities and, furthermore, that its internal fixtures and fittings be as suitable as possible.  Likewise, in the case of existing buildings, every reasonable effort is made to eliminate any access difficulties which may exist for disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS actively encourages disabled persons to participate on its training and employment programmes subject, of course, to their being physically or mentally able to do so.  As part of its day to day activities, FÁS liaises with the National Rehabilitation Board at national and local level with a view to recruiting the maximum possible number of such persons onto its programmes. Normal eligibility criteria do not apply to the participation of disabled persons on the new community employment integration option, the <Col N="137" /> part-time job option or the whole-time job option, as they may participate simply on the basis of being referred by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any specific discrimination <i>per se</i> that exists for unemployed people seeking work.  I do not accept that certain broad categories of the unemployed &mdash; such as the long-term unemployed &mdash; can face particular difficulties in securing employment. Labour market actions, such as the development of the local employment service, as well as measures such as those announced in the recent budget, seek to overcome such difficulties by, on the one hand, improving the employment-readiness of the unemployed and, on the other hand, engaging with employers to overcome certain biases they may have against persons who have been out of work for a long time.</P>
      <P>The package of measures introduced by the Government in the recent budget for the long-term unemployed included the splitting of the community employment programme into two distinct options (a) a part-time integration option and (b) a part-time jobs option and the better targeting of the programme at the long-term unemployed; introduction of a new pilot whole-time jobs option; introduction of a new recruitment subsidy scheme called &ldquo;Jobstart&rdquo;; introduction of a new work experience programme called &ldquo;Work-Place&rdquo;; and the introduction of special measures for 18/19 year olds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following arrangements apply in <Col N="140" /> regard to the implementation of these initiatives.</P>
    <P>Community Employment CE: The part-time integration option and the part-time jobs option for CE are being introduced as and from 15 April.  The pilot whole-time jobs option will come into operation on 1 July and will provide 1,000 additional opportunities for long-term unemployed people in areas of high unemployment in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    <P>Workplace and Jobstart: The planned start up date for &ldquo;Jobstart&rdquo; and &ldquo;Work-place&rdquo; is May 1996.  FÁS, as part of its day to day operational responsibility for both of these programmes has already prepared a design brief, the objectives of which are to inform the target audiences of terms and conditions of each programme; to highlight the benefits of each programme to their primary target audiences; to promote the programmes to employers as being worthwhile measures for their company and to present all information and material in a simple, user-friendly manner.</P>
    <P>Discussions are ongoing between my Department and FÁS, ICTU, INOU and IBEC on the final details of these programmes.  I hope that these will be completed later this week.  It is my intention to arrange a launch of the programmes in May this year.  This is earlier than the projected date of 1 July originally proposed.</P>
    <P>Special Measures for 18-19 Year Olds: On-going discussions are taking place between by Department, FÁS and the Department of Social Welfare regarding the implementation of these initiatives which will provide opportunities for 500 young unemployed people at any one time.  It is intended that the programme will apply to those 18-19 year olds who have been six months on the live register.  The measures will include a youth progression programme for each individual designed to encourage young people into the labour market and to prevent them from drifting into prolonged dependence on the live register.</P>

      <P>The access to finance scheme which carries a 6.5 per cent subsidised interest rate was created to provide low fixed interest rate loans to the small business sector for the creation of jobs and to increase commercial viability.  One of the features of this scheme is that indigenous service industries were included for the first time.  Private nursing homes would fall into this general category and are therefore not excluded from the scheme. Such indigenous services must show that displacement will not take place either locally, regionally or nationally (depending on the nature of the project) in order to qualify for a loan.  This is done by way of a market impact assessment submitted by the potential borrower to the lending bank.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing nearly 50 per cent of the subsidy for the scheme, the administering banks carry all the risk in lending under the scheme and therefore all projects proposed to the banks are subject to normal commercial lending criteria.  All sectors are subject to these criteria and loan approval decisions are made by the lending bank.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The Washington Conference provided a prestigeous focus to the ongoing efforts of Forbairt and IDA Ireland to promote industrial investment in the Border counties.  At that conference the United States &mdash; Ireland Business Partnership was announced.  The objective of this partnership is to promote strategic business alliances which will facilitate growth and employment creation in indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. This is being done by arranging direct contacts between compatible companies in Ireland and the United States.</P>
      <P>In November last I led a delegation which included representatives of 26 such companies to Boston, five of whom were from the Border counties.  Those representatives were introduced to American counterparts who had been specifically selected in advance because of the compatibility of their business interests and the possibilities of mutual co-operation to facilitate the growth of counterpart companies in this country. There has since been follow-up on these contacts.  While negotiations of this kind normally take some time to complete, and while it is too early yet to be definitive on the overall outcome of these contacts, I am confident that arrangements which will benefit Border companies in Ireland in growth and employment terms will emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and its agencies is proactively working with Irish companies in developing these contacts, carrying out negotiations and developing investment proposals as appropriate. Initial response has indicated that second phase discussions are likely with <Col N="143" /> approximately 60 per cent of the companies previously contacted.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, being taken to reverse the trend of increasing liquidations among small and medium enterprises, which have shown an 18 per cent increase for the first quarter of 1996 compared to 1995.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to recently published figures from <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> which indicate that there were 194 liquidations reported in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> in the first quarter of 1996, as compared to 165 for the first quarter of 1995.  <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> analysts had predicted, in 1995, that liquidations would increase because the number of liquidations are affected by the number of new businesses established in previous years.  The number of business start-ups increased by 29 per cent in the period 1992-95, reaching a record number of 16,265 in 1995.  It is important, therefore, to view the recent increase in liquidations in the context of this very substantial increase in business start-ups.  It is also relevant to mention that the number of liquidations in the first quarter of 1996 is, in fact, lower than the figure of 219 liquidations for the first quarter of 1994.</P>
      <P>One of my principal concerns is to ensure that help is available to businesses to enable them to survive the critical start-up phase.  A range of measures is already in place for this purpose and further measures are in the process of being implemented to improve the overall operating environment for small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agencies which come within the responsibility of my Department, including FÁS, Forbairt and Shannon Development, provide a range of support measure to assist start-up firms and to help them to survive and <Col N="144" /> develop.  These measures include training, management development, advisory services and mentoring programmes. The nation-wide system of 35 county and city enterprise boards is designed to assist small and micro enterprises at start-up level through the provision of direct financial assistance (e.g. grants) or indirect financial assistance, including business advice, information, mentoring and management development assistance.</P>
    <P>In addition, many State supported, local initiatives, such as the Plato programme, provide a practical support to small, and early stage business through a parenting arrangement whereby executives from large established companies provide expertise and lead groups of owner managers of small businesses on the programme.</P>
    <P>An area to which I attach special importance is the financial environment for small business.  The £208 million access to finance scheme is providing fixed interest rate loans for the creation of jobs and to increase the commercial viability of small business.  This scheme, which carries a 6.5 per cent subsidised interest rate, was created to provide long-term, low rate finance to small business and service firms.  In addition, I believe that the recently announced seed venture capital measure of the Operational Programme for Industry will be particularly important for the sector.</P>
    <P>As regards initiatives which I am in the process of implementing, my Department is currently preparing legislation to resolve the problem of late payment of business debts, which is an area highlighted by the Task Force on Small Business as being of particular importance.</P>
    <P>This Government has an ongoing commitment to help small business in the creation of enterprise and employment. This commitment is reflected in many aspects of Government policy. For example, the 1996 budget placed particular emphasis on the small business and services sector by reducing the rate of corporation tax, which was an <Col N="145" /> area highlighted by the sector as being of particular importance.</P>

      <P>The employment figures referred to by the Deputy relate to new jobs created by IDA Ireland during 1995.  The IDA's south-west region created approximately 1,500 jobs.  This represents 13 per cent of the total new full-time jobs created by the IDA in 1995.</P>
      <P>In addition Forbairt supported companies created a total of 717 first-time jobs in Cork and south Kerry representing 10 per cent of the national first time jobs created in companies.  A further 146 first-time jobs were created by Shannon Development in the north Kerry area.</P>
      <P>Cork and Kerry County Enterprise Boards created a total of 502 jobs in those counties during 1995 representing over 17 per cent of total jobs created by the country's 35 county enterprise boards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 100 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as my Department is concerned, the Deputies will be aware that Forbairt only provides financial assistance to developments which are based <Col N="147" /> on the use of waste as a raw material, and which are used to produce products in a traded sector.  Projects must satisfy normal commercial criteria and they are considered on their merit by Forbairt on a case by case basis.  Forbairt also provides assistance under the feasibility study grants programme to assist companies to investigate market opportunities for recycled products.  Forbairt assistance is not therefore available for developments which are based on collection, sorting, shredding and baling or incineration of waste materials. Recycling enterprises would be eligible for assistance from the county enterprise boards provided they satisfy the commercial, investment and employment criteria applied by the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>There are various initiatives in operation to support recycling activities.  Financial assistance to support waste recovery, waste recycling and the development of waste infrastructure will be available under the solid waste management sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 which will be administered by the Department of the Environment. The Minister for the Environment announced details of this scheme on 4 April 1996.  The Waste Management Bill, which will shortly be enacted, will provide the Minister for the Environment with extensive powers to promote the prevention, recovery and safe disposal of waste.  The National Recycling Strategy, <i>Recycling for Ireland</i> published in 1994, has placed the promotion of recycling high on the Government agenda.  I understand that the Minister for the Environment will publish a review of the strategy in the near future to guide and give impetus to the fuller development of recycling in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A recent development in the recycling area has been the recently launched REPAK scheme.  REPAK is a <Col N="148" /> new organisation, which will be established, run and funded by industry to coordinate and finance the recycling-recovery of packaging waste.  REPAK has set itself a target recycling rate of 27 per cent for packaging waste to be achieved by the year 2001.  I understand that the funds collected will be used by REPAK to contract out the collection, sorting and recycling of packaging waste.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to her <Col N="149" /> on this subject on 25 January 1996, as reported in the Official Report, columns 1,355-57, volume 460.</P>
      <P>In that reply I indicated that the intellectual property unit of my Department had recently completed its review of Irish copyright law which took account of:</P>
      <P>I.  Our international obligations under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers and Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations;</P>
      <P>II.  EU legislation on, <i>inter alia,</i> rental and lending, cable and satellite broadcasting and duration of copyright together with proposals for EU legislation on resale rights and private tape levies;</P>
      <P>III.  Technological developments;</P>
      <P>IV.  The legitimate interests of both suppliers and users of copyright materials and;</P>
      <P>V.  The need to ensure that copyright law does not impede legitimate creative activity.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in that earlier reply, the unit is currently drafting heads of a consolidating piece of legislation in this extremely difficult and technical area. The new piece of legislation will be a very substantial one, as this area has not been addressed in over 30 years and as legal and technological changes since then have greatly impacted on this issue.</P>
      <P>I do intend to bring forward this piece of legislation as soon as possible but the Deputy will appreciate that given the difficulties and technical issues involved, the importance of the legal rights provided for and the nature of our international obligations, this process must not be rushed.  The Deputy can be assured that there will be no delay in processing the legislation, and, indeed, steady progress is being made in this regard and that I will make every effort to expedite it.</P>

      <P>The definitive source of comprehensive data on employment and unemployment is the annual labour force survey.  I am satisfied that this survey provides an extensive range of analyses of the labour market situation, including internationally comparable measures of employment and unemployment.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with over 100 users of statistics during 1995, the CSO has examined the feasibility of conducting a quarterly multi-purpose household survey covering labour force as well as a range of social topics.  The CSO's proposals for such a quarterly survey are currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>The live register is also used as an indicator of short-term trends in the absence of sub-annual definitive LFS data.  However, the live register is based on an administrative system which is not designed to measure the level of unemployment. A subgroup of the Central Review Committee, comprising representatives of relevant Government Departments and representatives of the social partners, has been established to review the composition of the live register. The CSO is participating in this subgroup.</P>

        <Col N="151" /> The latest figures available from the Central Statistics Office on industrial earnings relate to June 1995 when the annualised average gross earnings was £14,101 (based on all industrial workers in all industries).  The corresponding figure for managerial staff was £26,011.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the CSO industrial earnings figures are not representative figures for pay levels in the private sector as a whole, excluding for example, the services sector.</P>
      <P>The total salary of the Taoiseach in 1995 averaged £83,781 while that of a Minister was £66,827.  The total salary of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs averaged £71,671.  In each case an element of £32,918 is included in the total salary being the average TD's salary in that year.</P>
      <P>With regard to programme managers, the arrangements for their remuneration provide that they continue to receive their existing salary plus an attraction allowance of circa 10 per cent subject, in most cases, to a ceiling of £43,752, the last point on the principal (higher) scale, with due allowance for vouched pension contributions.  As previously indicated to this House, different arrangements apply to the programme managers of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste.  The average salary of the programme managers of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers in 1995, was of the order of £45,000.</P>

    <P>National debt <i>per capita</i> is calculated as national debt divided by total population.</P>
    <P>While the nominal amount of national debt per head of population has increased significantly since 1985, it should be noted that there has also been a very large increase in the wealth of the country over the same period, as evidenced by the growth in the gross national product (GNP) or national income.  While the nominal debt per capita has increased by less than two-thirds over the period, the GNP has almost exactly doubled.  As a result, the debt burden has reduced in relative terms with the ratio of the national debt to GNP falling from 111 per cent in 1985 to about 90 per cent by the end of 1995. It is anticipated that continued strong economic growth in the coming years will see further progress in this area.</P>

      <P>The Government commitment on gender balance, which sets out the objective of achieving a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women on State boards, does not, in certain circumstances, apply to the type of bodies referred to by the Deputy, e.g., where the appointees need to be holders of certain posts, where the membership is determined by outside organisations represented on the body or on the basis of specific technical expertise or where a sufficient number of qualified men or women are not available to serve.</P>
      <P>In the case of the bodies referred to by me in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 60 of 15 February 1996, there was no one body over which I had exclusive control of the appointment of the membership.  A number of those bodies had members appointed by outside organisations, including other Government Departments and offices and trade unions.  I am satisfied that those appointed to the bodies concerned were appointed because of their specific experience or because of the offices which they hold.  Given the circumstances in which the 40 per cent gender quota may be departed from I am satisfied that there was no breach of the Government commitment to gender balance.</P>

For the Civil Service generally, including offices for which I have responsibility, the number of posts which cannot be filled amounts to about 80.  Posts affected by these restrictions have not been filled by temporary or contract recruitment which is also covered by the restriction.</P>
      <P>The projected annual savings as a result of the restriction are estimated at £2 million in 1996.</P>
      <P>As regards overtime, it has long been general practice in certain Departments to resort to overtime working to deal with seasonal pressures.  Overtime expenditure in recent months has not increased over previous years.</P>
      <P>The number of posts which are expected to remain unfilled by 1 January 1997, as a result of the restriction is expected to amount to approximately 300 posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that income tax statistics do not generally distinguish between individuals who have income from pensions and from other sources.  The only relevant information available is in respect of recipients of social welfare pensions, of whom some 32,000 individuals aged 65 years or over are estimated to have taxable incomes.</P>
      <P>The total number of individuals aged 65 years or over, including individuals with income from pensions, who are estimated to be liable to income tax in the income tax year 1996-97 is of the order of 93,000.  Some 31,500 of this number will qualify for marginal relief at the marginal rate of 40 per cent on total income in excess of the aged exemption limits.  The balance of 61,500 will be liable to tax at the standard or higher rates and will qualify for the age allowance at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of £6 million in a full year. Statistics are not available which would enable the number of claimants for the age allowance to be classified into age groupings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that <Col N="156" /> there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to provide a precise costing for increasing the combined tax free allowances of pensioners to the level of their tax exemption limits as both the levels of tax free allowances and exemption limits can vary considerably depending on individual circumstances. However, as an illustration, on the basis of increasing the combined tax free allowances of a married couple, aged 65 or over, with no dependent children and in receipt of only one PAYE allowance, to their relevant tax exemption limit, through increasing the age allowance, and applying <i>pro-rata</i> increases to the age allowance of other aged taxpayers, the cost is estimated to be of the order of £50 million in a full year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The death referred to by the Deputy was the subject of communication between the relevant hospital in which the death occurred and the coroner.  I understand that the coroner has now determined that a coroner's inquest is not required and arrangements have been made for the registration of the death with the relevant hospital acting as qualified informant.  As more than 12 months have elapsed since the date of death, the authority of the Ard-Chláraitheoir is required and I have been <Col N="157" /> assured that when the necessary papers are forwarded to his office by the hospital the application will be dealt with expeditiously.  On receipt of this authority, the registrar for the district in which the death occurred will register the death and a death certificate will be available from the registrar.</P>

      <P>The provision of respite care is an integral part of service provision to people with a mentalhandicap and people with physical disabilities. Respite services are provided in a variety of ways; for example through the use of dedicated respite beds, residential places vacated by residents returning to their families at weekends and the use of other residential places as and when available.

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As part of the 1992 <Col N="162" /> development of services to people with a mental handicap, a special home support scheme was initiated to help meet the needs of families with a member with a mental handicap.  The scheme works in a flexible manner; for example, providing assistance with clients in their homes, taking clients to leisure activities, allowing carers a few hours off, etc. The home support services are provided by both health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies and specifically targeted at those persons who have no service or an inadequate service.</P>

    <P>With regard to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, the additional cumulative allocation of £6 million made available over the last four years for services for people with physical disabilities has allowed improvements to be made to the home help and home care attendant schemes run by health boards and voluntary agencies.  Additional funding provided in the last three years for the development of these services was £175,000 in 1993, £76,000 in 1994 and £100,000 in 1995.

    <P>The basic principle of public procurement is competitive tendering, but issues such as continuity of service, expertise in particular areas of law, such as child care, and local availability must be taken into account in relation to legal services.</P>
    <P>It is important for each health board to ensure that it obtains its legal services at a competitive cost, but I am not satisfied that a tendering process is necessarily the best way of achieving this.  The issue will be followed up with the health boards.</P>

    <P>The increase in the number of cases of bacterial meningitis reported in recent years is almost certainly composed of two elements i.e. an actual increase in the community and more efficient reporting.  The actual increase is a reflection of the unpredictable nature of bacterial meningitis and meningococcal infection which can increase, sometimes significantly so, without apparent reason.  The greater propensity to report brings with it the possibility of over-reporting of cases, i.e. cases are reported as bacterial meningitis, but following thorough hospital investigation, another diagnosis is made, usually viral meningitis.</P>

In response to a previous question I stated that my Department, in consultations with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for the provision of this service.  A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officer group forms the basis for this examination.</P>

Articles 23.1 to 25.3 of the Nursing <Col N="169" /> Homes Care and Welfare Regulations, 1993 give health boards power to inspect nursing homes and premises believed to be nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Under the Act all nursing homes are obliged to register with a health board. Before placing a nursing home on the register the health board must inspect the home to ensure that it conforms with the required standard of staffing, accommodation and design.  The regulations require health boards to inspect all homes at least once every six months. In the course of inspections particular regard is paid to the general welfare and well being of residents, staffing levels, accommodation and facilities, kitchen facilities, hygiene, sanitary facilities, nutrition, patient records, safety and the prescribing and administration of drugs and medicines.  Any identified shortcomings are brought to the attention of the proprietor and the person in charge and homes are duly monitored to ensure compliance with the regulations.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 189 nursing home inspections have been carried out by the health boards, resulting in 164 written communications to nursing home proprietors.</P>

      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to the latest available statistics on foster children and foster families was set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 43 of 13 March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of fostering allowances is governed by the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 which came into operation on 31 October last.  The standard rate of allowance payable, effective from 1 March last, is £44.20 per child per week for those under 12 years of age and £60 per child per week for those over 12 years of age.  Health boards may pay higher rates of allowances in particular cases where, for example, a child has a disability or has other special needs.  Boards also make a range of <Col N="171" /> additional payments to cover items such as clothing, school and medical items.</P>
    <P>The Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995, which also came into effect on 31 October last, provide for the payment of allowances to relatives who have children placed with them by health boards in accordance with the regulations.  The standard rate of allowance in such cases is the same as that applicable to foster parents.  The other financial and support services available to foster parents apply also in cases where children are placed by health boards with relatives.</P>
    <P>A small number of children placed in foster care by health boards may also qualify for the orphan's allowance payable by the Department of Social Welfare. I understand that, in such cases, it is the usual practice of health boards to reduce the standard fostering allowance by the amount of the other allowance received.</P>
    <P>Statistics in relation to children placed in foster care by health boards and who also receive orphan's allowance are not collected as a matter of routine by my Department.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of difficulties arising in relation to any particular case, he should bring the details to my attention and I will investigate the matter with the health board concerned.</P>

      <P>The Waterways Service employs contractors to regularly remove litter and cut grass on canal property from Grand Canal Street to the old 5th Lockhouse, Bluebell, Inchicore.  The Waterways Service has also recently cleaned out the lock chambers in the Dublin area, including the 3rd Lock at Blackhorse Bridge.  There is no policy to discriminate between the different stretches of the canal in regard to regular maintenance activity. However, I understand that the Inchicore and Kilmainham Development Association recently organised a voluntary clean out of the canal at the first level, which is below Blackhorse Bridge, with the agreement and assistance of the Waterways Service.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the draft legislation in relation to education boards and boards of management has not yet been published.  The overall policy framework for this legislation, including the constitutional framework within which the legislation must be framed, is clearly set out in the White Paper, Charting our Education Future.  I know the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail, at this stage, on draft legislation which is currently being prepared by the parliamentary draftsman.  However, I would like to restate the policy context for this legislation, set out in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm that I have no plans to introduce legislative provisions which will give the patrons of denominational schools the right in law to remove teachers from posts on the grounds of religious denomination.  As set out in the White Paper, my aim in bringing forward legislation is to ensure that, in so far as the denominational character of a school impacts on the staffing of the school, it will do so only in a reasonable <Col N="180" /> and proportionate way which is objectively necessary for the protection of the ethos of the school.</P>
    <P>As regards boards of management, the White Paper points out that each board will be responsible for promoting and protecting the ethos of the school, while striking a balance between the rights of parents and students who subscribe to that ethos and those who do not.  The White Paper also proposes that a patron may for stated reasons dissolve a board of management with the approval of the Minister for Education if, among other things, the board acts in a way which would be a threat to, or a dimunition of, the ethos of the school.</P>
    <P>The White Paper states that the objective of selection procedures for the appointment of teaching staff in schools will be to ensure the integrity of the process and the selection of most suitable teachers.  I can confirm that the legislation will aim to protect the rights of teachers and other school staff to earn a livelihood free from arbitrary discrimination on grounds of religion.</P>
    <P>The legislation which I propose to bring before the Oireachtas will give practical effect to these White Paper proposals in a manner which will strike a fair and reasonable balance between the rights and obligations of all concerned, in particular the rights of parents to send their children to schools which have a particular ethos, the rights of patrons of schools to promote and protect that ethos and the rights of parents, students and teachers who do not subscribe to that ethos.</P>

      <Quest>if the right to silence in our criminal justice system is seriously undermining the best efforts of the Garda Síochána to successfully apprehend and prosecute crime lords and drug barons in our midst; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="181" /> While under our criminal law the general rule is that a person is not required to answer any questions in connection with an offence of which he or she is suspected, it would not be correct to say that there is an unqualified right to silence. The general rule, which is in line with a general constitutional protection against self-incrimination, is subject to a number of statutory exceptions.  The most recent of these were included in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Sections 18 and 19 of that Act allow a court or jury to draw inferences from an accused's failure or refusal in the course of Garda questioning to account for certain matters: marks on his or her person or clothing or presence in the vicinity of a crime.  These inferences cannot be drawn unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of failing or refusing to provide the relevant information might be.  While inferences can be treated as amounting to corroboration of other evidence the Act specifically provides that they cannot alone form the basis of a conviction.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in this area of our law conflicting and competing rights are at issue.  For example, it is argued that the right to silence is an old and very important protection of a suspect's rights and that its removal could place in jeopardy those innocent of any crime.  While it is, of its nature, both difficult and speculative to draw conclusions as to how the outcome of a complex criminal investigation might have been different had a different factor entered into the equation &mdash; such as a more restricted right to silence &mdash; I am aware of the concerns which have been increasingly expressed in recent times to the effect that the present situation helps those involved in very serious crimes to avoid conviction.  This requires that at the very least the law in this area is constantly kept under review in the light of changes that have taken place in the nature of crime and the nature of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right to sound a note of caution in relation to any possible change in the law in this area: there are clear <Col N="182" /> limits to what any such changes could achieve.  In particular, it is difficult to imagine any change in the law in this area which would not continue to provide that inferences from silence alone are not a sufficient basis for a conviction. In other words other evidence linking the suspect to the crime would also have to be available.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that a commission of experts which examined the question of the right to silence in a neighbouring jurisdiction concluded that there was no evidence to show conclusively that silence was used disproportionately by professional criminals; nor was there evidence to support the belief that silence in the police station led to an improved chance of acquittal.</P>
    <P>I mention these points not to indicate any unwillingness on my part to consider further changes in the law in this area but to emphasise that we should be realistic about what such changes might achieve.</P>
    <P>A further major consideration in this area is that there is a developing body of jurisprudence under the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination is an implicit element to the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the convention and that this, in turn, has implications for the exercise of the right to silence.  Some key cases in this area have recently been decided on or await to be decided at present which are likely to have implications for any legislative changes which might be proposed in this area.  I am, of course, having the judgments in these cases fully examined as they become available.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996 provides the legislative basis for the transfer of responsibility for the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the health boards to my Department.  It is intended that this transfer will take place later this year.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of this Act the scheme will be known in future as disability allowance and the following important improvements will be made in the conditions of the scheme: providing a disregard of £45 per week plus travel expenses in respect of the earnings of a working spouse; significant improvements in the provisions for the assessment of capital including the disregard of the first £2.000; provision for the payment of two full personal rates of payment where both of a couple are in receipt of the allowance; and where a person on disability assistance goes in to hospital provision is made for continued payment of the allowance for a further 13 weeks.  This is an improvement on the existing regulation which only allows payment for eight weeks in any calendar year.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to carry out a review of the scheme following the transfer which will take account of all issues raised with me to date including recommendations emerging from discussions with organisations representing people with disabilities and the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which is expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to address such <Col N="189" /> issues as soon as the scheme is transferred and I have had an opportunity to see how it is operating in practice.  I am confident that the transfer of responsibility for the scheme to my Department will of itself improve the situation for people in receipt of the allowance and my intention will be to ensure that any subsequent rationalisation of arrangements will further improve the situation of people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear.  Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and they must satisfy a means test.  The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of survivors (widows and widowers) contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple.  Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orphan's pension is not considered to <Col N="190" /> be a qualifying payment under the terms of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme.  The orphan's pension, which is a basic social welfare payment, is payable to the guardian and is intended to cover the child's cost of living, including food and clothing.  Eligible applicants will receive either a contributory or non-contributory orphan's pension of up to £41.40 per week.  In comparison, the allowance paid in respect of dependent children with other social welfare or health board payments is either £13.20 or £15.20 per week.  The higher rate of orphan's pension as compared with the child dependant allowance rate means that the guardian receives an additional income of up to £1,400 per annum in respect of the orphaned child.</P>
    <P>With regard to children placed in foster care, the financial support provided by the Department of Health through the health board includes annual assistance with clothing and footwear and additional assistance when the child returns to school.  Accordingly, payment of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance would not normally arise in these cases.</P>
    <P>Extending the back to school clothing and footwear scheme to include payment in respect of orphans would cost an estimated £53,000 per annum.  This figure is based on the assumption that all 1,094 orphans (as at the end of March 1996) would qualify for the allowance and that 62 per cent of these would qualify for the lower rate of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme allowance.</P>
    <P>From this year the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will be paid on an age related basis.  Furthermore, I have increased the rates of allowance payable by £3.  This means that under the 1996 scheme an allowance of £43 will be payable in respect of children from two to 11 years of age and an allowance of £58 will be payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 21 years of age.  I have also extended the <Col N="191" /> scheme to recipients of unemployability supplement who satisfy the means assessment.  It is expected that some 280,000 pupils will benefit under the scheme this year at a cost of approximately £13.8 million.  The scheme opens for applications in all health boards from 1 June each year.  This is to allow adequate time to process the large number of applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central issue which will impact on industry in EU terms is the development of economic and monetary union.  There is much that we can, and are doing, to ensure that we maximise the benefits of European Monetary Union and minimise any difficulties which could potentially arise in the employment context.</P>
      <P>The key issue will be to ensure macroeconomic stability and a further <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> would make a useful contribution to such stability if it can be achieved at the right price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost environment provided by the Irish economy has a major impact on the ability of Irish industry to achieve a high level of competitiveness on both domestic and international markets and so to enhance both wealth and employment creation.  While individual companies are responsible for the development of competitive capabilities and aspects such as management, marketing, product and process development and quality control systems, competitiveness is determined at several <Col N="193" /> distinct levels.  The Government is well aware of the role which it must play in facilitating and enhancing this competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In the 1995 and 1996 budgets measures such as improvements in income tax and PRSI were introduced. These had the objective of further improving the economic climate and will be of considerable benefit to Irish firms in their efforts to reduce costs and improve competitiveness.  The measures were aimed in particular at helping the labour intensive industries, in which indigenous firms tend to predominate. The improvements in income tax and employee PRSI will underpin the moderate wage developments enshrined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>It is also acknowledged that traditional industries face a struggle to survive if the variety of structural inefficiencies, problems of scale and under-capitalisation which affect many of the firms operating in that sector, are not addressed.  These problems are not insurmountable and can be overcome through a combination of adaptation measures.  Forbairt is actively working with and supporting those firms in the traditional sector and that organisation is exclusively dedicated to facilitating the adaptation and expansion of indigenous industry.  A determination to adapt to an increasingly competitive trading environment on the part of every individual company which operates in this sector is absolutely essential. The need to prepare for and to embrace change will become even more urgent as we approach European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Irish industry is increasingly aware of the competitive global environment in which it operates.  The industrial development and training agencies under my Department provide a wide range of programmes to enhance the competitiveness of the industry and services sectors and to ensure that skilled workers are available to take advantage of the new occupational opportunities which are opening up.  Change will <Col N="194" /> increasingly be a feature of modern working life and employment development policies have to be centrally informed by that reality.  Such policies are kept under review by my Department and its agencies and are changed or refined to take account of developments, both within the European Union and in the wider world with which we trade.</P>
    <P>ADAPT, an initiative to assist industry to cope with and benefit from change is also administered by my Department.  This is a European Union wide programme which is financed by the social fund.  It aims to facilitate adaptation to industrial change and the promotion of new forms of employment. This country has been allocated £23 million under the programme, which will be operational at the end of this century.</P>
    <P>I have approved 44 projects to operate to end-1997 under ADAPT.  These are promoted by a range of organisations, including 17 private companies and six social partner organisations, as well as by education and training institutions and community organisations. Each project, in co-operation with partners in other member states of the European Union, is piloting a new approach to the development of personnel in the work situation, having regard to changing European and world markets. I will examine the outcome of these projects to ensure that the learning gained under ADAPT is fully reflected in our policies on industrial development.  Further opportunities to develop innovative approaches in this area will arise when additional funds are made available next year.</P>

      <P>In 1995, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, the Companies Registration Office received notification of the appointment of a liquidator in respect of 777 companies and a receiver in respect of 55 companies.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that the processes in respect of many of the companies which went into liquidation or receivership in 1995 would not yet have concluded.  Recovery of any repayable grant-aid would be a normal issue in those processes.</P>
      <P>The information requested on State aid is not available.</P>
      <P>In the case of Forbairt, I am advised that the body does not maintain statistics on the numbers of grant-aided companies that go into liquidation or receivership in a particular period.  However, its legal department does monitor such companies and, in 1995, 43 grant aided companies were identified which had gone into liquidation or receivership and which had received a grant which could be repayable.  There are, of course, a number of programmes to assist companies in difficulties.</P>
