      <P>The Labour Force Survey, which is conducted in April of each year, covers a national representative sample of about 4.5 per cent of all households.  This makes it the largest regular sample survey in the State.</P>
      <P>The preliminary results for April 1996, which were published in October, were based on a sample of over 46,000 households.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report the following statement showing the number of sample households surveyed in each county and region:</P>

In both those counties the number was 6 per cent, above the national norm of 4.5 per cent.  The CSO tried to achieve as equal a balance as possible between urban and rural areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's response to the action plan prepared by the Western Development Partnership Board, I am coordinating <Col N="1092" /> discussions between the partnership board and the relevant Departments and agencies on the various indicative proposals for sectoral development contained in the action plan.</P>
    <P>A number of exploratory meetings to discuss the sectoral proposals have already taken place. Further meetings are being arranged and I expect that all the meetings requested by the partnership board will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The discussion documents referred to have been prepared by the partnership board as part of this ongoing consultative process and the continuing dialogue between the partnership board and my Department.  A number of discussion papers have been prepared covering a wide range of sectoral issues, including infrastructural funding, information technology and telecommunications, the proposed Programme for Identification and Linkage of Technologies &mdash; PILOT &mdash; and the related advisory councils to support the programme.</P>
    <P>These discussion documents, with the discussions which have been taking place between the partnership and my Department, have proved to be very valuable and informative in assessing the current position regarding the many sectoral issues pertinent to the western region.  In particular, the meetings on the sectoral proposals are important in assisting the partnership board to develop their indicative proposals and to identify the strategic priorities in the key sectors identified in the action plan. The outcome of this process will provide a firm basis for the tasks to be addressed by the forthcoming Western Development Commission, which will succeed the Western Development Partnership Board on the expiry of its term of office at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>In addition, the partnership board has also submitted papers to my Department which have been a most useful input in preparing for the establishment of the commission, setting up a western investment fund and the assessment by the Department of Social Welfare of the proposal to set up a social development unit.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's questions cover a wide area.  While the partnership board has made proposals, I met the chief executive of the National Roads Authority and discussed the problems as regards the national primary routes through Connacht and Clare.  He was concerned about the idea of economic routes implemented by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, who was responsible for the Structural Funds application to Brussels.  The term &ldquo;economic routes&rdquo; is causing great difficulty for the west.  I have tried to get the Minister for the Environment to accept the social aspect also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> Despite the actions of the former Minister for the Environment, I presume he did not want to neglect the west.  As a result, radial roads into Dublin have received most development.  While some progress has been made on routes around Sligo and Longford, there are many blockages in the area.  I would have preferred if the Structural Funds application had requested a western corridor to be established at the same time as an eastern corridor.</P>
    <P>As regards county roads, the Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment have substantially increased the funds spent in all county councils in the western area.  There is also provision for additional funds in the Estimates for the coming year and the Government is well aware of the problems.</P>
    <P>Any of the other actions proposed by the Western Development Partnership Board will be taken up by the commission on its assumption.  I have put a proposal to the Government as regards the establishment of the western commission and I expect a reply this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State suggesting that moneys are incorrectly spent on arterial routes leading from Connacht to the ports and airports and should be diverted to other routes?  The west is hugely dependent on exporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not suggesting that. Deputy Michael Kitt highlighted the principal problem, which is that there is no western corridor.  The original route planned by the former Minister for the Environment, Sylvester Barrett, in the 1970s, to which I am sure Deputy Burke made an input, was from Sligo and Donegal to Limerick and across to Rosslare.  That road has been developed on the economic route from Limerick to Shannon Airport and there are other patches of development leading from the city of Galway towards the docklands but the great majority of roads funding has been successfully spent on the east coast, where the economy is booming.</P>

His commanding officer stated he had outstanding service, was totally reliable and dependable.  This is in an age when strenuous efforts are being made to give equality to people with special needs.  I ask the Minister therefore, since time is running out &mdash; and there are only days left in terms of the opportunity for this man to be retained in military service &mdash; that a decision be taken immediately for a further appeal to be made and that common sense should prevail.  The Minister knows there are many serving members with sick leave records totally different from this one in terms of time and so on.

      <P>The Deputy should be aware that I said in reply to the question that his date of discharge has been extended to 12 March 1997. This is as a result of my ongoing inquiries into the matter.  It is not a question of days.  I am sure the House will appreciate that for reasons of medical confidentiality it is not open to me to disclose this person's illness.  I have made inquiries, I have asked for the file and have sent back a number of queries.  I am satisfied that within the Defence Force regulations all appeal procedures have been followed.  I am not a professional medical person and cannot say whether somebody is suitable or not.  There are Defence Force regulations to which I have to adhere and I do not have a great deal of discretion.  So far as the appeal procedures are concerned, this man has used every appeal procedure open to him right up to the adjutant general.  Based on the medical advice given by the director of the Army medical services the decision was taken.  I can assure the Deputy I am aware of the circumstances and will review the position again before the date of his discharge.  I am always conscious of people, particularly those with families, who are left in a difficult position because of illness.  In normal circumstances I am sure ways could be found to facilitate some people but unfortunately there are knock-on effects.  If somebody in medical category E was discharged while somebody else in the same category was retained, despite the <Col N="1097" /> Defence Force regulations, it would have a knock-on effect.  That is the difficulty in which I find myself.  I have listened to what Deputy Smith has said and I assure him I will do everything I possibly can to see if there is any way out of this.</P>

      <P>Will this mean that anyone who may suffer from that particular medical problem will be automatically transferred from category C to E and discharged?  Is the Minister aware that in the American army the medical classification was changed in 1989 to allow somebody suffering from any particular medical problem, which can respond to treatment, to be retained in the service?  Will he therefore agree that the medical classification and the procedures in that board, which seem to defy logic, fairness, equality, humanity, should be changed immediately so that no other family will have to suffer in the same way as this one?  I am not here to pillory the Minister or to point the finger at him.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Defence Forces Review implementation plan, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force will reduce by approximately 1,300 over the three years 1996 to 1998.  Due to the cost of the voluntary early retirement scheme, net savings arising from the reduction in strength will not begin to accure until 1999.  From that year onwards savings are estimated to be in the order of £15 million per year.  It is the intention that the savings accruing from the reduction in numbers in the PDF should be shared between the Exchequer and the Defence Forces.  The precise details remain to be finalised but I am confident a significant portion of these savings will be available for investment <Col N="1098" /> in infrastructure and new equipment for the Defence Forces commencing in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  We all realise a restructuring of the Defence Forces is necessary.  On a number of occasions the Minister has asked members of the Defence Forces to take ownership of this plan if it is to be successful.  Their biggest concern and frustration is that so many changes are necessary major sacrifices will have to be made.  However, until now, the only sacrifices have been by the members and there appear to be no benefits accruing to them for making them.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned savings of £15 million per year from 1999 onwards due to reduced numbers.  He was able to make changes to the voluntary early retirement package to facilitate a certain number of people this year.  Can the Minister do something similar with the savings to be made in 1999, and spend them now?  Nothing is more necessary in our Defence Forces than an injection of capital to improve infrastructure and equipment.  Members of the Defence Forces know major investment is badly needed.  If the Minister could indicate that he has such a plan in mind, it would do a lot for morale in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at the Book of Estimates he will find there is an increase in the money available to the Defence Forces, particularly for capital projects this year.  We are making improvements to the 80:20 ratio of salaries and wages to equipment and capital works.  The Deputy asked what would happen with savings, if any, and I said they will be spent on equipment and new infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The savings will not be available until 1999.  Next year alone we will include £30.5 million for a voluntary early retirement scheme. This year we spent in the region of £13 million which makes a total of nearly £44 million in two years.  There are no savings there but when they arise they will be given back to the Defence Forces.  It is my policy &mdash; and I hope that my successor will follow it &mdash; to move towards a ratio of 70:30 instead of 80:20 as at present.  That is precisely the reason new efficiencies and greater streamlining will result in members of the Defence Forces having the equipment and infrastructure they deserve to do their job properly.</P>
      <P>I am responding positively to the Deputy's question.  I cannot do anything about the fact that there will not be savings until 1999.  That will be a matter for the Government.  I am looking for a commitment that at least the savings will be shared until the cost has been returned.  I hope that in future any savings that arise will go into necessary infrastructure and equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not postponing any efficiencies.  There are no savings.  The Deputy's question asks whether the savings, if any, will be spent on infrastructure and new equipment.  They will, but the savings will not arise until 1999 so we are not postponing anything.  There are additional costs at the moment because of the VER scheme but when that has been completed the savings arising will be spent on infrastructure and equipment.</P>

      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The current strength on the Naval Service is 992.  The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.</P>
      <P>Advertisements were placed in the national newspapers recently inviting applications for enlistment in the Army and the Naval Service in 1996 and 1997.  I propose to enlist 200 recruits in 1996 and at least a further 400 in 1997.  The number to be assigned to the Navy has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>The EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.  The enforcement of the new control measures agreed in December 1995, is being examined in this context.  The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that Ireland will derive the maximum benefit from the available EU support.  The position in relation to the programme for 1997 is that Ireland's submission was passed to the Commission before the deadline of 30 June 1996 and provides for a down payment on an additional naval patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>Requests for proposals for the supply of a patrol vessel were advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Community</i>.  The deadline for receipt of proposals is 10 January 1997.  On the basis of the proposals received, a shortlist of suitable potential tenderers will be invited to tender.  It is anticipated the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the latter half of 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> The Commission will consider Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other member states and will decide before the end of January next on the level of funding to be made available to us in 1997.  Pending the implementation of the five year programme the Naval Service will continue to carry out its various roles using the existing seven patrol vessels, a number of which, it is expected, will be refurbished under the five year programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to increase the number of vessels available to the Naval Service as quickly as I can.  I am making a start this year by adding at least one vessel to the fleet.  I am also looking at the possibility that over a three year period we could increase that number to approximately ten, which would be three additional vessels.  We have advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Community</i> making a request for proposals.  It gives an idea of what new or second-hand vessels are available in the market that would suit our needs.  I am not happy that we have a sufficient number of vessels at present.  We are trying to address that situation but I ask the Deputy to take into account that we are living in an age of new technology.  We must not forget the benefits of the CASA aircraft flown by the Air Corps, which are placed at the disposal of the Naval Service for the purpose of passing on information.  Much can be done from the air through the use of new technology which feeds information to Haulbowline or directly to our naval vessels.  Therefore, instead of engaging in searches, vessels can be given exact directions to the site of an emergency.  We cannot ignore those advances.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service has a responsibility to serve the State.  If we are asked to perform further tasks on behalf of other Departments, there is an obligation on those Departments to support the Naval Service and the Department of Defence through the provision of resources.  In the interim, we shall endeavour to increase the numbers being recruited to the fleet as quickly as possible.  As a result of the review being carried out at present, we will ensure that the Naval Service has adequate personnel to carry out the duties expected of it and that no ship is confined to port because of a lack of such personnel.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the regulation to implement the recommendations in the Fishery Safety Report is not being put in force.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the fishing vessel safety review group is a most comprehensive and detailed document, containing 63 specific recommendations.  Some of these recommendations relate to the introduction of comprehensive regulations governing all aspects of fishing vessel safety.  However, it is clear that the making in isolation of such regulations would have little impact on safety practices in the fishing sector.  Much more fundamental changes are required.</P>
      <P>An intensive analysis of the report has been carried out in the Department of the Marine since it was published.  On this basis, the development of a new national policy on fishing vessel safety which takes account of the recommendations and objectives of the review group is now proposed.  I intend to seek Government approval in the near future to initiate this new strategy which is set out in a draft memorandum for the Government, which has been circulated to relevant Departments for their observations.  The overall aim of the proposed new policy is to achieve fundamental improvements in safety in the sea fishing sector with a view to reducing, to the greatest extent possible, fishing vessel casualties and, in particular, loss of life at sea.</P>
      <P>While it would be inappropriate to elaborate on the proposals contained in the memorandum in advance of its consideration by the Cabinet, it is clear that the pursuit of this new policy will require the putting in place of the necessary legislative framework, structures, administrative and technical capabilities and financial resources, including EU and Exchequer moneys.  I am totally committed to pursuing these resources and propose, in this regard, to seek additional allocations of Structural Funds, in the context of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework, to support the implementation of the review group's recommendations.  However, I emphasise that the success of any safety strategy for the fishing sector will, at the end of the day, primarily depend upon the full co-operation of the industry itself and a willingness on the part of individual fishermen to develop a safety culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the proposed comprehensive safety programme for the fishing sector will clearly need to be phased in over a period of time, a number of measures are already being implemented on <Col N="1102" /> foot of the report of the review group.  The Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are reviewing safety training requirements in light of the review group's recommendations in this area and, in that context, a newly refurbished mobile coastal training unit will be launched shortly.  This will bring training in the safe operation of fishing vessels directly to fishermen in ports around the coast.  Having regard to onshore radio communication facilities, the Department has placed orders for new medium frequency radio transmitters at Belmullet and Rosslare which will provide greater radio coverage and improve response to distress calls from fishermen off the north-west coast and in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>In July I established a marine safety working group which aims to increase safety awareness among seafarers, including fishermen.  The working group, which brings together representatives of various organisations having an active role in promoting marine safety, is to shortly issue a booklet containing guidelines to reduce machinery failure in fishing vessels, the main cause of emergencies involving such vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not sure when the Minister's reply would end but I thank him for providing such a comprehensive report.  I accept there is a need to introduce long-term and comprehensive legislative and other measures in this area.  However, I am concerned about the more intermediate steps required because each year the country is affected by tragic accidents at sea which decimate families.  I seek to ensure that interim measures be put in place and I welcome the establishment of the mobile training unit which will visit our fishing ports in the near future.  I urge the Minister to take the necessary steps to concentrate the minds of people in the industry on the action required, which includes satellite and identification.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an ageing fishing fleet.  Young people entering the business are purchasing old vessels and, because fish stocks are in decline, they must travel further out to sea where the risks are greater.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the necessary intermediary steps are put in place as soon as possible.  Perhaps some form of information kit on safety could be developed by the Department and sent to the regions so that there are no further tragedies during the interim period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about safety.  It is one of my priorities because a value cannot be placed on a person's life.  For that reason, speedy action has been taken in terms of training, awareness and using every opportunity to promote safety.  We are encouraging owners of fishing vessels and their employees to ensure that they are properly maintained and that the correct radio equipment is installed.  We must ensure that the staff of such vessels are trained in safety procedures.  I assure Deputy Smith that this <Col N="1103" /> process will be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Other fundamental issues must be taken into account.  The report of the fishing vessel safety review group, which is an independent report, states that the percentage of the Irish fleet made up of vessels over 30 years of age is slightly lower than the EU average; in the EU fleet as a whole 18,982 vessels are over 40 years of age and a further 16,664 vessels are between 30 and 40 years old.  The report indicates 39 per cent of vessels in the Spanish fleet are over 30 years old compared with 31 per cent of the UK fleet, 11 per cent of the French fleet and 24 per cent of the Irish fleet.</P>
      <P>We are told Spain has a modern fleet but 39 per cent of it is more than 30 years old.  Twenty four per cent of our fleet is more than 30 years old.  While I would love fishermen to have new boats the reality is that the 1,300 vessels in the Irish fleet will not be replaced with new vessels tomorrow morning, next year or the year after. Restructuring is taking place and we are providing funding for modernisation, particularly from the point of view of safety.  To date 133 applications for modernisation grants totalling approximately £4 million have been processed.</P>
      <P>Much work has been done and my priority is old and dangerous boats.  Unfortunately, a ten year old fishing vessel which has not been properly maintained could, sink.  There are a number of factors involved, for example, culture, the maintenance of boats, the viability of the industry and the training of staff, and it would be foolish to send out a signal that because there are new boats there will be no accidents.  This is not the case.  We need to encourage people to build up a safety culture.  In this context I am giving serious and positive consideration to the establishment of a training college in Castletownbere.  In the meantime the mobile unit will encourage people to think in terms of safety and to ensure they have proper radio equipment. At the same time it will look at ways of helping those people who want to buy a good second-hand or new boat.</P>
      <P>The Irish fleet is made up of the polyvalent and pelagic sectors.  We have the most modern pelagic sector in the world operating from Killybegs.  The bulk of the investment in this area came from private sources.  If the industry is viable people will invest in it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and I are trying to ensure there will be adequate fish stocks in the future so that the industry will be viable and banks etc. will be willing to lend money.  In the meantime I will do everything possible to ensure the introduction, even on a pilot basis, of new boats in the white fish sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No one on this side of the House suggested that 1,300 new boats could be purchased overnight.  We placed emphasis on the intermediate steps which can be taken and the <Col N="1104" /> necessary learning curve, to which no reference is made in some of the reports on tragic accidents, most of which could have been avoided through the implementation of even simple safety measures.  We are well aware that the necessary resources are not available to replace all boats overnight but we want the intermediate steps to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that any interim steps in the area of safety which can be taken will be taken.  Following a tragic accident on the east coast we put in place a 24 hour search and rescue helicopter service.  We are conscious of the need for safety and the necessity of having in place the resources to deal with tragedies, which unfortunately are likely to continue to occur in the future regardless of the measures one takes.  We hope to improve the 24 hour search and rescue helicopter service which operates from Baldonnel so that a comprehensive service is available throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99 provides funding for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, with more than £11 million of EU and Exchequer aid available to support total investment of some £31 million in the fleet over the period.  To date 131 vessel modernisation projects have been approved for grant aid of more than £4 million under the programme.</P>
      <P>The investment support strategy under the programme is designed to improve the quality, efficiency and safety of the fleet while meeting mandatory EU fleet targets.  The good take-up to date of available funding is contributing to those objectives.  There has also been significant private investment in the Irish pelagic fleet in recent years which is now one of the most modern in the world.  The scope for expansion of the fishing fleet will continue to be influenced by existing constraints and challenges in terms of fishing opportunities for quota and non-quota species, market factors and economic considerations.</P>
      <P>I am currently giving detailed consideration to the future direction of fleet policy.  A consultancy study has been commissioned to analyse, from all perspectives, the relative socio-economic and commercial merits of the introduction of new vessels into the whitefish fleet.  The outcome of this study will inform an assessment of future directions for fleet policy having regard to all relevant factors including developments at EU level.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Is the Minister aware that only 6 per cent of the registered fishing fleet is less than ten years old?  There is a need to bring this into line with our EU counterparts where approximately 15 per cent of vessels are less than ten years old.  Many fishermen have told me they do not qualify for grant aid under the refurbishment scheme because of the age of their boats.  Will the Minister make the scheme more flexible?  Does he intend to introduce a new scheme to allow for the purchase of second-hand boats of five years or less or to substantially increase the grant aid for the purchase of new boats?  Many fishermen do not have the necessary resources to purchase new boats and they need substantially increased grant aid.  Does the Minister intend to move in that direction through the EU?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have commissioned a consultancy study to analyse from all perspectives, the relative socio-economic and commercial merits of the introduction of new vessels into the white fish fleet.  This study is near completion and should be available in January.  I recently met the Irish Fishermen's Federation to discuss the possibility of introducing a pilot project.  I gave a commitment to consider such a project and I am doing so at present.</P>
      <P>On the question of grants for the refurbishment of old vessels, this is dealt with by BIM.  If a boat is beyond repair and should not be in the fleet then grant aid will not be of any assistance.  It would be unwise to allocate scarce funding for the refurbishment of such boats.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Operational Programme for Fisheries, unfortunately the people who made the decisions decided to allocate £11 million only for modernisation and new purchases.  The sum of £11 million will not go very far in this respect and in the mid-term review I will seek additional funds which I am convinced can be used wisely, particularly in reducing the number of boats over ten years old and more.  This is the area on which we must concentrate and I will do everything possible to provide assistance in this regard.</P>

      <P>Places in the cadet school are not reserved for serving members of the Defence Forces.  While places in the cadet school are not reserved for particular categories of candidates, it is open to eligible members of the Defence Forces to apply for a cadetship.  However, members of the Permanent Defence Force who have 12 months' full time service may qualify for <Col N="1106" /> an extension of the upper age limit from 21 to 24 years.  Similarly, members of the Reserve Defence Force who have 18 months' full time service may also qualify for an extension of the upper age limit to 23 years.  In addition, members of the Defence Forces who have 12 months' service qualify for an additional 6 per cent of the marks available at the final interview stage of the selection procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>People are not recommended for positions in the cadet school.  If a person qualifies, he applies like anyone else.  However, the upper age limit for a serving member of the Defence Forces with 12 months' experience has been extended from 21 to 24.  The normal age for anyone else applying for the cadet school is 18 to 21.  If the person gets through to the final interview, an additional 6 per cent of the marks are available for those who have served in the Defence Forces.  This is the advantage of being a member of the Defence Forces and applying for a cadetship.</P>
      <P>In addition, non-commissioned officers are assigned to potential officers courses as distinct from the cadetship.  If a person is a non-commissioned officer who has obtained certain standards, he can be selected to do a potential officers course and then be commissioned.  Over the past five years 27 enlisted personnel were appointed to commissioned rank on successful completion of the potential officers course.  I am considering introducing another such course, but it has been delayed because of the VER scheme and the implementation plan to see how that works out in terms of the number of officers at different rank level.</P>

      <P>I have made it clear that men and women will be treated equally in terms of their application and selection and that they will be trained in the same way and receive the same opportunities as anyone else.  Recruting women to the Naval Service is a major step forward despite the fact that ships are not fully equipped for women.  I am certain women who apply and are successful in the interviewing process will be as good as anyone else.  As I said before, women are capable of looking after themselves on board ships or anywhere else.  I am proud that the basis for selection is suitability rather than gender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>In 1996 four applications were received from three non-governmental aid agencies for the secondment of military personnel to assist in their relief efforts.  The applications were made by Trócaire, GOAL and HMD International and were in respect of varying periods of secondment. At present one member of the Permanent Defence Force is on secondment to Trócaire for service overseas with that organisation.  Last month Trócaire submitted a further request for the release of four military personnel to assist with its emergency programme in Rwanda and Zaire.  However, in view of the rapidly changing position in that area, the number that will be actually required is unclear and discussions with Trócaire are ongoing.</P>
      <P>GOAL has requested the services of an officer to work in its Dublin office and the necessary arrangements towards facilitating that request are being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year I approved a proposal to <Col N="1110" /> release up to 15 military personnel to HMD International to take part in a hospital rehabilitation programme in Angola.  The selection of suitable volunteers for the programme is ongoing and some details regarding the terms of their secondment are also under negotiation with the aid agency concerned.</P>
    <P>Other requests from aid agencies for the services of members of the Defence Forces will be fully considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The secondment of a member of the Defence Forces to GOAL's Dublin office would be unusual.  Will the Minister comment on that matter?  Have the personnel seconded this year special expertise in areas that will benefit non-governmental organisations?  Some years ago people were seconded because of their knowledge of languages and their legal expertise. Have the personnel concerned other expertise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>NGOs want people with particular skills.  The skills of two doctors, including a surgeon, two nurses, a laboratory technician, an engineer, four tradesmen, two line officers, a cook and a fitter were required for the project initiated by HMD International in Angola. Certain skills are necessary for such projects. While we pay the normal salary and allowances to personnel while on secondment, we do not force them to go on secondment.</P>
      <P>In 1995 13 officers were seconded to GOAL, two non-commissioned personnel were seconded to Trócaire and one to Concern.  The number of personnel seconded depends on the projects being initiated and the type of skills required.  The training received by members of the Defence Forces benefits those who serve in a humanitarian way, by organising food supplies and so on, in such countries.  Their experience on UN missions and in peacekeeping operations is also attractive to non-governmental organisations.</P>
      <P>I do not have information on the type of skills requested by Trócaire, but officers who volunteer to go on secondment are interested in assisting the work of NGOs and their training and experience in the Defence Forces will be of great benefit.</P>
      <P>I will contact GOAL about its request for an officer in its Dublin office.  It may involve clerical or managerial skills.  I will communicate with the Deputy in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>All personnel continue to receive their normal pay and allowances during their period of secondment.  Other costs, such as transport, insurance, additional allowances and so on, are a matter for the agency concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost of ministerial air transport service to date in 1996 is £1.8 <Col N="1112" /> million.  The figure is based on the cost to date of the air taxi service currently in operation, with the direct cost of using the Gulfstream and Beech Super King Air 200 for ministerial transport. These direct costs include the cost of maintenance, fuel and support services arising from the use of the aircraft in question.  The details of the flights so far this year are in the form of tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The air taxi service was taken on board because of the Presidency.  I presume it will cease when we hand over the Presidency.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has regarding the setting up of an An Slua Muirí unit in Dundalk, County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21542/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The first phase of the Government's plan for the reorganisation and restructuring of the Defence Forces is taking place.  An implementation plan, covering the years 1996 to 1998, was prepared on foot of recommendations made by the efficiency audit group which undertook a comprehensive review of the Defence Forces.  As part of the implementation process a review of the reserve Defence Force, which consists of the FCA and An Slua Muirí, will commence in 1997.  Some preliminary work in connection with this review has already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the reserve Defence Force will be comprehensive and will recommend the future organisation and structure of the reserve.  The <Col N="1129" /> Deputy will appreciate that, in the circumstances, reorganisation or expansion of An Slua Muirí must await the outcome of that review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the grave uncertainty in the FCA and An Slua Muirí and its tradition of serving communities throughout the country, will the Minister allow them to develop or has he accepted the original Price Waterhouse review to halve those organisations?  Can he not allow them to develop naturally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of allowing either of those organisations to be interfered with to any great extent.  I acknowledge the voluntary work carried out by members of the FCA and An Slua Muirí.  Their work is of great benefit to the country and to the members of those organisations.  It would be a foolish Government that would do anything other than encourage our reserve forces.</P>
      <P>My proposals will not prevent the expansion of either organisation.  They form part of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  We must deal with the Permanent Defence Force initially and then ascertain how to revitalise the FCA and An Slua Muirí.  I will do everything possible to promote both those organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not contradictory to advocate the expansion of An Slua Muirí and the FCA while at the same time proposing to restrict their development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not find it contradictory. The reality is that if one is to have the FCA and Slua Muirí, one must have the support back-up for both organisations and, because of the current review, that back-up may have to alter.  It is only for that reason there would be any delay in setting up a new organisation.</P>
      <P>I am always prepared to listen to reason.  If Deputy Dermot Ahern, who tabled this question, has some ideas, I would be delighted to have them examined in detail and come back to him because I respect the great work done by both organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If I heard the Minister correctly, he is showing that there is some light.  He may relent in excluding the possibility of setting up a Slua Muirí unit in Dundalk, County Louth, quite apart from the overall review of which he spoke. Will the Minister accept that this overall review has been taking place for some considerable time; that there are people in the area willing to give their time to this unit if it is set up and that this proposal has been around for some time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If we set up a new Slua Muirí company, it will be necessary to assign a number of naval service personnel to it on a full-time basis.  However, I will examine the matter and I will report back to the Deputy.  I must also be conscious of requests from other parts of the <Col N="1130" /> country so the Deputy will appreciate that the whole matter must be examined together.</P>

      <Quest>the total amount of money spent on research on fish stock assessment by his Department in 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding of £1,464,030 was provided in the 1996 Estimates to cover the cost of fish stock assessment programmes by the Fisheries Research Centre which is now an integral part of the Marine Institute.  Thirty-two persons are employed on this work.</P>
      <P>The FRC maintains research programmes on 44 stocks of fish and shellfish of key economic interest to the Irish fishing industry, including mackerel, herring, cod, whiting, monkfish, prawns and shrimps.</P>
      <P>Fish stock assessment programmes are carried out through catch data collected on an ongoing basis by FRC scientists and technicians at fishing ports.  Coverage under the national sampling programme has been considerably enhanced in recent years with EU funding support.  Seagoing surveys are also a crucial component of the assessment work by giving a cross-check on stock size and the abundance of juvenile fish.  The FRC has carried out 16 seagoing surveys to date in 1996.  Of these, five were on chartered commercial fishing vessels, eight on the national research vessel <i>Lough Beltra,</i> and four on the Northern Ireland research vessel <i>Lough Foyle.</i> The co-operation of the fishing industry in these programmes is a critical factor in their success.</P>
      <P>Other current projects under way in the FRC which have obtained EU funding support include the investigation of new fisheries resources in the deep waters west of Ireland, mapping of herring spawning grounds and work on alternative methods of scientific stock assessment.  FRC scientists collaborate closely with EU and international colleagues in the work of joint scientific assessments of many of the fish stocks which are spread over a wide geographic area. This work is carried out under the aegis of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea which reports annually on the state of the fish stocks to governments, the EU Commission and international fisheries organisations.  This international scientific advice underpins and informs ongoing management and conservation decisions taken by EU Ministers and, notably, the annual process of setting total allowable catches and quotas for each stock for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At national level we are applying a significant amount of resources to fisheries research and the efficiency and effectiveness of those programmes is being kept under review.  At EU level, there is recognition of the need for further improvement and development of fisheries research and the Council of Minister agreed earlier this year to <Col N="1131" /> give renewed priority to improved fisheries data collection and to encourage better co-operation and co-ordination between member states, their scientists and the fishing industry itself.  The prudent management of fisheries and then sustainable development depends very considerably on the quality and quantity of scientific and research input.  My policy objective, therefore, both nationally and at EU level, is to support and encourage an effective fisheries research capability in the interests of the fishing industry and the fisheries resource itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that I have received a copy of a submission from the &ldquo;Save Our Sea Trout&rdquo; group.  I am glad to have this opportunity to address the assertions made by this group.</P>
      <P>The Irish salmon farming component of the aquaculture industry makes a significant contribution in terms of jobs and economic activity in coastal communities.  The salmon farming sector now directly employs 900 people, with another 1100 jobs in associated industries.  It has a current annual output of over 12,000 tonnes worth £39 million, of which 8,000 tonnes worth £26 million was exported in 1995.  In addition to creating direct employment salmon farming also supports a significant level of jobs and economic added value in the processing sector and other downstream activities.</P>
      <P>The impact of salmon farming on the environment and <i>vice versa</i> and its interaction with other users of the marine resource is a subject of ongoing debate and analysis.  Salmon farming is itself affected by other activities and depends fundamentally on a clean environment. Contrary to the views expressed by SOS, this industry is controlled, regulated and sustainable.</P>
      <P>National and EU research generally has concluded that there is more risk of disease passing from wild stocks to fish farms.  In addition, the control of disease outbreaks in farmed stocks through improved husbandry, appropriate systemic treatments, reduction of stocking densities and effective disease management will, in any event, reduce any risk of transmission to the wild.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research management and conservation programmes in place to address the problem of seatrout declines is ongoing.  Sea lice monitoring, control and reporting programmes on salmon farms have been put in place in line with the <Col N="1132" /> practical framework of action recommended in the Sea Trout Task Force Report.  These programmes are fully monitored and overseen by the Sea Trout Monitoring and Advisory Group which is chaired by Dr. Emer Colleran and represents sea trout fishery interests, salmon farmers and relevant State agencies.  Significant financial and other resources are also being devoted to the research, rehabilitation and restocking of sea trout fisheries and this considerable commitment is paying demonstrable dividends.</P>
    <P>The parasite Gyrodactylis salanis, which is not present in Ireland, was transferred and spread in Scandinavian rivers through restocking programmes as opposed to fish farming.  There are specific Community restrictions in place, spearheaded by Ireland and the UK, to prevent the spread of the parasite to Community areas not currently affected.</P>
    <P>SOS statements about adverse environmental effects of salmon farms are inaccurate and outdated.  I am advised that the effects of fish farming on water quality and sediment ecosystems in Irish coastal waters, where they occur, are temporary, localised and reversible.</P>
    <P>There is no scientific evidence linking salmon farms to &ldquo;red tides&rdquo; which are naturally occurring marine algal blooms resulting from specific geographical and hydrographical conditions.</P>
    <P>One of the key benefits of our policies has been the recognition by European consumer markets &mdash; notably the discerning German market &mdash; of Irish farmed salmon as a quality &ldquo;green&rdquo; product commanding a price premium over its competitors with resultant market benefits for Irish salmon farmers.  This has helped to offset the acknowledged serious difficulties caused by low price oversupply of the EU market by Norwegian producers.</P>
    <P>The Irish salmon farming industry, and the Irish aquaculture industry as a whole, is not only capable of but deserves support for further incremental and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The Bill which I will introduce in Seanad Éireann this week is designed to provide the necessary legislative framework to underpin and regulate the future sustainable development of the Irish aquaculture industry, with full regard for the needs of the industry and all other interests.  I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on the future of the aquaculture industry and I hope that this reply to the House will help to bring the necessary level of objectivity and perspective to that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a very balanced answer.  In view of the fact that the Norwegians produce about 300,000 tonnes of farm fish and the Scots produce about 60,000 tonnes, Ireland's operational programme hoped to double production from about 12,000 or 13,000 tonnes to 24,000 or 25,000 tonnes.  When does the Minister of State consider we will be back on <Col N="1133" /> track in regard to achieving that target in view of the delay because of the necessity to designate areas through legislation?  Can we get the 1997 programme off the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The target set under the Operational Programme was 19,000 tonnes, not 24,000 tonnes.  I am satisfied that can be met by 1999, the target date set under the Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the Norwegian supply is being addressed in two ways, through the European Union where we have expressed our increasing concern about the over supply to the European market of the Norwegian product and by developing and promoting the Irish product as a niche quality produced under high environmental standards.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the development of fishing facilities on our rivers and lakes is vested in the Central Fisheries Board and in the seven regional fisheries boards which are independent bodies established under the Fisheries Acts.  In particular, the development of fisheries in the Border region is a matter for the northern, shannon and eastern fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>While I have no function in the day-to-day development of fisheries the fisheries boards are obliged in their development plans to have regard to general policy objectives established for the inland fisheries sector.  The overall policy objective for that sector is to ensure this valuable natural resource is conserved, managed and developed to support sustainable economic activity and job creation based on the resource.</P>
      <P>I have identified the inland fisheries sector as one which has particular potential for the development of tourism in the Border area. Accordingly, I have made available on an annual basis through the Central Fisheries Board to the regional fisheries boards operating in the Border area, significant amounts of money for development as follows:</P>

    <P>The Deputy may be aware that in addition to the provision for development in their annual estimates, the regional fisheries boards as well as other private and public fishery interests can avail <Col N="1134" /> of the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism.  This measure, supported by the European Regional Development Fund and administered by the Central Fisheries Board, provides for a comprehensive investment programme in the tourism angling product totalling almost £19 million over the six year period to the end of 1999.  Investment of almost £4 million under this measure has been earmarked for projects in the Border area.  The extent to which this indicative investment is realised will depend on the number, eligibility and quality of projects submitted.  To date, projects totalling almost £0.5 million in the Border area have been approved.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that £2.5 million has been provided for fisheries projects under the fisheries measure of the INTERREG II programme.  A total of £1.7 million of this has been allocated to the Erne Salmon Rehabilitation Programme launched in September 1996.  The objective of it, under which £1.7 million is to be invested in the period to the end of 1999, is to restore the Erne to its former glory as one of the premier salmon fisheries in Europe.</P>
    <P>The development of inland fisheries is also eligible for funding under the Cross-Border Development Sub-programme of the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. I understand two projects totalling £875,000 have been submitted by the fisheries boards under this sub-programme and are undergoing evaluation and assessment under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance and personnel in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree there were great expectations under the Operational Programme, INTERREG and other programmes, but practically nothing has been given to the Border counties?  I raised this matter with the Minister of State on numerous occasions. While it is all very well to talk about the allocation of £1.7 million under the INTERREG programme, most of that money was allocated to a salmon hatchery in Ballyshannon.  Is the Minister of State also aware that in 1994 when those schemes were announced the tourism body in Monaghan submitted a long list of lakes for development, not one of which has benefited under them.  We have been told that may happen in 1997.  That is disappointing and I ask that this be taken in hand.  The Minister of State has claimed he does not have full responsibility for this area, but he certainly has responsibility for it from a policy point of view and policy in this area has not been conducive to developing the lakes in the Border counties.</P>

      <P>Almost £1.5 million per year is spent by the fisheries board in fisheries development in the Border counties, £0.5 million has been allocated under the tourism angling measure for projects in the Border region, £1.7 million has been committed through the Erne waterways project, the salmon rehabilitation programme, and there are two projects under the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation estimated to cost £875,000, currently under examination.</P>
      <P>Regarding projects for County Monaghan, as I indicated earlier, the extent to which projects can be funded depends on their eligibility and the quality of projects submitted.  The Central Fisheries Board, which has overall responsibility and a unit that deals with those applications, would be happy to assist the promoters of the projects concerned and to advise and guide them on qualifying for the funds available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware I have already responded to a question from Deputy Smith concerning the implementation of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group.  I explained that following intensive analysis of the report of the review group in the Department of the Marine a new national policy on fishing vessel safety is being developed.  This takes account of the recommendations and objectives of the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to seek Government approval to initiate this new strategy which is set out in a draft memorandum for the government which has been circulated to relevant Departments for their observations.  The overall aim of the proposed new policy is to achieve fundamental <Col N="1136" /> improvements in safety in the sea fishing sector with a view to reducing, to the greatest extent possible, fishing vessel casualties and, in particular, loss of life at sea.</P>
    <P>While the proposed comprehensive safety programme for the fishing sector will clearly need to be phased in over a period, a number of measures are already being implemented on foot of the report of the review group.</P>
    <P>The Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara are reviewing safety training requirements in light of the review group's recommendations in this area and in that context a newly refurbished mobile coastal training unit will be launched shortly which will bring training in the safe operation of fishing vessels directly to fishermen in ports around the coast.</P>
    <P>Having regard to onshore radio communication facilities, the Department has placed orders for new medium frequency radio transmitters at Belmullet and Rosslare which will provide greater radio coverage and improve response to distress calls from fishermen off the north west coast and in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>In July I established a Marine Safety Working Group which aims to increase safety awareness among seafarers, including fishermen.  This working group, which brings together representatives of various organisations having an active role in promoting marine safety, is to shortly issue a booklet containing guidelines to reduce machinery failure in fishing vessels, the main cause of emergency incidents involving such vessels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad a working group has been set up, a strategy is being developed and a booklet produced but is the Minister satisfied with the speed of reaction to the safety review group's report?  What issues are stalling implementation of its recommendations?  When will they be implemented in full?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what has been said, I am satisfied action is being taken on all fronts.  For practical reasons, we have advanced on some more than others.  The summary of recommendations shows that progress on many of them is dependent on the outcome of the mid-term review of Structural Funds which will not take place until 1997.  The group recommended that we seek additional funds which it recognised are necessary.</P>
      <P>Work is being done at a professional level on other matters, including radio communications, and much progress is being made.  We have been in consultation with BIM.  A great deal of emphasis is placed in the programme on the need for training while booklets will be issued to make fishermen more aware of the need for safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of fleet renewal, criticism has been expressed.  I explained in detail what is being done.  I am trying to secure the introduction into the fleet of as many new fishing vessels as I can.  In 1994 when the operational programme <Col N="1137" /> was drawn up we were given £11 million for fleet modernisation and renewal.  That will not take us very far.</P>
    <P>Where possible, action will be taken immediately.  It will take time, however, to implement some of the recommendations while progress on others is dependent on the industry taking the necessary precautions in the maintenance of vessels.  Any regulations introduced would have to be adhered to.  If a fishing vessel goes down and lives are lost, it will be too late to do anything about it.  Checks would have to be carried out to ensure they are being complied with.</P>
    <P>The report was issued only six months ago. Coming from County Donegal, the Deputy will appreciate we are seeking to rectify something that has been happening for many years where habits have been developed.  Unfortunately, people do not pay enough attention to the need for safety measures and safe practices.  There is a need for education and to establish mobile units to raise standards.  A school has been opened in Castletownbere.  There is a similar school in Greencastle.  I hope new entrants to the industry will bring a fresh approach and will be conscious of the need for safety and to properly maintain vessels and machinery.  In the process many lives should be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>When one considers there are vessels in the fleet between 35 and 50 years old and it has been described as dilapidated, the matter must be considered urgent.  Can the Minister give an assurance that money will be made available in the Estimates for fleet renewal?  What are the chances of obtaining funds in the mid-term review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>When I had discussions recently with the Irish Fishermen's Federation I undertook to consider the introduction of a pilot project.  As the Deputy knows, we have the most modern pelagic fleet in the world, the bulk of which was provided through private investment as an attractive investment.  Other structural aspects have to be looked at as investment in new boats alone will not solve the problem.  The pelagic fleet is the perfect example.  I will do everything I can to secure the introduction of new vessels into the fleet as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The report contains a fascinating statistic: 39 per cent of the vessels in the Spanish fleet, which we are often told is the most modern in Europe, are more than 30 years old.  Twenty four per cent of the vessels in the Irish fleet are more than 30 years old.</P>

Those engaged in the fishing industry will incur considerable costs in implementing some of them.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I avail of this opportunity to convey my sincere sympathy to the health care worker in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, and her family.  I know the House will join me in that expression of sympathy.  Before addressing the specific issues raised by the Deputies I would like to give a background in regard to HIV infected blood.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board &mdash; BTSB &mdash; is of the view that the earliest date of infection by HIV of blood in Ireland was probably 1981.  No screening test was available until 1985 &mdash; that was introduced in October 1985.  Since then all blood donated to the BTSB has been screened for HIV and all donations found to be positive are discarded.  I have been informed by the BTSB that since October 1985 until the present date a total of 24 donors have been diagnosed as positive.  However, eight of these were first time donors and, accordingly, no risk of HIV transmission to recipients was involved in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be helpful if, in regard to the 16 repeat donors, I were to give details of the years in which the infected donations were first screened as <Col N="1139" /> positive.  They are: 1985, two; 1986, two; 1987, two; 1988, nil; 1989, one; 1990, one; 1991, one; 1992, two; 1993, three; 1994, two; 1995, nil and 1996 to date, nil, giving a total of 16.  In the case of nine of the 16 donors, recipients of products regarded as being at risk were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.  Eight of these donations were post-1989 and one was pre-1989.</P>
    <P>A difficulty arose in regard to tracing the recipients of the products produced from the donations of the remaining seven donors. Dispatch records in the BTSB in Pelican House are not available in respect of the period prior to 1986.  The BTSB has informed me that there were 31 possible infected issues prepared for recipients from these seven donations.  Of these 31 issues, 15 were donated prior to 1980 and are, therefore, not regarded as a potential source of infection. One of the 16 issues was transfused to the health care worker identified this weekend in St. Luke's, Kilkenny.  It would appear, therefore, that concern now arises in relation to a maximum of 15 recipients.</P>
    <P>I would like to revert to what I understand happened subsequent to the introduction of the screening test in 1985.  In the period between 1985 and 1989 no lookback was undertaken in respect of earlier donations made by donors who now screened positive.  However, their donations were not used and they were advised to contact their general practitioner for further assessment and counselling.  From 1989 onwards the BTSB had a lookback procedure in place for newly presenting positive donors.  There were a small number of people, however, for whom a normal lookback could not be carried out because their donations related to the period prior to 1986 in respect of which dispatch records were not available.</P>
    <P>When the new management was appointed to the board of the BTSB in April 1995 it identified a considerable volume of problems which had to be addressed, including the maintenance of confidence in the blood supply, the work associated with the screening for hepatitis C, with the legal cases, particularly the McCole case, and with the restructuring of the organisation.  It also identified the issue of conducting a full lookback in regard to HIV as one of the items which needed to be addressed.  The issue was addressed in some detail by the scientific committee of the board in May 1996, legal advice with regard to the duty of care was obtained in August 1996 and in the absence of dispatch records 45 hospitals were contacted with details of the numbers of the batches which were regarded as potentially infected.  Since then 14 hospitals have responded and three of the batches have been identified.  All of these three related to donations prior to 1980 and therefore did not pose a threat.  The board has now intensified its efforts to work with hospitals to identify the recipients of the remaining issues.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the specific questions raised by the Deputy.  I was aware of the <Col N="1140" /> reference to the introduction of HIV testing and the discovery that one of the plasma donors for the anti-D programme was HIV positive in paragraphs 3.12 and 4.15 of the Report of the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board, published in April 1995.  That report indicated that the problem which arose was fully investigated at the time and that all products prepared from the plasma donated by the donor concerned still in use were withdrawn when the observation was made.  PCR analysis of the product was found to be negative and it was furthermore concluded that the production method was effective in removing the viral material.  Subsequent to that, while I was generally aware, in the context of hepatitis C lookback programmes, of difficulties in the BTSB with regard to the absence of certain dispatch records, I was not made aware of specific difficulties in relation to batches of blood infected with HIV until Monday, 9 December when I was briefed in the context of the incident which occurred in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, it has been aware of the general arrangements made by the BTSB in regard to the screening of donors since its introduction in 1985.  In the context of the publication of the review group report in April 1995, correspondence took place between my Department and the BTSB which incorporated an outline of the protocol adopted by the BTSB for the prevention of HIV transmission by transfusion.  The question of a comprehensive lookback was addressed by the scientific committee of the BTSB in May 1996 and the steps I have outlined were taken.</P>
    <P>The Deputies have asked if I will initiate a national screening programme for those who receive blood transfusions and who could be at risk.  I have already supported the BTSB in the introduction of a targeted lookback in regard to hepatitis C and also a national optional testing programme.  I am not in a position to take a decision on whether it would be appropriate to introduce a programme as the Deputies suggest. I have asked the Blood Transfusion Service Board to let me have, as a matter of extreme urgency, an assessment of how successful it thinks it will be in tracing the recipients of the donations which are regarded as potentially infected, following its intensification of the search being undertaken by hospitals.  In this case I have offered the full support and involvement of my Department so that the co-operation of hospitals is unstinting.  On the basis of the board's assessment of the position and an examination of the residual risk, I hope to be in a position to make an informed decision with regard to an optional testing programme at an early date.  If I believe it is correct to do so, I will not hesitate to have the necessary arrangements put in place.</P>
    <P>I would like again to avail of this opportunity to put on record my sincere sympathy to the health care worker involved.  I would also like to endorse the statement of support made by the <Col N="1141" /> chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board at yesterday evening's press conference.  It is a matter of great regret to all of us that this incident has arisen and I assure the House I will do everything possible to reduce further risk arising from infected blood donated before it was possible to have it screened for infection.</P>

      <P>I wish to put on record my party's sincere sympathy for the health care worker in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, who has been infected by a blood product from the Blood Transfusion Service Board, and to her family and relatives.  Does the Minister find it extraordinary that he was not made aware of specific difficulties in regard to batches of blood with HIV infection until 9 December?  When was the Department informed and why did it not start a national screening programme in 1994 for people who might have received HIV infected blood product?  Such a programme was introduced for hepatitis C victims.  If memory serves me right, the Minister told the House at the time that he sought the advice of the Attorney General, who recommended that that should be done.  Is there a difference between the two infections or was the Attorney General's advice not sought on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As Deputies are aware, these are very sensitive issues.  We are all familiar with the issue of hepatitis C and other hepatitis infections.  We have residual memories of the difficulties with HIV-AIDS in the 1980s, which, thank God, are not present now.  I am informed by my Department that the unfortunate health care worker in Kilkenny is the first person in Ireland infected with HIV as a result of infected blood.  Over the years 1,600 HIV cases have been identified in this country and a blood transfusion was produced in only one instance as the primary risk factor.  When traced, that transfusion had been administered abroad.  I want to put this matter in context so that people are not scared about what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the work already done by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, it has established that we are talking about a maximum of 15 recipients. I stress a maximum of 15 recipients because, as Deputies will be aware, people who go to hospital can get more than one issue of blood.  Those issues could come from different batches but there is a possibility that we are talking about 15 issues rather than 15 people.  Furthermore, all the infected blood we are discussing was infected prior to 1985 because screening was introduced in 1985.  If a donor was screened out, say, in 1987, it does not follow that when his blood was used in 1983 it was infected because the HIV could have occurred between the two donations.  That is what we must examine.  In attempting to track this maximum of 15 persons we have to go through the hospital system, but if we are unable to identify persons with potential infection through <Col N="1142" /> an examination of the hospital records, I will again consider the type of national voluntary screening programme that I brought in successfully in respect of hepatitis C.  While I have not yet had time to consult the Attorney General I will do so and I will be surprised if his advice will be other than that which I received in the previous instance in terms of our duty of care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to the question posed by me in my Private Notice Question, namely, when were the Minister and the Department first made aware of this problem in relation to a potential HIV infected blood product in the blood bank?  We know from the Minister's statement today that it was only on 9 December he was briefed in relation to this risk of HIV infection through transfusions.  Why has it taken 11 years for this matter to come into the public arena and for the BTSB to disclose the fact that it knew in 1985 there was a problem in relation to the presence of HIV infection in the blood bank?  Could it be that the same level of reckless incompetence was shown in relation to this matter as is now unfolding in the tribunal of inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I regard this as a serious issue.  I am simply explaining that the level of risk in terms of numbers is very significantly lower than the risk in terms of numbers in respect of hepatitis C.  There are a maximum of 15 persons and one can qualify that subsequently but in a downward way.  In terms of being directly aware of an incidence of HIV in blood, it came to my attention arising from the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report which referred to one particular donor whose plasma was shown to have HIV but the manufactured product from his plasma, anti-D, was tested for HIV and found to be negative. Of course, like every person, both here and internationally, who has a passing knowledge of this problem, I knew there was a possibility when testing was introduced in 1985 that there was infected blood in the system prior to 1985.  That is not a revelation; everybody knows that and that is the reason testing was introduced here and elsewhere.  Such a possibility always existed.  In regard to the problem with records from 1985 to 1989 and the potentially traceable transfusions in the system prior to 1985, I did not know that until 9 December.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated, as did the Blood Transfusion Service Board in its press release, that dispatch records could not be located and therefore people could not be traced in the normal way.  Will the Minister agree there was an obligation on the Blood Transfusion Service Board to set up a programme to identify those who had been placed at risk, particularly given the nature of HIV?  The Minister told us in August that 45 hospitals were contacted by the Blood Transfusion Service Board but only 14 of those hospitals had responded.  Does the Minister <Col N="1143" /> not think that in that four month period alarm bells should have rung in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, particularly in view of the saga that has unfolded over two years with the BTSB in respect of a related blood contamination? Will the Minister agree it is not sufficient for a Minister of Health to be told that a public statement is about to be made by a health board to the effect that such a difficulty arises in the Blood Transfusion Service Board in relation to blood contamination?  What does the Minister intend to do about that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is a problem from which a number of questions arise but while, at a level of principle, it is as serious as the hepatitis C issue, the numbers at risk are quite small.  The new people who went in to run the Blood Transfusion Service Board concentrated first on reorganising the board, ensuring there was confidence in the blood supply and that everything was being done to best practice.  They then concentrated on the hepatitis C case and the legal issues arising from that.  They informed me that they knew there was a residual problem and they began to address that in May and have continued to address it since then.  The Deputy asked me what I intended to do.  I have asked the people in the Blood Transfusion Service Board for an even fuller report.  I will give them my full support to ensure that hospitals comply with the requests being made.  If there is a residual difficulty, I will consider again setting up an optional testing programme for persons deemed to be at risk.  We must not scare people when the best information currently available to me indicates that while the risk is real, it applies to a very small number of people.</P>
      <P>On the question of the absence of records, I knew there was a difficulty with records in the context of the hepatitis C look back programmes; we have had that conversation in this House on several occasions.  The difficulty arises in the dispatch record.  While there is a batch number on the blood transfusions sent to hospitals, there is an absence of information on the hospital to which the transfusion was sent.  There are records &mdash; very good in some hospitals, not so good in others, particularly some of the Dublin hospitals &mdash; for the 1980s but it is the record indicating the destination of the blood, which goes with the dispatch record, which causes the problem.  That is the reason all hospitals had to be contacted with a list of batch numbers.  They have been asked to go through their records to see if they can match them up and identify the persons involved.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister when this intensification started?  The batch numbers were sent to the various hospitals to see if they could be traced but why did it take 11 years for those batch numbers to be sent to hospitals when the BTSB knew about this problem since 1985?  I <Col N="1144" /> ask the Minister for a third time when he or his Department were made aware of this problem in relation to HIV infected blood.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I cannot explain the reason nothing happened between 1985 and 1989 or whether it was due to the absence of records.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board introduced testing in 1985, the same time it was introduced internationally; there is no discrepancy in that regard.  It was only in 1989 that they began to look back under the screening programme on donors who proved to be infected. There is a residual problem now which amounts to a maximum of 15 people but, when the qualifications are brought into that figure of 15, the actual risk is significantly less than that.  I was informed yesterday, 9 December of the detail of this, and I am told by my officials that the Department of Health was informed on 8 December about this case.</P>

      <P>How long does the Minister think it acceptable for 31 hospitals not to respond to a serious request from the Blood Transfusion Service Board in relation to HIV-infected blood?  How can the Blood Transfusion Service Board justify its claim that most of those who received potentially infected blood transfusions before 1985 would have died from their underlying illness?  That sounds like a repeat of what we heard in relation to hepatitis C.  Is the Minister seriously asking us to believe that the Blood Transfusion Service Board did not, at any time since 1985, advise the Department of Health that there was such a problem?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In respect of the notification of hospitals, my reaction was the same as the Deputy's when it came to my attention.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board has contacted all hospitals by telephone, and an urgent search of the records is being carried out to see if the batch numbers can be matched.</P>
      <P>I cannot vouch for what happened in the past. This only came up in the Hederman-O'Brien report in respect of one case where plasma was used for the manufacture of anti-D product.  The general issue did not arise.  The advice to me always was that we did not have a HIV problem in Ireland from blood.  Approximately 1,600 people are infected with HIV.  When they were tested, only one indicated that blood was a risk factor, and that person received the blood transfusion in another European country.  The Kilkenny case is the first case of infection from blood.  In my time as Minister for Health, in 1995 and 1996, no donor tested positive.  I presume that if donors tested positive for HIV I would have been informed.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that if it had not been for the public-spirited actions of the nurse who has been tragically infected through no fault of her own but through the <Col N="1145" /> possible negligence of the State yet again, this matter would not have come into the public domain, and that the actions now being taken in an urgent fashion have only come about because of her action?  Will the Minister comment on the BTSB statement last night in which it claimed that most of the people who received potentially infected blood transfusions before 1985 &ldquo;would have died from their underlying illness&rdquo;?  How can the BTSB say that in relation to persons whom they have not yet been able to trace?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It was the identification of the health worker in Kilkenny that brought this into the public domain. However, almost six months ago the BTSB had started the process of checking with hospitals arising from a meeting of their scientific committee in May last year.  I do not know how far or how exact matching will be, but at the outside we are looking at 15 possible cases.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked why the BTSB spoke last night in terms of a number of these persons being dead.  I understand there is a rule of thumb in hospitals and in the Blood Transfusion Service Board that five years after transfusion up to 50 per cent of recipients are dead.  It was a statistic which the board used to indicate that people die from underlying causes.  I am not using the statistic.  I do not know whether or how many persons who received blood between 1980 and 1985 are dead, but it is a fact of hospital life that some would have died from underlying causes and not from any potential infection.  I am giving the figures I have.  At the outside there are 15 cases.  The reference to persons having died from underlying causes, from surgery, etc., is not being put on the record by me.  We will see what the tracking back reveals.</P>

      <P>On No. 19, we have reluctantly agreed to complete the Universities Bill tonight. The Whips agreed to this on the basis that the Government extended time.  We have 17 speakers and I understand the Government has one.  I assume our speakers will be able to make contributions tonight.  We agreed to facilitate the Government on the basis that Committee Stage has to be debated next week.  The Minister for Education should take note that this party, like almost everyone else, is opposed to this Bill. Perhaps between now and next week she will accept most of the 95 amendments put down by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday night, when I was focusing on other matters, the Docklands Authority Bill was published.  It is normally two weeks before Second Stage is taken.  The party Whip told me yesterday that the Government wanted to take all Stages of this Bill tomorrow.  I understand that was subsequently changed to the start of Second Stage.  I and most of my colleagues have not read the Bill and I have had no opportunity to consult with people outside regarding the Bill.  It is very technical and seems to try to change the Financial Services Centre, which has worked well.  Will the Minister hold the Bill over for a week?  A Bill like this deserves to be examined.  If the Bill is fine, we will support it next week and it will proceed to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Given that the then Government brought forward a Bill in this House in 1994 to provide for immunity for witnesses going before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, does the Government intend to bring forward a similar Bill as regards the alleged payments by Dunnes Stores to ensure that those who are not Members of this House and the Seanad have immunity when they appear before that committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if my reply will answer the question posed by the Deputy but the House did pass the Second Stage of the compellability of witnesses Bill which would extend privilege to anyone coming before a committee of this House.  The Bill rested for some time with the relevant committee of the House. A number of points were raised and have since been dealt with by the Government.  The correct and comprehensive answer to the Deputy's question is that, if this House can enact that legislation as speedily as possible, the questions of privilege and indemnity can be properly dealt with in that context.  It is a matter for the committee to decide when it wishes to proceed with Committee Stage of the compellability of witnesses Bill.</P>

Unless that Bill is passed before the Christmas recess, witnesses before the committee you, a Cheann Comhairle, will have to chair during your Christmas holidays will not have immunity.  Therefore the committee will not be able to function.  If the Government wants to obtain the truth of these matters, it will be necessary for a special Bill to be brought forward to give immunity so you can get on with your business during the Christmas recess.</P>

The Bill in question passed Second Stage in this House and was with the relevant committee for almost a year, during which time that committee decided to investigate an array of issues surrounding the entire question.  It was quite late this year, after August, when we received substantial suggestions for fundamental changes of almost a Second Stage nature.  We considered those in due course and have given a response as we are required to do.  The Government has in no way delayed the passage of this Bill.  It is a matter entirely for the committee and consequently for this House to <Col N="1149" /> decide how quickly it wishes to proceed with that legislation.  I am sure we will have the full co-operation of Deputy Harney's party in that regard.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a ghlacadh labhairt ar an mBille seo agus by mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Rialtas as am an Rialtais a chur ar fáil dom.</P>
      <P>I have listened to people working in universities speak on this Bill and they hold strong and opposing views.  There are those who object to increased State involvement in the running of universities and refer to the pristine Newman ideal of unfettered institutions of education where the information and knowledge they deal with is pure and untainted by considerations of short-term expedience and even political expedience.  To that extent they are espousing an ideal which many of us would share. The universities, largely on account of the shortage of public funding, have been tempted and swayed and have given in to the temptation of funding from the private sector.  In many ways, this explains much of the growth in aspects of university life.</P>
      <P>The phenomenal growth in the University of Limerick is, in itself, a good thing but much of the funding for that institution comes from big business.  It is fair to assume that big business sees universities as part of its agenda which, while it may have many noble aspirations, is primarily a profit making exercise.  Universities are becoming part of that agenda and we should take a realistic look at the life and development of universities in that context.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the idea of a university as outlined by Newman.  However, universities as we know them have become bogged down in the same type of nation-state view of life that seems to preoccupy this House and other parliaments.  On Vincent Browne's RTÉ programme last night, Terry Prone referred to politicians as people who primarily follow ideas.  It can be politically suicidal, however, to go out on a limb and promote ideas that have not been tried and tested.  Universities play an important role in that regard, testing the waters for the world of politics. We must recognise that universities provide important research facilities for politicians.  Their independence must be protected and I hope that will reassure some people in the university world that the State is not trying to suck them into some type of political tool-making exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Green Party representative I welcome the research work that has been done in universities. Many issues which are, or ought to be, politically urgent were not even given the time of day 20 years ago.  In the 1970s the ozone layer was busily being destroyed by our ignorant activities as human beings, not to mention nation states.  The issue could not be mentioned in any parliament then because it would not have been given any credence.  Thanks to university research, <Col N="1155" /> however, the ozone layer was identified as requiring an urgent remedy.  The remedy was provided but the results will not be seen for some decades owing to the long-term gestation of the problem.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to redress the imbalance between the overt involvement of the private sector in university life and the responsibility of the State to maintain some type of equity and social equality in the involvement of people in third level education.  It is timely that today's Education and Living supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i> provides a breakdown of figures for those participating in higher education.  It points out that for all the talk of free fees, making progress and enhancing opportunities for attending universities, we are still stuck in a deep rut of inequality when it comes to participation in third level education.  According to the survey on the percentage of age cohort in full time studies in the Dublin area, Priorswood/Darndale, just outside my own constituency, has a 3.6 per cent involvement in university degree courses, whereas the figure for Rathmines/Terenure is 46.5 per cent and Clontarf/Marino, 30.2 per cent. These are 1993 figures and clearly there is still huge inequality.  I presume the figures are the most up-to-date available given that they are published in today's newspaper.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that much of the State's involvement in universities has not brought about the equality we aspire to.  Apart from reforming universities, a great deal of work needs to be done relating to huge social problems and the creation of ghettos in society.  Those problems will not be dealt with by this Bill but the legislation has an important role to play in bringing us closer to some type of social equity regarding people's involvement in university life.</P>
    <P>Some people see this Bill as interfering in universities while others see it as a necessary rebalancing of the existing interference which is dominated by private investment.  The State also provides considerable moneys to universities so it is fair that it should have some involvement in their development and progress.  Having said that, the Bill is full of inconsistencies and shortcomings.  The perspective of such shortcomings depends on which university one attends or is involved with.  Both DCU and the University of Limerick are still outside the Pale when it comes, for instance, to Seanad representation.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has been making strenuous representations to Members of the House highlighting the inconsistency of not having degree-awarding status as other colleges do whose qualifications are similarly recognised by outside agencies.  I share the Dublin Institute of Technology's view that it ought to have degree-awarding status.  I hope the Minister will have time to table amendments on Committee Stage allowing the Dublin Institute of Technology to <Col N="1156" /> assume its rightful place as a degree-awarding institution.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for students to be represented on governing authorities.  It is important to understand, however, that because students must study to qualify, they have particular difficulties above and beyond those of other governing authority members.  It is reasonable to have alternative student members on such bodies allowing students the flexibility of participating to the maximum extent.  An alternative member could thus attend when the official member is not available.  That would ensure fair play and representation for students on such bodies.  That worked very well at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation where I was a member and my colleague, Vincent McDowell, was an alternative member.  I do not see why it could not work in the case of university authorities, particularly in the context of student representation.</P>
    <P>I received numerous representations regarding the Dublin Institute of Technology from students, their parents and people with a broad view of education who are concerned about inconsistency, which is a mild word, or hypocrisy, which is more politically charged.  These people make the point that the Dublin Institute of Technology deserves degree-awarding status.  I am involved with the Dublin Institute of Technology through a number of acquaintances and I do not know why such status could not be conferred.  A letter I received highlights the importance of this issue:</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag scríobh chugat roimh an bplé sa Dáil ar an mBille thuas chun do thacaíocht a lorg i leith moltaí an ghrúpa ath-bhreithnithe idirnáisiúnta ar Institiúid Teicneolaíocht Átha Cliath agus chun go gcuirfear an Dublin Institute of Technology in áireamh sa Bhille. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go gcuirfeadh an tAire na moltaí seo i bhfeidhm.  Ní gá dom a rá leat an cháil atá ar an Institiúid mar lárionad oideachasúil sa tír seo ón 19ú aois ar aghaidh.  Cheana féin tá cúrsaí céime agus iarchéime á reachtáil ag an Institiúid agus ba chóir go n-aithneófaí seo trí status ollscoile a bhronnadh ar an Institiúid.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeadh tú féin i bhfábhar na moltaí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-soiléir go bhfuil na moltaí seo ciallmhar agus ba bhreá liom a fháil amach ón Aire an bhfuil sé i gceist aici aontú leo agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don DTI sa tslí sin.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith, tá sé an-tábhachtach nach ndéanann muid dearmad ar ról Ollscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann i saol na tíre ó thaobh saol Gaeilge chomh maith le saol Béarla.  Tá an-chuid baint ag an Institiúid phríomháideach nó ag comhlachtaí príomháideache se saol ollscoile agus tá baol ann go mbeadh laghdú ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge agus i ról na Gaeilge sna hollscoileanna.  Is féidir linn leasuithe a chur isteach sa Bhille seo a ládróidh saol agus ról na Gaeilge agus sa tír i gcoitinne.  Sá Pháipéir Uainne Oideachais a foilsíodh i 1992, bhí <Col N="1157" /> cúram faoi leith ar an Údarás um Ard Oideachais i leith na n-aidhmeanna náisiúnta an Ghaeilge a athbheochan agus cultúr náisiúnta a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt.  Bhí sé i gceist go ndéanfaidh gach ollscoil tríú leibhéal polasaí soléir a fhorbairt faoi chur chun cinn, faoi fhorbairt agus faoi úsáid na Gaeilge i measc fhoirne agus mac léinn na háite agus go soláthródh sé tuairisc ar an dul chun cinn gach bliain.  Níl fhios agam go bhfuil sé sin ag titim amach ach ba cheart go dtharlódh sé.  Tá ról tábhachtach ag an earnáil oideachais tríú leibhéal i gcoitinne agus ag na hollscoileanna go háirithe maidir leis an ngné seo.</P>
    <P>Cuir i gcás múineadh na Gaeilge ar an dara leibhéal, tá ról ag na hollscoileanna maidir le muineadh agus forbairt na Gaeilge, oiliúnt múinteoirí agus oideachas tríú leibhéal trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Braithim, áfach, go bhféadfaí ról na n-ollscoileanna a mhéadú agus a chur chun cinn na Gaeilge a threisiú, agus na hachmhainn a bheith ann chuige agus struchtúr reachtúil oiriúineach a bheith ann mar thacaíocht.  Is sa chómhtéacs seo gur gá dúinn roinnt leasuithe a chur isteach sa Bhille atá i gceist anseo.  Cuir i gcás, tá seans againn roinnt mhaith de na leasuithe a chur isteach a chinnteoidh go mbeidh gníomhaíocht shoiléar ón Stáit i leith na Gaeilge, rud nach bhfuil de dhíth ar an mBéarla, go mbeadh ionadaíocht ag pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ar údarás na n-ollscoileanna. Chabhródh an chomhairle a bheith ar fáil trí ionadaíocht den chineál seo leis na hollscoileanna a dhualgas reachtúil i leith na Gaeilge a chomhlíonadh agus go mbeadh ar na hollscoileanna a gcuram réimse iomlán seirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge a thabhairt san áireamh agus iad ag earcú foirne.  Dar liom gur cheart go mbeadh ar na hollscoileanna comhionannas teanga a chur i bhfeidhm agus iad ar freastal ar mhic léinn agus ar an bpobal go ginearálta, go mbeadh dualgas ar gach ollscoil cúram a dhéanamh don oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge agus leagan Gaeilge dá n-ainm a bheith in úsáid ag na hollscoileanna a bheadh mar chomh-ollscoil na Gaeilge.  Cén fath nach bhfuil &ldquo;Ollscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann Corcaigh&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ollscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann Baile Átha Cliath&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Ollscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann na Gaillimhe&rdquo; scríofa san Dara Sceideal?</P>
    <P>I ndáiríre tá an-chuid maith sa Bhille seo ach ba mhór an trua dá ligimís don Bhille seo dul ar aghaidh gan roinnt mhaith leasaithe a dhéanamh a thabharfadh isteach seansanna an Gaeilge a threisiú agus seansanna cothrom na féinne a thabhairt d'ár bpobal uilig.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Many Members wish to contribute and I regret that the Second Stage debate is due to conclude this evening.  I hope considerable time will be made available for debate on Committee Stage.  The Minister has stated she will be generous about discussion on amendments.  It is apparent that the Bill requires amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> With no sense of elitism, I can state that I am the product of two universities, UCD, when it was based at Earlsfort Terrace, and Maynooth College.  I entered UCD at 17 years of age and studied for three years.  Nine years later, at the age of 29, I attended Maynooth College as the first outside student to pursue a HDip.  In between, I married, gave birth and developed in personal terms.  It would be wrong to look back through rose tinted glasses but I remember with great accuracy and precision the three years I spent studying for a BA in Earlsfort Terrace.  We never had enough money to do what we wanted at that time and we were extremely cavalier in our approach to our studies, as is the wont of almost every student.  That has not changed since the first students entered Trinity College 400 years ago.</P>
    <P>My most striking memories of student life in UCD are of certain lecturers, tutors and knowledge imparted and gained, not merely in study halls or tutorial rooms but through the atmosphere and character of the old buildings at Earlsfort Terrace.  The knowledge I gained has stayed with me and provided a ballast and buttress against life's vicissitudes.  Nine years later I attended Maynooth College as a mature student seeking to further increase my capabilities and professional qualifications.  I was glad to study under the late Brother Ó Suilleabháin who was head of education in the college at that time.  He imbued mature students with the sense that they could, with their teaching qualifications, gain and impart much in a pedagogical situation and from teaching in the classroom.</P>
    <P>When I left the Department of Education five years ago this legislation was a gleam in my eye &mdash; I had one meeting with the relevant group.  It was decided that the 1908 Act needed to be updated and I had the honour in 1989, on the day the general election was called, of introducing two Bills dealing with Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, I stated clearly at the time that these two Bills would need to be recited, so to speak, in any new legislation dealing with universities.  I am honoured to have been the first Minister in the history of the State to introduce legislation dealing with universities.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth as constituent universities of the National University of Ireland, to provide a revised composition of governing authorities of universities and to provide structures for accountability and transparency in the affairs of universities.  These aims seem simple at first but, having read the explanatory memorandum, the Bill and the Minister's speech in detail, they are absurd.  This is clumsy and confused legislation.  The Government had an opportunity in the Bill to trace in historical terms how the universities had come into being and to set out in philosophical and practical terms where they should go in the future.  This is intrusive, prescriptive and heavy-handed legislation <Col N="1159" /> through which the Minister seems intent on leaving her imprint on every aspect of university life.</P>
    <P>The rights of employment are subject to strictures which run counter to practically all employment legislation and certainly run counter to natural justice.  In essence, the Minister is proposing the establishment of a State controlled university where academic freedom and creativity of thought will be stifled through excessive rules and regulations, ministerial rights of dismissal, arbitrary rights to override university charters, guidelines on practically everything that stirs in a university and the threat of publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for some unspecified misdemeanour. This is a far cry from Newman's idea of a university.  In his essay &ldquo;Christianity and Scientific Investigation&rdquo; he states:</P>
    <P>Great minds need elbow-room, not indeed in the domain of faith, but of thought.  And so indeed do lesser minds, and all minds.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not give anybody the type of elbow-room to which he referred because everyone will be circumscribed, allotted a place, time and sum of money and told what they may say and what rules they must obey.</P>
    <P>I do not know the author of this over-intrusive legislation.  I worked in the Department of Education for almost five years and I cannot recall any official who was imbued with these ideas or who would put them into print.  I believe there was an outside influence on the legislation. They are not the Minister's ideas but, as the person who introduced the Bill, she must stand over them.  I shall not name the person who I think had a major input into the legislation but he is from the south and has very definite ideas on many matters in the area of education.</P>
    <P>The legislation is noteworthy for the pedestrian approach it adopts to a very noble idea, its remarkable lack of recognition and generosity towards the achievements of universities and its overweening assumption that universities should be peopled with subdued and subservient minds. Those of us who attended university have stories about what we did there, while one political journalist has written in very telling terms about his time at university.  Be that as it may, we all have clear ideas of what should happen in universities.  When reading about the 1908 Act I was struck by the liberality of thought and the freedom of expression at that time.  It was part of an English idea on how to pacify the native Irish. Giving them universities and the right to formulate their own ideas was an attempt to kill home rule by kindness.  That period was notable for its achievements and the 1908 Act was a notable achievement in its own right.</P>
    <P>In his essay &ldquo;Discipline of Mind&rdquo; Newman stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> You have come, not merely to be taught, but to learn.  You have come to exert your minds. You have come to make what you hear your own, by putting out your hand, as it were, to grasp it and appropriate it.  You do not come merely to hear a lecture, or to read a book, but you come for that kind of instruction which consists in a sort of conversation between your lecturer and you.</P>
    <P>That is the essence of the lecture halls of a university.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The result is a formation of mind &mdash; that is, a habit of order and systems, a habit of referring every accession of knowledge to what we already know,...</P>
    <P>Students who read these essays during their university days may not have thought much about them or have felt they were beyond them, were esoteric and too academic.  However, when one reads them now they are very true.  He also states:</P>
    <P>...in all learning, you must not trust to books, but only make use of them; not hang like a dead weight upon your teacher, but catch some of his life; handle what is given you, not as a formula, but as a pattern to copy and as a capital to improve;...</P>
    <P>These fine ideas are as relevant now as when Newman wrote them 100 years ago.  The test of good literature is whether it can still strike a chord many years after it was written.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not recognise the universities' fine record in raising money for research and development.  Trinity College, UCD, UCC, UCG, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and the two new universities have increased the amount of money raised for research and development.  When I was Minister for Health I visited Trinity College where I was told about scientific research that was being carried out there.  The results of this research will enable people who are going blind from an obscure disease to keep their sight for longer.</P>
    <P>Freedom of expression, the right to publicly disagree with the establishment and the right to be out of step with the status quo are the hallmarks of a university whose foundation is proper teaching.  Freedom of expression was shown in the writings of Clonmacnoise and in universities such as Trinity College which was established 400 years ago.  Lecturers, professors and students should have the right to state their point of view.  Freedom of expression is so great it can lead to the overthrow of totalitarian regimes such as those in the former Czechoslovakia and in Hungary.  Poets, scholars, teachers and students should be able to express their points of view in the comfort and safety of university halls.</P>
    <P>Apart from Adjournment debates and parliamentary questions, I have not spoken on education matters since I left the Department of Education.  This Bill is misguided and it seems strange that amendments must be made to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> Should it not be sent back to the drawing board? My party leader and Deputy Martin issued a statement today about the Dublin Institute of Technology and Deputy Martin will table amendments in this regard.  I ask the Minister to consider giving the Dublin Institute of Technology university status because of its scientific and other achievements.</P>
    <P>I always thought that if a former Minister spoke on a relevant matter, his or her views should be considered.  I ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board with this legislation which should include what other minds, greater than those in this House, believe should constitute a university.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to enhance our vision for the future and to build on what has been achieved in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I am also concerned about the draconian nature of this Bill.  If the Minister accepts the many proposed amendments, it will completely change this Bill. The Minister must examine the Bill with her advisers.  The previous speaker, a former Minister for Education, believes this legislation did not emanate from the Department of Education. However, the Minister must accept responsibility for it.  This Bill finds no favour anywhere, but least of all in the universities which the Minister is trying to improve.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of an overdue process of reevaluating the role and status of third level education.  The most recent markers of this process were the Green Paper on education and the proposals for university legislation which the Minister published in November 1995.  I am amazed at how little of the Green Paper or of the Minister's proposals is reflected in it.  Gone are the principles in the Minister's proposals which set out &ldquo;the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos and traditions&rdquo;.  Instead, a set of draconian powers have been given to the Minister to suspend university charters and governing bodies and to lay aside existing contracts of employment if the Minister sees fit to do so for so-called stated reasons.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder that this Bill has attracted widespread criticism from all quarters, including the Higher Education Authority which is the Minister's advisory body.  I want to consider some of those objections and how they reflect the concerns that if this Bill is enacted into law the integrity of universities will be compromised by the long shadow of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provisions which will affect Trinity College, the Bill is both sloppily drafted and seeks to turn back over 400 years of university life as if that life and the contribution of Trinity College to the broader life of our nation is in some way backward or irrelevant. Section 16 (1) (b), for example, lists the functions of the governing authority.  It states: &ldquo;to appoint the chief officer and such other employees as it <Col N="1162" /> thinks necessary for the purposes of the university&rdquo;.  This is a sweeping provision which denies individuals the right to any say in the election of the provost, unless they are members of the college board.</P>
    <P>In one legislative swoop, the Minister proposes to challenge the position of the existing trustees of Trinity College and to replace them, without consultation or regard to their existing legal status and responsibilities, by a regime that is better suited to a semi-State body.  I am not surprised that, even on the basis of that one clause, the fellows of Trinity may take legal advice because it not only undermines existing legal conventions but is one of many that offends Trinity's great history and integrity.  To use the Minister's words, it offends &ldquo;the ethos&rdquo; and &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; of a great university.</P>
    <P>Similar points could be made about constituent universities of the NUI.  When the Minister introduced the Bill four weeks ago she told RTÉ its provisions were inspired in part by the senate of the NUI.  She stated, &ldquo;I have given them what they asked for&rdquo;.  With respect, she was very selective in adopting its proposals.  I support, in particular, its proposal to establish Maynooth college as a constituent university of the NUI. Fianna Fáil has a long-standing commitment in that regard.  In its proposals the NUI outlined the importance of autonomy and academic freedom. It stated that the additional controls are inappropriate and that the Minister's mission statement was an excessively narrow view of the place of a university in a modern and enlightened democratic society.  It also stated that the vital role of a university as an independent and political voice is not recognised and that universities need to have freedom to deploy and redeploy their resources as they see fit.  Those proposals are glaringly absent from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Rather than providing for those noble objectives, the Bill contains clauses that undermine university independence and provide for the dismissal of the Provost of Trinity and other university presidents.  They also provide for side tracking university charters if they conflict with Government policy.  This type of arbitrary power is unacceptable to Members on this side.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she wants universities to be accountable for the public money they expend.  I have no difficulty with that, but one would assume from the Government that universities are irresponsible and unaccountable.  The Minister must know that under existing legislation our universities are accountable.  Their accountability is spelt out in detail under the existing provisions of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 and the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  The Minister's proposals are based on a distorted view of the State's allocation of public moneys to the running cost of universities.  Little or no account is taken of the independent financial input the universities make to educational development and the broader economic and cultural life of the <Col N="1163" /> nation.  The Bill goes even further and proposes to bring the private endowment of colleges and universities under the rubric of the HEA.  Why should private moneys be accountable in this way?  As this is unacceptable, I will suggest to Deputy Martin that sections 22(4) and 35(1) should be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>I also believe the clauses that repeat the powers of the Higher Education Authority and the Comptroller and Auditor General should be repealed.  Why has the Minister included them in the Bill?  She wants to parachute the Departments of Education and Finance and the Government into the universities, despite the proven regimes of answerability and accountability already in place.  This is a dangerous road on which to embark.  The Bill, as currently drafted, could leave the universities and their staff vulnerable to the whims of those in power.  While this may be fanciful to some, the law is the law and this Bill, if enacted, poses such a threat to academic freedom that, irrespective of the Minister's intentions, the integrity and independence of universities will be severely compromised and undermined.</P>
    <P>One way of getting around this would be to enshrine in the Bill a clause that would protect academic freedom and the right of each university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos and traditions.  This was included in the Minister's original proposals published last November but, for some strange reason, it was excluded from the Bill.  Those principles should be reinstated.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing a draconian role for herself that would not have been out of place in Eastern Europe 30 years ago, a point made by the President of University College Cork in his conferring speech on 17 October last.  This kind of over-intrusion by Government has not proved to be durable or desirable.  In this case, it implies that over-intrusion by Government is necessary because the universities have not been doing a good job.  I reject that assumption because of the proven educational records of various colleges and universities and their broader contribution to social, economic and cultural life.</P>
    <P>Universities serve the country well.  They have not waited for Government handouts to diversify and develop.  They have led the way through the courageous vision of their leaders and they certainly do not need to be led by Government. The Minister would be better advised to work in partnership with our universities &mdash; administration, staff and students &mdash; to benefit from what they can offer in the future.  Instead she has chosen to confront them without just cause or good sense.  She has also chosen to ignore the terms and conditions of employment of the existing staff.  From my reading of the Bill, not only will the concept of holding office be set aside even for existing staff but it explicitly sets out to change those terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>The clauses that govern the right to dismiss and suspend are also broad.  The Bill also allows for <Col N="1164" /> changes in the operation of some superannuation schemes.  Those changes are not only arbitrary and introduced in a non-consultative manner, but if they are not radically altered the Minister will sow the seeds for the disintegration of our universities.  If the Bill is not withdrawn it will be a retrograde step for third level education.  That is why some five weeks ago members of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench decided that on return to Government this Bill would be repealed. While the Minister has tabled a generous number of amendments, the Bill is beyond repair.  It is broken down and cannot be restarted or repaired. It has already attracted more than 53 amendments from the Minister's advisory body, the HEA.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take the hint, return to the drawing board and, following consultation with all involved, return to the House with a new Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews stated, Fianna Fáil has decided the legislation is beyond amendment and on return to Government we will rescind it.</P>
      <P>We have a number of reasons for opposing the Bill.  It provides for an excessive and dangerous level of Government control and interference in NUI constituent universities.  It threatens the academic freedom of universities which is vital to their continued development as centres of independent and critical thinking.  The Bill severely undermines the security of all university staff by proposing to create arbitrary powers for their suspension and dismissal, to retrospectively override existing employment contracts and to repeal existing protective legislation.  It represents a dangerous precedent which undermines the security of all workers and must be opposed on that basis.</P>
      <P>The Bill fails to recognise the vital educational role played by the Dublin Institute of Technology since the 19th century by excluding it from its proposals, even though the international review group recommended that it should be allowed to make its own degree awards from 1998.  The Bill also fails to address the need to provide for intensive training in foreign languages, in particular business language, in third level institutions.  As such, the Bill lacks vision and fails to provide for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Government control and interference, the ministerial paper &ldquo;Position Paper on Proposals for University Legislation&rdquo; published in November 1995 recognised that the principle of the right of a university to regulate its affairs in accordance with its ethos and traditions is of central importance, as is the expression of academic, operational and management freedom, consistent with the effective and efficient use of resources and accountability.  At first the Minister recognised the value of protecting and encouraging the diversity which exists among our universities.  However, in the past year the Minister has retreated from her original position <Col N="1165" /> and now seeks to impose a stifling conformity on university governance by omitting this provision from the Bill.  More alarmingly, the Minister also proposes to entrench the role of the Higher Education Authority by significantly increasing its powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister endeavours to force through such measures in the name of transparency and accountability.  However, public review of university accounts and university governance is already provided for in the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 and the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  The Higher Education Authority wields considerable power over the development of university curricula and the university campus, staff salaries, numbers, structure, and student entry requirements.  In section 33 of the Universities Bill the Minister proposes that the Higher Education Authority be afforded the power to formulate &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; for universities.  The Minister also reserves the power to publish the Higher Education Authority report if any university fails to act on Higher Education Authority guidelines.</P>
    <P>The principal danger of such a provision, which would undoubtedly increase Government control and interference, lies in its opacity.  The Minister has deliberately neglected to clearly define the nature and legal basis of Higher Education Authority guidelines, thus leaving the door open for the possibility of making implementation of Higher Education Authority guidelines legally or financially binding by linking implementation to the provision of State funding.  The Bill also proposes to alter the role of the visitorial system so that the Minister would operate, to quote Deputy Martin, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on education, as a &ldquo;modern inspector general, sent out to do the work of an autocratic Tsar&rdquo;.  The irony is that the HEA, to which the Minister wishes to give this extra power and on whose behalf the Minister says she is operating, has disowned the Minister on this issue.  It has said it does not want these powers, it does not know what the Minister is doing and it has proposed various amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>In section 28 of the Bill the Minister reserves the power to supersede university charters and internal university statutes where they may contradict the proposed Act.  The Bill also provides for a reduction in academic representation on each university governing body to between one third and two fifths &mdash; Trinity College and Maynooth College are noted exceptions to this provision.  The governing body is afforded the power to veto the election of any representative if he or she is a student or employee of the university.  The Bill also proposes that internal governors can be appointed by the governing body &ldquo;as it thinks fit&rdquo;.  In view of the fact that the Minister has herself seen fit to radically reduce academic representation on governing bodies, the implications of these provisions for the freedom and independence of <Col N="1166" /> our universities cannot be underestimated.  Surely it is essential that the independence and freedom of action of universities is sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>Similar arbitrary and far reaching powers are afforded to the Minister and the Government in relation to the terms and conditions of employment of university staff.  Section 22 (5) allows that a &ldquo;university may suspend or dismiss an employee&rdquo;.  The Bill also allows the Minister to reserve the power to supersede internal university statutes where they may contradict the proposed Act.  In recognition of this power, the Bill states that all statutes which are deemed to be in conflict with the proposed Act are hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>All university staff are demoted from the position of officer, as provided in existing contracts, to employee.  Thus, protection afforded to university staff as officers under the Irish Universities Act, 1908 and the 1991 Act is summarily withdrawn.  The Bill undermines the security of all university staff by proposing to create arbitrary powers for their suspension and dismissal and to repeal existing protective legislation.  The proposed Act provides the Government with the unprecedented power to retrospectively override existing employment contracts.  The proposals contained in the Universities Bill clearly undermine the security of all employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister undertakes these changes in pursuit of her stated desire to enhance, modernise and consolidate the vital training and educational role of our universities.  However, the Minister's stated objective flies in the face of the Government's action, or inaction, to date. Nowhere can this lack of interest be more clearly witnessed than with regard to funding.  The Government has committed a mere 0.52 per cent of Structural Funds &mdash; £36.5 million from a total of £7 billion &mdash; to university development.</P>
    <P>In spite of the severe lack of Government support our universities have expanded greatly in the past 15 years, making a nonsense of the Minister's claim that a radical overhaul of third level education is essential to bring our universities up to standard and exposing the Government's true intention to increase its power and control over the education system.  Fianna Fáil undertakes to repeal this legislation on return to Government.</P>
    <P>The universities have not been sitting around awaiting support from the Government.  They have been out in the field raising funds internationally.  They have developed the concept of commercial industrial business parks, such as the superb Plassey park at Limerick University. The same concept has been used at UCD and elsewhere.  The dynamic of learning leading to investment and job creation exists already within the spheres of influence of the universities.  This Bill will introduce the dead hand of Government bureaucracy to university initiatives and goes against the whole trend, which is why Fianna Fáil is committed to repealing it.  Universities have <Col N="1167" /> played a vital role in Irish intellectual, social and political life for hundreds of years.  On return to Government, Fianna Fáil undertakes to support and enhance that role rather than diminish it. Support must involve more than simple thanks for a job well done.  It must involve more than the <i>laissez faire</i> policy pursued by the current Government prior to the introduction of this draconian Bill.</P>
    <P>Holes have appeared in third level education curricula from time to time.  In the late 1970s engineering graduates were in short supply in Ireland and a concentrated effort was made involving co-operation between the Government and third level institutions in order to successfully bridge the supply and demand gap.  More recently, the demand for qualified computer programmers and other IT consultants has been addressed by our universities and institutions such as the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In recognition of the great contribution to the educational needs of the country made by the Dublin Institute of Technology since the 19th century, Fianna Fáil proposes that the institute should be afforded university status.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Dublin Institute of Technology is not included in the Bill.  This reflects the continued neglect of its strength as an educational institution.  In December 1995 the Minister for Education established an international group which, having assessed the work of the institute, recommended that it should be allowed to award its own degrees from 1998. The Dublin Institute of Technology rightly feels that this recommendation is an endorsement of its reputation as a leading and progressive institute operating at degree and postgraduate levels and that this should be acknowledged with elevation to university status.  The institute has been contributing to our educational needs since the 19th century and is widely recognised as being of university status and standard.  It has endeavoured to be practical and progressive in its approach to education.  I know the institute and its president firmly intend to continue as a unique multilevel university institution.  The students attending that institute rightly deserve the same status as a university, namely its own degree qualifications as recommended.</P>
    <P>Regarding the role of third level education and its relevance to the needs of our expanding economy, I return to the point I made about engineering graduates.  In the late 1970s there was a shortage of engineering graduates and because of that the efforts of the IDA in attracting industry was badly hampered.  At that stage a concentrated effort was made between the Government, universities, other third level colleges and the IDA to ensure an increasing number of electronic engineering graduates came on stream and places were provided to meet that need.  That has proven to be very successful.  A similar situation arises where, on the brink of economic and monetary union and during <Col N="1168" /> Ireland's fifth EU Presidency, we are experiencing a severe shortage of modern language graduates.  I take this opportunity to warmly welcome the announcement today that Hertz Corporation will move to Swords and I hope its project will be very successful.  Many other companies have changed their decision to invest here and have invested elsewhere because of a lack of modern language graduates.  We need, in particular, intensive business language training at third level, at university or through the regional technical colleges.  That is an urgent need in our export driven economy, in our electronics industry and particularly in the telemarketing area which includes information technology.</P>
    <P>I heard that Delta Airlines changed its mind about investing here because there are not sufficient people available in the workplace with modern language skills.  Telemarketing means people can make a telephone call in Germany, France or Italy to make a reservation with, say, Delta Airlines and that call can be answered in their native language through the International Financial Services Centre here.  To attract that type of investment a sufficient number of our workforce require continental language skills.  It is vital that the Minister comes to grips with that by establishing a task force made up of officials from the Department, the IDA, the universities and other third level colleges to make a concentrated effort to ensure this opportunity to create very good employment is grasped and not lost to other parts of the world.  I appeal to the Minister not to put this matter on the long finger but to address it with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>We must be visionary and vigilant to address the appearance of such educational black spots before a crisis point is reached.  We must undertake to work in close partnership with our universities to reach a fuller understanding of their needs to build on their strengths and address their weaknesses.</P>
    <P>The Bill is full of ideological baggage but lacks vision.  Because of that and the massive Government interference it proposes in the universities sector, I call on each Member to oppose it.  Regarding this commitment and those concerned about this subject, the Minister might force this Bill through with the Government's temporary voting strength in this House, but she does not have a mandate to do that.  Fianna Fáil undertakes to repeal this legislation on return to Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very controversial Bill and the Minister has been quite ill at ease with the response to it.  Its general tenor radically undermines the whole philosophy of university education.  Those inside and outside university life have been appalled and dismayed by the main proposals of this ill-advised and ill-thought out Bill.  The Minister and the Government have failed to understand the <i>raison d'être</i> of a university and the need for independence of thought of such an institution from the arms of <Col N="1169" /> Government.  Surely this should be the basic tenet of any democracy.  As President Mary Robinson on the occasion of the award to her of an honorary degree in Poland so eloquently stated:</P>
      <P>... we will need, above all, the support of certain lasting values which the university more than any other institution in society is committed to uphold and promote &mdash; the free interplay of argument and discussion; a critical approach to the orthodoxy of the times; a passion for truth; and freedom to express the ideas which emerge from the restless questioning surge of the human intellect.</P>
      <P>... what society most needs, whether it realises it or not, is a continuous, constructive but critical judgment from within... In society's own interest, we ask for the freedom to be critical in analysis, dispassionate in the search for knowledge but passionate in its defence.</P>
      <P>The underlying philosophy of the Bill effects the transfer to State agencies of powers at present vested in the universities in a manner and to an extent which is wholly inappropriate in a democracy.  This Bill, as proposed, would result in a much greater bureaucratic interference by Government in the day to day workings of the university.  There is no respect for the ethos, traditions or the academic operational and management freedom of the university.  Why is there such a discrepancy between the Minister's original position paper and the Bill?  Will we see yet another U-turn by the Minister on this matter?  Perhaps, if we do, it may be far more welcome than what is before us today.</P>
      <P>Any Bill on university life should recognise that a university strives for academic excellence to advance knowledge, to promote the cultural and social life of society, to disseminate the outcomes of its research in the general community and to regulate its own affairs in accordance with its ethos.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to understand the supreme importance of these basic tenets and seems to infer, through this Bill, that our universities are not making efficient use of resources and are not accountable to the public for the use of public funds.  She has not recognised that our universities have begun to adapt to change and to growing needs in the areas of fundraising and the use of technology.</P>
      <P>The Minister has denied any democratic approach regarding internal governors who are to be &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; by the governing authority &ldquo;as it thinks fit&rdquo; and not elected by the relevant committees.  As my party's spokesperson on Education, Deputy Martin, said, this is nothing less than dictatorship.  The Minister has not taken account of the protective legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of this Bill has demonstrated a Stalinist way of thinking which would seem to be the prevalent approach being taken by the Labour Party on this sensitive issue.  This will be resisted by Fianna Fáil which, as my colleagues <Col N="1170" /> have said repeatedly, is committed to repealing the Bill if passed into law in its present form.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt anseo anocht ar ócáid ina bhfuil Bille Ollscoile á phlé don chéad uair le blianta fada i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Creidim go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an mBille seo mar go dtugann sé deis don Aire seo agus don Rialtas seo rudaí tábhachtacha a dhéanamh chomh fada is a bhaineann sé le neamhspleachas na n-ollscoileanna.  Creidim gurb é dáiríre atá á dhéanamh ag an Aire seo agus ag an Rialtas ná srian thar fóir a chur leis an neamhspleachas sin agus gan aon chúis leis seachas ídéalachas Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre.</P>
      <P>Six weeks ago the Minister told us this Bill represented the most radical assessment of our universities since the Irish Universities Act was passed in 1908.  One could forgive her for patting herself on the back if this was the case, if the Bill embodied a thoughtful consideration of the role of our universities in society and if it was the result of full consultation with the heads, staff and students of our universities.  Everybody interested in its fate knows the Minister's flowing introduction was not a tribute to work well done, that it was instead little short of a crude ego trip.</P>
      <P>We now know the real offering of this Bill is not to be found in the Minister's speech but in a statement she gave outside the House the previous day when she realised it was so flawed that it was in need of generous amendment. These are her words, not mine.  This partly explains why she has been so reluctant to find a debating slot to discuss her so-called radical proposals.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate the Minister's reticence to come openly before the House and her desire to keep a low profile.  The Higher Education Authority was so unhappy with what she offered that it leaked a devastating criticism of her and proposed 55 amendments to what she is trying to push through the House.</P>
      <P>The heads of our universities have also been highly critical.  I understand the Minister is trying to buy them off before she sums up later this evening and to salvage the Bill on Committee Stage but as she tries to save face, would it not be wiser, more responsible and more open, accountable and transparent to realise what is obvious to all, that the problems with the Bill are so basic that a mere cut and paste job will not suffice or are we back to where we were a few weeks ago when a Minister's incompetence is to be glossed over by ignoring ministerial responsibility for what in this case is legislation which has gone seriously wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Minister will prevail on university heads, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Finance to salvage something of this Bill but even if she succeeds in buying them off, it is far from a responsible and positive assessment of our universities.  It is <Col N="1171" /> exactly the opposite.  It has neither purpose nor vision.  The Minister now knows this.</P>
    <P>What makes this all the more unfortunate is that the Minister's position paper on proposals for university legislation, published in November 1995, brought together the views and considerations of a number of people and institutions involved in third level education. These included the senate of the NUI which proposed that its constituent colleges should be accorded university status.  Fianna Fáil has long supported this view and welcomes in particular the designation of Maynooth as a separate university.  This has been its long-established policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that most of what the NUI, the existing universities and others proposed in connection with the proposals made last November has been ignored in this Bill.  She is making too much of very little.  That is one of the problems with it.  It promised much.  Contrary to what we now know to be the case, it was presented as something which had widespread support.</P>
    <P>On 30 July when the Minister made her first statement on the occasion of the circulation of the Bill she thanked &ldquo;the staff of the universities through their associations&rdquo;, students and graduates for their contributions.  She also acknowledged the contributions of Senators to the debate in December 1995 on the proposals made the previous month.</P>
    <P>Behind all this rhetoric we should note that the Minister had not met any staff or student association in more than a year.  I was privileged to be present when the Irish Federation of University Teachers made a presentation to the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  When I asked whether it had sought a meeting with the Minister and whether she had responded, I was appalled and shocked to learn that, despite several requests, it had not managed to meet her. On 7 November the clerk of the committee wrote to the Minister on the chairman's instructions, on foot of a Fianna Fáil proposal.  On 13 November IFOUT wrote to the committee thanking it for its representations which had directly resulted in the Minister asking for a meeting on 19 November. As for listening to what Senators had to say, the reality was best revealed when Senator Shane Ross resigned from the Fine Gael Party in protest against the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other inconsistencies in how the Minister proposes to address the organisation, staffing and management of the universities. There is the issue of how this Bill proposes to deal with university staff.  To say that what the Bill proposes under this heading is arbitrary and illegal is an understatement.  The level of public concern at the Bill's dismissal of existing terms and conditions of employment as well as existing pension schemes is reflected in the large volume of letters I and others have received in recent months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> The Bill is in contravention of labour law in that it arbitrarily proposes to break contracts and put in place a less favourable set of conditions for future staff.  This is unacceptable.  On Committee Stage, on the assumption I will still be able to recognise the Bill, Fianna Fáil will propose that existing contracts should not be interfered with and that, in respect of present and future staff, the provisions of section 40 (3) should be applied to everybody.</P>
    <P>Section 40 (2) states that staff &ldquo;shall not, while in the service of the University, receive less remuneration or be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than the remuneration at the level to which he or she was entitled and conditions of service to which he or she was subject&rdquo;.  That provision applies only to staff at Maynooth, and while I welcome the protection it gives to those staff, I cannot understand why it has not been extended to the staff of every university.  It is one thing for the Minister to ignore existing contracts but it is illogical and immoral to apply the law differently within the same sector.</P>
    <P>There are inconsistencies in the way the Bill proposes to deal with university governance.  The Minister said last July that the structures would provide for &ldquo;broader representation on governing authorities&rdquo;.  She did not tell us that, according to the terms of section 14 (2) (b) (ii) and (iii) of the Bill the academic representatives should be appointed by the governing authority, that under subsection (4) employee representatives should be appointed by the governing authority and that under subsection (5) student representatives should be appointed by the governing authority. Nowhere in the Bill are there provisions for the democratic process of electing representatives. Even in section 14 (4) the existing provision whereby graduates elect their representatives is not carried over into this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the other side, chief officers as well as the Minister are given wide powers to appoint members.  The Minister goes further and reserves to herself the power to suspend the governing authority, the President of an NUI, DCU and UL, and the provost of Trinity College Dublin, and to suspend university charters and statutes if, to use her words, for stated reasons she deems this to be an appropriate course of action.  Under the Bill the Minister may act if university statutes are in conflict with the Bill.  That is an appalling affront to university independence.  I thought that State control over universities had fallen with the Berlin Wall, but I am appalled it is beginning to re-emerge in the Labour Party, albeit for stated reasons.</P>
    <P>All these powers are draconian.  They are too vague and arbitrary to put them into law as a code by which to regulate universities.  The draconian theme runs through the Bill.  It is a Bill that confronts, not a Bill that seeks co-operation or that will inspire university staff to build on their proven commitment and contribution to the life of the nation.  The heavy-handed and <Col N="1173" /> bureaucratically stifling nature of the detailed regulations set out in the Bill is puzzlingly at odds with all the earlier statements by the Minister and previous Ministers for Education on the need to guard the freedom of universities.</P>
    <P>The excessively regulatory role proposed for the Higher Education Authority in particular gives great cause for concern.  Everybody realises that universities are fully committed to the principles of public accountability and the effect of adherence thereto in respect of the use of public funds.  Under the existing system universities are subject to the most stringent scrutiny of their stewardship in respect of public funds.  Their accounts are audited by their own auditors and by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the results, together with annual reports, are available to the Minister, the Higher Education Authority and the general public. There is no evidence that their stewardship of public moneys has given cause for concern or serious complaint.  It is all the more disappointing, therefore, that the Bill seems pervasively suspicious of and frequently hostile to universities and that its provisions reflect a lack of trust in the universities' objectives, effectiveness and sense of responsibility.  It is a highly restrictive regulatory instrument which reveals a profoundly mistaken understanding of the nature of a university as an independent voice in an open, democratic society.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to control the routine, staffing, investment, budget management, planning and evaluation management of universities by legislative provisions which are similar to and occasionally more stringent than those applied to semi-State commercial bodies.  It is unacceptable that provisions in the proposed legislation should alter without consent, diminish or constrain the rights, constitutional, statutory or contractual, currently enjoyed by university staff.  Unless it is decided that the Bill be withdrawn for substantial redrafting and reintroduced at a later date, there is urgent need for substantial amendments to and deletions from the current Bill if it is not to do irreparable harm to universities, one of the success stories contributing to Ireland's international standing as a modern and developed State and a civilised society, as successive Taoisigh, Ministers for Education, Government representatives and distinguished commentators, Irish and others, have frequently declared.  The most pressing need is for a declaration of principle at the outset which acknowledges the freedoms proper to universities in running their affairs and provides a framework within which all other provisions of the Bill would be interpreted and elaborated.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have a problem with the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Since publication of the Bill a cogent, persuasive case has been made by Dublin Institute of Technology, which does not deserve the dismissive attitude adopted by the Minister.  The six colleges which make up the Dublin Institute of Technology have 13,500 full-time equivalent students, including about <Col N="1174" /> 4,500 who are involved in degree and post graduate courses.  We all agree the Dublin Institute of Technology constitutes a significant part of our third level system.  It deserves recognition for the vocational character of many of its courses, by which it maintains particularly close links with the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>Given that Dublin Institute of Technology students obtain degrees, its recognition as a full university is logical.  University status for the Dublin Institute of Technology would accord with the recommendations of the international review group set up in 1995.  There is no apparent reason the Minister has not acted on those recommendations and transferred the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority, as recommended by the review group.  Fianna Fáil believes the real reason the Minister has refused university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology has more to do with concentrating power in her Department than doing what is best for universities and colleges.  That is reflected in the Universities Bill which seeks to curb the natural and very important independence of universities by bringing them under the direct control of the Minister and the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>Our party spokesperson has published 138 amendments to the Bill.  It is probably the largest number of amendments ever produced by an Opposition spokesperson to a Bill which all of us expected would receive a very warm welcome. Our partners in Opposition may publish a similar number of amendments, not to talk about the number of so-called generous amendments the Minister will bring forward.  Committee Stage debate on this Bill will be a matter of great interest to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas as well as to students, parents of students, teachers and heads in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>At the stroke of a pen the Minister has conjured a legal nightmare.  She has affronted and insulted a great sector of Irish life by ignoring most of what they have to say and twisting the remainder to merge with some party manifesto. The Labour Party manifesto on higher education is arbitrary and cavalier.  It has been worked out without consultation and without recognition of the legal rights of university staff and university statutes.  The worst that can be said about the current position of the Bill is that the Minister should heed the deafening silences of the Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left backbenchers on the issue.  The best that can be said is that before she returns to the back benches herself, she should scrap the Bill and return to the drawing board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I want to express my full support for the idea that the legislation governing our third level institutions, particularly the universities, is urgently in need of an overhaul and upgrade.  As the Minister stated, there has been an increase in student numbers from approximately 10,000 in 1960 to approximately 50,000 today.  This represents a staggering fivefold increase over a 35 year period.  Therefore, when the Minister announced the proposal to draft the current legislation I looked forward to examining the Bill and making a constructive contribution to the debate.  With the Minister's personal professional experience in the educational area, I thought the Bill would be an exciting and positive collection of proposed improvements and innovations.  Unlike some commentators I also anticipated that a certain emphasis should be placed on the concept of accountability in the third level sector since Exchequer support for the universities alone amounts to approximately £220 million each year.</P>
      <P>How does one react to what the Minister has brought before us in this Bill?  Does it reflect a masterly assessment of the current state of development of our universities?  Does it recognise the need to equip those institutions to fulfil their vital national role as we approach the 21st century?  Has the Minister been inspired to see a clear way forward towards ensuring full accountability on the part of the universities while at the same time protecting their intellectual freedom?  Has the Minister sought to address the serious side effects of the points system, and has she seen an opportunity to tackle the social scandal of appallingly low participation rates from the most economically deprived communities?</P>
      <P>Sadly, the answer to each of these questions is negative to one degree or another.  Rarely have I read such legislation which is so lacking in focus, purpose or meaning.  It is difficult to believe that the Minister, with her wide educational experience, could have got this Bill so wrong. While we will probably never know the full truth in this regard, the Bill does not do justice to the Minister and she has a unique opportunity to show her political maturity and sense of responsibility by withdrawing it before this nonsense proceeds any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before examining a number of sections of the Bill which are particularly appalling, I want to make some general comments regarding the lead-up to its presentation.  In particular I want to make a point I have made a number of times before in this House as we consider major proposals across a wide range of ministries.  It relates to the fact that so little meaningful preparatory work seems to be carried out before a Minister sets about designing a new Bill.  In particular, scant regard seems to be paid to researching the matter in depth before attempting to identify the best way forward.  In the context of this Bill, for example, is it not vital that we at least receive a detailed assessment of <Col N="1176" /> the role and operation of the Higher Education Authority before we commit ourselves to significant new universities legislation?  In other words, will we ever audit the auditors?</P>
    <P>This lack of assessment of the HEA's structure and operational performance is a major deficiency in the lead up to this Bill.  Similarly, we should have comprehensive research information on the performance of each of our universities over the past decade and a detailed list of substantial problems encountered by each such institution.  In this way we will be able to assess the major developmental challenges facing our third level institutions and be in a position to assess the level and quality of self-assessment in each institution.  How otherwise are we to come to any meaningful evaluation of the overall performance of our third level institutions?</P>
    <P>We have not had the benefit of a planned build-up to this vital legislation.  We can only guess that this critical homework was not done by the Minister before she put pen to paper on this appalling Bill.  I will now examine some of its details to highlight some of its many failings, large and small.</P>
    <P>At an early stage in the Bill there is evidence of the core importance of the Higher Education Authority in the operation of the overall third level sector.  Sections 8 and 9 outline its key advisory role in determining and assessing the merits of either incorporating an existing educational institution as part of a university or establishing additional universities.  Yet the Minister has not given us any assessment of the performance of the Higher Education Authority or indicated her position in terms of carrying out such a process.</P>
    <P>The objectives and functions of universities are outlined in sections 11 and 12.  In many ways the aims outlined in section 11 are aspirational.  For example, how precisely are the universities to &ldquo;promote the official languages of the State, with special regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and cultures&rdquo;?  The simple reality of modern university life is that there is an increasing division between the so-called traditional liberal disciplines and the more career oriented courses such as medicine, engineering, commerce and computer science.</P>
    <P>Before leaving section 11 I note with great disappointment that the most important objective of any institution of State does not rate a mention by the Minister.  This is the duty to cater equally for each citizen of the State.  In other words, our universities must promote the most important goal of all, namely, the provision of social justice and the elimination of poverty and deprivation. For long enough our universities were the preserve of the social elite.  As a Labour Minister for Education I am extremely disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to highlight such key duties of our universities.</P>
    <P>The Bill really hits a low point when it comes to the various sections dealing with the governance of universities.  The proposed balance <Col N="1177" /> on the various governing bodies is nothing short of disgraceful.  For example, while only approximately one-third of the permanent staff of some universities are employed as academics, nevertheless such staff have a hugely disproportionate representation on the governing bodies.  This provision is totally unjust to administrative, clerical, technical and maintenance staff.</P>
    <P>The fact that the academic community of each university already has an academic council in which to air its views adds to the insult inherent in the Minister's proposals.  As a former member of a governing body I am aware that the core issues for discussion at meetings are more focused on policy, direction and operational matters than on purely academic issues.  Consequently, if the governing bodies are to adequately represent the interests of staff, some degree of proportional representation is essential if the Bill aspires to be democratic.  Sadly, this is not the case in the current instance.</P>
    <P>It must be particularly upsetting for the predominantly female clerical and secretarial staff of the universities to read section 14 (9) which states: &ldquo;In performing its functions under this section a governing authority shall ensure that each sex is represented on the governing authority with such gender balance as may from time to time be determined or approved by the Minister&rdquo;.  How shallow and nonsensical this subsection is seen to be when a key section of staff, largely female, is left to fight for a few meagre seats on the governing body.  If the Minister decided to simply adopt basic democratic principles when setting out the representations on the various governing bodies she would not have to resort to empty posturing in terms of gender balance.</P>
    <P>As if she had not already shown enough contempt for simple fairness and equality towards the colleges' non-academic staff, the Minister seriously compounds the problem when she further attempts to interfere with their basic democratic rights.  For example, while it is proposed that graduates of the college should continue to have representation on the governing bodies through an electoral process, the Minister amazingly wants to prevent staff of the colleges taking part in this democratic process.  One must ask whether the Minister is aware of the basic constitutional rights of each citizen of the State. To attempt to prevent individuals from putting themselves forward, often at great personal expense, as candidates for open election to governing bodies clearly shows a level of insanity which surfaces from time to time in the Bill.  Such a proposal is an insult to all employees of universities, many of whom obtained their degrees through night study over many years.</P>
    <P>As if this was not enough by way of showing contempt for the many non-academic employees of our universities, the Minister further proposes that such college employees should be prevented from co-option to the governing bodies as a <Col N="1178" /> matter of right.  This proposal is disgraceful and seems to be aimed at preventing independent minded and informed people in the universities making a vital contribution to the democratic operation of their institutions.</P>
    <P>I can only repeat my total outrage at the Minister's grossly unbalanced proposals in relation to this most important aspect of the governance of our universities.</P>
    <P>As if there might be some mistake in this regard, the Minister shows her lack of insight into the internal operation of our third level institutions when she addresses the issue of who should chair meetings of the governing authority. It is vital that the role of the chairperson and chief executive should be separated at all times. Our modern third level institutions are far too large &mdash; often comprising 20,000 or 30,000 students and staff &mdash; to allow a single individual to act as both chief executive and chairperson of the governing authority.  However, the Minister has decided to allow such a practice to continue. Does she not have the slightest concept of what happens when such a concentration of power is allowed?</P>
    <P>My eager anticipation of this Bill has turned into great disappointment at a major opportunity lost.  When I consider the appalling inequality in participation rates at third level education across our community, my disappointment turns to anger.  For example, even though the State's expenditure <i>per capita</i> on third level education far exceeds that at either primary or secondary level, the difference in participation rates between affluent and working class communities can vary as high as 20:1.  Incredibly low levels of third level participation rates are evident, for example, in many areas of my constituency.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, I played a leading role in persuading the Taoiseach at the time, Deputy Albert Reynolds, to provide State support for a £20 million extension of UCC to Our Lady's Hospital and its 50 acre site on the north side of Cork city.  The proposal had a number of clear advantages.  These included Government support, proximity to the existing campus, generous parking and developmental space, and a very affordable cost estimate of approximately £20 million from a highly respected Cork firm of quantity surveyors.  Despite almost unanimous governing body support, the project was turned down by the Higher Education Authority with little or no explanation other than a brief statement suggesting a real cost in the region of £40 million.  To this day I await clarification of the precise mechanism employed by the Higher Education Authority in coming to its decision.  If the principles of openness, accountability and transparency have any value, surely such information should be readily available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Universities Bill, 1996.  It <Col N="1179" /> provides for the designation of University College Cork, University College Dublin, University College Galway, and Maynooth as constituent universities of the National University of Ireland.  It also marks the first overall legislative assessment of our universities since the Irish Universities Act, 1908.  This is an opportunity for the House to consider the role of third level education in our changing society. Most of the universities predate the foundation of the State.  Exceptions are the University of Limerick and Dublin City University, established by Fianna Fáil in 1989.  These and other third level colleges, for example, the more recent regional technical colleges have served this country well.  All third level institutes have responded to social change and have been willing to have due regard to the needs of citizens and the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us proposes to lay aside university charters and to supersede existing contracts of employment.  If the Bill, as drafted, is accepted it will set precedents that can be applied to both the organisations and the terms and conditions of employment that apply, regardless of existing agreements.  It cannot avoid legal problems with regard to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Universities thrive on freedom.  Many have attracted large-scale private research funds.  Why the need for tighter State interference?  It is accepted across a wide spectrum that we are getting good value for money from our universities and third level colleges.  They have to meet the challenge of the marketplace, despite the large element of State funding which will never be sufficient for all they want to do.  The people involved in our universities are best placed to judge what is required without further State involvement.</P>
    <P>Financial autonomy is an integral part of the universities' independence.  Structures are already in place for a supervisory role in ensuring that public moneys are spent to the best advantage and are properly accounted for.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993 and the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971 are tried and tested instruments of financial accountability.  No Deputy in this House believes that universities should be exempt from public scrutiny, given that they qualify for public funding.  The President and Provost is already the chief accounting officer, and the accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts.  The Higher Education Authority already exercises extensive controls on salaries, curriculum and development, student entry requirements, staff numbers and structures and campus developments.  It is already entitled to any information or records it requires from the many universities, to attach whatever conditions it wants to university budgets and to demand that budgets be adhered to.  As a result of this Bill, these powers will be duplicated.</P>
    <P>The colleges have been most successful in <Col N="1180" /> drawing up and implementing unique financial packages which have been instrumental in securing sizeable contracts as well as private funding for new buildings and facilities.  For this achievement they deserve our congratulations, and the Government should support them in their efforts.  The Minister should encourage her colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider giving tax concessions to benefactors who donate substantial sums to our colleges.  In recent years, many individuals, companies and multinationals have contributed substantial sums as a result of appeals from the universities.  This trend should be encouraged.  Tax incentives would help to further increase donations.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of representations from students in Kerry who attend institutes of technology.  These institutes have been seeking full recognition for a number of years.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider their position as they are giving a tremendous service, and the Minister now has the chance to give them the recognition they are seeking.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the right idea when she decided to address the need for legislative change in the university sector.  Demand for places continues to exceed supply, and there is a growing and widespread awareness that some degree of third level education is always necessary for a number of reasons.  It provides those vital extra years of study which allows the student to come to terms with the increasingly complex issues which face young people as they make their way in the modern world.  The maximum level of education also greatly adds to one's chances of gaining meaningful and secure employment.  Thus the Minister had a free hand to contribute in a major way to the further development of our third level education provisions when she commenced work on her Bill.</P>
    <P>There were only two major clouds on the horizon in the sector.  The dominating influence of the points system continues, with its very serious negative side effects on second and third level education.  The lack of research into how this appalling blight on many young people's education and lives can be substantially reduced is one of the great scandals of modern Irish education.  I will cite two examples that illustrate the totally unacceptable face of this system.  A student who is excellent at just one subject, say, English literature, and gets an A on the relevant honours leaving certificate paper may not gain a much desired place on a BA course because of his or her performance in other subjects.  What a waste of talent.</P>
    <P>A second side effect is the impact of the points system on the manner of teaching in second level schools.  Who can deny that too great an emphasis is placed in the curriculum on subjects which are capable of being taught purely to maximise a student's points potential?  As a result vitally important subjects such as art and music fall by the wayside in relative terms.  Furthermore, <Col N="1181" /> minimal attention is paid to areas such as health, education, civics and preparation for life generally.  While all students suffer from the current lack of balance in our second level curriculum which is, to a large extent, due to the unacceptably high influence of the points system, those young people who do not go on to third level, by choice or out of necessity, have every reason to complain.  The system, which should be highly focused to ensure they receive a comprehensive preparation for life has instead placed great emphasis on a process which is ultimately of no value to them.</P>
    <P>The second factor the Minister should keep in mind as she addresses the needs of the third level sector is resources or, perhaps more properly, the perceived lack of available extra resources.  In this regard the Minister has to accept responsibility for her decision to abolish fees at third level irrespective of means.  While the idea that education should be free at all stages has a large degree of merit, the Minister's decision has to be assessed in the light of the need to promote social equality and justice in our society.  When making her very important decision in relation to third level fees, one has to wonder what the Minister's priorities were.  Did she in some way feel this decision would be of some benefit to those families who are most economically deprived in our society?  It would stretch credibility even beyond the ridiculous levels reached here last week to believe the Minister had any noble ideas of social justice in mind when abolishing fees.  The simple fact is that when the Minister allocated extra resources to many deserving middle income parents struggling to give their children every possible educational opportunity, she also gave an unexpected financial bonus to those who are most well off in our society.</P>
    <P>It is valid to suggest that education should be free irrespective of one's means.  However, it must be equally stressed that such a position is only tenable if each sector of society has a realistic opportunity of availing of our third level education services.</P>

      <P>i.  serious public concern arising from newspaper reports concerning alleged payments by, or on behalf of, Dunnes Stores Ltd. and/ or Mr. Ben Dunne to members of the Oireachtas and public officials in the period prior to December 31 1993, and</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> ii.  widespread public concern that the truth or untruth of the aforementioned newspaper reports should be established.</P>
    <P>Resolves that it is expedient that a Tribunal be established, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as adapted by or under subsequent enactments, and the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, to enquire urgently into, and report and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of public importance:</P>
    <P>i.  whether, and in what circumstances the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Michael Lowry, was in receipt of payments or other benefits made available by, or on behalf of Dunnes Stores Ltd. and</P>
    <P>ii.  whether newspaper reports published between November 25 1996 and December 6 1996, concerning alleged payments by Dunnes Stores Ltd. to, or for the benefit of members and former members of the Oireachtas or members of their immediate families and other public officials, or members of their immediate families, are true in substance, and what the motives and circumstances of any such payments were.</P>
    <P>And that the Tribunal be asked to report on an interim basis, not later than the tenth day of any oral hearings to the Taoiseach on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the number of parties then represented before the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the progress which has been made in the hearings and the work of the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the likely duration (so far as that may be capable of being estimated at that point in time) of the Tribunal proceedings;</P>
    <P>any other matters which the Tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Taoiseach at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P>And that the Taoiseach should inform the person selected to conduct the Inquiry that it is the desire of the House that the Inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible, and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it, and if possible, within 90 days.</P>

      <P>My party believes that the public have a right to know.  That is why the Progressive Democrats has put this motion before the House. <Col N="1183" /> A judicial inquiry is the only way in which the full facts can be brought out.  It is nearly two weeks since we heard of the alleged payments by Dunnes Stores to Deputy Michael Lowry.</P>
      <P>We all owe a debt of gratitude to the press for bringing these issues into the public domain.  I dissociate myself and my party from the attacks made on the professional integrity of some of the journalists reporting this story.  Surely we can recognise that a free press is a vital part of any democratic society.  Nearly two weeks have elapsed since the story first broke and there has been no satisfactory explanation from Deputy Lowry or the Taoiseach as to what really went on.  We have posed a number of simple and straightforward questions both inside and outside this House.  It is incumbent on the Taoiseach to provide answers to those questions on behalf of his former Minister and his Government.</P>
      <P>First, did Dunnes Stores pay over £200,000 for work done on Deputy Lowry's house?  Second, were the full details of this transaction notified to the Revenue Commissioners?  Third, did Mr. Ben Dunne, or any company in which he had an interest, benefit financially from any decision made by Deputy Lowry during his period as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications? Fourth, did any Fine Gael Member of the Oireachtas make representations to the Minister for Finance or his Department on behalf of Dunnes Stores or the Dunne family seeking changes in the tax laws?  Fifth, when did Deputy Lowry first become aware of the existence of the Price Waterhouse report and the import of its contents?  These are simple and straightforward questions, yet almost two weeks later we are still waiting for the answers.  Does anybody on the Government benches think these questions are difficult or complicated?  If they do, they should ask any of the ordinary taxpayers of this country where they got the money to buy their house.  It would not take them two weeks to give an answer.  They would not even need two minutes. We need straight answers to straight questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The electorate have a right to expect that political parties will keep their principles intact when moving from Opposition to Government. When in Opposition, Fine Gael, Democratic Left and, above all, the Labour Party took a long-term lease on the high moral ground.  For a while, it seemed as if the new morality would survive the transition to Government.  The resignation of Deputy Hogan and the demotion of Deputy Coveney led us to believe that the highest standards would be observed.  That was not to be the case.  Once Labour Party Ministers began to find themselves in the frame, the ground rules were quickly changed.  There was no question of resignation when the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, was found selling access to the Minister for Finance at £100 a go in the context of the 1996 budget.  There was no question of resignation when the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins <Col N="1184" /> used the head of a State body to raise funds for his constituency party in Galway West.  It was hardly surprising that there was no question of resignation last month when the Minister for Justice singlehandedly rewrote the laws of this country and proclaimed that nobody, least of all the Minister, is responsible for what happens in the Department of Justice.  Deputy Hogan must feel hard done by when he sees the cynical way in which other Members of this Government have dodged responsibility for their actions.</P>
    <P>The continuing fall in standards is all the more remarkable when the self-righteous way in which this Administration conducts itself is considered. No previous Government in the history of this State has made so much play of its commitment to openness, transparency and accountability, made such opportunistic use of ethics in public office as a political issue or so loudly proclaimed its moral superiority over its opponents.  Last week in this House the Tánaiste circulated a script in which he referred to one of the Opposition parties as &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;, a remark he was later forced to withdraw.  This is the Government that was to carry out its business as if behind a pane of glass.  It is time we sent for the window cleaners.</P>
    <P>The Government's handling of this affair has left a lot to be desired.  It began following the press revelations about the payments to Deputy Lowry, with the Taoiseach's preposterous suggestion that different ethical standards might apply to Opposition front bench Deputies as opposed to when that Deputy became a Minister. Despite his efforts to row back, the Taoiseach attached clear significance to the fact that the events concerned took place before Deputy Lowry became a Minister.  The Taoiseach showed himself to be out of touch with the mood of the times when it came to the disclosure of political contributions from Dunnes Stores.  At first, his party decided to say nothing.  Then, in the small hours of the morning, shamed by the frankness and openness of all the other parties in this House, he finally came clean and admitted Fine Gael had received £180,000 from Dunnes Stores. He said this money was received over a seven year period.  Perhaps he might use the opportunity of this debate to be more precise.  Is it not the case that the bulk of this money was paid in a short space of time in 1992 and 1993?  Is it not the case that these contributions resulted from Deputy Lowry's unorthodox relationship with Dunnes Stores, about which serious questions remain unanswered?</P>
    <P>During last week's debate on Minister Lowry's resignation, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, used his speech to launch a blistering attack on Dunnes Stores and the way in which the company deals with its staff. Apparently Deputy De Rossa has no difficulty sharing Government with a Fine Gael party financed by contributions from the same company.  At the heart of the present controversy lies a document listing payments by Dunnes <Col N="1185" /> Stores to various individuals, some private, some public, as alleged in our national newspapers. That document should be published in full and investigated in depth.  The people are entitled to no less.</P>
    <P>Only a public inquiry can achieve both of these objectives.  The public will not be satisfied with the kind of &ldquo;pass the parcel&rdquo; arrangement cobbled together by the Government.  The secretary to the Government will hand the document to a retired judge.  He will select certain names from it and hand it on to the Ceann Comhairle who will then hand it on to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges who will then hand it on to a sub-committee.  That sub-committee will have no power to investigate, compel witnesses, request documents or to censure.  The whole matter will be a damp squib. Money will be spent, time wasted and at the end of the day the people will be none the wiser as to what went on.  So much for openness, transparency and accountability.  Does anybody really believe that this ludicrous exercise in paper shuffling is an adequate response to the crisis of public confidence which now threatens the political system?  Mr. Buchanan is a fine upright individual and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is an excellent body.  It has a distinguished chairman in the person of the Ceann Comhairle.  Nobody is questioning their integrity or ability but without proper investigatory powers their efforts will be useless.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the political system is at a low ebb and it will not be restored if, in the middle of the biggest scandals in recent years, politicians are not willing to let the truth come out.  That simply will not wash.  This House has a duty to uphold the integrity of our democratic system, serve the public interest and ensure that all the facts are made available.  We have all the powers we need to discharge those duties and the only question is whether we have the political courage to use them to the full and face the truth they may reveal.  If so, there is one realistic option available to us: the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry, as provided for under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1921.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the beef tribunal it became fashionable in political and media circles to ridicule the whole idea of judicial inquiries.  The beef tribunal cost too much, it went on too long, it did not really get to the bottom of all the issues and the public interest was not adequately represented.  Everybody, it seemed, had their own legal representation at Dublin Castle except the taxpayer.  We have all learned from the shortcomings of the beef tribunal and the same mistakes will not be made again.</P>
    <P>The judicial inquiry is one of the most valuable tools a democracy has available to it when it comes to discovering the truth.  Would anybody question the very valuable work done by the Bantry Bay tribunal or the Stardust tribunal?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>In recent months, the Government instituted a <Col N="1186" /> tribunal of inquiry into the hepatitis C scandal. That decision was supported by everybody in this House, by the victims involved and the public.  It could be said that in setting up a tribunal the Government was belatedly responding to the mounting pressure of public opinion for such an inquiry.  That inquiry under Mr. Justice Finlay has made excellent progress to date.  Even those who were highly critical of the beef tribunal have been impressed by the efficiency with which the Finlay tribunal is going about its business.  Mr. Fintan O'Toole, a journalist with <i>The Irish Times,</i> who has taken a keen interest in the workings of both the beef tribunal and the hepatitis C tribunal has spoken highly of the achievements of the latter. Earlier this week he said the victims of the hepatitis C scandal had learned more in the first hour of evidence before the tribunal than they had in the previous two years.  The hepatitis C tribunal may be in a position to present an interim report to the Government very shortly and may complete its work by February or March 1997.  I know of no right thinking person who does not believe the tribunal is doing a valuable and important job in an efficient and effective manner.  The decision to establish that tribunal shows there is agreement that, in the appropriate circumstances, tribunals of inquiry are good and necessary.</P>
    <P>In the hepatitis C scandal the State poisoned thousands of innocent people.  In the Ben Dunne-Price Waterhouse-Deputy Lowry affair there is a fear that private money threatens to poison our whole democracy.  Are the circumstances serious enough to warrant a public inquiry?  I believe they are.  There are reports that very senior officials in the local government system, serving Members of the Oireachtas, senior officials in the political parties and a number of former Government Ministers may have received unorthodox payments.  In the absence of clarification and explanation the rumour mill is in overdrive.  Not only has a shadow of suspicion been cast over every single Member of the Oireachtas, the integrity of our whole system of parliamentary democracy is being called seriously into question. If these strange and exceptional circumstances do not warrant the establishment of a public inquiry, what does?  We are told that a tribunal of inquiry would take too long.  Our motion takes account of this criticism.  It stipulates that the tribunal's work should be carried out as speedily as possible within a target completion date of 90 days.  We are told that a tribunal of inquiry will cost too much, yet those people on the Government benches who do not want to spend public money on a tribunal are the people who want to spend millions of pounds of taxpayers' money funding political parties.  They are not prepared to spend public money to find out the truth but they are prepared to give public money to politicians so that they can pay for their election campaign.</P>

      <P>If Dunnes Stores is prepared to put millions of pounds into our political system surely this House should be able to find the money to investigate where that tax went and whether the transactions involved are legitimate and above board.  Is it not time the Government reconsidered whether it is getting its priorities right?  I clearly assert on behalf of the Progressive Democrats our view that we need a tribunal of inquiry because there is no other means of getting at the truth.  Full disclosure of the Price Waterhouse report seems increasingly unlikely. Even if it was published in full, that on its own would not be sufficient to answer all the questions and allay public suspicion.  One only has to look at the case of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry. The <i>Irish Independent</i> reported on Friday, 29 November that a bill of £208,000 for the extension and renovation of Deputy Lowry's family home was paid by Dunnes Stores in circumstances which were, to say the least, highly unorthodox.  Deputy Lowry said nothing.  The Taoiseach said it all happened before Deputy Lowry became a Minister and in any case he was sure there would be a full explanation of the whole matter.  Deputy Lowry resigned but no reason was given for his resignation.  Apparently he needed so much time to put together his explanation of what had happened that the rest of the Government could not be expected to wait. To the best of my knowledge, Deputy Lowry is the first Minister who resigned, not because he did wrong, but because it would take too long to explain what he did right.  This is hardly a satisfactory explanation for the resignation of a senior Cabinet Minister in a modern democracy.</P>
      <P>The weeks are going by and we are still awaiting Deputy Lowry's side of the story.  The situation with Deputy Lowry shows clearly that disclosure of the names and payments in the Price Waterhouse report will not be enough on its own. We need to know why the payments were made and whether they benefited individuals personally or political parties.  We will get nowhere unless there is some forum that has the power to call witnesses, to request documents, ask the hard questions and get answers to them.  The only forum provided for under legislation passed by this House, capable of discharging such a role, is a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      <P>What kind of issues should that tribunal address?  What kind of questions should it ask? It is important to have a full and comprehensive inquiry and one that merely resulted in the publication of a list of names would be useless. There are indications that some of the payments by Dunnes Stores may have been made to offshore companies or into bank accounts outside this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the money trail is a crucial part of investigations of this kind.  Past experience suggests that this will not be a simple and straightforward task.  There is simply no way a complex transaction of this kind can be properly investigated through the strange set of <Col N="1188" /> arrangements which have been put in place by the Government.  If transactions of this kind cannot be investigated then there is little or no point in having any investigation.  Why should one individual be &ldquo;outed&rdquo; for receiving £1,000 while somebody else gets away with £1 million because it was paid offshore?  Let us have a proper investigation and give it the resources to do the job properly.  If certain people were prepared to take pains to cover their wrongdoing surely then the State should be prepared to take pains to uncover it.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry should be so designed as to enable it to investigate fully the matters in hand.  In particular, it should focus on the following key questions.  Did Dunnes Stores or any member of the Dunne family make irregular payments to public officials and what benefits, if any, did they receive in return?  Did Dunnes Stores or any member of the Dunne family make irregular payments to politicians and what benefits, if any, did they receive in return?  Did Dunnes Stores or any member of the Dunne family benefit financially from contracts or licences awarded by Government Departments at any time in the past ten years?  Did Dunnes Stores or any member of the Dunne family meet the Department of Finance to discuss legislative changes that would reduce their tax liabilities and were any political representations made on their behalf in this regard?  These are all questions of the utmost public importance.  Only a properly constituted tribunal has the legal authority to get satisfactory answers to these and other relevant questions. Let us recognise that without adequate answers the integrity of our whole political system will be irreparably damaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <P>The Progressive Democrats tabled this motion because we are convinced that the loosely connected ramshackle process on offer from the Government by way of alternative, is fated to end in failure.  The Government amendment to this motion by the Progressive Democrats acknowledges as much because it is open to the proposition that in the last analysis an inquiry will have to be established.  It is not enough, however, to be open to that proposition. Surely now is the time for honest politicians to face up to the inevitable &mdash; that what is on offer cannot establish the truth and that something more radical with investigatory powers is required to establish the truth.</P>
      <P>From the beginning this party has insisted on a small degree of political accountability in this matter.  We have asked only for explanations and facts.  We have not called for anyone's resignation, public humiliation or the establishment of blame by lynch mob rule, whether in the form of the body politic, the media or the public at large. All we have asked for is that the public should know the basic facts of a controversy which has shaken the confidence of most voters in the political system of which we all form a part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> To begin with, this party was extremely careful before issuing any public statement on the Lowry affair.  Its spokesman contacted the Minister to allow him an opportunity of giving a personal explanation or offering any reason why no further comment should be offered at that time.  In a gesture which is unusual in the adversarial politics which characterise this Assembly, Deputy Molloy ensured that before he acted on the <i>Irish Independent</i> story he gave the then Minister, Deputy Lowry, an opportunity to give some account of what had happened.  Few people are ever given the opportunity of a fortnight in consultation with their lawyers and accountants to explain and document a defence when charged with activities which, on the face of them, amount to irregularity.  Deputy Lowry, by contrast, has not merely been extended every courtesy but far more than every reasonable facility to explain how £208,000 was spent on rebuilding his house and £50,000 in cash was sent to remunerate him. This facility was offered to him despite the scepticism of the public.  We await to this day some explanation from him for these events.  We were told by the Taoiseach that we should not ask him questions in this House which he was not ready to answer.</P>
    <P>I would ask a simple question of those who ask us why we would not wait.  If any of us were confronted by anybody in authority asking for an explanation of similar events, how would it be if we replied that we wanted two or three weeks to think about it?  Deputy Lowry has been extended not merely every courtesy but far more than reasonable facilities to explain why he cannot reply with speed to these charges which have been laid against him.  If these transactions were regular and above board one would expect at the very least they would have been accounted for in the books of Deputy Lowry's company or, alternatively, in his own books.  If he had been in a position to account for them in that way he would have been able to produce the books last Saturday week to those with whom he negotiated his departure from Government, and to explain to them that all was well.  If documentation of an above board transaction was available one would expect it to have been provided to the Taoiseach at Government Buildings last Saturday week, but it was not.</P>
    <P>Far from that, the threadbare excuse offered for the first ministerial resignation in the history of the State which was done without explanation, was that the exercise of demonstrating his innocence would have consumed too much ministerial time were he to retain office.  That explanation may be acceptable to the Taoiseach and, by definition, if so, it is also acceptable to Democratic Left which accepts everything the Taoiseach says.  It may also be acceptable to that most flexible of moral institutions, the conscience of the Labour Party, but it is not acceptable to anybody else.  Nobody believes the reason Deputy Lowry had to resign was that if he had retained ministerial office it would have <Col N="1190" /> precluded him from spending enough time to vindicate his innocence.</P>
    <P>That the Fine Gael Party is willing to shed a Minister for reasons too embarrassing to mention, is surprising enough for many people, but that it is willing to put in place the most ill-adapted mechanism for gauging the truth of the multitude of allegations that have followed in the train of Deputy Lowry's resignation, is not merely surprising but shocking to many people who expected more of that party.  Last week, when this party sought any mechanism &mdash; whether the appointment of authorised officers under the Companies Acts or a public inquiry &mdash; to bring into the open the full facts concerning suggestions that significant amounts of Dunnes Stores' assets had been diverted to the personal use of senior politicians and public figures, we expected to receive what we sought &mdash; some mechanism for establishing the truth.  If these suggestions were fantasy or rumour published by notorious scandal sheets it might be suggested that a more cautious approach was necessary.  However, senior and respected figures in the media have agreed on this common denominator of allegation which prompts us in the House to call for a serious investigation of such allegations as the least response.</P>
    <P>Judge Gerard Buchanan, whom I know and for whom I have the utmost regard, has been asked by the Government to perform not merely an unenviable or improbable task, but an outright impossible one.  He has been asked to look at 1,500 transactions in a time frame which, to borrow the Taoiseach's phraseology, would only permit a cursory examination, and to identify which of them is politically or constitutionally suspect.  He has been asked to carry out this function without any significant investigatory powers.  The most he can do is put before a Committee of this House a list of probable or <i>prima facie</i> infractions of standards of political behaviour.  That is after a process which is likely to last several weeks during which he seeks and receives written responses from some or all of the people whom he considers are or could be compromised by what is contained in that report.</P>
    <P>There is by repute nothing in the report which will establish categorically whether or not the more significant implications of this controversy are true or false.  If, for instance, one of the most commonly carried rumours is correct, that £1.1 million was directed in four instalments into a bank account in England which was established for the beneficial ownership of a senior political figure nothing has been given to Judge Buchanan by way of investigatory or moral power or even administrative structure to enable him to establish whether that rumour is correct.  Worse than that, if there is nothing in the report to identify who the beneficial owner of those accounts is, the judge has been given no function to make inquiries of those whom he suspects, on any grounds, may have some interest or connection with the matter.  The best we can hope <Col N="1191" /> for from Judge Buchanan is that he will be able to identify manifestly political contributions to the political process and improper contributions to public officials.</P>
    <P>That the public should be satisfied with a process which assumes that those who make improper payments are content to leave such transactions transparent and obvious to those who may later stumble on them stretches credulity beyond breaking point.  If improper transactions have taken place and payments were made to public officials, officer holders or former office holders, the least this House can expect is the establishment of an investigatory mechanism to consider the impropriety of such events.  It defies belief that a mechanism is being put in place which operates on the assumption that improper transactions are not disguised and can be investigated by merely sending a polite letter to those who appear to be involved.</P>
    <P>If we are dealing with impropriety, we should adopt measures designed to detect the impropriety we suspect may have been practised. The Garda are not asked to use polite inquiry forms in the detection of criminal offences and company inspectors or the Revenue Commissioners are not asked to investigate likely wrongdoing through the use of polite inquiries; they are given powers of investigation.  If it is reasonably suspected that wrongdoing is involved, we must put those empowered to make investigations in possession of the relevant records and material which can reveal such wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>The Government suggests that this House should allow those involved in considering this matter to take the equivalent of a feather duster into battle.  If public confidence in the political process requires a thorough investigation, Dáil Éireann should not offer the equivalent of a knitting circle as an investigatory arm.  If this House is serious about uncovering the truth, it must first put its hands on the means of establishing that truth.  If we expect voluntary co-operation or some form of acknowledgement from those who have been engaged in suspect transactions, the least we owe ourselves and the public is to put those charged with investigating this matter in possession of weapons to provide the means to establish the truth and breach the veil of formal denials and bland assertions of innocence.  However, we have done nothing of that kind.  If the Government is to be believed, we have put in place a process whereby the most on offer in connection with this matter is a dab of the feather duster.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the Government's proposals amount to a weak minded delaying tactic in the face of the inevitable.  In this case, the inevitable is that the people will demand of this generation of politicians a modicum of accountability and the plain unvarnished truth.  If the Government ever intended to conduct its <Col N="1192" /> business behind a pane of glass, the people are entitled to take a peek through that pane.</P>

      <P>On this issue above all, faced with a rainbow coalition of three parties which came together around a principle of political integrity, the people are entitled to an investigation of these matters which is not merely capable, with good luck, of establishing the truth but which is armed with the authority of the State to establish the truth of these matters beyond contradiction.  A Government which cannot explain the departure of one of its members for fear of imperilling the solvency of his personal company is in no position to give the people short rations on the truth when the battle is on to vindicate the integrity of the democratic process.</P>
      <P>The Government has stated that if this House acquiesces to the process it has offered to establish, it is possible that there will be a public inquiry in the fullness of time.  We are asked to accept that if Judge Buchanan identifies, from a flurry of correspondence with those named in the Price Waterhouse report, some names and facts of interest, these may be passed to the Ceann Comhairle and the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil and Seanad.  This may result in a sub-committee of either committee sitting in public to deal with these matters.  Neither committee or, by definition, a sub-committee can offer the people any investigatory mechanism.  If they are confronted with a bland denial, an assertion of innocence or a solicitor's letter stating that an individual does not intend to cooperate for fear that their reputation or the reputations of others will be compromised, those committees will face a blank wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is not merely engaging in positive thinking or optimism in asking us to acquiesce in the establishment of that process as the appropriate means to uncover the truth in what is a crisis of confidence in the political system.  It is asking us to engage in ludicrous overoptimism and blindness with regard to the realities of the situation.  If the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Jim Higgins, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, who represent the three parties in Government, believe that people who engage in serious wrongdoing will expose their private transactions to public view on receiving first class letters seeking polite responses, they underestimate this House and the people who are entitled to a detailed explanation of these matters.  The people are not demanding heads or victims; they are demanding the truth and are entitled to receive it.  They are also entitled to <Col N="1193" /> whatever consequences flow from establishing the truth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been concerned at all stages to achieve the early publication of the names of any politicians, public servants or political parties that might be contained in the Price Waterhouse report.  It has also been concerned to ensure that this is achieved on the most cost effective basis possible.  We believe that <Col N="1197" /> these twin objectives can best be achieved through the agreement made with Dunnes Holding Company.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell said the companies legislation might be an appropriate vehicle. Deputies will be aware that the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, carefully considered whether the powers under the Companies Act, 1990, could be invoked to secure the publication of the Price Waterhouse report.  This was suggested at an early stage by the Progressive Democrats and others.  While the powers under that Act may be relevant to some aspects of the report they would not ensure its publication.  The Progressive Democrats' motion which seeks the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry is premature.  The Government acknowledges that there is widespread public concern arising from media reports on the alleged contents of the Price Waterhouse report and we have acted to alleviate this.</P>
    <P>Members of the Progressive Democrats, having regard to their concern for restrictions on public expenditure, will acknowledge that the establishment of a tribunal on this matter would be very expensive.  We are led to believe from media reports that 1,500 names are listed in the report in respect of which payments were made by Dunnes Stores.  Are the Progressive Democrats seriously suggesting that a tribunal of inquiry would be in a position to quickly, or even within 90 days, secure the publication of the names of Members of the Oireachtas and other public officials as well as clarify the motives for and circumstances of any payments made to them by Dunnes Stores and the truthfulness or otherwise of the media reports?  If the details of 1,500 names and cheques had to be trawled through we would not see the results until the next election, let alone next Easter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us involved in politics regard the past couple of weeks as a bad time for politics and all political parties.  Media speculation surrounding the discovery of the Price Waterhouse report has cast a shadow of suspicion over everyone involved in politics and in public administration. For the overwhelming majority, that situation is unacceptable and untenable.  Two urgent and equally important tasks must be carried out, not simply by Government but by all of us charged with upholding the good name of politics and public administration to address that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue which affects public life is not simply a matter which can be resolved by Government because the erosion of public confidence in administration systems affects us all.  All the major political parties in this House have been in office in recent years and share responsibility to ensure there is public confidence in the way we do our business.  As a member of the Government <Col N="1199" /> and as the Minister charged with responsibility for local government, I know that Ireland has been extraordinarily well served by generations of people of high calibre and integrity working in public administration since the foundation of the State.  That is not to say we can now be complacent or less vigorous in terms of our scrutiny of the workings of Government.</P>
    <P>Our first task is to address the immediate suspicion that surrounds the much vaunted Price Waterhouse report.  It is the Government's intent and the House's wish to have the list of names of people in public life contained in that report &mdash; if such names are contained in it &mdash; published as soon as possible, but in a manner that is consistent with the tenets of natural justice and fair play.  On the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; this evening the leader of the Progressive Democrats unfairly suggested that this Government was not determined to publish the full facts.  Immediately after this issue arose last week, I discussed it with the leader of the Progressive Democrats.  She understood and accepted that the vast majority of people in this House wanted the same thing.  It is mean opportunism to make such a charge against the Government.  It is groundless and false and unworthy of a Member of this House for whom I have respect.</P>
    <P>The second task we are charged with collectively and for which I have responsibility is to change the way politics is funded.  We want to ensure open disclosure of all significant financial contributions to political parties, to provide for open disclosure of election expenses and the capping of such expenditure and to provide for a system of State funding for the political system in line with the practice in most European countries. The Supreme Court judgement has necessitated a different approach being taken to the matter of funding from that initially supported in the Electoral Bill.  The Government's advice is that all candidates and political parties must be treated equally when it comes to State funding of the political system.  I have worked over recent months to be mindful of the views of the Supreme Court and to revise the provisions of the Bill to give effect to that good advice.  I will bring specific proposals to Government tomorrow.  I have already received the Government's approval to proceed quickly to Committee Stage of this milestone legislation.</P>
    <P>There are three interrelated and equally important legislative measures which will in future be recognised as the bedrock of open Government.  The Ethics in Public Office Act is now the law of the land and each Member of this House and senior officials in Departments have already made declarations under it.  We all regard it as a safeguard to have our interests placed on the public record.  The Government will shortly publish the Freedom of Information Bill, which will be a substantial legislative measure to enable every citizen to overview the work of public administration at all levels.  The Electoral Bill, <Col N="1200" /> which deals with the conduct of politicians and political parties, will bring transparency to the system and help to restore public confidence which has been badly damaged in recent days and weeks.</P>
    <P>The motion puts forward different proposals to achieve the same objective.  It has been said in the House and outside it, particularly by the spokespersons for the Progressive Democrats, that there is a different agenda or objective for the people on this side of the House from those in Opposition in relation to getting all the facts into the open. That is wrong and the members of the Progressive Democrats who said it know that. The Government has sought to build an all-party consensus on any good proposal.  We are convinced that the proposal contained in the Government amendment is the most efficient route.  Even if it proves to be unsatisfactory, there is scope to take whatever further action is required.  We want to do it efficiently and effectively.  The only objective of Government is to get to the bottom of this matter.  That is what we are determined to do and that is what will be done.</P>

      <P>The circumstances which have faced the Government during the past ten days are unique in Irish politics and require a unique response. We know that copies of documents were produced by the <i>Irish Independent</i> concerning financial transactions involving the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Michael Lowry, and Dunnes Stores.</P>
      <P>We know that as a result of voluntary disclosures by the recipients, the Fine Gael party received contributions from Dunnes Stores, the Labour Party received a contribution from the same source during the last Presidential election and a number of individual politicians in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael also received financial support.  This is not improper or illegal, it has been part and parcel of the political-business relationship for generations.  How many journalists or citizens remember the famous Fianna Fáil TACA row 30 years ago, when there was much public foray and attempts by the Fianna Fáil Party to get the support of the business community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Virtually everything else we have heard in the past ten days has been based on rumour, speculation, gossip and innuendo, which may or may not be true.  Veiled allegations were made in certain newspapers against unnamed but clearly &mdash; in some circumstances anyway &mdash; identifiable political figures.  These <Col N="1201" /> claims were subsequently contradicted by other newspapers and in some cases qualified by those originally making the allegations.  Suggestions were made that there would be further sensational disclosures in the newspapers over the weekend but acres of newsprint failed to produce further significant facts.</P>
      <P>It was obvious from the beginning that it was necessary to establish the facts about a financial relationship between Dunnes Stores and politicians or other public figures as early as possible, as the continuing speculation and gossip had the potential to inflict enormous damage on the entire political process.  It was claimed in a succession of articles in different newspapers, that the allegations were based on a report from accountants, Price Waterhouse, apparently commissioned as part of an internal struggle within the Dunne family for control of the company.  It became clear that the publication of the relevant portions of this document was required to throw public light on the affair.  It also became clear that to publish a private report, made to a private business, in a way which protected private citizens and was seen to be fairly dealt with, required a series of safety precautions.</P>
      <P>During the past week the Government has put enormous effort, time and commitment into devising a mechanism that would facilitate the earliest possible publication of the relevant passages of the report.  There was no easy way to achieve this objective and anyone who suggests there was is seeking to fool the public.  There was no precedent for the Government's efforts.  This was a private report, commissioned into the internal affairs of a private company, and it was the private property of those on whose behalf it was commissioned.  Every potential course of action was fraught with legal and constitutional difficulties.  There were, by all accounts, politicians and other public figures referred to in the report, but there were also many private citizens who had a right not to have their good names impugned without evidence of impropriety.  There was clearly an obligation on the Government to ensure that nothing was done to compromise the public reputations of those people and that public representatives and their families were also ensured of at least a fair hearing.  A recent editorial referred to politicians as &ldquo;thieves&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Without the co-operation of Dunnes Stores, securing the publication of the relevant portions of the report would have proved enormously difficult and might never have been possible.  In the past, I have been critical of the business and labour relations practices of Dunnes Stores and I remain so.  Such practices have cost the taxpayer £1 million in the past 12 months.  However, when approached by the Government about the possibility of publication, they responded in a positive and constructive spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the agreement in principle with Dunnes Stores that the relevant portions of the <Col N="1202" /> report could be published, the Government, after considering all the options, decided the procedures set out in the amendment to the Progressive Democrats motion were the most appropriate, effective and speedy way to have the relevant names brought into the public domain. To have had the full report handed over to the Government to allow it to extract the relevant names would have left this Administration open to charges of selectivity or political favouritism. It was to avoid this that the Government sought an independent person of integrity and standing to discharge this task.  I have every confidence in the ability of the former Circuit Court Judge, Mr. John Gerard Buchanan, to promptly and effectively discharge the task given to him.</P>
    <P>What we are doing has a far better chance of achieving the desired result than any alternative approach suggested.  In addition, it must be emphasised that the agreement with Dunnes Stores does not preclude the Government from exercising a power or performing a duty or function conferred on it by or under statue. Neither does the course proposed by the Government preclude further investigation by whatever means are considered necessary by it and the Dáil or by any other relevant authorities after the publication of the facts in the Price Waterhouse report.  It is entirely reasonable that we should give this process an opportunity to work before we commit the State to embarking on possible courses that may prove legally dangerous, extremely costly and have no guarantee of success.</P>
    <P>Part of the negative response to the Government's proposal from some commentators and newspapers may arise because many of them are shifting their ground.  The universal demand last week from the media was for publication of the relevant sections of the Price Waterhouse report but, having quoted the report as the source of virtually all the allegations made last week, they seem to be suggesting that these claims may not be backed up by the document.</P>
    <P>I will deal now in more detail with the Progressive Democrats motion.  A week ago tonight, Deputy Harney demanded that the Government should invoke the Companies Act to send an inspector into Dunnes Stores to seize the Price Waterhouse report.  Presumably the highly paid senior counsel who shares the front bench with her has, in the interim, pointed out the difficulties involved in that course of action and Deputy Harney has now quietly dropped that demand in favour of a full blown tribunal of inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the eminent senior counsel and part-time <i>Sunday Independent</i> columnist has not warned her of the potential disasters lurking in her motion to establish a tribunal of inquiry.  A tribunal of inquiry along <Col N="1203" /> the lines proposed by the Progressive Democrats would be a potential disaster.  It is a recipe for prolonged hearings, with huge legal bills, and the real prospect of journalists ending up in jail, with no guarantee of satisfactory or complete answers at the end of the process.</P>
      <P>Some commentators have expressed concern that under the procedures proposed by the Government it may take a few weeks to get the relevant names from the Price Waterhouse report into the public domain.  A tribunal, as proposed by Deputy Molloy, is likely to be a far longer process.  I remind the House that while the motion to establish the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry was passed by the Dáil on 31 May 1991, it was more than five months later, on 7 November, before it could begin hearing evidence and it did not report until three years later.  The financial cost of that tribunal has still to be determined.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under the terms proposed by the Progressive Democrats and the precedents established by the Chief Justice when he was chairman of the tribunal into the beef industry, it appears that not only would anyone mentioned in the Price Waterhouse report &mdash; the number is believed to be approximately 1,500 &mdash; be entitled to legal representation at the tribunal but so also would every political party, newspaper and journalist who has written on this story in the past ten days.  The inevitable result would be an enormously costly and cumbersome tribunal. Irrespective of that, the Government is determined to establish the truth.  Our amendment does not preclude further investigation by whatever means considered necessary by the Dáil and Seanad or by other relevant authorities after publication of the facts in the report.</P>
      <P>Under the terms proposed by the Progressive Democrats, there is a danger that the tribunal would become an inquiry into the newspaper coverage of these events.  The terms specifically require the tribunal to establish &ldquo;whether newspaper reports...concerning alleged payments by Dunnes Stores Ltd.  to, or for, the benefit of Members and former Members of the Oireachtas or members of their families, are true in substance&rdquo;.  To establish whether newspaper articles were true in substance, it would be necessary to call the journalists who wrote them to give evidence and be cross-examined.  Issues would certainly arise about confidentiality of sources, privilege and so on, and conflict between the tribunal and the journalists concerned would be inevitable.  Is this what the Progressive Democrats want?</P>

      <P>The decision of the Government to appoint former Judge Buchanan to examine the Price Waterhouse document and <Col N="1204" /> report to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges on his findings was merely one part of the Government's response to the public concern regarding the reports of financial contributions from the business sector to political parties.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, has already dealt with the electoral Bill.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats were quick to point the finger at other parties in respect of contributions by Dunnes Stores to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, but it remained remarkably quiet about its successes in respect of funding from the business sector.  If they are as enthusiastic as they claim about openness and accountability in this area, why do they not set a headline for other parties by making a voluntary disclosure of all contributions they have received over the past 12 months which would have required disclosure had the electoral Bill been enacted?</P>

In the first instance, we had Deputy Harney weeping crocodile tears for the plight of Dunnes Stores workers &mdash; the same Deputy Harney who is an apostle for the Hong Kong economic model, that is, low pay and low social protection &mdash; but nothing illustrates the hypocrisy of the Progressive Democrats more than their approach to the electoral Bill.  The public position of the Progressive Democrats on State-funding of political parties is totally at variance with the position they adopt in private.  During the Second Stage debate on the electoral Bill the Progressive Democrats indicated that they were opposed to the principle of public funds for political parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The last ten days have raised serious question marks over the integrity of our public life.  It is our job as politicians to protect and vindicate our democratic system, and to revive public confidence which is at a low ebb. Nothing produces more public cynicism than a failure to live up to promises of greater openness, accountability and high standards in public life.</P>
      <P>It is as well to remind ourselves of the immediate cause of the present disquiet.  A report, which has not been contradicted to this day, was published in the newspapers that a Minister, who at the time was chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party and the party's chief fund-raiser, had received £208,000 for the extension and renovation of his home in a manner that was falsely accounted for.  The Minister resigned 48 hours later.</P>
      <P>I regard as a grave public scandal the fact that this House has still not been given any satisfactory explanation of this matter, and that the Fine Gael Party has not demanded one.  The public simply does not understand how anyone, least of all a Minister, is unable to explain credibly, within a very short space of time, how he financed improvements to his house.  An incomplete, complex, convoluted explanation constructed long after the event will have less and less credibility as time goes by.  It is clear that he did not furnish a declaration of interest to the Taoiseach on his appointment.  The longer a satisfactory explanation is outstanding, the more the question arises as to whether Deputy Lowry, former chairman of Fine Gael, is a fit person to be a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>After the Deputy Lowry affair, the wider ramifications of the report captured public attention.  It was legitimate to ask whether anyone else in public life benefited in similar manner from Ben Dunne's largesse, especially as others were named in the Price Waterhouse report but it was very wrong to engage in rumour and innuendo in an attempt to deflect attention from a highly embarrassing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one instance, at least, an abject apology has been made.  It was incumbent on all parties to ask questions of their Oireachtas members.  Assuming that every Member of the Oireachtas has answered truthfully, we may have many of the answers at this stage.  The Fine Gael Party and its individual members appear to have received over £400,000, whereas Fianna Fáil and Labour, as far as I can ascertain, each received between £15,000 and £20,000.  Publication of the report, or relevant sections of it, may provide further clarification of that discrepancy.  A complicating factor may be <Col N="1207" /> that some of the payments acknowledged by different parties are not, in fact, contained in the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
    <P>The payment of £208,000 for the <i>prima facie</i> personal benefit of Deputy Lowry &mdash; we are still awaiting explanations &mdash; led to his resignation.  It is important to clarify urgently whether any other Member of the Oireachtas, past or present, or, indeed, any member of the wider public service was in receipt of similar payments not clearly and exclusively linked to legitimate political expenses. It was for that reason that I called last week for publication of the Price Waterhouse report.  At my request, the Tánaiste contacted the Dunne family, who have agreed, in principle, to release such details as are relevant to our public life, with the relevance being determined by a retired High Court Judge.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners, on the other hand, will, I presume, be making full use of the entire report, or at least those parts listing the 1,500 transactions, to ensure that the transactions conform fully with the tax code, if necessary, retrospectively.</P>
    <P>The procedure announced by the Government is not satisfactory.  The judge will sift through the report and quickly identify the names of any Members of the Oireachtas.  He then proposes to write to them seeking a written explanation.  I hope this will be done promptly.</P>
    <P>I will be urging any member of my party who receives such a letter to reply promptly to it.  I would like to see the names and any correspondence before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as soon as possible.  A committee or subcommittee of the House can obviously summon before it Members of the Oireachtas and question them on payments received either individually or on behalf of their party.  This work should be carried out and completed promptly.  We need to have as much of this as possible clarified quickly.  I would expect Members to be upfront and comprehensive in their explanations.  I do not want to hear the excuses for not giving information and the prevarication that we had following the resignation of Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <P>The public interest comes before the private interest, and that is an obligation accepted by anyone who comes into this House.  It is right that all the names should be known to the public, irrespective of whether this is convenient for the persons concerned.  All the information should be given, whether or not it is explicitly contained in the Price Waterhouse report.  Such an approach is necessary to restore confidence in the integrity of our public life.</P>
    <P>However, the ramifications go beyond current Members of this House.  There may be others involved.  Public officials may be named.  The reality is that they are not answerable to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or a subcommittee, and most probably they would be strongly advised by lawyers not to accept its <Col N="1208" /> jurisdiction in the absence of proper legal procedures and safeguards.  There are no lawyers, no compellability of witnesses or no immunities such as would be enjoyed by someone appearing before a tribunal.  Furthermore, while a committee of the House can seek information and ask questions, it cannot make findings. Indeed, it would be wrong for any committee run by a political majority to seek to act in a quasi-judicial manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the hesitation about establishing a public tribunal.  The beef tribunal, in particular, was a hugely expensive exercise and it is doubtful if its findings justified the inordinate cost and length of time involved. On the other hand, the Hepatitis C tribunal is clearly doing an essential and thorough job investigating a grievous wrong done by an agency of the State to private citizens.</P>
      <P>Unless there was very full voluntary co-operation by everyone involved, beginning with Deputy Lowry, it is difficult to see how a tribunal can be avoided.  The people who could be called before it include present and former public representatives and officials.  Inquiries cannot be limited to named individuals and amounts in the relevant categories in the Price Waterhouse report.  Efforts should be made to determine whether any cash or under the counter payments were made to them, to others on the list or to people who were not on it.  Now that questions have been raised because of the dubious nature of a large under the counter payment to Deputy Lowry we need a full and comprehensive account of the transactions.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ben Dunne would be a key witness at any tribunal.  While there has been heavy media concentration on the political aspects of the report, it is important to ascertain that no public officials, whether engaged in the planning process or otherwise, have received <i>ex gratia</i> payments from one of our largest retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the issues dispassionately and objectively relating to party funding.  At an instinctive level I have some sympathy with the position of Mr. Kevin Boland who, writing in the early 1980s, regretted Fianna Fáil's change from being &ldquo;the small man's party&rdquo;, totally dependent on the small subscriptions from each parish in the national collection, to being as he put it &ldquo;financially patronised by the bosses&rdquo;.  He recalled that for years it had been &ldquo;a proud Fianna Fáil boast that they won elections at a fraction of the cost at which Fine Gael and Labour lost them&rdquo;.  It is certainly healthier to have many smaller contributions rather than a few large ones.  At the same time, our society and political system has become more complex, elaborate and more ambitious.  One of our successes is that the standard of living of so many people has been raised and most of the large group of respectable men and women who did <Col N="1209" /> not previously own property now own some, even if it is only their homes.</P>
    <P>People expect a higher quality in their democratic life.  Undoubtedly, this costs money. There is nothing wrong with seeking a greater contribution from those who have rather than from those who have not.  The business community has benefited from greater prosperity. Inevitably, it is asked to contribute more, not only to political life but to cultural and sporting life and to many other public causes.  People contribute money to churches, clubs and charities and also to political parties.  As a general rule, there is no expectation of any specific return other than, perhaps, general goodwill.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of supposed privileged access but, as the Chair knows from his long experience of public life, Irish politicians are among the most accessible in the world to people of all classes and backgrounds.  That applies to members of all political parties and to those who are not members of a party.  It is certainly not necessary to pay anything to come into contact with a politician or get a fair hearing.  Ministers could not afford politically to support a poor case just because of where funding comes from.  Any exceptions to this, such as acceptance of a payment linked to particular contracts, budgetary or planning decisions or the suggestion that arose in the past that large sums of money could be made available to change the leader of a party, would constitute serious political corruption.  I also include in that any insider dealings, for example, in the case of a competitive contract where a favoured firm might be tipped off about the tender proposed by a competitor.  There has been recent controversy about certain public contracts.  It is an area where the greatest care and most rigorous precautions are required because it has been a source of corruption in many European countries not to mention the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>In a well-ordered democracy the only gifts a politician should legitimately receive are public tokens of appreciation or mementoes of insignificant financial value at meetings with foreign visitors or at public functions.  The reason we have ethics in Government legislation is to ensure we outlaw what we regard as unethical. The public want the funding of political parties to be open and transparent, especially any large financial contributions.  A ceiling of £4,000 for a contribution to a party and £500 to an individual was included in the draft legislation and amounts beyond that would have to be declared.  When the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, was preparing that legislation, I said I believed that was about right.  On the other hand, it was proposed that in regard to amounts over the allowances given to party leaders, essentially for back-up services and research, the taxpayer should step in and fill the gap.  Apart from the complications of the McKenna judgment, I agree with the point of view that political parties are voluntary organisations and, broadly speaking, <Col N="1210" /> should not be funded by the taxpayer, but there is a choice to be made.  If we want to reduce the level of dependence on private contributions and do not want our political parties to be heavily in debt, the element of State funding has to be reviewed.  There is a huge imbalance in resources between the Government and the Opposition. The parties in Government <i>de facto</i> receive heavy, unquantifiable levels of State funding already.  Programme managers and advisers are already costing up to £15 million per year. Therefore, it is right that State funding should be weighted towards the Opposition, as happens at present.  It is important to have a level political playing pitch.  The existence of an Opposition is what distinguishes democracy from other forms of Government.  Its duty is to act as a watchdog for the public interest and keep the Government on its toes.</P>
    <P>We should not give any impression in this House that we are afraid of the truth or that we want to bury the whole affair.  We, on this side of the House, want the whole truth to come out, regardless of what may be revealed.  We need to establish quickly that Deputy Lowry's affair was an aberration and not the norm.  We also need to tighten up our safeguards, proceed with the electoral funding Bill and conduct a review of the ethics in Government legislation.  We need a good deal less of the rhetoric of the high moral ground in the future and more in the way of efficient and comprehensive safeguards which are a normal part of the political landscape.</P>
    <P>Ministers and politicians also need to look very carefully at any aspect of their activities that could undermine public confidence in our democratic system and bring in whatever reforms may be necessary.  Tomorrow night we will support our amendment and that in the name of the Progressive Democrats but, needless to say, that will not be the end of it.  I appreciated the briefing given to our party the other night, but I look forward to members of the Government spelling out precisely how this matter will be dealt with.  That has not been done yet.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to participate in this debate.  Like my party leader, I thank the Progressive Democrats for accepting the amendment tabled by our party.  They were accused by the Government over the weekend of making a quick judgement on its proposal.  We decided to take our time over it to see exactly what the Government was proposing.  The word &ldquo;bewildered&rdquo; was used in our press briefings and bewildered we were, but the position has become a little clearer during the past few days.  The last sentence spoken by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, that the only objective of the Government is to get to the bottom of this matter and that is what it is determined to do, stands out in the contributions <Col N="1211" /> of Government speakers tonight.  With all due respect to him, I believe he was saying that with his tongue firmly in his cheek.  I recall it is only about a fortnight since the Tánaiste said more or less the same about the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in regard to the paper shuffling exercise that went on between the Cabinet and her Department, yet we still do not have any accountability in that regard.</P>
      <P>This is the Government that came into office with a spirit of openness, transparency and accountability and compared itself to a pane of glass.  We, on this side of the House, are somewhat tired of listing all the great promises it made in its Programme for Government.  One promise that has not been acted upon, despite a number of issues arising during the past two years which could have been addressed by it, was the setting up of a committee of investigation.  We need only refer to the travails of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, about surveillance.  Why did the Government not set up such a committee to deal with all the other incidents that happened during the past two years and, particularly, this one?  No Minister has mentioned what I consider to be the most important legislation required to get at the truth of this matter, the privilege and compellability of witnesses Bill which the Government brought forward under pressure.  I tabled 11 amendments to that Bill but I am still waiting for it to come before the House.  Without it, no committee of the House will have the teeth needed to investigate matters and neither will the type of committee being proposed by the Government in this instance.  One often hears the question &ldquo;who guards the guard?&rdquo; The Government is proposing, in effect, that Deputies should investigate Deputies, former Deputies and Senators and members of their families.  We cannot accept this because it would send all the wrong signals and leave us open to the jibe from the general public that we have something to hide.  As somebody said, this is a whitewash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  My party's spokesperson, Deputy Keogh, has outlined our position on the substance of the Bill. I as the Minister for Education to give serious consideration to a particular matter, that is, conferring university status on the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would expect the Minister to engage in a comprehensive consultation process before bringing forward major legislation but that did not happen in this case.  Few Bills brought forward in recent years have caused as much <Col N="1212" /> controversy and met with such a hostile response as this one.  This lack of consultation explains why it makes no reference to the Dublin Institute of Technology which is one of our most important and long-established third level educational institutions and which, since January 1993, has been an independent entity with its own governing body.  Its constituent colleges include some of the best names in the field of technological education, including Bolton Street and Kevin Street.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology has 10,000 full-time students with a further 12,000 engaged in part-time studies.  This makes it the largest third level educational in the State. Out of a total of 22,000 students, 4,500 are pursuing degree and postgraduate courses.  This puts it on a par with St. Patrick's College, Maynooth in terms of degree student numbers.</P>
    <P>Under legislation introduced in 1992, the Dublin Institute of Technology was given the right to make its own awards at certificate and diploma level.  It does not award its own degrees although it has the legal power to do so but this requires an order to be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>An international review group set up by the Minister was asked to report on the matter earlier this year.  It reported that the Dublin Institute of Technology &ldquo;demonstrated a level of maturity which justifies a recommendation that it be granted authority to award its own degrees&rdquo;.  It recommended that full degree awarding powers be extended with effect from the 1998-9 academic year.  The National Education Convention had previously recommended in its report that responsibility for the institute be transferred from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority.  The review group further recommended that the Universities Bill be amended to take account of its findings; in other words, it was signalling that the Minister should give consideration to granting the institute university status.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not contain any good news for the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Effectively, its interests have been ignored or overlooked. The Minister could have taken the opportunity to take a radical initiative, that is, to create a new university but she decided not to do so.  My party believes this matter should be considered in more depth on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, there is a clear case for awarding the Dublin Institute of Technology university status.  It is strongly committed to research and development and operates a number of specialised units and campus companies.  It has good external links with both the private and public sector but its capacity to develop as a technological institute is severely limited because it does not enjoy university status.  For instance, it cannot have visiting professorships or professorships associated with industry.  This is a major drawback for an institution which, perhaps, has the closest relations of any educational body with industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> Awarding the Dublin Institute of Technology university status would rid it of the perception from which it suffers both at home and abroad. Because of its name and peculiar status and a certain amount of conservative academic snobbery, it is perceived as being something less than a true university.  Yet, its graduates collect the same parchments as those who attend our fully fledged universities.  This is unfair on the students of the institute and their parents who make sacrifices to send them there.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government gave consideration to putting the Dublin Institute of Technology on an equal footing with the universities.  I can only assume the Minister does not want to create another university because it would lessen the centralised control which both she and her Department exert over the third level sector.  The thrust of the Bill when put forward originally was bureaucratic and centralising.  Institutions which had enjoyed autonomy, in some cases for centuries, were to be subjected to ministerial interference and central Government control to an unprecedented degree.  Much of this has blown up in the Minister's face.  Even the Higher Education Authority has come out against her proposals.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology must be encouraged to develop as a centre of excellence in the field of technological education at third level.  The best encouragement it could receive from the Government is elevation to university status.  This issue should be considered on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Like many other contributors from this side of the House, I am critical of the Minister and the Government for the manner in which they have proceeded with this legislation, the purpose of which is to put new structures in place to allow the universities to confront the challenges they will face in the next century.  If enacted in its present form, it will restrict and constrain their ability to do so.  It is an unacceptable attack on their academic freedom.</P>
      <P>All our universities, with the exception of Limerick University and Dublin City University, predate the foundation of the State.  It is worth noting that Limerick University and Dublin City University were granted such status by a Fianna Fáil Administration in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill contains a number of acceptable provisions, the Government has failed to award the Dublin Institute of Technology university status.  This is a glaring omission and should be rectified on Committee Stage.  The Government should consider the case put forward by the institute.  Its six constituent colleges have 13,500 full-time equivalent students, including 4,500 <Col N="1214" /> pursuing degree or postgraduate courses.  Its recognition as a university is logical.</P>
    <P>Granting university status to the Dublin Institute of Technology would be in accord with the recommendations of the international review group set up by the Minister last year.  There is no apparent reason for the Minister not acting on these recommendations and transferring funding and responsibility for overseeing the institute from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority as recommended by the review group.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes the real reason the Minister has refused university status has more to do with concentrating power in the Department than doing what is best for our universities and colleges.  This is reflected in the Bill as published. It seeks to curb the independence of our universities and to bring them more under the control of the Minister and the Higher Education Authority.  Is it any wonder the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, in an article, called this Bill &ldquo;Thatcherite&rdquo; in its basic lack of understanding of what universities are about? Fianna Fáil is committed to repealing this legislation, if enacted, on return to power.  The Bill is fatally flawed and should be withdrawn immediately.</P>
    <P>All third level institutions have responded to social change and have served the needs of students very well.  Governments of the late 1960s and early 1970s are to be commended for their foresight in what is a growth area in education.  I recall when it was the exception rather than the rule for students to go to third level education, and I would like to see even more students going on to third level.  Considering that in 1908 there were only 4,000 students attending universities, in 1960 there were 10,000 and today there are up to 50,000, we are making progress.  For an individual to progress in today's world, a good basic education is very important.  The quality and standard of education by third level institutions provides a good basis for life.</P>
    <P>The success of many universities in recent years has attracted private investment, which is very welcome, but much greater investment is needed if we are to maintain the standards attained in the past ten to 15 years.  The quality of education will deteriorate if the Minister insists on pushing through this Bill.  She should take cognisance of our proposals on Committee Stage.  While there are many good aspects to the Bill, I ask her to consider its deficiencies.</P>

Ritheadh Billí i 1929, 1971, 1991 agus 1993 ach go háirithe a raibh tionchar acu ar chúrsaí oideachais ollscoile agus déanfaidh mé tagairt do chuid acu amach anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mór an trua nár ghlac an tAire leis an deis stairiúil seo atá aici chun Bille fiúntach a chur os ar gcomhair.  Ní chreidim gur féidir an Bille seo a <Col N="1215" /> leasú agus molaim dí agus don Rialtas é a tharraingt siar agus ceann nua a chur in a áit.  Ba chóir dí barúil na n-ollscoileanna agus a lucht riartha a chur san áireamh sa Bhille nua agus meas éigin a chur ar a neamhspleachas.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sections in the Bill about which I am concerned but because of time constraints I will be unable to refer to all of them. Section 9 empowers the Government to declare an institution to be a university under the terms of the Bill.  A very strong case can be made for the Dublin Institute of Technology to be elevated to university status, as recommended by the international review group.  Many speakers referred to that matter and outlined the case in some detail.  The extraordinary record of the Dublin colleges of Dublin Institute of Technology since the last century ought to have been recognised in the Bill.  The role of parents and students in seeking the upgrading of those colleges is commendable and illustrates good relations between the various elements of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.</P>
    <P>There is much room for outreach courses as part of the third level system.  Because of the decline in population, with spare classrooms and extra teachers in many locations, at least first year of a large number of courses could be accommodated in second level campus buildings in virtually every county.  There is huge potential for savings of taxpayers' money and for access to third level courses for a greater number of school leaves and particularly for women who wish to rejoin the workforce.  The Minister will be aware &mdash; I was in contact with her about this matter &mdash; of an attempt to have an outreach course provided in Ennis.  Limerick regional college has agreed to that, but because deliberations are awaited no progress can be made on that issue.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 set out objectives and functions of universities in a manner which fails to acknowledge the unique features of the university as an independent institution in society.  The provision in section 11(d) that universities shall promote the English language is amazing and is in direct conflict with the University College Galway Act, 1929.  Section 11 (e) raises questions of a fundamental nature regarding the relationship between universities and the Government of the day in the area of economic policy.  In section 11(f) the word &ldquo;higher&rdquo; is used in such a context as to remove any role for universities in the education of na gnáthe daoine.  In section 11(g) the phrase &ldquo;and quality of&rdquo; is tautology.  The language in several sections is imprecise, sometimes to the point of being meaningless.  It is difficult to believe that nobody within Cabinet took exception to various provisions in sections 15 to 22.  The lack of trust inherent in the Bill is not a good basis for a healthy partnership in the future.</P>
    <P>Contracts of employment have been entirely scrapped for many employees of universities, particularly in sections 22(5) and 29(3).  The status <Col N="1216" /> of current agreements with these members of staff has been undermined and questions remain regarding superannuation rights &mdash; there is probably an illegality here.  This matter should be cleared with staff before we proceed with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The right to academic freedom is fundamental in any university.  The Bill fails to realise the outstanding contribution made by universities to academic, artistic, cultural, economic and social life.  There is huge untapped potential which can be realised only in the context of academic freedom.  The whole area of research and development has been, sadly, underfunded. Universities have sought to rise above this mediocrity with commendable success and they should be encouraged.  The assistance available for post graduate research and development students is paltry.</P>
    <P>Several European universities are among the institutions which have survived since the reformation.  The fundamental attack on the independence of universities is a negation of their role.  Monasteries have a long and distinguished record of providing education for the children of Europe.  That type of education should be restored because there are many advantages for the country, including cultural, touristic, financial and the promotion of peace and understanding at home and abroad.  Universities have a role in improving the way in which the country is perceived and its place in the developing world.</P>
    <P>In section 28 the Minister has power to override university charters.  This provision, as well as many others, differs in several important respects, particularly in regard to independence and staff matters, from the proposals for university legislation in 1995.  The Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, provides for wide Government control of universities and under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, all university accounts are verified.  Will this Bill so undermine universities as to reduce them to a drab grey landscape?  The ethos of Trinity College and Maynooth appear to be recognised somewhat grudgingly, but what about the other colleges?  How can representatives who are appointed rather than elected represent those whom they are supposed to represent?</P>
    <P>Section 31 refers to quality assessment.  This is one of the few areas in which I agree with the general thrust of the Bill.  The current discussions between the Higher Education Authority and the conference of heads of universities ought to be built on rather than ignored.  Section 14 deals with the role of public representatives in management in education.  Nobody could better act as guardians of taxpayers' money than public representatives, many of whom have played a great role in encouraging and promoting innovative ideas on the political stage on behalf of universities.  Public representatives acknowledge that other groups should be represented on governing bodies.  In regard to Dublin universities in particular there is a need to increase the size of the bodies to facilitate that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> The Third Schedule provides that no more than two consecutive terms may be served by a member and if people lose their council seat they are debarred from membership.  Since that is not provided for in the case of the Oireachtas I strongly caution against its inclusion in the Bill. I welcome the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party is opposing the Bill and has undertaken to repeal it in the future because I fear for the implications of this Bill being passed in its present format.  I now pass over to my colleague, Deputy Liam Fitzgerald, who, I understand, intends to share his time with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>Since the Irish Universities Act was passed in 1908 this represents the first opportunity to discuss legislative proposals on the future of our universities and third level education generally in terms of the late 1990s and into the next millennium.  The Minister referred to the Bill as historic but it is only historic in that particular context, and I put it to the Minister that in many other respects the Bill represents nothing more than bureaucracy gone mad.  It is a deliberate intrusion, in a most authoritarian way, into what was hitherto the commendable, traditional independence of our universities.  Its effects will undoubtedly inhibit rather than promote innovation.  The Bill will dampen the culture of enterprise and academic and intellectual freedom.  It represents a licence for the governing of our universities by Government diktat.</P>
      <P>In some respects many of the Bill's provisions are daft and they will have an opposite effect to what the Minister purported to be her vision of university education in the future.  I have always believed that the freedom of our universities to be innovative and to promote the academic, artistic, cultural, economic and social life of our nation was the cornerstone of university education.  We are now witnessing a kind of revisionism which seeks to challenge the success of our universities which is acclaimed not alone by some of the most renowned universities and third level institutions around the world but also by industry, the research institutes and some critics of our educational institutions both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>One of the areas in the Bill that is most baffling is the attempt to address the changing role of universities in our economy.  By virtue of some sections of the Bill the Minister seems to be suggesting that the role of our universities heretofore in meeting future challenges in regard to economic activity has been of limited success. I challenge the Minister to produce that evidence in terms of research, reports or studies that have been carried out by national or international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest threats to the role of our universities is to their independence.  The Bill attempts to promote a culture of dependence, contrary to what has always been a culture of independence.  This type of culture will ultimately <Col N="1218" /> stifle the very ethos the Bill is seeking to promote.</P>
    <P>I regret the Bill fails to address the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Throughout the late 1980s I had the honour to serve on the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  By virtue of legislation in 1992, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Seamus Brennan, established the Dublin Institute of Technology on a statutory basis.  I am deeply saddened that, despite reports from an international body which this Minister commissioned, she ignored the Dublin Institute of Technology when bringing forward what should have been substantial legislation on third level education, the manner in which it is addressing the academic, cultural and artistic needs of our society as well as the applied scientific and technological needs.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the Dublin Institute of Technology has taken up the applied challenges in a significant way.  Despite considerable constraints over the decades, some of which I was party to, the Dublin Institute of Technology has proven in a spectacular way that it can meet the challenges of technology.  It went out into the marketplace, sometimes hampered by the 1930 Act, to take on research and innovation.  According to the international review group established by the Minister.  Deputy Bhreathnach, the Dublin Institute of Technology proved itself to be worthy of recognition as a full university.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a number of points made by the international review group.  The Higher Education Authority submitted in excess of 50 amendments to the Bill which the Minister is due to consider.  It is amazing that the Minister brought forward a Bill which the authority that is the custodian of university education says she should amend in so many different areas.  When considering those amendments the Minister should incorporate the Dublin Institute of Technology to give recognition to its track record, which is second to none, and to the overwhelming view among its staff, students and their parents that the Dublin Institute of Technology has reached a milestone.</P>
    <P>Recognition has been accorded to the Dublin Institute of Technology also by the international review group which stated that it has demonstrated a level of maturity which justifies the recommendation that it be granted authority to award its own degrees.  It suggested also that, in accordance with the White Paper, the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology should be transferred from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority at the earliest possible date. I commend those views to the Minister.  I am sure she has had an opportunity to study them and I hope when she sits down prior to Committee Stage to respond to our party's amendments she will seriously consider giving proper recognition to an institute which, despite the legislative inhibitions enshrined in the 1930 legislation, has <Col N="1219" /> shown spectacular academic success, has an outstanding record in the technological applied education area and has won recognition not only nationally but from professional bodies throughout Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Many previous speackers referred to the Dublin Institute of Technology; that is obviously the result of a well organised lobby by the Dublin Institute of Technology and its students.  It must be heartening to everybody that the students and their parents have such commitment and interest in this institution that they are prepared to engage in this lobbying.  It is encouraging for the institute that the Minister established a review group and I hope she will take account of its views and allow these institutions award their own degrees.  They have provided many highly trained people for much needed jobs and they deserve any help they can get.  I am sure the Minister will do whatever is necessary and what she believes to be right in regard to these institutions.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, abolished third level education fees.  This meant middle income people living in the Border counties had the choice of sending their children not just to universities in Northern Ireland but to universities and third level institutions in the Republic and that was greatly appreciated by them.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the numbers of people attending third level education we find that Monaghan has the third lowest number in Ireland. We have to look seriously at the reasons for that.  I believe it is because students leaving Monaghan have to maintain themselves and pay travelling expenses out of their own resources, and none of them can live at home because there is no third level facility in Monaghan.  A farmer in my constituency who has profits agreed by the Revenue Commissioners at £10,000 must, for education grant purposes include the REPS grant of £4,000, loan interest of £3,000 and depreciation of £3,000.  This puts him outside the income limit for a maintenance allowance.  There are many different forms of assessment, one for old age pension, another for health benefit, another for education grants.  This is an area that must be seriously looked at if all our people are to be treated equally.</P>
      <P>The issue of establishing closer links with the Northern Ireland universities is another matter that should be looked at from the point of view of the Border counties.  The Queen's University and the University of Ulster are interested and would be prepared to create links to help students in Monaghan through the first two years of their education at least without the cost of having to maintain themselves in our cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Opposition Party, having been many years in Government, have much they now want <Col N="1220" /> to offer to education.  It is great to be in Opposition and to look for controls on spending while on the other hand advocating spending in certain sectors.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to contribute on the Bill. Listening to Deputy Crawford, one would think he had been here for a lifetime.  I tell him bluntly that the people who founded and financed our education system were Fianna Fáil, now the major Opposition party.</P>
      <P>As a graduate of the University of life and a student of Ballindangan National School I have followed the debate and controversy surrounding this proposed legislation with considerable interest.  This Bill has been in gestation for many years, although not quite as far back as the time of King Charles I of England and Plato, both of whom were referred to by the Minister in proposing the Bill.  Having read the Minister's long statement, I had to check to see to which Plato she was referring.  She obviously intended to refer to Plato the philosopher, son of the distinguished Athens family who, in 387 BC, instituted the Academy as an institute for the systematic pursuit of philosophical and scientific research.  This Plato, we gather from Aristotle, was wont to lecture without manuscript. Moreover, the text presented by the Minister is more like the work of the other Plato, the Greek poet and writer.  This Plato, who was a contemporary of the philosopher, wrote 28 comedies mostly on political themes &mdash; one of his best known plays was &ldquo;Perialges&rdquo; translated in English as &ldquo;The Sufferer&rdquo;.  The Minister's 1996 AD production could have a similar subtitle.</P>
      <P>Regarding this Bill we must first ask why we need it and who wants it.  Legislation is necessary regarding the recognition of Maynooth and the continuing emergence of Limerick University and Dublin City University.  However, this Bill proposes to go into areas far beyond these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister kindly said she will listen carefully to the views of fellow Deputies and give them full consideration.  This is very welcome, but the Minister, in advance of consulting the Oireachtas, has already substantially backtracked on her own proposals and has given assurances to interested parties.  As a consequence she intends to introduce a substantial number of amendments to the Bill.  This is in addition to a considerable <Col N="1221" /> number of amendments Deputy Martin has already indicated he will make to this flawed Bill. No doubt the universities and the newly appointed Higher Education Authority board through their representatives in the Seanad and representations made to other Members of both Houses will put down other numerous amendments.  One of the most important universities in this State, Trinity College, is to be the subject of a Bill.  Whether the Trinity College Bill is a separate Bill is not a matter of great importance, but the present Bill should be presented alongside the proposed Trinity College Bill.  To try to rectify a Bill such as this by tabling numerous amendments is not in the least satisfactory and risks poor or bad legislation passing through this House in the confusion.</P>
    <P>Not everything in the Minister's Bill is bad.  She certainly should not backtrack at the merest whiff of criticism.  Her efforts at justification and backtracking in her statement make very bad reading indeed.  I assure her that properly thought out and presented proposals would have my support.  The universities want everything their own way.  However, they are the beneficiaries of more than £220 million this year alone from the Exchequer.  The Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the Dáil have a right to know how this money is being spent and be assured it is being spent in pursuit of policies approved by the State.  This does not mean the Minister or her representatives need to be involved in the detail of university housekeeping. It would be wrong to suggest that all university life is academic.  The growth and development of University College Cork, now under Professor Michael Mortell, and the emergence of the National Microelectronics Research Centre, Cork under Professor Gerard Wrixon are practical examples of how universities can identify a need and, in a practical and constructive way, bridge the gap between commerce and knowledge or, to put it another way, translate innovation and research into implementation and earnings.  Cork University has always been the business university of the southern region &mdash; its slogan was &ldquo;what Finbar taught, let Munster learn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 refer to guidelines.  I am dubious about the concept of guidelines being enshrined in legislation.  The draft legislation provides that breaches of guidelines would be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  How this is relevant to readers of this publication is not clear to me.  The Minister said a breach of the guidelines would only be a breach of non-binding guidelines.  Lest anybody be worried about a breach of non-binding guidelines, an amendment is being tabled to the effect that a departure from these non-binding guidlines would not result in conditions or restrictions on the payment of moneys to universities.  The only other sanction the Minister could impose would be to take the recalcitrant parties off her Christmas card list.</P>
    <P>I support section 35 of the Bill regarding the keeping of accounts and records.  Whether or not <Col N="1222" /> this materially changes the current situation is not clear but the Minister and the Exchequer are entitled to the keeping of proper books and accounts audited by an independent outside party.  It is not always right that all audits on behalf of the Government should be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office. The office does an excellent job and has produced many excellent reports for Dáil sub-committees. However, because the Comptroller and Auditor General has so many clients, so many responsibilities and so few people to carry them out, these reports, however accurate, have lost much of their value by the time they come before the Oireachtas.  Why can the universities, like the television service, not employ qualified auditors from the private sector, approved by the Minister?  Such professional auditors, with access to specialists in educational accounting around the world, would produce ideas, suggestions and assistance of benefit to the universities and their individual administrators.</P>
    <P>Section 22 and Chapters 7 and 8 of the Bill contain provisions relating to budgets.  The proposals do not represent proper budgetary controls.  Budgeting should be done on a rolling basis over three years.  There should be no question of even considering an excess over a year's budget being built into the budgeted expenditure for the following year.  It is also necessary to take into account any university borrowings made with the approval, authority or guarantee of the Minister for Education or the Minister for Finance.  It is the problem of universities if they cannot live within their agreed expenditure.  If they could not pay salaries once or twice, the problems of budgetary overruns would quickly disappear.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to her intention to include provision that tenure, pay allowances and pensions of existing staff will not be less beneficial after the passing of the Act.  This was also done in the State telephone, rail and bus companies where it created new difficulties further down the road.  Care must be exercised not to create additional benefits, perceived or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have left the detailed provisions of the Bill to our spokesperson, Deputy Martin.  I have confirmed myself to principles applicable to most Bills.  Will the Minister present a new Bill dealing with the matters that need to be addressed immediately?  She may anticipate further criticism during this debate.  I welcome Deputy Martin's contribution.  He has made his mark as education spokesperson on this important legislation which affects all families who have availed and will avail of third level education.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the Bill.</P>

      <Col N="1223" /> The Bill will do more damage to the rainforest than good to the universities.  It will add to the mound of paper which has bedevilled this State. We are all in favour of control of money. However, controlling every detail tends to lead to loss of control.  One of the problems anyone with management experience has is that of the having too many or too few rules.  Too many rules result in as much loss of control as too few.  The Minister should ensure the Bill is efficiently structured. Proper accounting procedures should be in place and a money audit should take place within the universities to ensure they are spending the money correctly and obtaining good value.  The only way to do this is through an audit system, not by creating a bureaucratic mound of reporting with a huge number of civil servants and staff in the Higher Education Authority. controlling the flow of paper.</P>
    <P>The question of the structure of boards in universities will have to be left for another day.  I would like to refer to the position of University College Galway.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh sé ráite go soiléir sa Bhille seo go mbeadh baint lárnach ag an nGaeilge le riaradh na h-ollscoile seo agus go gceapfaí daone ar an mBord le déanamh cinnte do go mbeadh ar chumas na h-ollscoile freastal ar phobal na Gaeilge.  Níl aon institiúid tríú leibhéal oideachais ginearálta fágtha a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á húsáid go rialta ann.  Is í Gaillimh an ceann is giorra dó ach feicim sa Bhille seo nach bhfuil aon tagairt lárnach don Ghaeilge nó nach bhfuil aon soláthar praiticiúil ann le déanamh cinnte go mbeidh áit lárnach ag an nGaeilge sna h-ollscoileanna go mór-mhór i gcoláiste na h-ollscoile i nGaillimh. Beidh mé ag súil le leasaithe ón Aire nuair a thiocfaidh an Bille seo faoi bhráid Choiste na Dála le cinntiú nach bhfágfar an Ghaeilge ar lár. Is aisteach an rud é gur faoi Rialtas de chuid na hÉireann a gcuirfear deireadh le nó a thosófar ag maolú go mór ar stádas na Gaeilge sna h-ollscoileanna nuair a smaoiníonn tú gur tháinig céad míle duine amach ar na sráideanna i mBaile Átha Cliath i 1908 ag iarraidh a chinntiú go mbeadh áit larnach ag an nGaeilge i gcúrsaí oideachais in tíre seo.</P>
    <P>Ag deireadh ba mhaith liom tacaíocht don méid atá ráite ag mo chomhleacaí faoin Dublin Institute of Technology.  Níl údar ar bith, ó tharla go bhfuil athbhreithniú iomlán á dhéanamh ar na h-ollscoileanna, nach dtabharfaí cead don Dublin Institute of Technology tré ollscoil a dhéanamh de, céimeanna a bhronnadh.  Creidim gur deineadh scrúdú neamhspleách ar an Dublin Institute of Technology maidir le cúrsaí caighdeáin agus creidim freisin go ndúirt an scrúdú sin go raibh cúrsaí an Dublin Institute of Technology ar leibhéal sách ard le go mbronnfaí céimeanna.  Tuigtear dom freisin go bhfuil an Higher Education Authority i bhfábhar an stádais seo agus mar sin credim go mba cheart an Bille seo a tharraingt siar agus athbhreithniú iomlán a <Col N="1224" /> dhéanamh ar a bhfuil ann.

      <P>I agree with the criticisms of the Bill made by my colleagues.  I support the case for raising the Dublin Institute of Technology to university status.  It is not just a Dublin issue. People in my constituency are concerned the provision has not been included in this Bill.  It is in accordance with the report of the review group initiated by the Minister in 1995.  The leader of our party and Deputy Martin issued a statement on this issue, which I fully support.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at the question of access to university.  The Clancy reports show that in the Border counties of Louth, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal there is a low rate of access to university.  The Minister referred in her speech to knowledge being the basis of a richer culture, greater social justice and the creation of a better quality of life.  She should be concerned at this lack of opportunity in the Border counties. As regards overseas investment, 11,000 jobs were created in this country last year, only 47 of which came to my county.  One of the principal reasons given for this is that high tech jobs are knowledge intensive and companies need to be in close proximity to universities and third level institutions.  I ask the Minister to create proper facilities in areas far removed from regional technical colleges or universities and to develop outreach programmes.  If the rationalisation of the vocational education committees goes ahead in the form promoted by the Minister it appears there will be two broad areas, Cavan-Monaghan and Laoighis-Offaly, that will not have a third level facility.  If we want equity and if we do not want everything to be in the greater Dublin area this issue should be addressed.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the way in which this Bill has been handled and we have not been given proper time in which to debate it.</P>
      <P>Last November the Minister published a position paper on university reform.  At that time, I welcomed the elements contained in that paper, but I did so on the basis that the paper would not be completely ignored when it came to drawing up the legislation.  That is the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are debating a Bill that has rejected both the letter and spirit of the Minister's position <Col N="1225" /> paper and proposes to impose an authoritarian regime on universities.  As such, the Minister refuses to recognise that our universities have always behaved honourably and have contributed constructively, that they have led, not just reflected, change in ways consistent with their own ethos and traditions.  It is regrettable the Minister has chosen to ignore this track record and deny our universities the opportunity to build on this record, each in accordance with its own culture.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Taoiseach quoted John Redmond who gave a strong commitment that no Home Rule Government would ever interfere with Trinity College or Queen's University, Belfast.</P>
    <P>This Bill is offensive to all our universities and they have made the Minister aware of this.  It is pointless for the Minister to say she will be generous with amendments when the spirit of the Bill is against everything the universities need: freedom to develope their ideas and research out of reach of government police; freedom to continue their contribution, not only to the educational life of this country but also to its broader economic and cultural life and freedom to continue their accountability under the stringent provisions already provided for under the Higher Education Act, 1971, and the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>From my talks with the university sector, I understand the universities are not unwilling to be accountable.  The Minister is trying to suggest they are.  The universities are already accountable.  What the universities do not want &mdash; and in this they have my full support &mdash; is to be stifled and muzzled by Government and, more particularly, by the rhetoric of the Labour Party. I am fascinated that the Labour Party, when in Government, always want to control everything and put their own people on the boards.  It is preoccupied with getting its own people into as many positions of power as possible.</P>
    <P>In view of its long history and great work done by the Dublin Institute of Technology it should be included under this Bill.  The Universities Bill, 1996, seeks &ldquo;to constitute or establish certain colleges and universities as universities under this Act&rdquo;.  I strongly recommend the Minister include the Dublin Institute of Technology under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the comments made by all sides about university status for the Dublin Institute of Technology as it affects students throughout the country.  My overall criticism of the Bill is that it does not provide the correct balance for accountability in respect of public <Col N="1226" /> funds or affirm the freedoms that are necessary for the universities to discharge their unique role in society.  The Minister's approach is heavy-handed and bureaucratic and at odds with her earlier statements about the necessity of freedom for universities.  I understood the Minister always acknowledged that balance but I do not see it in the Bill.  Instead, the Bill is primarily concerned with a regulatory regime for the universities but they consider this would paralyse them from acting as creative institutions.  Neither do I agree with the role proposed for the HEA.  It is a complete invasion of the normal managerial competence that the boards of governors and the presidents of universities should have.</P>
      <P>The universities are committed to the principles of public accountability.  They have their own auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General and their reports are made available to the Minister, the Higher Education Authority and the public.  I am concerned also about the conditions of employment of existing staff.  In the past I criticised the situation of students doing their higher diploma in education. When I inquired from universities about this I was told that in Galway there were only 185 places in 1994-95 when there used to be 300 places and that there were 1,371 applications for those 185 places.  This is totally unfair to students doing a primary degree who expect to do the higher diploma in education.  The matter should be examined immediately, although I criticise any university that would use an unfair random or lottery system.</P>
      <P>On the issue of finance, I have been told by University College, Galway, that less than half its income comes from the State.  That is interesting given that tuition fees are paid by the State. However, that does not mean any additional grant is paid to the university, it is a State subsidy to students.  Student numbers in Galway have increased by 60 per cent in the past ten years.  I suggest the Minister discuss this matter with her colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, a college professor, who would be able to tell her much more about what the role of universities should be.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing his limited time with me.  It is reprehensible that this debate is being guillotined given that many Members of my party and I have not had a proper opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I will confine my remarks to the need for a university in my city of Waterford.  This campaign has been going on for some time.  The Minister will be aware that the legitimate claim for a university will not go away, will not be watered down and will not be dropped until we have achieved parity with every other city on this island.  It is not a claim for a particular facility but a demand for something which is the right of the people of the region and a necessity if we are to thrive as a region and have a facility without which we are seriously disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> Some time ago the Higher Education Authority established a subcommittee which set up a technical working group which reported in favour of a university in Waterford.  Incredibly, and for whatever reason, the Higher Education Authority saw fit to change the recommendation of its working group.  I have little doubt that this decision was politically influenced.  Whatever the reason for the change of heart it operated to the detriment of our city and region.  This is totally unacceptable to the people of the regions and all the more so because the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, before the general election in November 1992 gave a commitment on local radio that Waterford would have its own university.  There has been no delivery on that promise and no sign that it will happen but the Labour Party does not appear to be in the least embarrassed by its gesture of bad faith.  Given that the Labour Party has suffered and has had to accommodate in others such bad faith and a decline in standards recently it is unlikely to be ashamed of anything ever again.  In contrast Fianna Fáil has endorsed the recommendation of the expert group and will implement it after we return to power after the next general election.  Despite what comfort the discredited Rainbow might draw from the opinion polls, the Government is becoming more unelectable day by day.</P>
    <P>A recent newspaper report suggested that the rats had got at the Universities Bill and eaten anything of value.  I agree with the sentiments but not with the direction of blame.  The Minister is merely reflecting the aspirations of her party which has been using its uncharacteristically long stay in Government to provide for its future.  Part of that future has been in the area of education and this Bill is the living proof of it.  I oppose the whole ethos of this Bill vehemently.  I oppose the principle it is trying to bring about and I support my party decision to repeal it after the next general election.</P>

      <P>In my opening speech I indicated that on the basis of continuing dialogue and the views of Deputies I intended to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.  I am surprised at the reaction of some Opposition Deputies who seem to consider that the process of consultation and dialogue is a sign of weakness and retreat.  I consider consultation and a willingness to <Col N="1228" /> respond to the views of others as fundamental to the exercise of democracy and the principle of partnership in education to which I am deeply committed.</P>
      <P>In the words of Dr. Daniel O'Hare, President of Dublin City University, &ldquo;consultation in this depth about complicated legislation is a new departure to be encouraged not denigrated&rdquo;.  It is incumbent on me, as Minister for Education, following the consultation which has taken place, to table such amendments as will improve the Bill.  These amendments will be consistent with the Bill and its underlying objectives and principles which have remained unchanged.  I would remind the House that the Bill has three main objectives: restructuring of the National University of Ireland; provision of revised governance structures; provision of a framework for interaction between the universities and central Government, and for accountability to society generally.</P>
      <P>I certainly cannot agree with Deputy Keogh that the National University of Ireland should be abolished.  I have listened to the debate in the National University, in the constituent colleges and in the recognised college at Maynooth.  The consensus is that these colleges all want to be constituent universities of the National University.  Surely the Deputy would not wish me to ride roughshod over the wishes of these communities and abolish such a long-standing institution as the NUI?</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Lenihan who was confused as to the future role of the NUI following the enactment of the Bill, the degrees and other qualifications awarded by the constituent universities will be designated as NUI qualifications.  The NUI will also have the power to appoint external examiners for the constituent universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recognition by many Deputies of the need for broad governing authority structures in universities.  The main areas of adjustment lie in the detail.  I intend to increase the upper limit on membership of governing authorities.  I will allow for potentially more students, academic staff and non academic staff on governing authorities than in the Bill as published.  In the case of the constituent universities, I intend to increase the number of NUI representatives.  In the case of all universities I will amend the Bill to allow each university to decide, if it so wishes, that the members representing both graduates and artistic and cultural interests can be drawn from the academic staff.  I intend to authorise the visitor, rather than the Government, to appoint the person or body to run the university during any period where the governing authority has been suspended. Similarly, where a commission fails to determine the composition of a university's first governing authority, it will be the visitor, rather than the Minister for Education, who will appoint the person or body to perform the commission's functions.  These amendments will further reduce <Col N="1229" /> any potential involvement in these areas that a Government might have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin is wrong to say the chief officer is being given the power to select members of the governing authority.  In a number of cases, a committee comprising the chief officer and two other members of the governing authority can choose the members from among nominations made to the governing authority.</P>

      <P>Not in any case will the chief officer carry out this function alone as is plain from the text of the Bill.  Several Deputies have raised the issue of election rather than appointment to the governing authority.</P>

      <P>This issue has also been raised by a number of interests in the university community.  The text as published allows discretion to the university to decide whether there should be election or some other form of selection.  However, given the widespread interest in providing for elections, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that the representatives of the academic staff, non-academic staff, students and graduates, where appropriate, will be elected.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Keogh's suggestion that the Bill would bear down particularly heavily on Trinity College, the oldest of all our universities.  It is proposed that the charter of Trinity College will not be amended by this Bill, but will be amended by a private Act, sponsored by the college in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin's claim that the charters of the NUI are being abolished, is simply wrong.  He should read the Bill.  The charters of the constituent colleges will remain in place as the fundamental legal and constitutional instruments of the constituent universities with amendments only in a limited number of areas necessitated by the provisions of this Bill and for the most part in accordance with proposals made and invited by the NUI.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have questioned the role of the Higher Education Authority and the State generally in the provisions of the Bill, with accusations that the Bill is based on a centralising philosophy.  Yet, all sides of the House recognise the need for proper accountability.  Any provisions should seek a balance between institutional autonomy and the needs of public policy and accountability.  As Deputy Frances Fitzgerald said, we need to continue to discuss this Bill in Committee to ensure we get the balance right.  To refine the balance I propose to bring forward amendments in a number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> Deputy Bertie Ahern asserted that the Bill will restrict, confine and constrain universities' freedom to face new challenges.  I was amazed at this because clearly it is not the case.  If we study and appreciate the provisions of the Bill as published, we can see that we are reaffirming institutional autonomy.  However, because people seem to have difficulty in understanding its simple provisions, I intend to insert a provision confirming that a university has the right to regulate its management and academic affairs in accordance with the principle of academic freedom and its independent ethos and traditions in a manner consistent with the effective and efficient use of resources and its accountability obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the role of the Higher Education Authority, I refute categorically Deputy Coughlan's assertion that the Higher Education Authority is an extension of the Department.  The Higher Education Authority is a statutory body established by the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  Under this legislation it acts as a buffer between the State and the universities.  It has performed this function with great integrity since its establishment.  The Higher Education Authority Act was enacted 25 years ago and since then the universities have grown in size.  There has been a corresponding growth in the importance of the Higher Education Authority and the Bill provides an opportunity to allow the universities and the Higher Education Authority to develop that partnership.</P>
      <P>The functions in this Bill which relate to the Higher Education Authority can be considered under three categories: advisory; reporting and review; and functions in relation to consistency in the format of annual reports and accounts. Deputy Keogh is wrong in saying the Bill will &ldquo;transform the Higher Education Authority into a State universities board, a centralised body that will exercise increasing power and influence over the country's university institutions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, the Higher Education Authority has a statutory function to co-ordinate State investment in higher education by allocating resources to the universities and to advise the Minister on general policy.  The Higher Education Authority has a statutory obligation to advise me on, <i>inter alia</i>, legislative measures in relation to institutions of higher education.  The Higher Education Authority provided me with advice on the Bill and I have given careful consideration to its advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Higher Education Authority may issue guidelines.  The guidelines are intended to enable the Higher Education Authority to bring to the notice of universities best national and international practice.  The guidelines will not be binding and departure from <Col N="1231" /> them by a university will not result in restrictions or conditions on the payment of moneys.  I intend to explicitly state this to address any misinterpretation of the role and effect of the guidelines.  In view of the misconceptions associated with the role of the Higher Education Authority under the Bill, I will amend it to consolidate the provisions relating to the role of the HEA.</P>
    <P>Some people have expressed concern that the Higher Education Authority will have access to information on private funding.  There is concern that such a development would hamper the universities in raising private funding.  It was never intended that would happen.  I have made it consistently clear since the opening of this debate.  I intend to amend section 35 (1) to provide necessary reassurance for those who have difficulty in understanding the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Concern has also been expressed in this House and by the universities that the provisions on borrowing in sections 33 and 34 restrict financial autonomy.  I want to ensure the Exchequer is not exposed to unplanned demands and I propose to delete section 33 (5) and to provide an amended section 34 which will put beyond doubt the intent of the provision.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed by Deputies and universities that the Bill as published might overly interfere with universities in determining fees.  I intend to introduce an amendment to clarify the respective roles of the universities and the Higher Education Authority and to clearly state the autonomy of the universities in this area. I indicated in my opening speech that there is nothing in this Bill which could conceivably worsen the pay and conditions of staff.  This really seems to have caused terrible difficulties for Deputy Martin in particular in understanding the wording in the Bill.  In order to facilitate him a provision will be specifically included in the Bill to the effect that the tenure, pay, allowances and pensions of existing staff will be no less beneficial after the passing of the Act than before it.</P>

All university staff will continue to have the full protection of employment and industrial relations law which is in force.  In spite of my reassurances on this matter, a number of Members, led by the Deputy opposite, persist in claiming that I intend to do the opposite.  When did I promise to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill confirms the present situation where <Col N="1232" /> the rates of pay and allowances of staff are in line with public sector norms.  In order to provide the universities with a degree of flexibility in this area, I intend to allow departures from normal remuneration levels, within a framework agreed between the universities and the HEA.  This will be dealt with by amending section 22 (4) on Committee Stage.  In addition, I intend to remove from this section the requirement for publication of staffing structures by universities and the provision for inspections by the HEA.</P>

      <P>There is general agreement on a need for quality assurance procedures in universities.  However, I do not agree with Deputy Keogh's suggestion that the Department of Education should monitor and assess the comparative performance of different universities. This would be precisely the kind of State intervention which the Deputy and her party claim to deplore.  The Bill provides that the universities themselves, with autonomy and academic freedom, will be allowed to develop and implement their own quality assurance procedures.  I intend to amend the provisions to provide that these procedures will be widened to include the education and related services provided by the university and to provide that the manner in which the findings of evaluations will be published will be determined by the governing authority.</P>
      <P>The issue of extending the power to award degrees to the Dublin Institute of Technology is being activity progressed by my Department in consultation with the institute.  Its progress is separate from the issue of the Universities Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.  The alleged incident to which the matter relates is the latest in a chapter of accidents which will be synonymous with the tenure of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, the Minister with the un-Midas touch.  We usually associate prisons with breakouts &mdash; thankfully there have been few of these &mdash; but this is a new phenomenon, a prison break-in.  According to a report in a Sunday newspaper dated 1 December last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there was a break-in at the top security prison at Wheatfield which houses some of the country's worst criminals.  The break-in is reported to have happened on the night of Monday, 11 November.  The report states that a number of individuals entered the prison complex by using cutting equipment to punch a hole in the perimeter gate.  The gate is surrounded by cameras and high walls.  However, the high-technology cameras along that stretch of the jail perimeter were not working at the time.  The report states that the people who broke in made their way under cover of darkness to a second unguarded gate which provides access to the main prison complex.  They left after tampering with that second gate.</P>
      <P>The incident was discovered by prison staff on Tuesday, 12 November, the day the Minister for Justice was supposed to defend herself in this House following the debacle over the failure to inform Judge Dominic Lynch that he had been delisted from service in the Special Criminal Court.  A source is quoted as saying:</P>
      <P>The whole thing was kept hushed up because of the implications of what could have happened.  The people who got in could easily have got into any cell in the prison.  It would have been the last straw for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Department of Justice source is quoted as saying that &ldquo;this is a professional operation and <Col N="1236" /> is being treated as a major incident.  We do not know the reason for the break-in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A number of theories have been advanced for the break-in, one of which is that it was designed to test security at the prison with a view to springing prisoners in the future.  One of the main concerns of prison staff at Wheatfield is that this break-in was part of a plan to spring nine republican prisoners who were moved there recently.  The view has also been advanced that the break-in may be related to the fact that one of the inmates, who was connected with the £130 million Urlingford drugs sting, has been reportedly targeted for assassination by a major drugs baron who lost millions in that operation.</P>
    <P>Is that story correct and, if so, why has it been concealed?  Has any Garda investigation been initiated as a result and, if so, has anybody been charged?  What steps have been taken to increase security at this prison?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If this story is correct, then the failure of the Minister for Justice to be transparent and accountable has deprived her of any last vestige of fitness for office.  Perhaps the explanation is that criminals are so afraid of being on our dangerous streets they are now breaking into prisons.  Perhaps criminals have such a relaxed time in prisons that their mates are trying to break in to join them.  The food is good, they have free television and study facilities and they also get paid.  The prison system is now so open that prisoners can come and go as they please. Perhaps the Minister for Justice might consider a radical policy departure and order the doors to be locked and the cameras to be switched on.</P>

      <P>There is no basis to the reports which have been circulating in the media and elsewhere regarding this matter.  While it is the case that from time to time incidents occur within the prisons and elsewhere involving prisoners, it seems that any story relating to the prisons, however outlandish, tends to be given the widest possible exposure in some sensationalist areas of the media and by headline seeking politicians.</P>

      <P>There have, for example, been many instances of individual long-term prisoners allegedly being spotted at locations in the community.  Such fictitious events have regularly found their way into certain newspapers, as have totally inaccurate reports of incidents alleged to have occurred inside and in some cases outside some of the prisons and places of detention.  The press office of the Department of Justice receives <Col N="1237" /> numerous queries about the prisons from the press, the wider media and the public on a daily basis.  While the Department is only too happy to assist, it is the case that a significant percentage of such queries have little or no basis in fact, are widely exaggerated or are untrue.</P>
      <P>The incident referred to by the Deputy falls broadly into the latter category.  There was no such break-in at the place of detention, Wheatfield.  On the morning of 12 November 1996 the gate leading to the adjacent vacant site was discovered to be open.  There were gale force winds on the night of 11 November 1996.</P>

The site and the prison were thoroughly searched on 12 November and nothing was found.  There is no evidence that a group of persons made their way into the vacant site and nothing to suggest that the perimeter of the prison was breached.  Security at Wheatfield was not compromised in any way.  It is now considered possible that the gate was pushed in by the wind, not by an intruder.  The gate has since been secured.</P>

      <P>This is the second time in as many weeks that I have spoken about jobs being lost or jobs at risk in the Cork area.  Two weeks ago I mentioned Irish Crown Cork Company Limited which is closing its doors on 20 December and laying off 210 people, thereby making it one of their bleakest Christmases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 300 jobs at risk in Youghal Carpets in Killacloyne because the American owner company has signalled its intention to pull out.  I call on the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and IDA Ireland to pull out all the <Col N="1238" /> stops to ensure that an alternative investor is found for that company so that these jobs can be saved.</P>
    <P>This is a viable industry with a highly skilled workforce which produces a product of prestige. I am proud that all the carpets in my house are Youghal carpets.  This company has undergone a series of rationalisation programmes recently which means its productivity is high and its labour costs are competitive.  There is a tradition of carpet making in this area which, if lost, may not be recreated.  Youghal Carpets is a brand name which instils the same sense of pride as Waterford Crystal.  This industry must not be allowed to disappear.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and IDA Ireland to pull out all the stops to secure these jobs.  It is just as important to save existing jobs as it is to create new ones.  There is no economic justification for sending IDA officials around the world looking for new investment when they could help to save existing jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the House because it is seldom that a Minister takes the Adjournment matters.  They usually pass them on to the Ministers of State.  We cannot afford to lose this important traditional industry.  The manufacture of carpet yarn is an old industry on this island and the Minister must protect it.</P>
      <P>A total of 315 families face a bleak Christmas at a time when the economy is buoyant and we hear on a daily basis about growth rates and low inflation and interest rates.  I welcome the announcement yesterday of 300 new jobs for my constituency, but they will be phased in over three years and many of those industries do not reach their full potential.  Why not protect the 315 jobs at risk in Youghal?</P>
      <P>The Government's policy on job creation in the southern region is disappointing.  Apart from the announcement yesterday, that region has been neglected compared to the Dublin area.  I understand the Government was notified some months ago about the problems at Killacloyne, but little or no action was taken.  It makes a big deal about announcing new jobs, but there are no announcements when jobs are lost.</P>
      <P>Youghal Carpet Yarns is owned by an American company.  The Minister made great play about the jobs in Semperit.  I urge him to put similar criteria in place to rescue the 315 jobs in Youghal.  He should support the management proposals or make the necessary funding available to further modernise that important facility.  A study of the plant should be carried out before the jobs are lost.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for allowing me to say a few words about Youghal Carpet Yarns, particularly as it is located in the parish of Carrigtohill.  Having worked as an auditor in Youghal, Celbridge, Ennis, Navan and other subsidiaries, I am familiar with the <Col N="1239" /> problems and successes of the company down through the years.</P>
      <P>Youghal Carpet Yarns is the only survivor of the group.  When I was a Minister of State in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the plant was reorganised to a become a slim, efficient and profitable plant.  The parent company wants to sell it off, even though the management is happy with its success in recent years.  I understand the IDA is making every effort to get a buyer for the plant.  Many companies depend on it for yarn.  It is crucial for the 315 workers and the associated service industries that the Minister makes every effort to secure a buyer for the plant.</P>

      <P>This is the third occasion I have had to speak on an Adjournment debate about such matters. There were 460 jobs in Sunbeam in Cork in 1994, but there are only 60 now.  The Minister's assurances in that regard were not realised.  Even though a strong case was made for Irish Crown Cork, the future is also uncertain for those jobs. We are here again tonight making a case for the 350 jobs in Youghal Carpet Yarns.  I accept the IDA is doing an excellent job, but unfortunately the future does not look bright for the workers in Youghal Carpet Yarns.  I urge the Minister to become directly involved in this matter.  While his efforts in terms of jobs in other parts of the country have been successful, that has not been the case in the Cork area.  On behalf of the workers in Youghal Carpet Yarns, I appeal to him to become directly involved with the IDA to ensure the jobs are retained and, if not, replacement jobs are found as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns of Members in this regard.  Several Members from this side also contacted me in the past few days to express similar concerns.</P>
      <P>Youghal Carpet Yarns has announced it is to withdraw from woollen yarn spinning at its Killacloyne plant.  The announcement was made following the parent company's decision to divest itself of all its axminster carpet operations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Youghal Carpet Yarns has undergone a number of changes in recent years.  In 1995 it was taken over by Carpets International (UK), which is a subsidiary of Shaw Industries, Georgia, USA.  The Cork plant currently operates as a division of the UK operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the woollen carpet industry has declined in recent years, it was hoped that, following the takeover of Youghal Carpet Yarns by the UK company, its future would be secure.  This optimism was helped by the fact that Carpets International, following its takeover by Youghal, <Col N="1240" /> embarked on a major restructuring of its European carpet operations, including the Killacloyne plant.  I understand, however, that Carpets International has now decided to radically and suddenly change its focus, with the result that it is exiting the carpet weaving sector of the business, and concentrating on the polypropylene and nylon part of its operation. This, of course, has impacted on the Youghal plant and, consequently, Youghal Carpet Yarns has been forced to announce its decision to withdraw from woollen yarn spinning.</P>
    <P>The company recognises the impact its decision will have on the local community, particularly as it is a long established business.  It is with this in mind that the company has decided to gradually phase out its operation in the next few months. During this period, the company, with the full co-operation and assistance of the State agencies, including IDA Ireland, is making every effort to sell the business as a going concern.</P>
    <P>I have already discussed the possible sale of Youghal Carpet Yarns as a going concern with one of the directors of Shaw Industries and I have been assured of the group's full support in securing a prospective buyer, which would help protect the maximum number of jobs at the Youghal plant.  The owners of Youghal Carpet Yarns recognise the high skills and high level of commitment and co-operation from the Youghal workforce.  This will be a major positive factor in securing a new owner for the operation.  I am encouraged that there has already been an expression of interest in the Killacloyne plant and this will be pursued vigorously.</P>
    <P>I accept that the local community, particularly the employees and their families, are concerned about the future of the plant.  I know from contacts from Members on this side of the importance of Youghal Carpet Yarns to the local community.  In this regard, I confirm that the State agencies, my Department, local government, Deputies and myself will continue to work closely with Youghal Carpet Yarns and any other interested parties in an effort to find a buyer for the Youghal operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's belief that Cork is being neglected is unfounded.  An additional 5,000 people were employed in the Cork and Kerry region last year.  While the position in Youghal is disappointing and must be tackled with vigour, it would be a mistake to suggest that Cork is being neglected by the Government or that there is not good economic prosperity there.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Area Aid Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Area aid has become an administrative nightmare.  Farmers trying to make contact with Hume House find it virtually impossible to get a free telephone line into the building.  As we all know, area aid maps are vital to the payment of a whole range of supports to the agricultural industry and mapping errors have immediate implications down the <Col N="1241" /> administrative line.  Many farmers are losing large sums of money in aid because of relatively trivial errors.  It should be possible to decentralise the administrative arrangements on a regional basis. Such a move would ease considerably the pressure and frustration of farmers and those who work with area aid generally.</P>
      <P>The area aid arrangement came into place because of the supports which are available from the Community for the agricultural industry. Only time will tell whether those arrangements will change in future.  However, it is clear there are serious difficulties at present.  Last week I spent a considerable amount of time trying to contact the office and it is virtually impossible to contact it by telephone.  The staff in the office are helpful when one succeeds in getting through, but there is still a problem with the huge volume of work they must process and minor mapping errors have very serious implications for the payment of the beef premium, the suckler cow premium and the range of payments dependent on it.</P>
      <P>While I know the completion of the process of computerisation is in its final throes, I do not see why the office cannot be decentralised even on a temporary basis to see whether it would work more efficiently and provide a better service to the individual farmers who are so dependent on the support which flows from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993, the first year of its existence, the administration of the area aid scheme was carried out on a decentralised basis as far as almost 90 per cent of all area aid applications were concerned.  In that year all forage only area aid applications were processed in the local offices of my Department around the country and only the arable aid applications &mdash; which constituted as few as 11 to 12 per cent of all applications &mdash; were processed in the Department's head office in Dublin and Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decentralised method of operation did not work very well.  Limited resources meant that the extra work of processing the area aid applications placed an intolerable burden on those local offices during a period when they had to cope with a huge increase in other premium and headage work resulting from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy carried out by the EU in 1992.  Limited accommodation meant that when forage only area aid applicants had to submit maps in later years there would not be enough space in the local offices to store them. The EU Commission commented unfavourably on splitting the work between three different types of locations, the Department's local offices, its head office in Dublin and its office in Cavan, and criticised the resulting lack of co-ordination between processing, controlling and inspecting applications to which this fragmented approach gave rise.  Accordingly, the processing of all forage only area aid applications was transferred to Hume House in Dublin in 1994 and the processing of all area aid applications, both for <Col N="1242" /> forage only and for arable aid, was centralised in one unit in that building in 1995.</P>
    <P>All things considered, it was just as well this was done.  The relevant EU regulations required Ireland and all other member states to put in place by 1 January 1997 as land parcel identification system whereby every parcel of land declared by farmers on their area aid applications would be given a unique identity number and a digitised area and would have its boundaries shown on maps to be issued to those farmers.  Difficult as this task has been with one centralised area aid unit in Hume House, it would have been totally impossible if we had the fragmented situation of 27 different locations as in 1993.</P>
    <P>The result of this centralisation has not been perfection, but it has been much better than what would have resulted from any alternative.  As of today, some £688 million has been paid in 1996 under all headage and premia schemes compared to only £655 million on the same date in 1995. The total amount paid so far in 1996 under the 1996 schemes is just over £426 million compared to only £408 million paid by 10 December 1995 under the 1995 schemes, while the total number of payments made to 1996 scheme applicants as of today is 364,500, slightly larger than the number made by 10 December last year to 1995 applicants.  As most of these 1996 payments depend on clearance of 1996 area aid applications, it can be seen that good progress is being made with those area aid applications, and I assure this House that that rate of progress will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that those farmers not yet paid are trying to contact the area aid unit for an explanation.  From Monday, 2 December 1996, a freephone number has been in place to facilitate farmers in contacting the unit.  Improving telecommunication links to the unit in this and in any other way necessary is the key to solving the contact problem mentioned by Deputy Kirk rather than any proposal to decentralise the work involved again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise what may be one of the most important issues I will face in my area as the idea of legislation for the Foyle is close to the hearts of the hundreds of people who work in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Foyle Fisheries Commission for including fishing organisations in its reaction to the report which it is currently reviewing. However, many groups have been ignored.  For example, the North-West Region Cross-Border Group comprises County Donegal, Derry City Council, Strabane Council and Limavaddy District Council which work together.  They have been established for over 20 years.  They have worked on the Foyle basin study, they have a five year plan and have sought European funding for <Col N="1243" /> the Foyle and yet, as a cross-Border group and in the context of a cross-Border venture, they were not approached with regard to this report.  That is a big mistake.  I understand they have been approached separately but their collective attitude is exactly the type of one which any cross-Border review should incorporate.</P>
    <P>I was also worried about the timescale.  A deadline of 30 November was set for the return of all reactions to the report but, at the same time, we were told last week that the legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation.  This gives me the impression that we have put the cart before the horse.  If local people are just beginning to comment on what they want but the legislation is at an advanced stage, it seems there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>I would be happy if the Minister or the Minister of State, with the Commissioners and the chief executive, met the local authorities and groups involved because one of the issues I came across while talking to the people concerned is that the groups, such as the North-West Cross-Border Group, would like local representation on the commission at a high level.</P>
    <P>Everybody is fed up with paper exercises, where a piece of paper is passed along and people are asked to comment.  The big example of that is that there are three elements to the Foyle Fisheries Commission review: salmon, seafish and shellfish.  When we ask about seafish, for instance, this is supposed to be incorporated within or outside Lough Foyle depending on the date to which one refers.</P>
    <P>On 12 November sea fishing was considered to be within Lough Foyle, but at some future time it might be considered to be seaward of the lough if such an extension of powers were considered necessary.  I would like an assurance that the idea of expanding sea fishing outside Lough Foyle will not be considered.  The activities of those involved in sea fishing are controlled by EU and national directives and more bureaucrcy is not needed.  We want an assurance that the claim to sea fishing outside Lough Foyle will not be entertained.  That view was expressed loudly and clearly by the people of that area.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in talking about sea angling and incorporating it outside the lough. How can one boat be distinguished from another when they are coming in to shore?  When working in a specific area, a boat must be boarded and searched to ascertain if it is a sea angling or a fishing boat.</P>
    <P>Salmon fishing is the only area over which the commission has control and salmon licences are twice the price of licences under other regional fishery boards.  The period during which salmon fishing is allowed is usually half that allowed under the other boards.  Subsequently, the fish stocks are not high.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the area is worried about the pollution aspect, conservation, protection and sustainability of the fishing stocks.  They want <Col N="1244" /> what is in the common good.  We are looking for a national strategy in this regard so that no one will be penalised.  Foyle fishermen should not have to pay twice the amount paid by everyone else for a licence.</P>
    <P>Regarding shell-fishing, people in the area want protection, conservation and research, but if the Foyle Fisheries Commission takes over responsibility in that area, 85 per cent of fishermen will come from the Donegal direction and only 15 per cent from the Northern countries. Management of that type of fishing must be local because locals know the spawning, nursing and high yield areas.  They know their resource. Representation must be local and at a high level. Those are the reasons local knowledge is needed before legislation is introduced and when introduced management will still be required at a high level to ensure that Foyle fisheries continues to expand in the way everybody wants it to. People want only what is in the best interest of fishing and that can only be achieved through the highest level of co-operation between the relevant bodies.  The problem is that we seem to get drips of information &mdash; one minute the sea fishing area is within the Foyle and the next it is outside it.  I have not been able to ascertain from parliamentary questions the area in question on a map.</P>
    <P>The fishing area outside Lough Foyle covers a large area.  People want to be able to follow EU and national directives and fishermen in the Lough Foyle area want protection of the stock the pollution controls, but under the management of local representatives and, if possible, with a local input from commissioners at a high level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this issue.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission is a unique cross-Border statutory body established in 1952 under parallel primary legislation enacted by the Northern Ireland and southern Legislatures.  The need for a cross-Border fishery protection body in this area arose from the absence of an agreed jurisdictional boundary between Northern Ireland and the South in Lough Foyle and the adjoining sea areas. It was impossible to regulate and control exploitation of the salmon stocks in these areas and serious over fishing of the stocks developed. As a result, the commission was established with the devolution to it, by both jurisdictions, of powers to regulate salmon and freshwater fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While reasonably effective in securing its primary objective of achieving adequate breeding stocks of salmon throughout the Foyle system, the commission, largely because of legislative and financial constraints, has been unable to develop the fishery resources of the Foyle area to their full potential or to maintain a profile which would reflect favourably on such a unique example of cross-Border co-operation.  This arises because the commission, unlike fisheries boards in the <Col N="1245" /> South, does not have a development function under its present statutes so that it is unable to tap the not inconsiderable funds available from IFI and EU sources to carry out desirable and publicly demanded fishery development projects within the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>Because it lacks the powers to license and control aquaculture development, considerable development potential for shellfish farming in Lough Foyle continues to go untapped and private enterprise promoters are unable to avail of national and EU grants to exploit a proven resource there.  Moreover, due to lack of regulation, wild shellfish stocks in the lough are seriously depleted.</P>
    <P>Against this background the two sponsoring Departments commissioned in 1993 a review of the commission's operations, funding, structure and staffing which was overseen by a steering group comprising senior officials from the two Departments with the support of consultants.  The main recommendations resulting from this review, which was undertaken by KPMG Managing Consultants, were that the commission's remit with respect to salmon and inland fisheries should be expanded to enable it to undertake development work in relation to the fishery resource and by promoting, developing and improving facilities for angling and that the role of the commission should be extended to include regulation and licensing of shellfish farming and marine aquaculture and the regulation of sea fishing within Lough Foyle.  The report recommended that the devolution of powers in relation to sea fishing might relate to Lough Foyle initially but that provision should be made to allow an extension of these powers to the parts of the Foyle area seaward of Lough Foyle at some future time, if such an extension of powers was considered necessary.  I can assure the Deputy that such an extension is not in prospect.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that the existing structure of the commission should not be changed, but the advisory council, representative of fisheries' interests within the Foyle area, should be restructed to allow it play a more meaningful role in the direction of the commission with an executive committee being established to supplement the advisory council and work very closely with the commissioners and commission staff in determining and monitoring the operational strategy of the commission.  Furthermore, the report recommended that a new post of chief executive should <Col N="1246" /> be created and that new headquarters premises and equipment for the staff be acquired.</P>
    <P>Those and other recommendations of the review were accepted by both Governments and legislation is now under preparation in both jurisdictions to implement them.  It is hoped to have this legislation in place next year.</P>
    <P>The employment of a new chief executive was arranged under existing legislation and Mr. R.J. Derick Anderson commenced employment as the chief executive on 15 January 1996.  In addition, the commission has been successful in securing almost £700,000 since 1994 under the EU Fisheries Surveillance Programme.  A new seagoing fisheries patrol vessel was acquired under this programme and commenced operations during the 1995 season.  Funding under this programme has also been used to address the deficiencies identified in the review in so far as equipment and vehicles are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to report that the commission was successful in its application for funding under the salmonid enhancement scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  Under that scheme, funded under the special support programme for peace and reconciliation, the commission will receive more than £240,000 up to the end of 1997 in respect of the establishment of a hatchery, the installation of fish counters and fishing surveys.</P>
    <P>A number of other legal and technical issues have been agreed with Belfast as requiring amendments to the Foyle legislation over and above the items covered in the recent review.  It is proposed to take the opportunity to make the necessary changes which, accordingly, have been incorporated in the draft heads.  They include strengthening the enforcement powers of authorised officers, those who support them and private river watchers and providing additional protection against the use of specified undesirable fishing gear and empowering the commission to fix fishery rates.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the commission has issued a consultation document and invited views from interested parties, North and South, on how it might carry out these new roles.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these proposals will have positive economic benefit for the fisheries resource as a whole in the cross-Border region and will enable the Foyle Fisheries Commission to realise new opportunities for development and strategic planning on an efficient and effective basis.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 11 December 1996.</P>

      <P>Subsistence allowance is only payable where personnel who are performing duties away from their stations are not provided with meals.  This does not arise frequently, however, as there is a comprehensive catering system in place in Border units to cope with feeding troops in the field.  Full hot meals are provided in barracks for those performing the duty before commencement and on completion of duty.  Also, while on patrol personnel receive flasks of hot tea or coffee and sandwiches.  A meal allowance is not payable to members of the permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to add, however, that in addition to basic pay, a military service allowance is payable to all members of the permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,070 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £39.68 per week &mdash; £2,070 per annum &mdash; with the exception <Col N="1248" /> of privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.29 per week.  The allowance is paid irrespective of the actual hours worked.  In addition, all personnel posted to Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £49.57 per week in the case of officers and £44.47 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates.  The allowance is paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.</P>

      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The current strength on the Naval Service is 992.  The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.</P>
      <P>Advertisements were placed in the national newspapers recently inviting applications for enlistment in the Army and in the Naval Service in 1996 and 1997.  I propose to enlist 200 recruits in 1996 and a further 400 in 1997.  The number to be assigned to the Navy has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>As I outlined previously to the House, the EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.  The enforcement of the new control measures agreed in December 1995 is being examined in this context.  The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that Ireland will derive the maximum benefit from the available EU support.  The position in relation to the programme for 1997 is that Ireland's submission was passed to the Commission before the deadline of 30 June 1996 and provides for a downpayment on an additional Naval Patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>Requests for proposals for the supply of a patrol vessel were advertised in the Official Journal of the European Community.  The deadline for receipt of proposals is 10 January 1997.  On the basis of the proposals received, a shortlist of suitable potential tenderers will be invited to tender.  It is anticipated that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the latter half of 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission will consider Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other <Col N="1249" /> member states and will decide before the end of January next on the level of funding to be made available in 1997.  Pending the implementation of the five year programme the Naval Service will continue to carry out its various roles using the existing seven patrol vessels, a number of which it is expected will be refurbished under the five year programme.</P>

      <QRef>[23154/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly points out, there is significant, incremental growth in consumer demand for seafood within the EU and indeed worldwide. Demand for fish and fish products will continue to grow and underlines the opportunities and challenges for the Irish catching, aquaculture and processing sector.  I am committed to ensuring that policy and strategies for the sector are closely geared towards meeting those opportunities and challenges.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant upward growth curve in Irish fish landings and exports, both in volume and value terms over recent years. Landings of whitefish have risen from 35,500 tonnes worth over £39 million in 1993 to over 46,000 tonnes worth over £48 million last year. Ongoing investment support strategies for the sector have been a key contributing factor to this growth.  The operational programme for fisheries is providing support for a total investment of £140 million between 1994 and 1999 in the catching, processing and aquaculture sectors.  The investment support strategies are designed in particular to improve the efficiency, competitiveness and safety of the fishing fleet backed up by investment support for modernisation and development of the processing sector.  The whitefish fleet has received significant grant aid over the last three years, totalling £3.7 million towards the cost of 177 vessel modernisation projects.</P>
      <P>The good take-up to date of the available incentives for modernisation of existing whitefish vessels is contributing to the overall objectives for the fleet.  Grant aid for the processing sector totalled £5.8 million in the same period, the benefits of which will also contribute to the economic viability of the catching sector as a supplier of the raw material for processing and added value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment support strategy under the operational programme has the overall objective of increasing fish landings to over 300,000 tonnes worth £118 million by the year 2000 with the consequent increases in exports jobs and value <Col N="1250" /> added right across the fisheries sector as available.</P>
    <P>I am also reviewing future directions for fleet policy overall which will give full consideration to all relevant factors including the economics of realising available fishing opportunities, EU developments and safety considerations.  To inform the policy review, a consultancy study is currently being undertaken to assess the relative social and economic merits of the introduction of new boats into the whitefish fleet as against the modernisation of existing vessels.  The allocation of funds for renewal of the whitefish fleet will be considered in the context of the policy review.</P>
    <P>Policy must also have regard for the particular challenges facing the whitefish sector in terms of the market and the state of fish stocks generally. These are fundamental challenges facing the EU whitefish sector as a whole and national and EU policy must be geared towards addressing these difficulties.</P>
    <P>The EU is a net importer of fish and fish products in order to meet growing consumer and processing industry demand which outstrips ability to supply from within the EU itself. Seasonal supply/demand and market difficulties have characterised the EU whitefish sector over many years.  The sector is vulnerable to fluctuations in supply and demand reflecting the fact that it mainly serves the fresh market notably in Spain, France, the UK and Ireland.  There is also a competitive difficulty to be met given the significant level of imports of whitefish each year into the EU which are usually destined for the processing sector.  The EU whitefish catching sector as a whole and the Irish whitefish fleet face the challenge of overcoming seasonal supply fluctuations and price competitiveness <i>vis á vis</i> third country sources.</P>
    <P>Continued growth and development of the EU and Irish whitefish sector is, however, most critically dependent on fish stock levels being maintained and improved through effective conservation management and protection policies.  The depletion of stocks through overfishing is the single most serious threat to the future of the catching sector worldwide.  Policy strategies at EU level must be geared to optimising management and conservation of fish stocks backed up by strict enforcement.</P>
    <P>My objective during the Irish Presidency has been to drive forward the necessary strategies on all these fronts and I am confident that following the final Fisheries Council of our term in two weeks time we will be able to demonstrate significant progress towards ensuring long-term conservation and management of fleet policies which will offer the best guarantee for the future sustainable development of the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>The management of a major emergency such as the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident could involve a wide range of specific, prioritised, linked interventions including, air-sea rescue, salvage which includes securing and towing a vessel, cargo transfer and pollution response at sea and onshore.</P>
      <P>The official report of the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident, however, has not yet been published but it is expected to deal with serious issues in relation to management of such major marine emergency incidents, in particular, regarding the emergency response as the incident unfolded.  In view of the high volume tanker traffic in the Irish Sea and the tanker traffic to our own ports we will be closely examining the response, conclusions and recommendations of the report when finalised with a view to helping to ensure that the casualty potential of these tankers is eliminated or controlled.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine was kept fully informed on a daily basis of all aspects of the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident.  The Irish marine emergency service, IMES, of my Department has been closely involved with the UK marine emergency services and the EU Commission and is in receipt of various scientific and technical papers and initial reports produced and published following the incident.  During the early days of the incident IMES had a senior officer on-scene as an observer attached to the joint response centre and with the clean-up teams.</P>
      <P>Essential elements for an efficient and effective prevention, monitoring and response to a <i>Sea Empress</i> type incident are the availability and capability of suitable emergency towing facilities, role fitted aircraft, sufficient trained and exercised technical, press and operational management personnel and sufficient appropriate response equipment.</P>
      <P>We have, however, already in place contingency plans to respond to marine emergencies.  These plans define the precise roles and responsibilities of the response agencies, local authorities, harbour authorities, on-shore and off-shore oil companies and central Government.  The Irish marine emergency service has the authority to task all available resources within the State and call for whatever equipment, vessels and personnel which might be required from international sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under Directive 93/75/EEC, known as HAZMAT, which came into force in September 1995, vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods and bound for or leaving a port in an EU member state, are required to notify designated national authorities of their intended route and cargo on board.  The directive's definition of dangerous and polluting goods does not, however, include those materials covered by the IMO's code for the safe carriage of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive waste in flasks on board ships, INF code.</P>
      <P>In view of Ireland's concern about shipment of nuclear materials in general, and particularly through the Irish Sea, we have been pressing for some time to have this serious anomaly addressed.  While the European Commission indicated its support in principle for Ireland's position many months ago, I insisted that this sentiment should be translated into positive action and should form part of the Irish Presidency agenda.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Commission introduced at the October meeting of the Council of Transport Minister a proposal for a Council Directive amending the HAZMAT directive.  The purpose of this amending directive is to extend the scope of the HAZMAT directive to cover the carriage of materials included in the INF code; to supplement information given in the annexes to the directive in light of developments in international legislation; and to facilitate the amendment of those annexes in light of future developments in international legislation by applying the committee procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Commission's proposals fully meet Ireland's concerns regarding the <Col N="1253" /> adequacy of the HAZMAT directive.  The amending directive has been examined and discussed at a number of Council working group meetings in Brussels, at which senior officials of my Department were in attendance.  While I understand that a few member states expressed reservations regarding the need for the amendment, I am now satisfied that the robust case presented by Ireland, and indeed the Commission, has been persuasive, and I am looking forward with confidence to securing political agreement on this proposal at this week's forthcoming Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>While progress in relation to the expansion of the scope of the HAZMAT directive represents a significant political advance, the work being pursued in the International Maritime Organisation aimed at strengthening the INF code is also of considerable importance in improving the security of marine transport of INF materials.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to expand the statutory role of the commission to include the development of the fisheries resource and the promotion and development of angling facilities and to provide powers for the licensing and regulation of aquaculture and sea fishing within Lough Foyle.

      <P>Work has commenced on the preparation of the environmental quality status report, OSPAR, for the entire area covered by the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic, OSPAR, to which Ireland is a party.  For the purpose of the report the convention area has been divided into five sub-regions.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the United Kingdom are required to prepare the report in respect of that part of the north east Atlantic region &mdash; Celtic Seas &mdash; extending westwards of the UK mainland to the edge of the continental shelf, 200 metre depth. The area includes all of Ireland's marine and coastal areas.</P>
      <P>The report will comprise of: a compilation of existing knowledge, physics, chemistry, biology, human activities, of the area; an assessment of this information in relation to agreed critera of environmental quality; and a statement of the prevailing condition of the area.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with similar reports on the four other parts of the OSPAR region, the Celtic Seas QSR will be assimilated into a convention-wide QSR that will be published in the year 2000.  It is expected that the draft of the report in respect of the Irish-UK region will be completed early in 1998.</P>
      <P>The Irish contribution to the QSR is being managed by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Departments of the Environment and of the Marine.  The institute has established a QSR office at the Forbairt laboratory in Shannon, County Clare, staffed by a team of four marine scientists.  The team is lead by Mr. Rick Boelens, a recognised international expert in marine environmental science, who has been seconded to the institute for this two year project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question on the inclusion of an inventory of munitions dumpsites off the UK and Irish coastlines into the QSR, this matter was raised by Ireland at a recent scientific working group of OSPAR.  Agreement was reached on having such an inventory included in the QSR.  The completion of an inventory will be the first step towards development of guidelines for the management and monitoring of such sites. <Col N="1255" /> Ireland was represented at this meeting by an officer of the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite in particular, Deputies will be aware that my colleague at the Department of the Marine, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, met with the UK Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and the Environment, Scottish Office, Lord Lindsay, and the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State, UK Ministery of Defence, Lord Howe, in London last February to discuss the management and monitoring of this dumpsite.  It was agreed at that meeting that the Scottish Ofice would undertake a new study of the Beaufort Dyke dumpsite in order to remap and rechart the extent of the dumpsite and distribution of munitions within the site.  This study was completed in August and the report of the study was published on 28 November.  The level of co-operation between officials and scientists of both Governments in relation to the carrying out of the survey was excellent.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the pattern of distribution of dumped munitions and the extent of the dumpsite have now been established in so far as this is practically possible.  This information increases our knowledge in relation to the dumpsite and will assist in ensuring that any activities in the region of the site will not result in disturbances. The Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore will be meeting with Lord Lindsay and Lord Howe in Dublin this month to assess the results of the report and to discuss what further steps are now required.</P>

      <P>There is a significant and growing level of marine research being carried out in Irish universities and regional technical colleges.  Much of this research is funded under EU RTD programmes under the fourth framework programme and a number of joint industry/third level projects are being funded under the research measure of the operational programme for fisheries which is administered by the Marine Institute.</P>
      <P>The need for improved co-ordination and interaction between third level institution and enterprises was highlighted in the report of the science technology and innovation advisory committee in 1995 and has been endorsed in the recently published White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation.  This requirement applies across all sectors including the marine and fisheries sector.</P>
      <P>The objective, therefore, in line with overall national science and technology policy considerations and within the marine policy framework itself, is to gear marine RTD strategies towards building strong links between third level institutions and the marine and fishing industries.  The Martine Institute has a pivotal role to play in achieving maximum co-ordination and prioritisation of marine research expenditure to meet the S&amp;T and development needs of the sector.  To that end the institute is preparing a national RTD strategy for the marine sectors in the context of the overall review of marine policy currently under way.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions No. 59 of 7 March 1996 and No. 18 and 52 of 4 July 1996, giving, <i>inter alia,</i> details of my external and internal travel during the period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of my official commitments for the period 1 July 1996 to the present are set out in the following tables.  During this period I participated in 13 EU meetings at ministerial level, ten Troika ministerial meetings, 16 Anglo Irish meetings/talks, a Western European Union <Col N="1263" /> ministerial meeting and two Bosnia Conference meetings.  I also attended the UN General Assembly in New York, where I had in excess of 30 meetings in four days both in my capacity as President in Office of the EU and bilaterals at foreign ministerial level.  The cost chargeable to my Department for flights during this period was £702.00.</P>

      <P>The Florence European Council in June requested the Irish Presidency to prepare a &ldquo;general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties&rdquo; for consideration by Heads of State or Government at the European Council in Dublin on 13 and 14 December 1996.  As the Deputy is aware, the Presidency last week produced an outline draft treaty reflecting months of intensive negotiations.  A copy has been sent to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The outline draft treaty focuses among other things on enhancing the Union's external action. It recognises that, despite the fact it is the world's largest trading entity, the European Union is not as effective as it should be in using its diplomatic influence and economic capacity in relations with third countries and in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the world.  The outline draft treaty makes a number of proposals which are designed to enhance the effectiveness and coherence of the Union's external action.  The detailed proposals in the document concern both the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the external economic relations of the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Common Foreign and Security Policy is concerned the proposals envisage a number of elements which would enable the Union to ensure a more effective and co-ordinated approach.  These include: the establishment of a new planning and early warning capability to be established under the responsibility of the Secretary General of the Council; improved decision-making procedures; and association of the Commission in an enhanced way with CFSP policy implementation and representation with a view to ensuring <Col N="1265" /> coherence in the overall external action of the Union.</P>
    <P>As far as external economic relations are concerned, the outline draft treaty envisages a limited extension of external Community competence in order to make it possible for the Community to act rapidly and decisively in the highly competitive and rapidly changing international trading environment, notably in the World Trade Organisation, in the areas of services, intellectual property and direct foreign investment.</P>
    <P>These are, of course, very complex and sensitive areas and unanimous agreement will be required for any treaty changes.  Nevertheless we are confident that our proposals in this area will be reflected at the end of the Conference in significant improvements in the Union's external action.</P>

      <P>As set out in the statement on the priorities for the Irish Presidency, which was published at the beginning of our term in office, our Presidency has been committed to the development of relations with the countries that have applied for membership of the Union.  This priority reflects the decisions taken at the Madrid meeting of the European Council in December 1995, which confirmed that the next round of enlargement negotiations will commence six months after the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference, taking its results into account.  The European Council at Madrid also asked the Commission to expedite preparation of its opinions on the applications for membership of the Union by the Associated States of central and eastern Europe so that they can be forwarded to the Council as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to preparing for enlargement, the European Council at Madrid also charged the Commission with preparing a number of studies and reports.  The Commission was asked to take its evaluation of the effects of enlargement on Community policies further, to prepare a composite paper on enlargement, and a detailed analysis of the European Union's financing system in order to submit, immediately after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, a communication on the future financial framework of the Union as from 31 December 1999, having regard to the prospect of enlargement.  This week's meeting of the European Council in Dublin will provide a valuable opportunity to its members to take stock <Col N="1266" /> of progress by the Commission in the preparation of these opinions and reports.</P>
    <P>Given that we are now in the lead-in period to the opening of accession negotiations, and given that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference is ongoing, the emphasis during the Irish Presidency with regard to the enlargement process has been placed on the continuing process of developing the Union's relations with the Associated States.  In this regard the efficient and effective management of the day-to-day aspects of the Union's relations with the Associated States has also been an important goal.  The successful conduct of the Intergovernmental Conference, with a view to its concluding, on schedule, at the Amsterdam meeting of the European Council in June next year has, of course, been central to maintaining momentum towards enlargement.</P>

      <Quest>the efforts, if any, he is making to ensure that any national industrial actions in an EU country do not affect international trade when the particular country is a designated international trade route.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Irish Government is not in a position to intervene directly to ensure that national industrial disputes in another EU country do not affect international trade.  However, every effort possible is made at a political and diplomatic level to assist Irish traders and transporters affected by such disputes and to minimise the extent of the disruptions suffered.</P>
      <P>For example, in the case of the recent French dispute, which I presume the Deputy had in mind when asking this question, the Irish Embassy in Paris made strong representations on behalf of Irish hauliers at a very early stage in the blockades throughout France.  These interventions drew attention to the particular difficulties being experienced by Irish hauliers as a result of the blockades and asked that every assistance be given to them in order that they could proceed on their journeys.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is keeping in close contact with the Irish Road Haulage Association on the issue of compensation and the Irish Embassy in Paris is in communication with the French Transport Ministry in order to ensure that this issue is progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications responded in detail to the issues surrounding this dispute on 5 December 1996 and outlined the discussions held at EU level on this matter.  In summary, these included a request to France to intervene on the matter.  This was made at the Internal Market Council held on 26 November, where Ireland, along with a number of other member states expressed concern about <Col N="1267" /> the adverse effects of the strike upon the functioning of the internal market.  The matter was also raised by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on 27 November at a meeting with Commissioner Kinnock and they agreed that intervention at that stage was not necessary since the French authorities had already made substantial progress towards finding a solution.</P>
    <P>On the question of routes which are designated as international trade routes, if the Deputy is referring to international transport agreements, he might address himself to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, who has responsibility for such matters.</P>

      <P>The opening plenary session of the multi-party talks in Belfast is continuing to consider the question of decommissioning.  As was reiterated at the most recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which was held in Belfast on 20 November, both Governments remain committed to the implementation of all aspects of the report of the international body as the best possible basis for progress in relation to decommissioning.  We continue to hope that <Col N="1268" /> agreement will be reached with the other participants on such an approach, and that it will accordingly be possible to effect the earliest possible transition into substantive three stranded negotiations on this basis.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the conditions for participation in the talks has been set out by me in the House on many occasions, and I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave on this matter to Deputy Burke on 31 October, Official Report, Volume 470, No. 8, columns 1655-1659. The Government believes that Sinn Féin should be included in the talks once those conditions are fulfilled, and we are anxious to see that objective fulfilled as soon as possible.  That is a strong argument for the earliest possible reinstatement of the IRA ceasefire which, as I have said, should never have been broken.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not received an application for repayment of vehicle registration tax under the scrappage scheme from the person referred to in the Deputy's question.  However, an inquiry on behalf of the wife of the person concerned was received from a County Cork motor dealer last month in regard to a vehicle which was first registered in 1980.  Unfortunately this vehicle had only been acquired by the person concerned in May 1995 and consequently it fell considerably short of a legal requirement of the scheme, that the scrapped vehicle must have been taxed and insured in the name of the person concerned for at least two years prior to the date it is scrapped. However, the vehicle will be eligible from May 1997, as I have recently announced the final extension of the scheme to 31 December 1997. The replacement new car may be purchased up to one month before the date of scrapping.</P>

      <Quest>if he will list all subsidies which are received by farmers as income subsidies and which are so regarded for tax purposes; if he will list the subsidies not considered as income; and the estimated amount of each of the listed subsidies in each of the years 1994 and 1995.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on figures published by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, subsidies received by farmers as income subsidies in the years 1994 and 1995 were as per the following schedule.</P>
      <P>Income tax statistics do not distinguish between the amounts of tax that arise from farm subsidies and from other sources.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that to provide the breakdown required would necessitate a detailed examination of all the returns received from farmers.  Such an examination could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>The general position is as follows.  First, where a payment is made to a farmer in circumstances where it is intended to be a subsidy towards income, it will generally be taxible as income. Second, where the payment made is intended to be an amount to aid the purchase of a capital item, it will generally reduce the cost of the item for capital gains tax purposes and for capital allowances purposes, if appropriate.  Third, payments made for the forfeiture or surrender of rights will generally be liable to capital gains tax. Fourth, certain payments made may be income payments but are exempted by virtue of certain provisions in the Income Tax Acts, e.g. forestry premia may be exempted under section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifth, in rare instances payments under a scheme may be both income and capital in <Col N="1275" /> nature, e.g. a small part of payments made under the rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, may be capital.  Sixth, some of the payments listed on the following schedule under the heading other milk payments are categorised for tax purposes as capital receipts.  Installation aid for young farmers is also categorised as capital for tax purposes.  Otherwise, all of the payments listed in the schedule are regarded as income for tax purposes.  Seventh, it has not been possible, in the time available, to extract a list of subsidies not considered as income subsidies.  This list will be compiled in the near future and a copy will be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Representations were received in February last from the persons mentioned by the Deputy for changes in the taxation legislation dealing with discretionary trusts.  Two changes were proposed in the representations.  One change proposed was the extension of the capital gains tax retirement relief to cover specified categories of disposals of business assets by trustees to specified categories of relatives of the person who set up the trust. The second change proposed was the crediting of discretionary trust tax paid against any capital acquisitions tax liability arising for the recipients of assets distributed from discretionary trusts. Discussions subsequently took place between officials and representatives of the person concerned in regard to the proposals in view of their complex nature and the issues involved.  It was made clear by officials that they had no mandate for negotiation and what they were doing was exploring the matter.  In the event the proposals put forward by the representatives were not acceptable and this was made clear to the representatives in October.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that proposals from other persons or representative groups suggesting changes in the taxation rules governing discretionary trusts have been made from time to time over recent years.  The last change in the taxation legislation governing discretionary trusts occurred in the 1994 Finance Act when the 3 per cent initial tax on these trusts was doubled to 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be mentioned that the <Col N="1279" /> introduction of and improvement in the business relief for capital acquisitions tax in the last three Finance Acts has significantly changed the taxation environment relating to the reasons for the setting up of discretionary trusts where business assets are involved, and this undoubtedly prompted requests for certain taxation changes in relation to these trusts.  As the Deputy will know, the new business relief was welcomed by various Dáil spokesmen during the course of the discussions on the budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has wide-ranging implications for many Departments and agencies.  The Government has approved the establishment of a monitoring committee whose function will be to monitor implementation of the commission's recommendations and an interdepartmental task force to prepare the Government's plan of action.  The latter group will consider the implications of the commission's report for the various Government Departments and agencies involved.  My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, is proceeding with the arrangements for the establishment of these groups.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether it is unfair to ask young couples to pay 6 per cent of the purchase price of a house in the form of stamp duty in view of the recent significant price increases in the real property market, particularly in the Dublin area, and in view of the fact that an average three bedroom terrace house can cost from £70,000 upwards, which means that a young couple buying a house for the first time pay in excess of £4,200, almost half the annual wage of unskilled workers and also of a large number of newly graduated third level students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>There are a number of important reliefs and exemptions which are primarily aimed at assisting house buyers to purchase new homes.  There is a full exemption from stamp duty for purchases of new houses with a floor area below 125 square metres. Purchases of new houses with a larger floor area attract stamp duty based only on the site value, subject to a minimum site value of one-quarter of the full house, plus site, value.  The targeting of these stamp duty reliefs in favour of new houses takes account, <i>inter alia</i>, of the fact that most new house sales are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent, whereas sales of second-hand houses generally are not.  There is also 100 per cent mortgage interest tax relief for first time buyers of both new and second-hand houses and a reduced rate of relief for other mortgage holders.  In addition, there is a generous £3,000 new house grant available for first time buyers of new houses.  All these exemptions/reliefs and grants help to moderate the cost of housing generally and also play an important role in promoting employment within the construction sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the case that house prices have been rising in some areas at a rate greater than inflation in recent years.  However, it is by no means certain that a reduction in the rates of stamp duty would be passed on to the purchaser of a property, particularly, in a buoyant property market.  The likelihood is that, in such circumstances, any reductions in stamp duty would accrue to those selling second-hand properties and would not benefit home buyers.  In fact, I believe that the <Col N="1281" /> current levels of stamp duty on the transfer of second-hand houses do serve, to a very real extent, to protect the housing market against property speculation.  This is supported by commentators within the property market itself.</P>
    <P>Finally, the importance of the substantial Exchequer yield from stamp duty on the transfer of land and buildings which is estimated at between £180 million and £190 million for this year must be borne in mind when framing taxation policy.  The yield from stamp duty represents a large component of the overall yield from capital taxes and makes a very significant contribution towards the cost of implementing the Government's important social and economic programme.  Were the Exchequer yield from this stamp duty to be reduced, which would be the case if the threshold at which the 6 per cent rate applies were to be increased, it would be necessary to bring in compensating measures elsewhere in the taxation code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The management at St. Vincent's Hospital readily admit that referrals to the hospital's breast clinic have increased significantly in recent years.  The clinic was the first of its kind in this country and to some extent its success has led to the rapid increase in patient referrals, very many of whom come from regions well outside the St. Vincent's catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key principles in the health strategy is the need for enhanced regional self sufficiency in the provision of hospital services.  In relation to the operation of the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital, it is my view that this clinic should be a <Col N="1282" /> model for the development of breast clinics elsewhere but cannot substitute for the provision of these services on a regional basis.  The regional development of clinics would, of course, ensure that the service would be provided in close proximity to the women who avail of it.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been put in place to reduce pressure on the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital and further improvements are planned.  For example, in 1995 only one clinic per week was held.  In response to the growing number of patients attending the clinic, a second clinic was introduced each Friday afternoon. Also, the hospital is conscious of the need to curtail the number of inappropriate referrals presenting at the clinic and accordingly it has been in contact with general practitioners as part of an ongoing educational campaign.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I was pleased to provide additional funds to the hospital to facilitate the introduction of new nurse led clinics which are now held twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays.  These additional clinics deal with return patients who would not necessarily require to be seen by a consultant.  In addition, one of the consultant surgeons, together with the specialist breast clinic nurse, is seeing patients every Wednesday.  Again, these clinics are focused on return patients who require time for discussion and counselling.  I also understand from St. Vincent's Hospital that the block booking of patients on Friday's has ceased and patients are now given appointment times.</P>
    <P>In general, the hospital has informed me that waiting times at the breast clinic have improved. The hospital management and the breast clinic staff are doing everything possible to try and alleviate waiting times and to improve services. Finally, the hospital has stressed that women referred to the clinic who require urgent appointments are given appointments at the following Friday clinic.</P>
    <P>In the long-term I was pleased to announce a major capital upgrading of St. Vincent's Hospital which will cost approximately £33 million. Included in this development will be a major upgrading of the physical conditions within the existing breast clinic.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated recently in the House, the provision of funding to voluntary organisations, such as Brainwave, is a matter for the health boards.  To date this year, health boards have allocated a total of £28,400 to Brainwave.  As discussions in relation to overall health expenditure in 1997 are still ongoing, I am not in a position to comment at this stage on any particular area of expenditure.  An officer of my Department recently held a meeting with representatives of Brainwave at which the subject of funding and other topics of concern to the association were fully explored.  The matters raised were brought to the attention of the chief executive officers of health boards.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy should note that as well as availing themselves of services provided in the normal course of health service through the health boards, people with epilepsy are entitled under the long-term illness scheme to obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition.</P>
      <P>The amount of funding approved by health boards in 1996 for Brainwave is set out in the table below.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to answer Questions Nos. 54 to 56, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy, I am fully supportive of the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer.  The Protocol, whilst recognising that there is an existing and continuing requirement for inhaled medications such as CFC-containing metered dose inhalers, calls for the elimination of such products by the year 2005.</P>
      <P>The research and development necessary to provide alternative products is proceeding and the schedule for the safe introduction of new propellants and reformulated products is on schedule.  Already the first such product has become available and, in fact, was launched in Ireland earlier this year.  In addition, there are a number of applications currently under assessment by the Irish Medicines Board for other CFC-free products and it is likely that these will become available in the coming year.  As more reformulated non-CFC containing products become available, we can expect to see the virtual elimination of CFC-containing inhalers.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the availability of non-CFC inhalers and, at the same time looking forward to the eventual elimination of CFC-containing products, I must recognise that ultimately the decision to prescribe any particular medicine is a matter for individual medical practitioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A study of the prevalence of MRSA in Irish hospitals was carried out on behalf of the committee on the control of MRSA which was established by my Department.  This survey serves as an important baseline for measuring the effectiveness of the guidelines on the control of MRSA published by my Department.  I am also committed to ensuring that future trends in the prevalence of MRSA will be closely monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> The establishment of a national disease surveillance unit that would build on the reporting systems which have been developed in some regions and which would assist in the control of all communicable diseases, including hospital acquired infections such as MRSA is currently being considered.</P>
    <P>The proposed developments in the area of disease surveillance at national level accord with a current proposal at EU level which seeks to create a network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the European Community.  The network will operate through a system of close co-operation and effective coordination between member states.  The disease categories to be covered by the proposed network includes hospital acquired infections of which MRSA is one.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for post-adoption contact between birth parents and adopted persons and access to birth records is a priority of the Government.  It is my firm intention that the necessary enabling legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible after a number of legal and constitutional issues, which are currently before the Surpreme Court by way of case stated from the Circuit Court, have been clarified.  These legal and constitutional issues will have a direct bearing on the nature and scope of the framework that will be put in place.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I am proceeding with arrangements for the establishment, on an administrative basis, of an adoption contact register to assist adoptees and birth mothers who wish to be put in touch with one another.  My Department is currently developing proposals in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that a special programme to replace substandard facilities for persons with disabilities should be urgently introduced and that this programme should be protected from normal competition for funding within the services generally.  The commission made particular reference to St. Ita's, Portrane, because of the large number of persons with a mental handicap currently accommodated there.</P>
      <P>My Department has been working closely with the Eastern Health Board to implement the proposals of the board as submitted in 1994 to transfer clients with a mental handicap to community settings, where appropriate, and to improve the accommodation and services available to those clients who need to be cared for in a more structured environment.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Ita's, capital funding amounting to £500,000 has been provided by my Department in the period 1993-95 for the upgrading of existing accommodation.  A further capital grant of £250,000 was allocated in respect of refurbishment work in 1996.  In the period 1993-95 revenue funding amounting to £265,000 has been provided to increase staffing levels, to provide multi-disciplinary support and to enhance services to persons with a mental handicap who are also behaviourally distrubed.  Revenue funding of £280,000 and capital funding of £500,000 have also been provided in recent years to transfer persons of the hospital campus.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million is also being made available over a two year period, £1 million of which was allocated in 1996, to provide additional residential facilities on the southside of Dublin city which will assist in the transfer of persons from St. Ita's hospital campus.  The inspector of mental hospitals noted the enhancement of the overall appearance of clinical areas and also the improvement in staff morale in his 1995 report, the publication of which is imminent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national intellectual disability database is now providing my Department, the health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies with information on both the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap over a five year period.  This includes the needs of those who <Col N="1292" /> may require an alternative replacement.  I would hope to continue the development of further services for persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the database.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the condition post polio syndrome and of the effects it has on people with the syndrome.  Sufferers are entitled to apply for assistance under a wide range of schemes which are available to all people with disabilities, irrespective of their particular condition.

      <P>As the Deputy may know, the recently published report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recognised the additional costs of disability and recommended the introduction of a cost of disability allowance to compensate people with disabilities for these additional costs.  The report's recommendations will be considered by an interdepartmental committee which will report to Government on its implementation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is currently finalising its report on the development of health and personal support services for people with disabilities, including people with post polio syndrome.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Midland Health Board concerning this case and have been assured that the application has been reviewed on hardship grounds.  However, as the person's income was substantially over the standard income guidelines the health board considered that the applicant would not be entitled to a medical card on hardship grounds.  Should the circumstances of the applicant change a fresh application would, of course, be treated in a sympathetic manner by the health board.</P>
      <P>Non medical card holders are entitled to all inpatient and accident and emergency public hospital services subject only to modest statutory charges.

      <P>I have made inquiries with the Southern Health Board concerning this child and I am aware that some difficulties exist concerning his educational requirements.  I am anxious that the difficulties and uncertainties concerning the child's future educational requirements will be quickly resolved.  All agencies concerned with the child's welfare are co-operating closely in deciding upon suitable arrangements for the child.  A case conference was held recently to consider a number of initiatives and I am hopeful that a suitable placement can shortly be finalised.  I will communicate with the Deputy directly when specific details have been worked out between all agencies concerned with the child's welfare.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Officials of my Department held a one day information workshop on the statutory registration of certain designated health and social professions in Dublin Castle on 1 November 1995.  The workshop provided a forum for discussion on the possible introduction of legislation which would allow for the regulation and control of a number of professions with a view to the maintenance of a high standard of professional education and conduct amongst registered members of those professions, and so to protect the public.  Representatives of a wide range of professional bodies were in attendance, including members of four groups which represent the interests of the chiropodists.  However, while work on this area is ongoing within my Department, it should be noted that these discussions are still at a preliminary stage.</P>

      <P>To date in 1996, I have taken ten flights outside the State and two flights within the State at a total cost to my Department of £16,279.35. The net cost is £14,512.35 when regard is had to a refund made by the Council of the European Union of costs associated with travel.  No direct costs were incurred by my Department on those occasions when Government aircraft was used. All flights were of a return nature except for a one way flight which I took on 18 November 1996 from Cork to Dublin.  The precise details sought in relation to these flights, including the composition of the official party on each occasion, are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the NESF on equality proofing issues as a valuable contribution to policy making in the areas covered.  As decided by the Government, I have taken the report into consideration in the context of my legislative programme and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the NESF report No. 10 on equality proofing issues have been examined in the context of the Employment <Col N="1300" /> Equality Bill, 1996.  A number of amendments to the Bill introduced on Committee Stage and under consideration for Report Stage respond to issues raised by the NESF in its report and subsequently in the forum's recently published opinion on the Bill.  Consideration is also being given to the report's recommendations on equal status legislation.  I hope that the Equal Status Bill can be finalished and published as soon as possible.  The Deputy will appreciate that, until this happens, its precise contents cannot be divulged.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency of the EU, in conjunction with the EU Commission, held a seminar on 7 and 8 October on mechanisms for mainstreaming. This afforded a valuable opportunity to examine concrete strategies in use at EU level and in the various member states.</P>
    <P>With regard to the representation of women on State boards, the most recent data shows that women constitute 34.2 per cent of the Government/ ministerial nominees and 25.5 per cent of total membership of State boards.  These figures have increased since 1992 from 17 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.  The situation is kept under review and figures are obtained on a quarterly basis.  The aim is to reach 40 per cent gender balance.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women presented its report to the Taoiseach in February, 1993.  The report contained 211 recommendations covering issues on the Constitution and law, health, education, employment and training, women in decision making, rural women, women in the home, childcare and culture and sport.  A monitoring committee was subsequently established by me and has, to date, published two progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations. The second progress report indicates that almost 80 per cent of the recommendations have been acted upon with 47 per cent implemented in full. The monitoring committee will continue to monitor and report on the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The National Women's Council of Ireland, formerly the Council for the Status of Women, was established following the publication of the report of the First Commission on the Status of Women in 1972.  It is the national umbrella organisation representing over 130 women's organisations at national, regional and local levels.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform funds the council.  The Commission on the Status of Women recommended doubling of the council's grant from £114,000 in 1992.  This year the council received £170,000 which amounts to an increase of 21.4 per cent over the 1995 allocation and an increase of 49 per cent on the 1992 provision.</P>
    <P>A report on Ireland's position in relation to implementation of the platform for action agreed at Beijing is being prepared by my Department and should be available within the next two weeks.  A national mechanism to oversee <Col N="1301" /> implementation of the platform for action is being established by the Department.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community was considered by the Government and a range of actions decided.  Relevant Departments, in particular the Departments of the Environment, Health and Education, are advancing the implementation of their respective elements of the Government strategy in response to the report of the task force.  The Employment Equality Bill and the proposed Equal Status Bill will, of course, prohibit discrimination on grounds of membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities endorses the NESF recommendations on equality proofing with regard to people with disabilities.  The commission believes that there is an urgent need for the Government to adopt a policy of &ldquo;disability-proofing&rdquo; legislation and any public policy initiatives.  It recommends that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform should bring proposals to Government within six months aimed at securing agreement to adopting a policy on disability proofing.</P>
    <P>This recommendation will be considered in the context of the work of the inter-departmental task force which will be established to prepare the Government's plan of action arising from the report as well as that of the monitoring committee which will be set up to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>My role in the certification of film or television productions seeking to raise investments under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, is set down in that legislation and elaborated in the statutory guidelines for certification which were made by me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, dated 15 June 1994.</P>
      <P>In the summary, the guidelines require that I must be satisfied that projects make a significant contribution to the national economy and Exchequer and-or act as an effective stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State.  The guidelines require that I will, in particular, bear in mind the importance of the promotion, development and enhancement of the national culture through the medium of film in the certification process.  To this end my examination of film production budgets relates to being satisfied that the costs included in the budget are eligible as costs against which section 35 investments may be raised.</P>
      <P>I have no role in relation to the adequacy or otherwise of the insurance cover included in a budget for a film project.  It is a matter for the employees on such projects or their representatives to satisfy themselves in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that land owned by farmers, which is proposed to be designated under the national heritage areas programme as special areas of conservation, is excluded where there is a need to drain this land in order to alleviate flooding from agricultural land, agricultural yards and private houses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, special areas of conservation, SACs, are required to be established under the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, 92/43/EEC.  The directive specifies the scientific criteria on which sites must be selected. Objections of the inclusion of a site may only be considered if they are scientifically based. Accordingly, it is not open to me to agree to exclude agricultural lands requiring drainage from these sites.</P>
      <P>The Habitats Directive requires that SACs be protected from any significant damage unavoidably that will in some cases lead to drainage works being prohibited, since some of these sites derive their ecological importance from their &ldquo;wetland&rdquo; status.  However, the position is more complex than this.  The directive categorises SACs into those containing priority habitats, which are defined in the directive, and those without such a habitat.</P>
      <P>For SAC sites which do not contain a priority habitat I may permit an activity or development to proceed, even where it may produce a significant adverse effect on a site, if &ldquo;imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature&rdquo; are at issue. This would be subject to appropriate compensatory measures being introduced to ensure the overall quality and size of SAC sites are not reduced and must have the prior agreement of the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The directive specifies that where a site &ldquo;hosts a priority natural habitat, type and-or a priority species, the only considerations which may be raised are those relating to human health or public safety, to beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment or, further to an opinion from the Commission, to other imperative reasons of overriding public interest&rdquo;.</P>

The designation of this site as a special protection area, SPA, under the Article 4 of Council Directive of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, 79/409/EEC, known as the Birds Directives, was notified to the European Commission in October 1988.</P>
      <P>The infringment proceeding referred to was a formal notification by the European Commission under Article 169 of the treaty and in relation to Rogerstown Estuary related to (a) the tiphead of Baleally and (b) the size of the SPA.  In relation to (a) I am advised that Final County Council has engaged consultants to undertake the Baleally landfill study and the consultants have had discussions with officials of my Department on a number of occasions about this study.  With regard to (b) my Department has informed the European Commission of its intention to review the boundaries of all SPAs, including the one at Rogerstown Estuary.</P>
      <P>I understand that the European Commission has acknowledged the major progress made by this country in meeting the requirements of the Birds Directive, particularly in regard to the number of sites designated as SPAs, which now stands at 106 designated sites totalling 205,300 hectares.  Consequently, the Commission is in the process of reviewing the Article 169 notification.</P>

      <P>EU Directive 91/226 does not contain any mandatory provisions which would require to be incorporated in road traffic regulations.  The directive sets out technical requirements which a spray suppression system must meet to obtain EU type approval certification.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations require that, subject to certain exemptions, every vehicle and every trailer attached to a vehicle be equipped with wings or other similar other devices to catch, so far as practicable, mud or water thrown up by the rotation of the wheels or, in the case of a trailer, the rear wheels, unless adequate protection is afforded by the body of the vehicle.  I have no proposals at present to amend these regulations to require the fitment of a spray suppression system which meets the requirements of EU Directive 91/226.</P>

      <P>The production and use of CFCs has been wholly prohibited since 1 January 1995 except for a limited number of essential uses, including use in metered does inhalers, MDIs.  CFC production for these exceptional uses is subject to EU controls and is declining continuously.  As more approved non-CFC based alternatives suitable for all MDI uses becomes available, the use of CFCs in MDIs will declined further and be phased out.</P>
      <P>As a party to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Ireland supported decisions taken recently at the eighth meeting of the parties, 25-28 November 1996, to promote the development of national transitional strategies to non-CFC based MDIs.

      <P>The youth affairs section of my Department administers a scheme of grants in respect of special out of school projects for disadvantaged young people.  Grant aid is made available to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are excluded or marginalised due to a combination of socio-economic factors.</P>
      <P>Youth services in the Ballymun area and in the Dublin city area generally are administered, on behalf of my Department, mainly through the City of Dublin Youth Service Board (Comhairle le Leas Óige), the youth work sub-committee of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  Commensurate with its responsibilities in this area, the City of Dublin Youth Service Board has submitted proposals for some restructuring of the Ballymun Youth Service which seek to refocus activities in order to enhance provision, particularly for those young people who are most severely disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I understand that these proposals, which are currently being considered by my Department, were drawn up following research into the needs of the area and consultation with a broad range of community interests.</P>

    <P>National certificates have been granted by the <Col N="1322" /> NCEA each year since 1972 and holder of this award have a very good record in terms of gaining relevant employment and progressing to higher level awards.  It is also of value to students who receive awards from the National Council for Vocational Awards as these students may gain exemptions from parts of a national certificate and so progress on the ladder of higher education in accordance with their abilities.

      <P>I have been aware that the Carrowreagh national school is currently housed in unsuitable accommodation and that the school hopes to <Col N="1323" /> amalgamate with a nearby school.  For this reason I included a project in my Department's 1996 programme to plan a replacement building to house the amalgamated schools.</P>
      <P>The current position on the project is that the school authorities have recently submitted details of the proposed site for the project and these are currently been examined by my Department's architectural staff.  If the proposed site is suitable the next stage is the preparation of sketch scheme drawings in order that the school authorities may apply for planning permission.  Every effort will be made to advance the project through the various planning stages.</P>

      <P>The development of the designated school concept will require the targeting of additional resources on these schools to ensure the availability of adequate services, including transport services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 144 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1996 higher education grants scheme, independent mature students are defined to be mature students who are not ordinarily resident at home with their parents.  Their entitlement to a grant is assessed without <Col N="1329" /> reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    <P>The address of independent mature students for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is within 15 miles of the college, the adjacent rate of grant is payable.  If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1995-96 academic year, the normal residence of independent mature students was their address in the previous October.  The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant was payable where the student's normal residence was more than 15 miles from the college being attended. There is, however, provision within the scheme for local authorities to review the rate of grant payable where there is a change in the student's normal residence.  This provision effectively allowed local authorities to award an adjacent rate of grant if the student's residence for the purpose of attending college was within 15 miles of the college.</P>
    <P>The 1995 scheme standardised the approach to be adopted by local authorities.  Furthermore, where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college, provision was made to allow local authorities to regard that address as the normal residence and to award a non-adjacent maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>To award the non-adjacent rate to independent mature students irrespective of their address would in effect involve creating a new category within the grant scheme.  This would in turn be likely to lead to demands that this category be applied to all students.  Such a course would involve additional expenditure of about £11 million per annum.</P>

      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of <Col N="1333" /> disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 157, 166 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>Regulation 14 of the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988 provides for the recruitment of persons to the force who have special technical qualifications.  Members recruited under this provision do not have to fulfil all of the admission criteria required of members who are appointed to the regular uniform force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deployment of members of the Garda Síochána is a matter for the Garda authorities and they have informed me that members of the force recruited under Regulation 14 are not, apart from very rare occasions, required to assist with <Col N="1334" /> normal Garda work nor to discharge regular uniform duties.  If Deputies are concerned about any particular situation in which Regulation 14 gardaí were allegedly engaged on ordinary Garda duties and they provide me with specific examples, I shall gladly have them investigated.</P>
    <P>With regard to training, I should explain that a course in subjects relevant to their duties is provided for persons recruited under Regulation 14.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Commissioner is satisfied that this level of training is sufficient to equip them to carry out their duties.  Training needs are constantly evaluated and in-house course are provided, if considered necessary.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that Regulation 14 gardaí will only have their names entered on warrants where the subject matter of the search relates to their area of expertise.  In July 1996, two two-day courses were conducted during which nine Regulation 14 gardaí were given instruction on court procedure.  Such members only give evidence on matters pertaining to their area of expertise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the public order situation detailed in Deputy Fox's question, the Garda authorities point out that members of the Garda band, which has both Regulation 14 and other personnel attached to it, were on duty in their capacity as bandsmen at this event and did assist their colleagues on that occasion.  The Garda authorities have informed me that they view this as a once off occurrence.</P>

      <P>The Government policy agreement contains a commitment that the Government will examine the possibility of legislating to enable journalists to protect the confidentiality of their sources in certain circumstances.  The matter is being <Col N="1336" /> examined in my Department at present in the context of a Law Reform Commission Report on Contempt of Court which, among many other issues, addresses the question of journalistic privilege.  In addition, a recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights related to this subject is being examined as part of this review.</P>
      <P>The matter is clearly a complex one and I am not in a position to indicate at this stage when the review which I have mentioned will be completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was convicted of common assault and sentenced to two months imprisonment at Clonmel District Court on 26 November 1996.  He was, on the same day, committed to Limerick Prison.  On the following day he was granted a period of temporary release.  It is longstanding practice not to comment on individual prisoner's cases or on the reasons for particular decisions.  I wish to say however, that the decision to grant this offender temporary release was made having regard to a range of considerations which are applied in all such cases.  These include the nature of the offence and the potential risk to the public.  While pressure on accommodation is a factor in many temporary releases I wish to emphasise that there are often compelling reasons for the release of particular offenders even at which might appear to be a relatively early stage of a sentence.</P>

    <P>In relation to travel to and from the all party talks in Belfast, the travelling party usually includes in addition to the officials mentioned above, officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and quite often includes the Tánaiste, the Attorney General and perhaps another Minister.</P>
    <P>* The costs shown for each visit are based on the travel and subsistence costs which have been brought to account in the Department of Justice to date.  It can be some time before invoices or other bills are received and brought to account. The figures shown will, therefore, fall to be adjusted when accounts have been completed. Where a nil cost is shown for travel, the Government jet was used.</P>

      <P>I have received a letter from the board of management of the local primary school expressing concern about this matter.  The position is that the Garda authorities have been approached by Esat Digifone with a proposal to share their radio masts in the context of Esat's planned mobile telephone network.  The Garda consider that the arrangement proposed by Esat is technically feasible and would offer significant benefits to them.</P>
      <P>The Departments of Finance, Environment, and Transport, Energy and Communications, and the Office of Public Works were consulted and had no objection in principle to Esat sharing Garda radio masts.  Approval in principle was, therefore, given to the Garda Commissioner to enter discussions with Esat on the basis that a definitive decision to enter such an arrangement would be taken only if it could be established that it would represent value to the State, would not impair Garda communications or security and would meet legal and other requirements.  As yet, no final agreement has been reached or contract made.  A condition of any agreement that may be reached with Esat would be that its use of any Garda site would be subject to all relevant planning requirements or exemptions as the case may be.  The various other requirements concerning health and safety as set out in the guidelines circulated to planning authorities by the Department of the Environment in July this year must also be satisfied before a final decision can be reached.</P>
      <P>The Garda mast at Sligo has been identified by Esat as being of interest to it.  The Garda authorities have allowed Esat to add some antennae to the existing mast at Sligo in anticipation of a satisfactory agreement being concluded.  However, unless and until an agreement is concluded, Esat transmission from the site will not be permitted.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the matter referred to in the Deputy's question and I would like to place on the record that there was no such break-in at Wheatfield place of detention.</P>
      <P>On the morning of 12 November 1996, the gate leading to the vacant site adjoining the existing prison was discovered to be open.  Cutting equipment was not used to cut a hole in the gate and internal gates between the site and the prison next to it were not tampered with.  This unguarded site is the location for the proposed new remand centre.  The site and the actual prison itself were thoroughly searched on 12 November 1996 and nothing was found.  There is nothing at all to suggest that the perimeter of the prison itself &mdash; as distinct from the vacant adjoining site &mdash; was breached and security was not compromised in any way.</P>
      <P>There were gale force winds on the night of 11-12 November 1996 and it is possible that the gate to the vacant site was pushed in by the wind and not by an intruder.  The gate has since been secured.  The vacant site and its gate will clearly be greatly altered when the new remand prison is built and in the meantime the gate will be kept secure.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 170 and 172 together.  I can inform the Deputy that my Department has agreed to accept the site referred to by the Deputy in exchange for the old courthouse site in Fair Street, Drogheda.  The Office of Public Works has now been requested to liaise with Drogheda Corporation on the matter of the site boundaries and to act as the Department's agent for the building project.  At this stage, it is too early to give precise details of the timescale for design and construction other than to say that I am committed to ensuring that proper court facilities are made available in Drogheda, and that funding will be made available for the project.  It is proposed that the new court accommodation to be provided will be capable of accommodating sittings of both the District and Circuit Courts.  Accommodation for the District Court office and ancillary court facilities are also to be provided.  In the meantime Drogheda Corporation has provided alternative accommodation for the District Court office.</P>
      <P>With regard to the return of the Circuit Court to Drogheda, the Deputy will appreciate that under the terms of section 10 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1947, the fixing of venues within a Circuit Court circuit is a matter for the President of the Circuit Court in consultation with the Circuit Court judge permanently assigned to that circuit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the European Commission adopted a package of proposals for directives for the elimination of controls on persons at the internal frontiers of the European Union.  The proposals were made, and are being considered, within the context of the completion of the internal market and not within the framework of the Third Pillar of Justice and Home Affairs.  The Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community, has also consulted the European Parliament on the proposals.  I am aware that the views of the Parliament were made available recently to the Commission and it is a matter now for the Commission, having considered these and any other relevant views, to indicate how it wishes the proposals to be developed further.  It has been made clear at all times during the course of the Irish Presidency of the European Union that the Presidency is ready to facilitate the consideration of any proposed developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of member states, including Ireland, support the objective of adopting measures with the aim of establishing an internal market in which the free movement of persons as well as goods, capital and services is ensured as envisaged in Article 8a of the Treaty.  Britain, however, interprets Article 8a to mean that, while controls on EU nationals must be abolished, <Col N="1346" /> member states continue to be free to subject third country nationals to controls at the internal frontiers.</P>
    <P>However, whatever the differences in interpretation, the need to protect the citizens of the Union against the possibility of the proposed greater freedom being exploited by criminals is recognised by all member states.  Discussions have been taking place with a view to ensuring that appropriate compensatory measures are put in place in the areas of organised crime, drug trafficking, terrorism and illegal immigration. Indeed, the proposals from the Commission recognise the fact that the elimination of controls on persons require essential accompanying compensatory measures.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will clarify the fairness of requesting an overpayment from old age pensioners (details supplied) in County Limerick in view of the fact that both pensioners never received any material gain out of having the shares and did not consider that the fact of having shares would impact on their pensions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23818/96]</QRef>

      <P>The couple concerned are both in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension which is a means-tested payment.  When assessing a person's means in accordance with the legislation the Department must take account of any savings, investments, shares, property or income which the person may have.  Old age non-contributory pension application forms include a request to notify the Department of all incomes.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, the Department discovered that the husband had a shareholding in a company which neither spouse had disclosed, as required under social welfare legislation, when their pension entitlements were originally investigated in 1991 and 1992 respectively.  This shareholding would have caused a relatively small reduction on their weekly rates of pension.</P>
      <P>In the light of this new fact, the couple's pension entitlements were reviewed.  The deciding officer wrote to the persons concerned on 19 November 1996 outlining the discovery of the shareholding and affording them the opportunity to furnish, within 21 days, any statement or evidence that they wished to make available for consideration.  None has yet been received.  A decision on their pension rates will be made shortly, taking full account of any response they wish to make, and of details supplied by the Deputy in this question.</P>
      <P>Should the deciding officer decide to revise their pensions retrospectively, an overpayment would then arise.  In that event, the couple concerned will then be notified of the amount due for repayment.  They will be afforded the opportunity at that stage to provide any further relevant information in accordance with the overpayments code of practice before a determination is made on the recovery of any pension amounts overpaid.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 19 on Wednesday, 27 November 1996.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in relation to the services for which I have responsibility are: the establishment of a non-means-tested payment to compensate for loss of income due to an incapacity for fulltime work, or work to full potential to be known as a disability pension.  This payment would replace the existing disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension and would be extended to cover people with disabilities who are living in part-time residential settings; the transfer of administration of the domiciliary care allowance and motorised transport grants schemes from the health boards to the Department of Social Welfare; changes in the financial supports available to carers, including an extension of the carer's allowance on a means-tested basis to all carers; the achievement of the payment rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare as a matter of priority; and specific regard should be given by the Government within any anti-poverty strategy to combating the disproportionate impact of poverty on people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also recommends the renaming of the disability benefit scheme to sickness benefit; the retention of secondary benefits by people with disabilities participating in Government sponsored training programmes; the introduction of a standard unrestricted disabled person's public transport travel pass, which would automatically cover a companion; and the <Col N="1351" /> extension of the free telephone rental allowance scheme to cover free mobile telephone rental and a number of call units free of charge for drivers with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is paying class S1 contributions as a self-employed person since 1988; these are reckonable for old age, contributory, and widow's/widower's contributory pensions but not for retirement pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for a retirement pension last August but his claim was rejected because he had no reckonable contributions.  He was informed of this decision.</P>
      <P>Since he commenced paying contributions after his 56th birthday he will not qualify for an old age pension by virtue of these contributions alone.  However, as he paid social insurance contributions in the United Kingdom prior to his 56th birthday he may qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> Irish old age contributory pension under EU regulations, based on his Irish and United Kingdom social insurance records.  He should apply to the Department about three months before he reaches pension age of 66 years in 1997 and his entitlement will be examined.</P>

      <P>I am favourably disposed, in principle, to proposals put forward by unions representing taxi and hackney drivers, that applications for public service vehicle licences and renewals should be accompanied by a social welfare clearance certificate.</P>
      <P>Such a system has the potential, both for self-policing the industry and as a deterrent to those who might otherwise be tempted to abuse the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>I understand that the proposal would require legislative changes for which my colleague the Minister for the Environment would be responsible.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in County Sligo made a claim for disability benefit on 7 November 1996; when a decision will be made on the claim; when a cheque will issue to her; the normal period for processing such a claim; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 7 November 1996.  Her claim was allowed on 2 December and a cheque for £202.10 was issued on 4 December.  This represented disability benefit due from 7 November to 28 November, less supplementary welfare allowance advanced.  A further cheque for £71.70 comprising payment of a personal rate of £64.50 and half rate for one child dependant, representing benefit due to 5 December, was issued on 9 December 1996.</P>
      <P>Disability benefit claims are normally processed within six days of receipt and payment is normally issued when the next medical certificate is received.  The delay in processing this claim was due to the need to establish that the claim was not a continuation of a previous claim made by the person concerned.  An appeal was pending on the previous claim which had been disallowed following a decision that the person was capable of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate in this House on the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, I made known that I was taking the opportunity of the introduction of the new one parent family payment and the new disability allowance to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all of the various social assistance payments, including old age non-contributory pension on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>Under the new provisions, the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent. The extension of these provisions to the other social assistance payments will be done progressively over a period of time in view of the significant administrative implications involved. The means of all social assistance recipients with capital will have to be reviewed on the introduction of any changes in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Under the new system of means assessment, a single old age non-contributory pensioner would qualify for the maximum rate of payment where they have capital of up to £6,160.  The equivalent amount of capital for a couple would be £12,320. An old age non-contributory pensioner would still qualify for a pension where he or she has capital of up to £35,500 in the case of a single person, or £71,100 in the case of a couple.</P>
    <P>This new system of means assessment would cost £4.3 million to implement for old age non-contributory pensioners and is more favourable than the proposal mentioned by the Deputy in the question.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, £369 million is being made available from the European Union as grantaid for tourism related projects.  Grants under the product development and marketing sub-programmes of the operational programme are approved by independent management boards established under the programme.  Details of grants for individual projects are contained in the annual reports of the management boards, the latest of which covers the period to the end of December 1995 and copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.  Grants under the natural-cultural tourism sub-programme are administered by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and under the training sub-programme by the Department of Education and CERT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG II Programme, EU funds of £10 million have been allocated to tourism development under the tourism measure over the period 1994 to 1999.  Tourism projects in the South are evaluated by Bord Fáilte and <Col N="1354" /> recommended for final decision at the Tourism and Culture Working Group.</P>
    <P>Under the Ireland-Wales (Maritime) INTERREG II Programme, EU funds of £3.8 million have been made available to tourism development under the tourism and cultural cooperation measure over the period 1994-99.  The Economic Development Working Group approves tourism projects for funding under the programme.</P>
    <P>Other EU-funded programmes, such as the programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, which is an agri-tourism scheme, and the Leader II Programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry together with the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme also provide assistance for tourism initiatives.  The International Fund for Ireland and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation provide funding for tourism related projects in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>I have already given details of the measures in the EU funded peace programme which provide support for tourism development in a written reply to Deputy Brendan Smith on Wednesday, 16 October 1996, Official Report, volume 470, columns 413-4.</P>

      <P>I have undertaken 19 foreign and internal flights up to 29 November in 1996.  The passenger list for each trip is set out in the statement below.  Those listed are officials of my Department except where otherwise indicated. The cost of the trips to my Department on the basis of claims submitted to date is £28,381.38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government jet or Beech aircraft was used for a number of the trips and in these cases, the costs of the flights were not borne by my <Col N="1357" /> Department and are therefore not taken into account in the following list.  In addition, the <Col N="1358" /> statement indicates where some costs were borne by the IDA in respect of its promotion trips.</P>

The inclusion of an effective system of remedies and penalties sufficient to provide a strong disincentive to any person contemplating an infringement of copyright protection will be given <Col N="1361" /> appropriate consideration in the context of the draft legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the report in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 1 December, 1996 regarding the sale of Tipperary Crystal.  A receiver was appointed on 10 October, 1996, over the assets of the Tipperary Crystal companies, namely, Crystal Designs of Tipperary Limited; Tipperary China, Crystal, Porcelain, Silver and Gold Company Limited and Tipperary Crystal Manufacturing Company (Sales) Limited.  The receiver was appointed by Yeoman International, a debenture holder.  The receiver is still in place.</P>
      <P>I am informed that shortly after his appointment the receiver sought to sell the business.  Minority shareholders made an application to the High Court for an injunction to prevent the sale to the purchaser, Asdon Limited. Their application was denied on 21 October, 1996.</P>
      <P>About a year prior to the appointment of the receiver, the minority shareholders instituted proceedings against the company under section 205 of the Companies Act, 1963 &mdash; remedy for oppression of minority shareholders.  After the receiver was appointed they applied to the High Court to join the receiver, the debenture holder and the purchaser in the section 205 proceedings. Their application was refused on 18 November 1996.  In addition, on that date an application to set aside the sale was denied by the High Court, although it was held that the matter could be dealt with in the context of the full hearing of the section 205 application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to appoint an inspector under the Companies Acts to examine the manner of the sale of the business by the receiver at this time.  The issue was examined by the High Court <Col N="1362" /> on two occasions and still forms part of the section 205 action referred to above.</P>
    <P>I understand from Forbairt that, prior to the appointment of the receiver, the company was experiencing cash flow difficulties and was endeavouring to put together a financial restructuring package.  I understand that the threat to employment has been averted by the sale of the business.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199, 204 and 205 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of the negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that <Col N="1365" /> the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage &mdash; 62 per cent &mdash; of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with many recommendations.  Following consultation with the farm bodies on the consultants' report, I have made a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes in 1997 and following years.  These would involve some limits on the overall level of payment, adjustments to a small number of grant rates and a better targeting of payments in order to meet the overall aim of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Discussions on these proposals with the <Col N="1366" /> Commission are ongoing and it would not be appropriate to publish details of the proposals until discussions with the Commission are finalised.</P>

      <P>Out of over 132,000 applicants for area aid in 1996 there are less than 300 cases where my Department has no record of having received a 1996 area aid application.  The herdowners in question were requested, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the area aid scheme, to provide a certificate of postage as evidence that an application form was submitted.  So far 234 herdowners have submitted valid certificates of postage and replacement applications have been accepted.  Replies are awaited from the remaining 66 applicants.</P>

      <P>A sum of £81,000 was paid in compensation to a herdowner for the depopulation of his herd following the occurrence of a case of BSE where evidence existed of the administration of feed containing meat and bonemeal.  The sum paid reflected a deduction of £9,000 on the market value of the herd made pursuant to the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment) Order, 1992 due to the failure of the herdowner to take reasonable precautions to protect against the disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Galtee mountains area a small number of sheep and cattle headage applicants have not been paid because of problems with area aid applications.  In one case the local office is awaiting an RSI number.  Every effort is being made to have the outstanding problems resolved <Col N="1373" /> with a view to making payments at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>As part of the integrated administration and control system, an EU requirement governing all CAP compensatory payments, Ireland was committed to developing a new area aid related land parcel identification system &mdash; LPIS &mdash; in 1996.  In order to clear area aid applications, which in turn allow payments under the various arable and livestock applications, a cross-check has to be carried out against the land parcel identification system.</P>
      <P>Given the increased levels of checks and controls associated with the new system it was inevitable that some delay in making payments, when measured against the 1995 performance, would arise.  The simple fact is, however, that Ireland must comply fully with the additional controls associated with the introduction of a computerised land parcel identification system.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is already aware of my support for any initiative which would lead to the allocation of additional quota to milk producers in the Border counties.  Discussions on this issue had, in fact, taken place between officials of my Department, the United Kingdom's Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland even before the group referred to was established.  I had also raised the matter directly with the UK Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated, the success of any initiative in this area will depend on the circumstances and timing of its being raised at EU level.  The position taken by the United Kingdom authorities is, of course, a critical factor in any approach to the EU.</P>

      <P>There are no legislative proposals relating to public transport accessibility under discussion at the Transport Council of the European Union at present. However, a Green Paper on the citizen's network was published by the European Commission earlier this year.  The Green Paper addresses a wide range of issues relating to public transport systems, including the question of improving the accessibility of these systems for people with mobility impairments of one form or another.  In this regard, the Green Paper notes that it is the long-term aim of the Commission to ensure that public transport is accessible for all, and this is an objective which I fully support.</P>
      <P>Having completed the public consultation process launched by the publication of the Green Paper, the Commission will no doubt bring forward specific proposals over the next few years in relation to issues raised in the document, including that of accessibility improvements.  My Department will participate fully in the consideration of any proposals of this kind which the Commission may present to the Transport Council and will assess individual measures on their merits, in the light of their potential impact on our public transport sector generally.</P>

      <P>The functions of the Telecommunications Service Users Council were taken over by the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act (First Schedule) (Amendment) Order, 1984.  Sections 48 and 49 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, which gave statutory effect to the users council, were repealed by section 3 and the Second Schedule of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  A different group, the Telephone Users Advisory Group, was established in September 1993 on a non-statutory basis to carry out <Col N="1375" /> independent monitoring of the impact of the Telecom Éireann price rebalancing package which was introduced on 1 September 1993 and to assess future trends in tariffs.  In response to a request from the chairman of the group to broaden that group's terms of reference, the latter were revised in October last year to a more general monitoring and reporting role in relation to telecommunications tariffs and quality of service.  The group's current terms of reference and its membership are appended.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the group was limited in size to ensure effective working and it comprises representatives of industry and consumer groups. Given its terms of reference, details of which follow, I am satisfied that the Telephone Users Advisory Group as currently constituted can address any issues brought to its notice related to the quality of service to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Terms of Reference for the Telephone Users Advisory Group</P>
      <P>The Group should:</P>
      <P>1.  Carry out independent monitoring of the operation and impact on different groups and classes of consumers of telecommunications tariffs and report to the Minister thereon.</P>
      <P>2.  Assess the quality of service in the telecommunications sector for different groups and classes of consumers taking into account current and prospective technological developments and the quality of service available to users within the EU and elsewhere and report to the Minister thereon.</P>
      <P>In discharging these functions the Group should: monitor developments in other tariff systems both in the EU and elsewhere and assess their relevance to the Irish situation; take account of market and technical developments in Ireland and elsewhere; ensure that recommendations made to the Minister on changes in tariffs should take account of the need to achieve an overall balance which will enable Telecom Éireann to maintain financial viability.</P>
      <P>The Group may also; examine the general pattern and nature of any complaints made by customers concerning the operation of Telecom Éireann's tariffs; suggest how Telecom Éireann might deal with complaints of a general nature which customers may have; advise the Minister on any area where the Group believes general customer service by Telecom Éireann couldbe improved, including communication of information to customers.</P>

      <P>The estimated cost to the Exchequer of ministerial air transport service during the period in question is £2.7 million.  This figure is based on the cost to date in 1996 of the air taxi service together with the direct cost of using the Gulfstream IV and Beech aircraft of the Air Corps aircraft for ministerial transport.  These direct costs include <Col N="1378" /> the cost of maintenance, fuel and support services arising from the use of the aircraft in question.</P>
      <P>The estimated direct cost of operating the Gulfstream IV and Beech aircraft for the first six months of 1996 is £530,000.  It is not possible to estimate the cost of ministerial air transport for the first six months of 1997 as this will be directly related to the number of flying hours involved. However, it is expected that it should be in line with the cost in 1996.</P>

      <P>Valentia <Col N="1380" /> Coast Radio Station, together with the other manned coast radio stations at Dublin and Malin Head, forms part of the coast radio station &mdash; CRS &mdash; service under the aegis of the Irish Marine Emergency Service &mdash; IMES &mdash; of the Department of the Marine.  IMES maintains a continuous 24 hour VHF watch for distress calls and provides a communications network for the alerting, notification and reporting of marine emergencies.  It also controls 12 remotely controlled VHF radio stations at various locations along the coast and has at any one time seven people keeping watch.</P>
      <P>There has been significant upgrading of search and rescue facilities and the marine emergency communications network, including coastal radio stations, under the direction of IMES since it was established in 1991.</P>
      <P>Radio equipment at Valentia includes four medium frequency radio telephone transmitters, a digital select calling system &mdash; DCS &mdash; which is used in distress incidents to alert shipping in the area and two medium frequency wireless telegraphy transmitters used to transmit and receive morse coded messages.  In recent months a NAVTEX system has been installed at Valentia which is capable of being remotely operated from Dublin Coast Radio Station and is used for transmitting distress signals, urgent messages, weather forecasts, gale warnings and navigational warnings.</P>
      <P>A new control desk and electronic equipment are currently being installed at Valentia to facilitate the operation of a new medium frequency transmitting station required for the handling of an increased volume of fisheries communications traffic.  The extension of Valentia VHF cover by the provision of new stations to improve radio communications in Galway Bay and on the south coast is also planned.  Plans are also in train to fit high frequency channels in the existing radio telephone transmitters for use by the IMES search and rescue helicopter when it has to proceed outside of Valentia medium frequency and very high frequency coverage.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that existing coverage of Valentia Coast Radio Station facilitated it in responding to 414 incidents in 1995 thus enabling IMES to assist and-or save 1,288 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236, 237 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, the Minister for the Marine is empowered to grant or refuse to grant permits for the disposal of (a) dredged material; (b) inert material of natural origin, that is, solid, chemically unprocessed geological material, the chemical constituents of which are unlikely to be released into the marine environment; (c) sewage sludge until 31 December 1998; (d) fish waste from industrial fish processing operations; and, (e) vessels or aircraft until, at the latest, 31 December 2004.</P>
      <P>So far during 1996 I have authorised the disposal at sea of a total of 3,371,500 tonnes of dredge spoil, 131,000 tonnes of sand, 40,000 tonnes of granite rock, 2,500 tonnes of fish shells and offal and 340,000 tonnes of sewage sludge at various sites around the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications to dump at sea are rigorously assessed by the Department's Marine Licence Vetting Committee &mdash; MLVC.  The committee, a multi-disciplinary one, is comprised of officials from the Department of the Marine, the Fisheries Research Centre of the Marine Institute and the <Col N="1382" /> Central Fisheries Board with expertise in fisheries, biology, chemistry, oceanography, navigation and engineering disciplines.  Briefly, the assessment criteria used include: the characteristics and composition of the substance or material to be dumped; the characteristics of the dumping site and the proposed method of disposal; the extent to which the dumping might interfere with fish and shellfish cultures, shipping, recreation or navigation; the availability of suitable land-based alternatives; proper certification of the disposal vessel and crew and the possibility of an impact on the marine environment.  Consultation takes place with local fishing organisations and other users of the area. Any concerns raised by fishery or other environmental interests about dumping at sea applications are considered carefully by the MLVC before a decision is made to allow dumping at sea to go ahead.</P>
    <P>In addition to the MLVC assessment procedure, I am empowered to request applicants to undertake analyses or surveys of the material to be dumped and of the dump site at their own expense.  If the proposed site is found unsuitable for any reason alternative sites are investigated; if the waste is found unsuitable for sea disposal a permit is refused.</P>
    <P>The dumping of sewage sludge at sea will be prohibited internationally under the Convention for the Protection of the North-East Atlantic &mdash; OSPAR &mdash; after 31 December, 1998.  This prohibition has been given statutory effect by way of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996.  Dublin Corporation is Ireland's only authorised sewage sludge dumper.  Its plan for alternative disposal methods has been approved by the Department of the Environment and work on the implementation of the plan to switch to land-based disposal after 31 December, 1998 is on target.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation currently holds a permit for the disposal of up to a maximum of 340,000 tonnes of sewage sludge at sea during 1996 with a maximum of 2,000 tonnes to be dumped per day.  Three trips are normally made to the site per week with approximately 2,000 tonnes being disposed of on each trip.  The dump site is located some 14 miles south-east of the Kish lighthouse well away from Dublin Bay.  The corporation has recently applied for renewal of the permit for 1997 and has requested an increase in the amount to be dumped to 370,000 tonnes.  The Department's Marine Licence Vetting Committee is currently considering this application.</P>
    <P>It came to light recently that six companies were transporting industrial liquid wastes by tankers for treatment at Ringsend.  This waste was being combined with sewage sludge and disposed of at sea.  Following intensive examination by the Department's Marine Licence Vetting <Col N="1383" /> Committee it was decided to allow the continuation of this practice on the basis that the waste from the tankers, once it enters the plant, is treated and becomes sludge.  I am satisfied that the sludge is non-hazardous, non-toxic and contains no heavy metals.  It is biologically treated to a primary standard and does not pose any threat to the marine environment.  The waste is monitored on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>In March 1991, following extensive scientific studies, the site used by Dublin Corporation for the disposal of sewage sludge was relocated from its previous location two miles off Howth Head to a new site south-east of the Kish lighthouse about ten to 14 miles offshore.  Some localised environmental impact had been identified in the vicinity of the old site.  Monitoring of the status of the new sewage sludge dump site and the recovery status of the old dump site close to Howth Head was carried out in 1993.  At the new dump site the monitoring revealed that there was no significant impact on the sediment fauna in the area, reflecting the dispersive nature of the dump <Col N="1384" /> site, while at the old dump site the monitoring revealed an increase in the number of benthic faunal species in the area, suggesting good recovery.  Arrangements are currently in train to have both sites resurveyed.  The parameters for the survey have been established by scientists from the Marine Institute and tenders for the work will be invited shortly.  Under present disposal conditions environmental problems are not anticipated.</P>
