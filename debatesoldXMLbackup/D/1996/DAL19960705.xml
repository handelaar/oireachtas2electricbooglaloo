      <P>It is proposed to take No. 6 &mdash; Motion re Dáil sittings; No. 2 &mdash; Transport (Dublin Light Rail) (No. 2) Bill, 1996, Amendments from the Seanad; No. 7 &mdash; Estimates for the Public Services, 1996, Votes 1 to 4, inclusive, 6 to 45, inclusive, and Supplementary Estimates, Votes 3, 18 and 32; No. 14 &mdash; Statements on Shaping our Future: A Strategy for Enterprise in Ireland in the 21st Century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 6 and the amendments thereto shall be decided without debate by one question; (2) the amendments from the Seanad to No. 2 shall be taken together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair; (3) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate on No. 7; (i) the Estimates shall be moved and debated together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair not later than 2.30 p.m. and if a division is demanded on such question it shall be taken forthwith; (ii) a general debate may arise thereon; (iii) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 <Col N="762" /> minutes in each case; (iv) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (v) Members may share time; and (vi) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 2.15 p.m. to make a speech in reply; (4) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 14: (i) the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four matters to put to the House.  Are the arrangements for dealing with No. 6 satisfactory and agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose the arrangements for dealing with No. 6.  In recent months the party leaders and the Whips have been trying to reach agreement on Dáil reform.  We have managed to complete an excellent document but there are two matters on which unfortunately, the Taoiseach will not give way, tabling questions during the recess and how matters of concern should be dealt with on the Order of Business.  I oppose the Order of Business on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's arguments are contrary to what he said in Opposition and at the start of the life of the Government. Section 26 of the Fine Gael document on better laws and Dáil reform states: &ldquo;Fine Gael also proposes that Members have the right to put down Parliamentary Questions during the Dáil recess&rdquo;.  A longer period is outlined and I would have no objection to that. There are more than 20 committees of the House, all of which will meet during the next three weeks and again in September. I ask the Taoiseach to allow parliamentary questions to be tabled at least once a week, not every day.  I <Col N="763" /> would have no objection to a longer period being specified than that set down in Standing Orders.  That would help the committees in processing legislation and making the Dáil more relevant.</P>
    <P>On matters of concern, the document brought forward by the Fine Gael Whip at the start of the life of this Government states: &ldquo;One of the aims of Oireachtas reform is to make the Dáil more efficient and businesslike in order to avoid the daily wrangles on the Order of Business&rdquo;.  The procedure to be used was set down.</P>
    <P>This would be of help to the Ceann Comhairle, Opposition, Government and the House.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach is not interested in doing this and, on that basis, I oppose item No. 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already raised this matter with the Taoiseach and agree with the points made by Deputy Ahern.  As this is the last time the House will meet before 25 July, I appeal to the Taoiseach to live up to the lofty words spoken by him on the day he was elected to office, about the supremacy of the Dáil and the importance of parliamentary questions.  In the run up to his election to office he stated on many occasions in the House that the Ceann Comhairle would have to be given extra powers, if necessary, to ensure that parliamentary questions were answered. Parliamentary questions cannot be answered if we are not entitled to put them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception that from today on Deputies will be on holidays.  That is not the reality as most Deputies will probably take no more than two weeks annual leave.  If this House is to be made more relevant, we are to be seen to do our job and we are to restore confidence in our institutions and, in particular, the political process we should be given an opportunity to put down parliamentary questions during the recess.  Deputy Ahern's suggestion that more than three days would be given for replies is <Col N="764" /> reasonable and a good compromise, and I ask the Taoiseach to agree to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this matter carefully.  During the recess Deputies have available to them the excellent research service supplied by the Oireachtas Library to assist them in their work in committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the case when the Fine Gael manifesto was produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no bar to Deputies who have queries about particular matters addressing them to the relevant Department.  I have no doubt officials will be willing to provide that information to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>What a somersault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in introducing a system of parliamentary questions during the recess &mdash; such a system has not existed at any stage since the foundation of the House &mdash; is primarily one relating to the diversion of administrative time away from other work.  Parliamentary questions are not simple responses to queries.  They must be vetted at the highest level by the Minister and Secretary of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative cost involved in the extra vetting of parliamentary replies is very substantial.  In the past, the cost of dealing with individual parliamentary questions was put at several hundred pounds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was in Opposition I found that a phone call to the <Col N="765" /> relevant Department or the use of the research service in the Oireachtas Library was much more effective in assembling information than tabling parliamentary questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which, if Deputy Ahern's suggestion was agreed, would not be replied to for one or two weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tabling parliamentary questions is not the most effective way of assembling information for Deputies who are anxious to get information for a committee meeting which might take place in two or three days.</P>

      <P>This move to have parliamentary questions during the Dáil recess, which neither of the parties now <Col N="766" /> looking for this system ever proposed or did anything about when they were in Government is not being put forward out of a sincere desire to obtain information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

It is surprising that some members of the Deputy's party are taking offence at the fact that defects in the legislation are being pointed out.  It is the obligation of the Government to ensure that all legislation passed is workable.  As part of <Col N="775" /> that process we pointed out defects in this Bill and will seek to remedy them. We will not give a blank cheque to any item of legislation without considering relevant amendments.

This problem has a number of manifestations, first in the form of tenancies held by people who are causing public anxiety and problems because of their drug-related activities. The design of estates is also a problem in that people can congregate too easily for the distribution of drugs.</P>
      <P>A number of actions in the housing area can be taken to deal with this problem. In addition, tenants in these estates can be facilitated in coming together to deal with the problems with the aid of statutory bodies.  The Minister for the Environment will report to the Government on the matter next week and on receipt of his report we will consider what further legislative, administrative or regulatory action is necessary.  This is a very important aspect in the battle against drugs and I will take a personal interest in it, as the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, are currently doing.</P>

The position is that the Government is preparing legislation to amend the law concerning fund raising for charities.  This is, <i>inter alia</i>, to implement the recommendations of the Costello committee.  In addition, an advisory group, which includes representatives from various fund raising organisations, is advising the Government on legislative proposals and its report is expected some time in the <Col N="782" /> middle of this month.

    <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity in the absence of my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, to debate the 1996 Estimates and to review progress on the economic and budgetary fronts.  It is particularly pleasing to be in a position to participate in such a debate at a time of unprecedented economic growth and where the Government's policies are yielding very positive benefits for industry and for society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I will outline some key aspects of our economic performance in recent years and the significant factors which contributed to that performance.  The Irish economy in recent years has experienced exceptionally strong and well balanced growth, which has been reflected in significantly higher employment. Inflation has remained moderate and budgetary discipline has been maintained. Over the past decade, the rate of growth in our gross domestic product has been twice as fast as the EU average. More recently, employment growth has also been faster than the EU average.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of the remarkable success of the Government's economic policies was provided by the publication earlier this week of the 1995 national accounts data.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> These confirm that Ireland continues to have one of the best economic performances in the industrialised world.  They show that Ireland is continuing to combine strong output and employment growth, low inflation, moderate Government borrowing and a satisfactory balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>The latest CSO figures show that gross domestic product grew by an unprecedented 10 per cent last year. Even if one excludes the distorting effects of profit repatriations by multinational companies, our gross national product grew by a highly impressive 7.3 per cent.  The volume of consumer spending rose by 3.7 per cent and the volume of fixed investment grew by more than 10 per cent.  The strength of investment last year was a particularly encouraging feature since it lays the foundation for further strong growth in the future.  Inflation averaged 2.5 per cent last year and Government borrowing remained comfortably within the Maastricht criteria for the seventh year in succession.</P>
    <P>Most important of all perhaps, the strong economic performance is succeeding in creating new jobs.  Employment in 1994 and 1995 combined grew by more than 88,000, 7.7 per cent. Manufacturing employment grew by 6.1 per cent on average last year, while the corresponding increase in employment in the building and construction sector was 4.5 per cent.  These figures refute any criticism that we are experiencing jobless growth.  They clearly show that strong output growth is being translated into very impressive rates of employment growth.  The labour force survey shows a fall in unemployment of 40,000 for the two years 1994 and 1995 combined.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that a strong economic performance is being maintained this year, and this is all the more remarkable against the background of a significant slowing down in the average growth rate for the European Union as a whole.  Consumer confidence is high and retail sales remain very buoyant. <Col N="804" /> The volume of retail sales in the first quarter of the year was up by 6.75 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1995.  The strong showing of retail sales in the first quarter owes much to the vibrant performance of the motor industry. However, even when car sales are excluded, retail sales grew by 4.75 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>It is very gratifying that, despite this strong growth, inflation has remained moderate.  The latest inflation rate &mdash; 1.4 per cent for the year to May &mdash; is in fact the lowest for almost three years. However inflation is falling in many other EU countries also so we cannot afford to be complacent here.  Inflation in Ireland now ranks eighth lowest out of the 15 EU countries according to the new EU interim index of consumer prices.</P>
    <P>As is usual at this time of the year, the Department of Finance is reviewing its budget day economic forecasts for 1996 in the light of the CSO's latest figures for 1995 and economic and budgetary developments in the first half of the year.  Updated forecasts will be published in <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> towards the end of the month.</P>
    <P>Looking beyond 1996, the exceptionally strong growth performance is expected to moderate over the coming years, but growth in Ireland is likely nevertheless to remain well above that expected in the larger and more developed EU member states.</P>
    <P>The OECD and the EU Commission have recently published optimistic forecasts for Ireland for 1997 with growth rates here continuing to outpace those in our trading partners.  According to these forecasts, inflation here is projected to remain moderate and budgetary discipline will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Ireland's remarkable economic performance in recent years did not occur by accident.  On the contrary, the very positive developments in economic growth, employment, inflation and consumption are very largely attributable to constant adherence by the Government to a framework of consistent budgetary, <Col N="805" /> monetary and other policies aimed at enhancing competitiveness and providing stable exchange rates and low inflation.  It has been possible to pursue such a coherent and successful economic strategy principally because of the commitment and support lent by all the social partners under the current <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and its two predecessors.  The consensus and social partnership achieved under the three national programmes have contributed enormously to the improvement in our economic performance in recent years.</P>
    <P>Confidence in Ireland's economy is running at an all time high.  Our international credibility has been given an enormous boost by the achievements of recent years and this is reflected in strong international participation in the Irish bond market and in the willingness of investors to put their funds into Irish pounds.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to do everything possible to ensure that this confidence and credibility will continue. To this end the Government will continue to pursue the following fundamental elements of our economic strategy which have brought us such success to date: a continued commitment to membership of the European monetary system and the associated monetary policy which has delivered low inflation; sound management of the public finances which has delivered interest rates at historically low levels; these low interest rates have stimulated consumer and business confidence, which, in turn, have boosted domestic demand, which, along with tax initiatives undertaken in recent budgets, and the wage moderation of the national wage agreement had led to the significant employment increases of recent years.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, one of the fundamental planks of our economic strategy has been sound and disciplined management of the public finances.  I wish to outline some of the main developments in this area.  The Government pledged in its programme that it will use the fruits of economic growth for both tax <Col N="806" /> reform and to improve essential public services.  The Government further pledged that tax reform will promote incentives to work; tackle the poverty trap; aim to reduce the tax wedge; and encourage enterprise development and growth.  The initiatives taken in the 1995 and 1996 budgets focused on three objectives &mdash; to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity &mdash; while maintaining adherence to the Maastricht Treaty criteria for the general Government deficit.  In the past two budgets, we have taken significant steps in all these areas.</P>
    <P>The public finances are in excellent shape.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement has been held at about 2.25 per cent of GNP throughout the period 1989-95, and is projected at just 2 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>Last year's general Government deficit outturn was just 2.4 per cent.  This is the measure of borrowing which will be one of the main indicators set out in the Maastricht Treaty used to judge our eligibility to participate in economic and monetary union.  In both 1994 and 1995, Ireland and Luxembourg were the only members of the EU which met the Maastricht criteria and the indications are that our continued adherence to the criteria this year will again be shared by a very limited number of other EU member states.  We are thus very strongly placed to meet the fiscal criteria for participation in European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>The successful consolidation of our public finances secured by successive Governments over the past decade, and the strong economic growth which it supported, has seen the general Government debt-GDP ratio decline from 116 per cent in 1987 to 85.4 per cent at end-1995. The ratio is set to fall again this year, to just over 80 per cent.  Against this background, debt services costs, which pre-empted over 12 per cent of GNP in 1988, now represent less than 9 per cent of GNP.  These declining debt service liabilities released the resources needed to reduce tax burdens and to <Col N="807" /> improve and extend socially desirable expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>In 1996 to date, the Exchequer returns indicate that the public finances are well on course to secure the borrowing target for the year.  Thus Ireland's fiscal outturn is set to again be among the best in Europe, with a general Government deficit firmly under 3 per cent of GDP and underpinning a further significant decline in the debt/GDP ratio.</P>
    <P>Control of public expenditure is a central element in the Government's overall strategy to prudently manage the public finances.  Our policy programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> sets very demanding targets on public expenditure, the first time that a Government policy programme has given such specific targets for controlling public expenditure.  Under the programme, we are committed to limiting the growth in gross current spending to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms in 1996 and 1997.  The Government recognises that control of spending is essential if the necessary additional resources are to be free to allow scope for meaningful tax reform. In this context, I have no difficulty defending this Government's record on controlling public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves.  This Government has succeeded in keeping the growth in public spending to its lowest level since 1989.  In the period 1991-1994, the average real increase in day-to-day Government spending was 6 per cent.  Since taking office, this Government has succeeded in not only containing but actually reversing this excessive growth trend.  In 1995 the real increase in public expenditure was just over 3 per cent and in the 1996 budget we have provided for an increase of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Gross non-capital supply services spending as a share of national income is planned to be lower this year than in any year since 1990.  These facts show that we have succeeded in keeping public expenditure under firm control, something which previous Governments <Col N="808" /> since 1990 did not do.  This Government is fully committed to maintaining its prudent stance on public spending.</P>
    <P>The process of expenditure adjustment spanned the whole range of Government spending programmes and required difficult decisions about priorities. However, I assure the House that the process was managed in a balanced and socially conscious way which supported the development and expansion of a whole range of public services.  The Government will continue to provide sufficient resources to respond adequately to priority social and other concerns, both for their own sake and as a necessary factor in maintaining the social consensus which has contributed to our recent strong economic performance.</P>
    <P>We are fully aware of the challenge we are facing.  The future development of Government spending programmes will have to be looked at in this framework. In future, it is very unlikely that any Government would be in a position to allow public expenditure to grow for a number of years at rates significantly above those implied in this Government's programme.  The use of our scarce public resources will have to be planned more efficiently.</P>
    <P>A major step forward in improving resource allocation has been taken in the context of the Strategic Management Initiative and the public service reform programme.  One of the central objectives of those initiatives is to ensure that the management of all Government spending programmes is clearly focused on the achievement of specified results and value for money.</P>
    <P>As part of a continuous process of monitoring and control of public expenditure, particularly in the context of the implementation of the strategic management initiative &mdash; SMI &mdash; much greater emphasis will be placed on undertaking systematic evaluation of the main spending programmes.  Implementation of the SMI across the public service will give a clear focus on the need to ensure that scarce public resources are used in the most efficient <Col N="809" /> manner possible.  In time, the SMI should make a significant contribution to the development of an efficient and modern public service capable of delivering the highest quality services at significantly reduced costs.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of this Government's committed and innovative approach to overall public expenditure and budgetary management, if such evidence is required, can be found in the planned move to a new system of multi-annual budgeting which was announced in this year's budget.  The phased introduction of a multi-annual budgetary framework with effect from budget 1997 will make an important contribution to the overall effort to maintain firm control on the growth in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The multi-annual approach, involving three-year benchmark projections for the budgetary aggregates, will facilitate a planned approach to the management of the public finances.  The process will involve the establishment of baseline projections of expenditure for three years ahead which will be agreed by the Government.  These projections will be costed on the technical assumption of a continuation of the existing level of programmes and services.</P>
    <P>While it will still be open to Departments to seek additional resources over and above the baseline projections, the existence of such Government approved projections will provide a valuable benchmark against which such demands may be more rationally assessed and should serve as a restraining influence on expenditure generally.</P>
    <P>Of course, the SMI has other aims. The Government is strongly committed to the introduction of a comprehensive programme of change in the Civil Service. <i>Delivering Better Government,</i> which was launched on 2 May 1996, sets out the framework through which this can be achieved in a consistent and systematic manner.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating group established to oversee its implementation &mdash; the membership of which was recently announced &mdash; comprises representatives <Col N="810" /> from the most senior levels in the public and private sectors, the academic world and the trade union movement.  I have every confidence that the improvements being pursued are both realistic and achievable and that the co-ordinating group, supported by a number of working groups comprising senior management from the civil and public service and private sector experts, will chart a successful route through the many complex issues falling to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The programme of change will lead to: greater public service accountability and improved allocation of authority and responsibility; greater openness and transparency; improved delivery of quality customer services; better use of information technology; better co-ordination between Departments and improved human resource management and financial management systems and procedures &mdash; including the improved public expenditure management framework which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>This is a major undertaking by any reckoning.  While full implementation will take some time to achieve, the programme will ultimately result in a public service which is both efficient and effective and more responsive to the needs of its customers.  This will result in greater value for the money spent on public services and their delivery.</P>
    <P>In the 1996 Estimates provision has been made for the cost of paying the increases arising under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreement this year, both general round and local bargaining increases.  Negotiations on local bargaining claims are currently taking place throughout the public service. While there have been problems in certain local bargaining negotiations, the joint Government-ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 sets out an agreed framework for resolving these problems.</P>
    <P>To achieve our overall economic targets, it is essential that the cost parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement are strictly adhered to.  The prudent management of the national finances, as well <Col N="811" /> as the criteria for economic and monetary union, require that we keep firm control of public expenditure.  Public service pay accounts for over half of net current public spending and the consequences of deviation from the cost parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement would be very serious.  Staff interests must also accept the need for change in return for any increases offered.</P>
    <P>In 1996 we are coming towards the end of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  Decisions will have to be made in the coming months by all the social partners about the future of social partnerships in Ireland and its value in furthering social and economic development.</P>
    <P>Some of the benefits of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> include strong employment growth over the three years of the programme, estimated at almost 10 per cent in total; take-home pay has risen significantly faster than inflation or the general pay increase provided for in the pay agreement because of reductions in personal tax and PRSI &mdash; for example, a person earning the average manufacturing wage will have received an increase of 14.5 per cent, if single, or up to 16.5 per cent, if married with four children, over the three-year period, compared with inflation of 7.3 per cent; social expenditure, on health services, education, social welfare and housing, has met priority needs; and inflation has been kept low, averaging 2.4 per cent per year.</P>
    <P>These are benefits which have reached all sections of the community as a result of the consensus approach under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It is worthy of note that in the period of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> we have managed to improve our economic performance in terms of controlling public expenditure and reducing our national debt as a proportion of GDP while at <Col N="812" /> the same time increasing social expenditure and improving the incomes of the less well off.</P>
    <P>There are compelling reasons for all the social partners to come together to agree a new national programme to follow the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which would enable us to address the challenges which face our society and our economy in the coming years, including the advent of European economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>It will not be easy matter to get agreement on a new programme.  All sides will be subject to constraints, including the strict limits on public expenditure which prudent economic management and the Maastricht criteria impose on the Government.  However, we must not lightly disregard the improvement in our economy in recent years and the major contribution which a decade of social consensus has made to this achievement.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this Government has a sound record of achievement on the economic and budgetary front. However, we face a number of challenges. Balancing the need for taxation reform with the natural demands for increased spending on social priorities will be a very difficult task.  We also face the challenge of agreeing a new national framework to follow the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which will allow our economy and society to progress. I assure the House these are challenges which this Government is determined to meet.  The foundation is there in the record of solid achievement I have spelt out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate provides a good opportunity to review the present Government's performance over the past 18 months before it becomes too immersed in the EU Presidency.  Overall, this Government has signally failed to impress.  No incoming Government was handed better opportunities &mdash; a booming economy, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> substantial EU moneys to spend, and a three-month-old peace process that had <Col N="813" /> strong momentum initially and enormous further potential.  Although in some areas progress has been maintained, in other areas opportunities have been squandered and the necessary action has not been taken or left too late.  The righteous postures adopted by the Government parties when in Opposition have been largely abandoned, along with most of their original policies.</P>
      <P>This rainbow coalition is viewed by the public as an interim or caretaker administration formed in exceptional circumstances in the middle of a Dáil term.  It did not have the same composition as the rainbow coalition put forward by Fine Gael at the last election which would have involved the Progressive Democrats Party, not Democratic Left.  The Labour Party, under electoral pressure, decided to switch horses midstream, even though the public had come to strongly prefer a Fianna Fáil/Labour Government.  Contrary to calculation, the change of Government has done nothing to restore the Labour Party's standing with the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, as a caretaker administration in charge of the nation's business, people have no choice but to wish this Government well for the country's sake.  I have done so on many occasions, most recently in relation to the EU Presidency.  The record will show that I have been more charitable towards the Taoiseach and the Government than virtually any of my predecessors in this role.  I think particularly of some things said by leaders opposite when on these benches about previous Fianna Fáil Taoiseach who served this country well.  I have attacked double standards but have not sought to deny the integrity of office holders.  Democracy is about healthy political competition.  It should not be about petty destructive bickering. The role of an Opposition is not only to hold the Government accountable but to spur it into better performance.  It is also to put forward alternative policies and agendas where appropriate.  Fianna Fáil has made an active and positive contribution in relation to the main <Col N="814" /> issues such as crime, the economy, Europe and the difficulties in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, both in the last Government and on taking up office in this Government, promised to introduce new standards in politics of honesty, integrity, openness, transparency and accountability.  I have no desire to waste time going over a well known, disappointing and ordinary record.  Deputy Bruton, prior to becoming Taoiseach, had something of a reputation as a champion of Dáil reform.  There has been very little progress on reform of the Dáil or of the administration of the State since he took over or, as we saw again this morning, on the Order of Business.  Although we have had a strategic management initiative report, there is no sign of the promised reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, no sign of any relaxation of Cabinet confidentiality, no sign of freedom of information legislation or reform of the Official Secrets Act.  I have pressed for written questions during the recess at least once a week, but this has been turned down.  The Taoiseach's decision is totally incompatible with the commitment in the programme for Government to make the executive fully accountable to the Legislature.  Is it not accountable during the lengthy summer recess?  The Taoiseach is indulging in narrow political advantage and the desire to be as little accountable as possible. I have also noted on many occasions that Ministers are slow to give information unless pressed very hard by this Opposition.</P>
    <P>This Government is regarded as one of the most closed administrations in modern times.  It has expanded, beyond all precedent, the number of political advisers brought in as special advisers and programme managers and this is of substantial cost to the Exchequer, in contrast to the marked restraint shown by Fianna Fáil.  We find it ironic that Labour and Democratic Left are those principally responsible for privatising and politicising some of the functions of <Col N="815" /> the public service.  We have a Government remote from the people.  The Taoiseach rarely appears in public.  He transfers questions which are clearly for him to answer.  For example, this week I tabled a question asking about the arrangements, if any, he had made to keep in regular contact with other Heads of Government during the Irish Presidency of the EU.  That has been transferred to the Tánaiste.  Does this mean the Taoiseach has not made any arrangements to stay in touch with his fellow Heads of Government during the Presidency?  The Tánaiste is meeting his fellow Foreign Ministers constantly so the question would be pointlessly addressed to him.  In transferring dozens of questions like this without rhyme or reason, which is a daily occurrence &mdash; I am sure Deputy Harney also has files full of rejected questions &mdash; the Taoiseach is running away from this House.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael-led administrations tend to be particularly PR conscious as they fall into the trap of thinking that sophisticated media manipulation and snappy sound bites will paper over any amount of missing substance.  Because of the different ideological backgrounds of the parties in Government, they have had constant difficulty in coming up with a coherent analysis of problems and in making firm political decisions.  It seems that every difficult decision has to be laboriously brokered between the three parties.  Items such as the third banking force, one of the main planks of the Fianna Fáil/Labour administration, has to all appearances been dropped.  I could cite many examples of members of the three parties having a go at each other.  It is an unseemingly run-in to the break up of the three parties.  They do this mostly when there are few other Deputies present, believing people outside will not see them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, on the main 1 o'clock news programme the Minister for Finance criticised Deputy Carey's party. Last night I watched Deputy McGrath having a go at Deputy Taylor's colleague, the Minister for Education and <Col N="816" /> members of Democratic Left constantly criticise all and sundry.  It is an extraordinary dilemma.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of crime and law enforcement has suffered from serious differences within the Coalition.  I accept that crime has been gradually building up for some time, but serious crime has become particularly acute under the present Administration.  Any Minister for Justice needs the support and confidence of the Taoiseach and Cabinet colleagues to be effective, as well as the confidence of the Garda.  That is, sadly, not the situation today for which responsibility lies as much on the shoulders of the three Government leaders, who are only belatedly getting to grips with the urgency of the situation, as it does on the Minister for Justice.  There has been a conspicuous lack of political support for the Minister for Justice from her colleagues in Government over the <Col N="817" /> last 18 months.  It is clear from the statement of the Minister for Finance yesterday that Labour begrudges spending money on law and order.</P>
    <P>As an inner city Deputy, I have been deeply conscious of the deterioration in law and order and its social effects for a long time.  Under my leadership, the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition has given the highest priority to dealing with crime.  We produced nine Private Members' Bills.  Our legislation and Private Members' motion earlier this week formed an important part of the Dáil's response to the current situation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government accepted the principle of our Bill on freezing the assets of drug dealers, since that attacks the problem directly and immediately.  I look forward to working with the Government on legislation, to be pased this month, which must not be altered beyond recognition.  However, we have to deal with the problem at both ends. We must tackle the suppliers, but also make it clear to the small dealers and addicts that we will not accept or tolerate the growth of a drugs culture.  Which of us with teenage or even grown-up children do not worry about the dangerous environment to which they and their contemporaries are exposed?</P>
    <P>How can the Government justify the Tánaiste's veto last year of the proposal of the Minister for Justice to hold a referendum on bail, past inaction on the right to silence, and earlier deferral of plans to provide new prison accommodation? As a Dublin Deputy I am happy with the proposal to build a new prison at Wheatfield in addition to the new women's prison at Mountjoy.  However, we also need the planned prison at Castlerea which was cancelled last year. We have to end the scandal of prison overcrowding and early temporary releases, which, as the Garda Commissioner pointed out, are the biggest single factors in perpetuating crime.  I note that the Northern Prisons Minister has promised to provide satisfactory sanitary facilities throughout the North's prisons and end the practice of slopping out.  I would like the Minister <Col N="818" /> to commit our Government to doing this as well.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, we were told by senior people in authority that there was much political and media exaggeration of crime.  Even now we are being warned about the dangers of over-reaction. The problem has to be dealt with firmly, consistently and with determination. Our spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, has continually done that in this House and the wider media. Many proposals are ripe for action. Comparative statistics are misleading. We decide what quality of life we want for our families and children.</P>
    <P>It used to be the case that for practically every murder the perpetrator was caught.  That is no longer the case.  The shooting first of a Garda and then of a journalist constitute the breach of two barriers in a few weeks.  I deplore telephone threats to Deputy Shortall and any Member who is seriously threatened must be provided with any protection they may need.</P>
    <P>The 12 unresolved contract-type killings this past year are a real cause for deep concern on the part of every Member. The increasing murders of young women, many of them unsolved, also constitute a very worrying trend which can only have the effect of restricting the freedom of all women.  Two more people died last night.  The effect of drugs in destroying the lives of young people will never be adequately captured in Garda statistics.  I also worry about the attacks on vulnerable old people.  This is a callous anti-social crime which must be tackled as severely as any other attacks against the person.</P>
    <P>The Garda have been deprived of some of the necessary resources to do their job.  There has been a significant increase in public sector numbers over the past two years, but none in the Garda.  Everyone who examined the Book of Estimates for 1995 and 1996 can see the low political priority that the justice area has received, compared with other areas of Government.  Indeed, the Government is providing a lower proportion of GNP to be spent on the <Col N="819" /> security of the State in 1995 and 1996, that at any time in the past.</P>
    <P>Protection of the institutions of the State was the watchword of former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave.  This protection has fallen down, with the spectacle of the Government reacting belatedly to events rather than displaying any firm grip.</P>
    <P>In emergencies when the State and society are vulnerable, the Dáil must act collectively.  We will certainly support firm action which is proposed, without prejudice to our own right of initiative. Under the next Fianna Fáil led Administration, law and order will be given top priority at the outset, and the Minister for Justice will have full support from the Taoiseach at all times.  The challenge facing us is to make it too risky for anyone to assume that crimes they commit will go unpunished.  Then we will see real progress.</P>
    <P>Of course, Fianna Fáil accepts there are wider social dimensions to crime and there are large areas of deprivation which are in many cases its breeding ground.  These problems have to be tackled.  We are not in favour of a one dimensional approach to the drugs problem, or to anything else.  Remedial and preventative health, education and employment measures must be taken, as well as justice ones.  Anything we propose or support is intended to enhance the rights and liberties of our citizens. However, we need tougher policies which will send out a clear message to criminals that they will no longer be able to defy society with impunity or regard themselves as untouchable.</P>
    <P>Real economic and social progress and the creation of greater opportunities for all our people will diminish the attraction of crime.  The Government has been riding on the back of an economic boom about which the Minister, Deputy Taylor, spoke this morning. It gathered pace in mid-1993 in a renewal of the strong growth in 1989 and 1990.  I am glad to see from the latest figures that GNP growth in 1994 was maintained at 7.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> The EU Commission's report on the economic and financial situation in Ireland in the transition to European Monetary Union is recommended reading for anyone seriously interested in the progress and problems of our economy. The principal credit for our improved performance is given by the European Commission to the decisive change of direction by the new Fianna Fáil Administration in 1987.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the text prepared by my old colleagues in the Department of Finance for Deputy Taylor, in the absence of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, did not mention the most fundamental report on the economy in recent years. I am amazed they left it out, but there are many spin doctors in the Department of Finance now &mdash; unlike my time there &mdash; and I suppose they must vet everything before it is put on the record here.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the second paragraph of the Commission's report states that the strong performance of the Irish economy is due to a marked change in strategy towards the end of the 1980s.  From 1987, a new broadly based macroeconomic strategy was adopted, involving three main components: fiscal consolidation, enhanced exchange rate stability and a broadbased social consensus agreement.  This strategy laid the basis for a success which is increasingly evident.</P>
    <P>It also states that fiscal correction was pursued with much greater emphasis on the expenditure side, and that in many respects the expenditure reductions were extraordinary.  The Irish economy was the least affected of the member states' economies by the slowdown and subsequent recession in the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>Favourable factors enabled the Government to respond to the slowdown by increasing expenditure, but, as I reminded the Taoiseach last week, the report notes that the reversal in the expenditure trend under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in the early 1990s, was modest compared to the cuts in previous years. In 1987 and 1993, tumbling interest <Col N="821" /> rates were a key factor in reviving our economy, which is why fiscal prudence is so important.</P>
    <P>The EU report states that since 1986 Ireland has experienced an accelerated period of catching up with our EU partners. My party is proud of the economic momentum which we created and sustained over that period from 1987 to 1994.  I hope it will carry us safely through the short remaining lifetime of the present Administration.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of the management of the country's finances since I bequeathed my successor a zero current budget deficit at the end of 1994.  The programme for renewal, in setting a 6 per cent increase in day to day expenditure, was going in the right direction. My aim, if I had continued in Government, was a target of 4.5 per cent.  This Government did not make any attempt to stick to its own higher targets.  Taking 1995-96 together there has been a large increase in public expenditure and this year's spending target will be exceeded once again.  As the EU Commission points out, this has the potential to store up future liabilities which we might not be able to afford should there be a serious downturn in the international economy.  The Commission considered the Government to have been too stringent during the last downturn in 1991-93 but this Government is too loose. Attempts by the Taoiseach to compare spending increases at the bottom of the economic cycle with spending increases at the top of the cycle are economically illiterate.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government's Exchequer returns are broadly favourable. The Minister for Finance should use them to achieve a zero current budget deficit this year.  The emphasis on increased spending has meant that in the past two budgets the Government has been able to give only minimal tax relief.  The social partners have been let down badly.  The commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to reduce earned income as a proportion of total revenue was honoured <Col N="822" /> in my 1994 budget but not in the budgets of 1995 and 1996 introduced by a Labour Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The notion of Labour and Democratic Left parties being the champions of the PAYE sector and Fine Gael as the party of enterprise is laughable in the light of the past two budgets.  A death bed conversion to lower taxes in the 1997 budget will be too late to impress the electorate.  This Government showed its true colours in the past two budgets.  In the rainbow coalition's public expenditure stakes, tax reduction is the last in the field, a rank 100:1 outsider, except perhaps when an election comes around.  The electorate will not be satisfied with the prospect of vote buying relief for hard pressed taxpayers only once every five years.  The EU Tripartite Conference, which includes the trade unions, stated a few weeks ago before the European Summit that lower taxes are more favourable to growth than increases in public spending.  Even new Labour in Britain is prepared to commit itself to no rise in the real level of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>If we wish to maintain the progress achieved by Fianna Fáil since 1987, during the next ten years we should go for the elimination of the Exchequer borrowing requirement by 1999, as recommended by the ESRI and as decided by Ecofin Ministers earlier this month when they agreed that each member state should aim for a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus in the medium term.  In reply to a written parliamentary question I have failed to get any clear statement from the Minister for Finance that the Government is committed to achieving that and still fewer details of how it proposes to go about it, starting in the 1997 budget.  We should aim for a balanced budget on several accounts.  First, it will create room for borrowing to rise when there is a down turn, as there inevitably will be, to smooth over the effects of recession.  Second, as the ESRI has argued, it will create scope and discretion post-1999 to fund worth-while capital projects which will no longer be <Col N="823" /> funded from Brussels.  Third, lower debt servicing costs, currently about £2.3 billion, will create real scope for tax reduction.  The achievement of this does not require public expenditure as a whole to be cut or even frozen in real terms.  It merely requires prudent restraint.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing the Government is to create a more competitive and tax friendly economy.  If we play our cards right, we can join the lower tax countries without prejudicing our ability to provide necessary social services.  When I raised this matter last week with colleagues who were in the House at Question Time we saw the Taoiseach did not believe it and has joined the ranks of tax and spend, saying that any money you gain should be got rid of quickly and not to worry too much about the evil day. Interest rates which are at an extraordinarily low level will certainly rise, economic growth will drop, borrowing will go up again and taxes will rise.  It will be the same old cycle.  I hope we will be back in Government in time to try to stop that from happening but if what the Taoiseach said last week was economic policy, it was the worst kind of economic policy.  I would not expect any backbencher, even those who know nothing about economics, to make such an extraordinary statement.  I recommend it as compulsory reading during the summer recess for everyone who believes that this country should be managed correctly and not in the way put forward by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The tax burden, outside manufacturing and international services, is an impediment to employment.  The unemployment record of this Government is poor with the number on the live register running well ahead of last year's levels. I do not accept that the labour force survey provides a complete or adequate substitute.  When I was Minister for Labour and for Finance, Deputy John Bruton used to say that the labour force survey was just a survey of a few households and not to take any notice of it. Now he is saying the live register, which <Col N="824" /> is the actual number of people signing on, means nothing and that the labour force survey is the main issue.</P>
    <P>The least satisfactory area of this Government has been transport, energy and communications.  Since we returned from the summer recess last year the Minister responsible has been on the agenda of the House.  He has left behind him a trail of controversy regarding almost everything he touches.  He prides himself on being a ruthless operator while the truth is that he is merely an incompetent one.  His messy dismissal of the previous chairman of CIE does not seem to have brought about any of the promised changes in the fundamental problems of CIE, much though I respect current management.  The Minister's hand is suspected behind the efforts to shaft the reputation of the chief executive of Bord na Móna, who has a fine management record even if there were legitimate questions concerning expenses incurred, with the full approval of a former chairman and General Secretary of the Labour Party. We have had enough boardroom scenes for one administration.  I fear that because of earlier reservations of the Labour Party we failed to get the best deal for a share in Telecom Éireann as a strategic partner.  It shocks me that members of the Labour Party and Democratic Left feel so comfortable that they have sold 20 per cent of a State company which became successful because of workers working hard with no days lost on strikes.  Twenty per cent of the company has been sold to two international banking groups which have the option to purchase another 15 per cent of the company.  The telecommunication companies in those countries are owned by banks.  There were other options.  For example, why was the stakeholders scheme not looked at, which I understand was examined closely by the people involved?  Why are pension funds being invested outside this country?  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has debated this point with me for years and agrees that we should stop that money <Col N="825" /> leaving the country and instead reinvest it here.  Why is that money not reinvested in Telecom Éireann?  The asset was sold off to two companies.  The initially large number of interested parties faded away but in an effort to make a deal the workers were sold down the river.  Decisions on the Irish telecommunications industry will be made in the boardrooms of two banks.  I have no problem with a strategic partner for Telecom Éireann, but I am afraid Pat the Banker got himself so indoctrinated by banks that he forgot about communications companies, let eight companies off the list and then had to sell the asset to two banks.  That is a terrible decision and I believe we will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>The Government took over in its early stages a peace process that has generated enormous hope, which has probably saved up to 200 lives and has won tremendous support both at home and abroad.  The public resignation to never ending violence is gone.  People are demanding that the peace be fully restored.  I am glad that Northern Ireland at least remains at peace, though there have been some horrific events elsewhere.  We are appalled at punishment beatings and what appears to be one or two sectarian killings in the past two years.  The peace process was not, as some vocal critics suggest, fundamentally flawed or based on a naive and danger policy of appeasement.  It was based on devising a new and better way forward for all, by building a broad democratic consensus.  We were and are prepared to do all in our power to build and extend that consensus.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach likes to quote my reflection in February that perhaps we could have done more to tie things down in August 1994.  That reflection could apply equally to the commitment of the British Government and the Unionist parties.  I know the Government press officer will keep reminding the Taoiseach to refer to that comment every time I speak on the North &mdash; I do not mind what Government press officers says.  Fianna Fáil in Government tied down two bottom lines, <Col N="826" /> grounded in the basic principles of democracy from which neither we nor our successors in Government have departed nor will depart.  The first was that the principle of self-determination has to be balanced by the principle of consent.  As both the Peace Forum and the Downing Street Declaration have acknowledged, the principle of consent operates in both directions and must be mutual.  Second, in the words of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in this House after the IRA mortar bombs at Heathrow in March 1994, &ldquo;democracy is indivisible... if parties want to play a full part in the democratic process and to take part in direct negotiations, armed struggle by associated organisations must be definitively disowned and ended, clearly and unambiguously&rdquo;.  That reflected the formal position of both Governments in paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration and it achieved a ceasefire, the extent of which exceeded the expectations of the British Government and most parties in this House.</P>
    <P>Irish democracy will have nothing to do with an armalite and ballot box strategy. It will have nothing to do with bombing, multilation and murder.  After the breach of the IRA ceasefire in February and further bomb attacks around the start of all-party talks in June, up to the latest attack last weekend in Germany, it will definitely be more difficult to persuade both Governments and other political parties that a new ceasefire is a bona fide long-term decision and not just a further tactical move in a continuing dual track strategy.  Yet, we must continue to keep doors open as long as we can.  Whatever effect violence may have had in the past it is an incontrovertible fact that it is incapable of further advancing in any respect the republican cause or the interests of the Nationalist people.  It can only set them back.</P>
    <P>While I am severely critical of the way in which the peace process was allowed to lose momentum last year with serious obstacles being placed in <Col N="827" /> the path of talks, we have to move forward. In April I feared the Governments were content to set a date for all-party talks and leave it at that.  I pressed them to move on and great efforts were made between then and 10 June to create the conditions for inclusive, comprehensive and meaningful all-party talks without unnecessary preconditions.</P>
    <P>What I find difficult to understand is the IRA's reluctance to let Sinn Féin go to the negotiating table where it will face political challenges but where it will also have a real opportunity to influence the outcome of talks.  I can see the objections to being asked to settle the decommissioning issue in advance of any other substantive agreement in a talks process where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  I equally understand the fear that the IRA's determination to hold on to its arsenal is for the purpose of reserving its right to resume violence at any time of its choice.  It has always seemed clear to us that discussions on the establishment of a fair and just civil society in the North would involve not only the dismantling of paramilitary arsenals and organisations but also the withdrawal of an intrusive British military presence and a fundamental reform of the police.  A comprehensive peace settlement must include these elements and both republican and loyalist organisations have a vital and indispensable contribution to make to it.</P>
    <P>Like Ireland's friends in America and the Government, I am not sure what more we can do to assist the decision-making processes of Sinn Fein whom we want to see participating fully in the talks now started on the basis of a common understanding enshrined in the six Mitchell principles.  It would help if the talks process was seen to make more visible progress but I agree with the Taoiseach that we should be slow to write them off.  There is far too much at stake and no better alternative.  By demonstrating that there is a viable talks process capable of reaching substantial <Col N="828" /> agreement, regardless of whether all parties are present, the two Governments and the political parties around the table can make their own real contribution to the restoration of peace. The talks process and the peace process were always complementary.  Reaching a political settlement involving the main parties in Northern Ireland and bringing everyone into the process are not and should not be incompatible objectives.</P>
    <P>A reasonable compromise settlement which recognises the different identities on this island and deals justly with them and which fosters trust, reconciliation and co-operation is within reach.  It will allow both parts of the country to prosper. The only route that can possibly exist to a united Ireland is an agreed and democratic one over time.  A forced unity, even if it were to be had, would leave us with a legacy of bitterness, betrayal and instability which none of us would want.  We have much in common with all the people of the North.  Fianna Fáil is a mainstream republican party but we recognise there are other republican parties on this island, especially in the North.  Our ability to work together, the ability of all Nationalists to work together and the ability of Nationalists and Unionists to come to an agreement, which we all recognise is essential, is made very difficult, if not almost impossible, by the persistence of armed struggle.  The nature of British political involvement in this country may also be an obstacle but it is a problem which can be dealt with at this stage by negotiation and agreement and by greater democracy.</P>
    <P>A resumption of the armed struggle would in every sense lead to a dead end. It is time for everybody to move to the next stage, to create a new, peaceful and democratic dynamic.  We must all play our part.  Fianna Fáil has and will continue to try hard to do so, even from the Opposition benches.  It will play a major role in that work willingly, consistently and dutifully.</P>
    <P>The Government has a mountain of important and unfinished work ahead of it.  Given its actions this week, it has <Col N="829" /> very little time left.  Fianna Fáil will watch closely during the recess to see whether the necessary progress is being made while continuing to prepare the agenda of the next Government which we hope to lead.  We hope the agenda will not be forgotten as it was last summer. We hope also that the unseemly scenes witnessed both inside and outside the House in recent weeks when the Government was in disarray are not a sign of things to come during the remainder of its tenure.  Even if this can be put down to the fact that it holds the Presidency, perhaps the Taoiseach should do what the Italians did and have a general election.  We are ready any day he wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On some comments in the newspapers this morning that politicians are wrangling and bickering with each other on the crime crisis in a democracy it is as important to have a vigilant Opposition as it is to have a good Government.  If our democracy is to be vibrant, it is important that the Opposition holds the Government accountable.  The reason we are in different parties and on different sides of the House is that we have a different perspective on many issues, crime, taxation, Northern Ireland and a host of others.</P>
      <P>During the past 18 months since the Government came to office no issue has been debated more than the crime problem. Fianna Fáil has tabled nine Private Members' Bills and the Progressive Democrats three as well as a number of Private Members' motions.  We have tabled questions frequently and sought to get the Government to make up its mind on the bail issue and limit the right to silence to ensure we have laws that are enforceable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology for being critical of a Government which does not have a coherent policy approach to the crime crisis and for trying to ensure that it is kept on its toes and that the crime package finally announced this week is implemented with speed.  If this takes asking questions, criticising and urging <Col N="830" /> on the Government, we would fail in our duty if we did not do so.</P>
    <P>After 18 months in office it is time to audit and evaluate the Government's performance in a number of key areas. I will concentrate on three: its performance in managing the economy and dealing with the crime crisis and how it has lived up to the high standards it set itself in the programme for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  On his first day in office the Taoiseach said that in everything it would do the Government would be open, transparent and accountable.  Lofty sentiments can be found in every paragraph of that document.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the events which led to the collapse of its predecessor it was no surprise that the Government promoted the principles of openness, transparency and accountability.  The Taoiseach told the Dáil the Government would go about its work without excess or extravagance and as transparently as if it were working behind a pane of glass.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was in no doubt about the supremacy of the Dáil.  He said that Taoisigh did not discharge their duties to the public by virtue of their own merits but delivered all authority from this Assembly, the Dáil, the duly elected Parliament of our people.  He also told us that every voter was entitled to expect a Government to operate to high standards, to be answerable for every action it takes and to be open.  He promised a radical reform of our institutions, both locally and nationally, &ldquo;so that they would provide service and be accountable and so that freedom of information is a citizen's clear right without delay or fudging&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Eighteen months later the plans to enshrine the Taoiseach's commitments to freedom of information in legislation are proceeding at a snail's pace.  The heads of the proposed Bill have been published but already the half-hearted approach to openness has run into a barrage of criticism from various groups, particularly the National Union of Journalists.  I doubt if we will see this <Col N="831" /> legislation in the lifetime of this Dáil. Given the level of unease the proposals have already engendered, perhaps this is no bad thing as half baked measures are no substitute for the real thing.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Government's plans to tackle the issue of Cabinet confidentiality are proceeding at a painfully slow pace.  When I asked on the Order of Business yesterday if the Government would use the opportunity in November during the referendum on bail to put the issue of Cabinet confidentiality to the people I got the same answer I received from the Taoiseach on this and other matters over the past 18 months, that is, it will be considered.  After all that time and commitment to openness, transparency and accountability this matter is merely being considered.</P>
    <P>The Government abandoned many of its core aspirations after an initial flush of blood in office.  First there was the controversy over the delays in the Attorney General's office in responding to the correspondence from the victims of Father Brendan Smith.  In trying to explain away his evasive answers to questions tabled by members of the Progressive Democrats the Taoiseach offered an astounding justification.  He told us on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that he did not give certain answers because he was not asked the right questions.  Disbelief was the order of the day on the Opposition benches when we heard that statement.  We asked if it could be possible that the great champion of Dáil reform, the man synonymous with the search for a more dynamic way of doing our business, had uttered these words on radio.  His predecessor had been hounded out of office for coming up with a similar explanation.  The Taoiseach did not even see the connection and could not understand why we were so critical of him.  It was obvious from that day that he had begun his descent down the slippery slope to secretive and evasive Government.  I agree with Deputy Ahern that this is a very closed administration.</P>
    <P>That pattern of secrecy continued last <Col N="832" /> May in the Anthony Duncan extradition case when the Government, through its myriad of spokespeople, allowed the impression to be formed that the fault for the collapse in that case lay on the British side.  Once again parliamentary questions ran into a brick wall of obfuscation from the Government benches. The Taoiseach spoke of his casual conversation with the Minister for Justice and told us he could not remember exactly when this was, even though the Minister subsequently confirmed it was three days later.  Opposition attempts to establish the full facts were dismissed as frivolous and unhelpful.  Indeed, our very right to ask questions was criticised. The Taoiseach believes the only questions that should be asked are ones which he regards as helpful and not insensitive.  Our obligation as members of an Opposition to ask the right and difficult question &mdash; in a democracy it is important that difficult and awkward questions are asked &mdash; is often challenged on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>It was not as if the Brendan Smith and Anthony Duncan cases were isolated examples of where the Government abandoned its high standards. Throughout his period at the helm of the Government the Taoiseach has displayed an unwillingness to be frank and open during deliberations in the Dáil. Dozens of questions tabled by the Opposition parties to the Taoiseach have either been transferred or ruled out altogether.  Too often the Taoiseach has opted for the minimalist approach of saying very little in the Dáil.  As recently as this week, he ignored the Dáil completely by opting to announce the Government's latest anti-crime package at a hastily arranged press conference, while there was no Cabinet Minister present in the House for one of the most important Private Members' debates during the life of the Dáil.  So much for the Taoiseach's commitment that the Dáil would be supreme and he would ensure it was more relevant and was reformed.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion I can draw from 18 months of this Government is that <Col N="833" /> many of the lofty aspirations have come to nought due to internal dissension. Never was this more evident that during the past few months when we were treated to the most astonishing defence of two fund-raising fiascos.  First there was the £100 per head business lunch which offered a rare opportunity to meet the Minister for Finance before he finalised the Finance Bill.  This Labour fund-raising initiative was the brainchild of the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  As we know that lunch never took place.  That was the only firm decision taken in the affair, and a very weak apology was thrown out for public consumption.  In this Government of high standards there was no question of resignations or of politicians falling on their swords.  The former Ministers of State, Deputies Coveney and Hogan, earlier victims of Labour's scalp seeking, showed commendable restraint.</P>
    <P>A few weeks later we were treated to another fund-raising event which backfired when the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, Niall Stokes, penned his signatur to a race night, a fund-raiser organised for the Minister who had appointed him to his position.  Once again, we were criticised for daring to suggest that there was something wrong with this fund-raising duet between the Minister and the man he appointed.  Later in the day there was an admission that what was done was wrong, but Labour has its own laws when it comes to the matter of resignations. Once again, admirable maturity and restraint was displayed by Fine Gael, the largest party in Government.</P>
    <P>These events, taken together, provide compelling evidence that the rot has set in.  Members of the Government are beginning to turn on each other &mdash; we had an example of this last night by Deputy Paul McGrath &mdash; and the cracks are already beginning to appear.  After ten years in the political wilderness Fine Gael was obviously cock-a-hoop about being back in power.  The unfortunate point for the public is that Fine Gael has forgotten what power is for.  It was <Col N="834" /> inevitable that the feel good factor in Fine Gael about holding the reins of office would only last so long.  In recent days the impatience about being in power but being effectively impotent has become more evident.  Deputies Shatter, Deasy and Hogan have led the way in criticising the performance of the Government.  The penny has dropped. These Deputies know that for too long the Labour Party has been wagging the Fine Gael dog and that their leader, the Taoiseach, has been abandoning his political instincts in the interest of keeping his partners on board.</P>
    <P>It has become glaringly obvious during the past week that the traditional party of law and order is but a shadow of its former self.  Fine Gael has lost its way on a range of issues, from taxation, the economy, to crime and many others. Any time a Fine Gael Minister dared put his or her head above the parapet the marksman of the Labour Party took aim, fired and shot down the target.  On the issue of bail, for example, the Labour Party made it known at an early stage that it would not countenance any change which might in any way make life more difficult for hardened criminals. It did not have the courage to come out and say this publicly but merely spread the word via an unnamed senior Minister and through various spokespeople in the columns of the newspapers.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has been in office for almost four years.  It has been in power during a time of unprecedented growth in the economy, yet it has failed to convert this wealth into real jobs for the electorate.  Its stubborn refusal to accept the threat posed to the security of the State by the crime crisis or the threat posed by organised crime is testimony to its failure to grasp the reality of modern day life.  This was seen first in its attitude to the bail laws and now in the length of time it will take to build a prison to house 400 inmates. Yesterday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, tried to give me a lesson in architecture.  He suggested that it was <Col N="835" /> facile for me to suggest that a new prison could be built in a matter of months rather than years.  I bow to the Minister's greater experience with architecture and bricks and mortar, but I wish to point out to him that we do not want a renaissance cathedral or an architectural monument but rather four strong walls to house these people.  To suggest that it will take years to construct, 18 months to design and a massive £40 million to build is a disservice to the construction skills of the private sector &mdash; £100,000 per inmate.  Close to the proposed Wheatfield site on the Naas Road there are very fine recent examples of how the construction industry can build projects with great speed. The Doyle Hotel Group, for example, demolished and rebuilt the Green Isle Hotel with 90 luxury bedrooms and a new state of the art conference facility in a matter of six months at a cost of a mere £5 million.  A stone's throw from there, Patrick Campbell has just built Bewley's Hotel, a 126 room hotel, in a matter of seven months.  At the Red Cow Inn a new 150 bedroom hotel and a banqueting hall will be completed within seven months.  These are but a few examples of how the private sector when given a job, get on with it and it could also be done in relation to the prison.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the crisis in crime is not always about spending more money. Since 1990 expenditure on our prison service has gone up by 50 per cent, yet the number of inmates has increased by only 7 per cent.  If we are serious about tackling the chronic shortage of prison spaces the private sector should be asked to build this facility and the State should lease it back from them.  We do not have time on our hands because the crisis requires urgent attention.  It has taken two horrific, cold blooded murders to bring this Government to its senses in relation to crime.  Some commentators have warned against knee-jerk reaction in the wake of recent events but that warning misses the point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> Until a few days ago there was a constant and stubborn refusal by the Government to accept there was a crisis. We were constantly told in the media that crime, and the crisis surrounding it, was merely being hyped up by the Opposition.  Finally the Government has bowed the knee to public pressure.  Public confidence in Government is at an all time low.  Governments who fail to take tough and courageous decisions in the face of unprecedented attacks on the fabric of society are guilty of a gross dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>One Labour Minister the other evening accused us of not caring about the disadvantaged and the vulnerable and presented herself as a champion of the underprivileged.  She exhorted us to look not only at crime but at its causes. I can safely say that after four years in Government the Labour Party has done nothing to tackle either crime or its causes.  Its justification for doing nothing can be attributed to its strange interpretation of civil liberties.  Our liberty &mdash; our most basic liberty &mdash; is to be able to live safely and securely in our own homes, to be able to walk down our streets without fear of being attacked, to be able to live in a country where the law is on the side of law abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>The primary duty of Government in a democracy is the protection of the citizen. Our Government gets involved in a multitude of things like running hotels, airports and ports and many other matters that could be done by other sectors. The one area where the Government must act &mdash; and where only the Government must act &mdash; is in the protection of citizens.  That is a duty that comes before all others.  Would it not be better if the Government concentrated on that primary duty and let others get on with doing other things?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, as Leader of Fine Gael in Opposition, was a great proponent of tax reform.  Since coming to power 18 months ago this Fine Gael led Government has vigorously pursued the kind of tax and spend policy which his party lambasted in Opposition.  The <Col N="837" /> result has been massive increases in taxation. No other Taoiseach in the history of the State has presided over such massive increases in personal taxation. By December 1996, if the Government lasts that long, it will have been in office for two years.  During that period it will have succeeded in increasing the Government's total tax bill by £1.3 billion, increasing income tax by £500 million and increasing the tax burden on the hard-pressed PAYE sector by more than £400 million.  In short, in just two years the Government will have driven up the country's tax bill by more than 12 per cent when the combined inflation rate is 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Taxes do not rise by accident, they rise because of deliberate decisions by Government.  In spite of all his rhetoric in Opposition about the need to encourage enterprise and employment the Taoiseach is doing the opposite in Government.  A married couple with one earner on £250 per week pays over £50 in income tax, a single person on the same income pays £66 a week in taxes. Not only that, he or she is also taxed at 56 per cent on any additional earnings. Will the Taoiseach tell me of any country that imposes this kind of penal taxation on people with such modest incomes?  The ordinary PAYE workers here are hit with four separate taxes: income tax, employees' PRSI, the health levy and the training and employment levy.  This means that the same slice of income is taxed four times, effectively we are paying tax on tax.  In addition employers have to pay a payroll tax for the privilege of hiring someone. The net result is a tax system that militates against job creation.  If an employer pays somebody £250 a week, the Government collects £95 per week from the transaction.  This is equivalent to a tax rate of 35 per cent on job creation.</P>
    <P>Experience around the world shows that high taxes produce high unemployment. It is a remarkable fact that despite favourable international circumstances, low inflation, low interest rates and billions of pounds in EU supports, the <Col N="838" /> level of unemployment in Ireland is higher than when the Taoiseach took office.</P>
    <P>The Government spin doctors tell us we are creating jobs in record numbers. Out of the 107,000 jobs created between 1992 and 1995, only 34,000 were full-time. Two in every three jobs were accounted for by part-time positions or places on Government job schemes where numbers have mushroomed over the last couple of years.  I worry about an economy in which the number of people on Government job schemes is greater than the total number of people employed in the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>Part-time work has an important role to play in our economy.  However, if we are saying that a supermarket which replaces one full-time job with three part-time jobs has created two new jobs then we are being disingenuous with the figures.  Over taxation and over regulation is leading to the casualisation of Irish employment.  There are now 150,000 people engaged in some form of casual employment.  They are either part-time, on contracts or on zero hour contracts.  These people are at a severe disadvantage when it comes to pension rights or even taking out loans from financial institutions.  There was always a large element of casual working in the services sector, particularly in seasonal industries such as tourism and we are now seeing the large scale casualisation of industry.  Casual workers now account for almost 10 per cent of total jobs in the manufacturing industry, up to 6 per cent from three years ago.  We have now made it so unattractive for employers to hire people that they prefer to take on casual workers.  What sense is there in that kind of employment policy?</P>
    <P>The link between high taxation and high unemployment is well established and there is no shortage of advice available to the Taoiseach on this front.  The Government's development agency, Forfás, recently produced a major report entitled <i>Shaping our Future</i> which will be discussed here later today. <Col N="839" /> That document clearly stated that personal income tax should be reduced to promote enterprise and improve the incentive to work.  I do not know if the Taoiseach pays any attention to the reports produced by his Government. Perhaps he will be willing to listen to the plaintive cries emanating from his Fine Gael backbenchers, a group with whom he seems to have lost all political contact since elevation to office.  I understand they have formed a tax strategy committee and will forward a report to the Taoiseach in a matter of weeks. According to well placed sources that report will call for reductions in the rates of income tax.  This effort must surely be classified as a triumph of hope over experience.  Have they not realised that although Fine Gael is in Government it is definitely not in power?  Not only that but the Labour Party holds an ideological veto over the economic policies of this Government as well as over issues to do with crime.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is the second largest party in this House and the largest party in Government.  It has a majority of seats in the Coalition, yet when it comes to taxation or law and order or any other major issue it has to toe the Labour line and watch a Fine Gael led Government implement policies against which Fine Gael campaigned in the last election and won support.</P>
    <P>In relation to tax I can think of nothing better than to quote the words of Tony Blair last night when he said that people should be able to keep as much of their money as they have earned and allowed to spend it as they wish.  That is British Labour Party economic policy and the economic policy that is in place in Northern Ireland.  We share this island with the British economy. In Northern Ireland a worker on £300 per week living in Newry is £17 per week better off than a worker 12 miles away in Dundalk.  The cost to an employer in Newry of giving an employee an extra pound in take home pay is 50 per cent cheaper than across the Border in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> Ordinary people earning their own income and making their own choices would be more than capable of paying university fees if they could take home more of what they earn.  The Taoiseach chastised me for suggesting the Government should not have made that decision.  The recommendations of the de Buitléir report should have been implemented.  The decision on third level fees will not bring about equity or enable my constituents, or those of the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, to attend university.  It will merely cost the taxpayers more money.  Giving people money and allowing them decide how to spend it is the best way to create a self-reliant economy and ensure we do not continue to foster a dependency culture.</P>
    <P>We are one of the biggest recipients of foreign aid.  Each year we receive approximately £2,000 <i>per capita</i> from the EU, an astonishing amount of money.  It is only a question of time before that money runs out and we will have to stand on our own feet.  If we cannot control public spending, prioritise decision-making and apply the proceeds of growth to reducing the tax burden on ordinary workers at a time of unprecedented growth in our economy, when will we be able to do so?  If the Government had kept public spending in line with inflation this year, it would have had £280 million to apply to tax reform which could have either reduced the higher rate of tax by eight percentage points or the standard rate by four percentage points.  If the Government had made one of those choices it would have done more to create jobs and to stimulate growth in the economy than the choices it made.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed miserably in three key areas, crime, the economy and its commitment to openness, transparency and making the Dáil more relevant. This is one of the most closed, evasive and secret Administrations we have ever had.  I hope it will change its ways during our Presidency and insist on major packages on crime and other matters being announced in the House, not at PR press conferences.  The <Col N="841" /> Government has an unprecedented number of advisers, programme managers, consultants, task forces and review groups.  It is paralysed by advice and analysis.  If the Government decides before 25 July that it will be tough and decisive, that it will not procrastinate on major issues and examine new ways of being open, transparent and accountable, this debate will have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The refusal of the Taoiseach to allow written parliamentary questions be taken during the summer recess does not augur well for what I want from the Government.  The Taoiseach stated this morning that when in Opposition he considered it better to talk to people, to telephone them or to carry out research rather than table parliamentary questions. That is not what he told the Dáil when in Opposition.  His words were:</P>
    <P>There is no greater way of making a Government accountable than by being able to table a question.  It is fundamental as far as I am concerned and I believe we must give serious consideration to giving the Ceann Comhairle extra powers to ensure that Deputies, who are the representatives of the public in this Parliament, have full access to parliamentary questions both in session and out of session.</P>
    <P>That is not what he said this morning. Even on that issue he failed to live up to the high standards he set himself.  The Taoiseach does not inspire people's confidence in himself or the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney is confusing matters in criticising the Taoiseach on the decision not to take parliamentary questions during the summer recess.  He referred this morning to the best way in which a person could carry out research during the Dáil recess.  The extract from which she quoted relates to the role of the Opposition in keeping a Government accountable for policy decisions and actions.  They are two distinct roles. If we are to have a serious debate on <Col N="842" /> accountability, openness and transparency we should distinguish between what are essentially the blood sport antics that can emerge about Question Time and the real need to make a Government accountable, open and transparent.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to judge the Government simply on its performance in the House. I have had many years of experience in Opposition and Ministers in this Government have given far more open, detailed and transparent replies than was my experience when I tabled questions to previous Ministers, both in the Progressive Democrats Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  One should also consider the manner in which the Government does its daily business.  When initiating new policies my Department engaged in a wide range of consultation with non-governmental organisations and the voluntary sector.  On my own initiative I offered, on a number of occasions, to go before the Select Committee on Social Affairs to discuss major reports produced by my Department or other agencies.  If we are to have a balanced debate on the question of transparency, openness and accountability, we should examine the total package and operations of the Government and not narrow the focus to parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>This debate provides the opportunity to review the work of the past year and to look to the tasks ahead.  In common with all Government Departments, the annual Estimates of the Department of Social Welfare for 1996 were framed against a background of a successful and well-managed economy.</P>
      <P>Sensible and effective management of the national finances coupled with the support of European Structural and Development Funds have brought about the creation of a significant number of new jobs.  Inflation is low and stable.  Short-term interest rates are at their lowest levels for 20 years and mortgage rates are at their lowest for 30 years.  This makes the pound in the pocket more valuable and leaves more for discretionary spending or saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> There is another side to the coin.  Side by side with a successful economy, we also have an unacceptably high number of people living on the margins and excluded from participating fully in our society.  While economic success can be measured through indicators like interest rates and inflation rates the real measure of our success will lie in the extent to which we can ensure that the fruits of a successful economy are shared by all sections of society and not confined to those fortunate enough to be in secure, well-paid employments.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for my Department for 1996 amount to more than £2.6 billion. When the additional amount of some £1.7 billion which will be provided this year by employers, employees and the self-employed by way of PRSI contributions is taken into account, the full extent of social welfare spending in Ireland this year adds up to £4.35 billion.</P>
    <P>Some 900,000 people are in receipt of weekly payments from the Department of Social Welfare and nearly one-and-a-half million people, including dependants, benefit from these.  More than £1 billion pounds a year goes directly to supporting families, more than £1 billion to pensioners and a similar sum to the unemployed.  Of course, much of the expenditure that goes to the unemployed, to pensioners, and to people who are ill, helps to support families. Some 315,000 children are dependent on recipients of pensions, disability and unemployment payments.  In addition, child benefit is paid monthly to nearly half a million families.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare does far more than dispense weekly and monthly payments.  It supplies vital employment support services and assists many voluntary and community groups. It also makes an impact on the labour market through the social insurance system, which provides a range of entitlements for insured workers, through the family income supplement which supports low-paid workers, and through the way in which it assists unemployed <Col N="844" /> workers.  This impact on the labour market is being enhanced substantially by the pro-employment measures we have introduced over the last year and I intend to continue to make improvements of this kind.</P>
    <P>In framing this year's budget, we had two primary objectives in mind in the social welfare area.  First, we set out to consolidate the gains achieved in 1995 by again providing for substantial increases in child benefit and by providing for increases in general social welfare payments considerably in excess of inflation.  Second, we set out to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment through a cohesive and imaginative package of measures, intended to enable people to participate actively in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare system must be flexible and capable of responding to the changing nature of work today.  It is not enough for the system to provide income support to those in need; it must also be capable of providing a springboard for those seeking to enter or reenter the labour market.  In this context, I turn now to the recently published report of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>This report recognises the fundamental importance of balancing the need to maintain a strong and transparent incentive to work with the equally important objective of ensuring an adequate income for all.  An important feature of the report is the statement of the principles underlying its recommendations which the expert group consider should be a guide to future policy: there must be a reward for working; the transition to work should be facilitated; tax on the lower paid should be reduced; the tax and social welfare systems should be simpler and tax and social welfare reforms should be coordinated.</P>
    <P>In charting options for future reforms, the report provides a highly significant contribution to public debate in this area.  It makes it clear there is no panacea to the problems we face and <Col N="845" /> goes on to identify where our main priorities must lie.  The report identifies reform of child income support and tax reform as two of the key issues to be tackled.</P>
    <P>This Government has already taken steps to reduce some of the disincentive effects associated with the current structure of child income support.  We have improved child benefit and reduced the relative importance of child dependant allowances, an approach which is endorsed and recommended by the expert group.</P>
    <P>The group's report makes it clear that reform of child income support must continue, although it did not recommend one approach over another. Instead it put forward a number of different ways in which the overall system of child income could be improved, highlighting the advantages of each approach.  The Government will look at these options very carefully, to develop the best strategy for continuing reform in this area.</P>
    <P>The expert group also signaled the need to pay attention to the taxation of people on low incomes.  This Government has already made some progress on reducing the tax burden.  In the past two budgets, the personal tax allowance for a married couple has increased by £600; the general exemption for a married couple has also been so increased by £600 in the two years.  Substantial progress has also been made on widening the tax bands.</P>
    <P>The integration group also dealt with the issue of PRSI, a subject close to my heart and one on which my Department has been for some time preparing a discussion document.  I was pleased to see the group reach a consensus on the need to maintain the contributory principle which forms the basis of the social insurance system and is a fundamental principle for the trade union movement and many others in our society, although obviously not for the Progressive Democrats if we are to accept what their leader said here today, and what they have said in their published policy documents.  I agree with the group's <Col N="846" /> recommendation that both the employers' and employees' contribution should be retained and that it should continue to be based on earnings.  I also endorse its recommendation that the principle of an Exchequer contribution to the social insurance fund should be maintained to reflect a commitment to social solidarity.  In recent years, social insurance contributions from employers, employees and self-employed have met almost all of the cost of social insurance payments. However, the remainder continues to be met by the Exchequer and this residual contribution will not necessarily be static.  For demographic and other reasons, it is low at present, but we have to be prepared for it to rise again.</P>
    <P>The level of Exchequer funding of the overall social welfare system is a very significant expression of social solidarity by the general taxpayer.  It amounts to the equivalent of more than half the yield from income taxes each year.  Any reductions in PRSI contributions by employers, employees, or the self-employed would have to be converted directly into increases in taxation, in order to meet the Exchequer's increased obligations to the social insurance fund.  For this reason, changes in PRSI cannot be viewed in isolation from general tax reform, and the long-term implications of major adjustments in PRSI must be studied very carefully indeed.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, I will publish a discussion document on social insurance shortly as a contribution to public debate on these issues.  The information and analysis it contains, together with the views of the integration group in this matter, will form essential reading for serious commentators as well as for policy makers and I trust both documents will receive widespread attention.</P>
    <P>I must respond again to Deputy Harney on this matter.  I fail to understand why the leader of any political party would stand up in this House and criticise a Government for undertaking serious analysis of problems, for preparing serious reports on these problems <Col N="847" /> and for presenting them to the public and the Dáil for discussion to seek the best way forward.</P>
    <P>The idea that Deputy Harney seems to promote is that one should go into a darkened room on one's own, look into one's heart and come up with a solution with regard to the facts.</P>
    <P>In addition to its practical support for workers, pensioners and families, the Department of Social Welfare plays a significant and increasing role in developing policies and strategies for long-term social and economic development. It is responsible for three important organisations &mdash; the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Service Board &mdash; each of which contributes to policy formation and planning for important aspects of society's present and future needs.</P>
    <P>In the past year the Government, on foot of my proposals, has established a national anti-poverty strategy and a Commission on the Family.  Under the strategy, a detailed assessment of the institutional and other changes required to overcome poverty is being carried out.  The Commission on the Family is considering the future role of the Government in relation to families, given the many changes that have been taking place in Irish family life and the need for an integrated strategy to strengthen and assist all families to function effectively in future.  It will make an interim report to Government in October of this year and a final report in June 1997.</P>
    <P>As with any Government, there have been issues in the past year that might have been handled differently, especially with the benefit of hindsight, but in general the Government is successfully tackling old problems avoided by Fianna Fáil Administrations and new issues that inevitably arise.  The commitment by this Government, by all Ministers and by each of the three party leaders to discussion, consultation and consensus is what distinguishes this <Col N="848" /> Government from many of its predecessors and is the key to its success.</P>
    <P>Through this way of working, we have been able to tackle change without the sort of bitter infighting that led to the fall of the past two Governments, and, as I have said on several occasions, the dynamics of a three-party Government, as opposed to a two-party Government, are positively conducive to political stability and effective decision-making.</P>
    <P>This Government has much to be proud of.  We have introduced the biggest ever increases in child benefit to the direct benefit of half a million families. We have ended the disgraceful discrimination against married women in social welfare with £260 million being paid out to 70,000 women.  Long-term unemployment has been put at the top of the national economic agenda with a major programme of job initiatives put in place in the last budget; it is also being placed at the top of the European agenda by us during our Presidency of the EU.</P>
    <P>More than 600 net new jobs have been created every week that this Government has been in office. Inflation has been kept under control and mortgage rates are at their most sustained low levels for 30 years; everyone is better off, in real terms, as a result.  Tens of thousands of low-paid workers have been taken out of the tax net.  A successful referendum was held to remove the constitutional ban on divorce. Legislation for abortion information was introduced.</P>
    <P>We continued with the firm, balanced, and effective approach to the peace process.  While a major review of the Constitution is under way, we have also revamped the public housing programme. That is only a small sample of the Government's achievements.</P>
    <P>As a Government, we inherited the guardianship of the peace process.  We have carried that process forward with energy, commitment and good faith, and considerable success, for example in commencing multi-party talks.  From the outset, the Government decided on a balanced and even-handed approach <Col N="849" /> that took account of the fears and aspirations of both Nationalists and Unionists. We gave no succour to triumphalism &mdash; on any side.</P>
    <P>We did not seek to champion the cause of one side over the other because the resolution of the Northern Ireland conflict lies not in notions of victory or defeat, but in the reaching of an accommodation between nationalism and unionism, the two conflicting allegiances at the heart of the problem.  We recognise that there are other dimensions to the problem that must be, and are being, addressed.  We are fully aware that the parameters of the Northern Ireland problem extend to the Republic of Ireland and into Britain, but the Anglo-Irish war is over for generations and there is no conflict, real or imagined, between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  IRA bomb attacks in London or Manchester, bomb factories in Laois, or mortar attacks in Osnabruck do not serve the cause of Ireland however one cares to define it.</P>
    <P>Rather they compound the problem and add to the toll of human misery. The armed struggle, as it is called, is morally wrong and no amount of IRA propaganda, Sinn Féin hypocrisy or graveyard orations long on personal abuse and short on reason can make it right.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil teannas idir an pholataíocht agus an claonadh míleata laistigh den nGluaiseacht Poblachtach. Bhí sé amhlaidh i gcónaí.  Tá an saol míleata bunaithe ar cheannas agus ar chinnteacht, caitear órdaithe a chur i gcríoch, gan ceist.  In eadansin tá an saol polaitiúil bunaithe ar chomhráití agus ar chomghéilleadh; deintear cur agus cúiteamh ar na fadhbanna agus níl aon fórsa i gceist seachas fórsa na haragóna.</P>
    <P>Tá Gluaiseacht na Poblachta tugtha don bhfoirneart le fada an lá.  Ní ghlacann lucht an tradisiún go fonnmhar leis an athrú, agus níl an meoin míleata ar a shuaimhneas le bunluacha an daonlathais. In ainneoin sin, ní foláir don IRA <Col N="850" /> glacadh le buncheart na síochána, atá ag muintir na hÉireann agus na Breataine.</P>
    <P>The people of this island want an end to IRA violence, once and for all.  Peace is their sovereign right and it cannot be denied them.  Sinn Féin has a choice to make: it is the choice between democracy and violence, a choice between representing their electorate or continuing to play front end of a pantomime horse to the IRA's rear-end.</P>
    <P>The time for prevarication is over. Likewise, the time for pretence is over. Sinn Féin cannot pretend to be merely a distant cousin of the IRA when it is intimately associated with, and acts as a mouthpiece for, that organisation.  Sinn Féin cannot shout, &ldquo;Up the IRA&rdquo;, in Bodenstown on a Sunday and act the innocent on a Monday.  If Gerry Adams could tell us that they have not &ldquo;gone away you know&rdquo;, he can at least tell us if he has asked the IRA to go away.</P>
    <P>The negotiations are under way.  Progress has been made, although it has been slow, but it is important to recognise that the negotiations do have the potential to lead to an agreement.  It will not be as easy.  A peaceful and democratic accommodation requires that politicians on all sides should turn their backs on the rancour and suspicion of the past.  In seeking to overcome past divisions, existing differences should be acknowledged and every effort made to overcome them.  The approach of politicians should be based on a willingness to compromise and on a recognition that there can be no agreement without compromise.  The capacity to do so is beginning to emerge on Stormont Castle.</P>
    <P>Terrible events have occurred in recent weeks that have highlighted the nature of crime in our society.  A new generation of ruthless, professional criminals has emerged in recent years. Irish society has been rightly shocked by the extent of their criminality and by the level of violence they are prepared to employ in order to protect their interests.  Some of them have enjoyed the status of celebrities in sections of the media while others have been subjected <Col N="851" /> to more rigorous scrutiny, but they have now signalled, in the most brutal fashion, that they want no more media attention.</P>
    <P>The media has declared that it will not be intimidated.  This Government will defend freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  Likewise, we will make it clear that there is no freedom to rob, murder, or main in this State. Crime is a serious problem and the Government treats it seriously.  We are committed to ensuring that the elderly are able to live in safety and security, that women can walk safely on our streets, that communities are enabled to live free of the daily debris of drug abuse and crime on their doorsteps.</P>
    <P>As a society we have to confront both the culture of criminality and a certain residual ambivalence towards the law and its agencies.  The murders of Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin were appalling crimes in themselves, but they were also attacks on the institutions of this democratic Irish State. We cannot, and will not, tolerate such attacks.</P>
    <P>The anti-crime package announced by the Government this week is a coordinated and reflective response to the situation.  Organised crime demands a response from Government, on behalf of the people, which is different in both degree and kind from the response required for individual crimes, even individual serious crimes.  The Government's response is based on better detection, better deterrence and better prevention.  That is a more effective and responsible approach than declaring a fatwa on organised crime.</P>
    <P>Criminals today, of course, operate internationally and that is why the Government has made tackling crime a major plank of the EU Presidency.  We are determined that significant progress will be made towards ratification of the Europol convention so that there will be common action to deal with a common problem.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to place pro-employment measures and measures to combat <Col N="852" /> poverty at the centre of the European treaties.  If the citizens of Europe are to remain committed to, and continue to identify with, the European Union, then Treaty revisions will have to deal with issues of real relevance to ordinary men, women, and children.  Jobs, a good standard of living, adequate levels of social protection and equality of opportunity are universal concerns.  If we fail to maintain and develop our tradition of social solidarity at both national and European levels we are left with a framework of Government which accommodates itself to the unchecked demands and priorities of big business, whatever they might be at any given time.  Europe must, and can be, more than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on a number of areas, particularly my area of responsibility as spokesperson on Finance.  It is appropriate to say a few words on the debate we have had in recent weeks on law and order and crime.  Whatever Government is in office, protection of our people should be a priority.  The basic reason people organise themselves into groups is to protect themselves from the invader.  In Ireland we enjoy a democracy, with free and regular elections, perhaps too regular for some of us.  The basic purpose behind any Government or organisation is to provide protection and security against the criminal.  Whatever changes are required in expenditure, the number one priority must be in the area of law and order and if adjustments have to be made by the Government in the coming months or years, priority must be given to crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday in an interview on national radio referred to this matter.  I did not hear the interview, and reports quoted him as stating that some adjustments may have to be made in other areas, and I have no problem with that.  Regardless of what party is in power, there will always be backbenchers who, rightly, demand increased levels of public services.  It is <Col N="853" /> the job of the Opposition and spokes-persons to demand changes in expenditure, but it is the job of Government to decide where the money should be spent.  There is no point in Government backbenchers crying when cutbacks are made in certain areas.  Governing is a tough job, and there are many people in this House willing and able to do that job.  Some politicians have recently learned that being in Government is not an easy task, but the necessary changes must be made.  The major change regarding economic performance in my political lifetime came in 1987.  At a time when the country was on the edge of economic bankruptcy, that Haughey-led Government took the necessary medicine and adopted a completely new approach to the level of public expenditure. Until that time it was thought that if a Government went down that road it would be thrown out of office at the earliest opportunity.  Previous administrations were not prepared to take on cutbacks in levels of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The measures implemented by that Government led to an increase in the respect in which politicians were held and, far from its being berated and dealt with severely by the electorate, it did very well in the 1989 election.  It is not true to suggest we must continue to give in to vested interests.</P>
    <P>We have enjoyed economic growth for several years at a rate not seen since the mid-1960s, but the tide will turn and an economic slowdown of some kind will occur in the future.  It behoves any Administration to build up some reserves for that rainy day.  One does not have to be a politician or an economist to know that; it is mere prudence. Any business person, housewife or ordinary worker should work to that premise</P>
    <P>The economy will face a number of problems in the coming years for which we should be planning now.  Whatever changes occur in the European Union, proportionately Ireland will not enjoy as high a level of direct Structural Fund transfers post-1999 as it will enjoy pre-1999. Post-1999 the European Union <Col N="854" /> will continue to make some transfers to Ireland but they cannot be of the same levels we have seen.  The basis for transfer of funds from the European Union is to bring all member states to the same level of income.  Ireland has enjoyed high levels of Structural Fund and other transfers from the EU because our economy, and other economies throughout Europe, had to be brought up to the European average.  Our economy will be above the European average by 1999.</P>
    <P>One does not need to be a mathematician to know that, with poorer countries joining the European Union, Ireland will be above the threshold that applies to other countries.  We will not be entitled, nor should we be, to the same level of transfers we have received.  Administrations would like those high levels of transfers to continue because it would mean the Exchequer, and ultimately the taxpayer, would not have to fund the programmes currently funded by Europe.  Those funds will taper off, however, and we must make provision for that now.</P>
    <P>The level of transfers has contributed largely to Irish GNP growth.  I have read various commentaries by experts on the direct effect of those transfers in terms of economic growth.  They have certainly been significant.  Ireland has received a great deal of funds from Europe in the infrastructural area but the Government will have to fund various programmes in that area when EU funding increases.  No one is suggesting that when Structural Fund transfers slow down we should abandon a whole range of infrastructural projects.  They will have to be continued and the Exchequer will have to continue to fund them.  If we do not do that, economic activity in Ireland will be depressed and we will be unable to keep up with our European partners.</P>
    <P>By 1999 Ireland will probably have joined some form of economic and monetary union.  The Government and Fianna Fáil are committed to at least being in a position to decide for ourselves whether to join.  When we join an economic and monetary union the level <Col N="855" /> of flexibility the Government will have in regard to budget deficits and Exchequer borrowing requirements will be restricted.</P>
    <P>Subject to the rules being laid down in tablets of stone, the Government will not have the discretion to engage in spending sprees.  Asymmetric shocks, the term now used, will occur and it would be prudent for us to plan our affairs in such a way that we can address problems when they arise.  I have referred to three areas where prudence on the part of the Administrations would be advisable.</P>
    <P>Revenue buoyancy and economic growth in the past number of years have masked an increase in public expenditure which is not warranted or desirable. When the problems to which I have referred arise, the changes that will have to be made by an Administration and the policy changes that will have to be put into effect will impinge more strongly than they would if they had been planned for in a prudent way.</P>
    <P>Those who advocate a &ldquo;spend, spend&rdquo; approach are generally left of centre in Irish political life.  They want everybody to think they are the only people who can look after the poor and disadvantaged in society.  When Governments are forced to implement policy changes the poor and disadvantaged bear the brunt of those policy changes.  I acknowledge Governments endeavour to ensure the effect is shared in all areas but the people who suffer most are those whom the original measures were designed to help.  The history of political Administrations shows that has always been the case.</P>
    <P>We must decide on the level of services we want to provide.  Since my election to this House in 1977 I have never advocated lower levels of taxation for political purposes.  We should decide on a level of services which is necessary and desirable but which we can afford. There are many desirable things in life but families and individuals must make decisions as to whether they can afford <Col N="856" /> them.  However, we have not abided by those tenets.</P>
    <P>The Government has made no effort to have a planned and prudent approach to the public finances.  I see nothing halfway through 1996 to make me believe otherwise and I doubt if the 1997 budget will be any different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak as a Deputy for Laoighis-Offaly, not as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I want to highlight the disgust of people who have telephoned me here and at home about the continuing débâcle in Bord na Móna.  We have had three deadlines this week.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications said he would act swiftly and decisively.  I understand the meeting which was to take place at 12 o'clock has not begun and people have been left on standby.  Worker and other directors are bemused and shattered that this could be allowed to continue.  The Government seems to be trying to construct a gallows to allow a hanging.  A hanging is not dignified in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>The incompetence of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has been one of the hallmarks of the Government.  His continuation in office is testimony to the leadership qualities of the Taoiseach.  The Minister's bungling attempts to manage the semi-State sector beggar belief.  As a former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, it has been terrible to see that for 11 weeks that Minister did not interfere in the controversy at Bord na Móna.  He said it was a board matter and would await the board's considerations before acting.  This week he finally awakened from his slumber and moved centre stage in the best traditions of his fruitless tenure.  In avoiding his responsibilities up to now, he has shown a blatant disregard for 2,000 families in the midlands area who depend on Bord na Móna for their livelihoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were promised swift and decisive action on Tuesday.  The Minister told us we would have a final decision by <Col N="857" /> Thursday afternoon.  It is now Friday and the board is still dithering over whether it will meet, and if it will have a motion on which to vote.  Who is running the board?  Is it the chairman or the Minister?  The board reached a conclusion in the early hours of Tuesday morning.  Its resolution was given to the Minister by the chairman, Mr. Dineen, who had absented himself on legal advice from the board's deliberations on this issue.  Given that the only account the Minister received on Monday's board meeting was from someone whose objectivity is so compromised that he received legal advice not to participate, the Minister's decision not to accept the board's findings, following a briefing by a compromised chairman, demonstrates extreme prejudice on his part.  This mess represents the Minister's stock in trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement to the Dáil on Tuesday informed us that he found the board's resolution unsatisfactory.  By what criteria?  The only intelligent way to interpret the Minister's statement is that he had a different expectation and he wanted a different result.  One can only conclude the Minister wants the board to provide him with the ammunition with which he can justify dumping the managing director.  With the Minister's record of tender and respectful treatment of State boards I believe this pressure was deliberately exerted to try to shift those who, after 11 weeks of careful consideration, were immovable in their support for the managing director. The only thanks they got from the Minister for their efforts was a suggestion that they had shirked their responsibilities.  So much for the rhetoric about respecting the independence of State boards and advocating the strict commercialisation of the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The jibe about shirking rsponsibilities is clear evidence the Minister has had a predetermined outcome in mind all along.  It is also evidence of his growing impatience with the board which remains steadfast against providing a head on a plate &mdash; to recall the infamous <Col N="858" /> phrase used by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, on another undignified occasion &mdash; regardless of the evidence.</P>
    <P>What has been the result of the Minister's gutless display of his now well renowned bully-boy tactics?  It was the board's position three days ago that there may have been a breach of the guidelines.  In addition, the absence of censure against Mr. O'Connor in its resolution could only be interpreted as signalling the conclusion by the board that such a breach, although denied by Mr. O'Connor and the former chairman, Mr. Halligan, was authorised.  It was for the board, with the necessary accounting and legal advice, to get the answers and report to the Minister.  Any board which has considered this matter for 11 weeks, culminating in a 13 hour meeting on Monday, would have done so as thoroughly as it could.</P>
    <P>The Minister's 13 questions now appear to have moved this board closer to his personal agenda.  It should not go unnoticed by the House that so devious is this Minister that the five questions he told the Dáil on Tuesday would have to be answered by the board did not appear in the list of 13 questions subsequently addressed to the board.  So unsuitable has this Minister become in the past 12 months, he sees his role as changing from Steve Silvermint to revelling in his new position as the political Pierrepoint of this Administration.</P>
    <P>The Government's cowardice and incompetence in dealing with this problem is best demonstrated by the clear indication to it under the Turf Development Act, 1946 which states that the managing director holds office at the discretion of the Government.  If the Government chooses to remove him, it can only do so under statute on the basis of stated misconduct or incapacity and it is obliged to lay in writing before each House of the Oireachtas the reasons for any such action.  Mr. O'Connor is a capable person but the Government's problem has been to try to convince the public he should be dismissed on the basis of misconduct in circumstnaces where Mr. Halligan, the former chairman of <Col N="859" /> the company, has confirmed to the present board that there was an agreement with the managing director and that the agreement was authorised by the board.</P>
    <P>There are members of this board who will not accept any further intimidation and pressure from anybody.  They have discharged their duties honourably and fairly.  The Minister and the Government must make up its mind without a no confidence motion being passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to present a revised Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the House.  The estimated gross expenditure for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Vote 31, for 1996 is £663.796 million.  This represents a 15 per cent increase over the provisional outturn for last year. When appropriations-in-aid are taken into account, the net expenditure for this year is £376,063 million.  This does not include either the FEOGA guarantee measures, which are fully funded by the EU budget, or the capital cost of operating intervention and other market support schemes.  Total expenditure under these headings in 1995 amounted to approximately £1.2 billion and a similar level of expenditure is expected this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate I am presenting today differs in one significant respect from that published in the revised Estimates for the public service for 1996, which I presented to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy on 6 June.  On that occasion, a number of committee members were critical of the Estimates procedure because they felt the Estimate, which was in accordance with normal practice presented in abridged form to Dáil Éireann on 18 December last year and adjusted prior to the budget on 23 January, no longer reflected current realities.  I have accordingly added the sum of £50 million to the Vote for my Department in this revised Estimate to meet part of the <Col N="860" /> cost of the Commission's disallowances &mdash; commonly known as the beef fines. This can be seen in subhead L2, market intervention losses by deficiency, which, in the published revised Estimates for the public service contains a token amount of only £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>This £50 million was already included in the overall budgetary figures but not in my Department's Vote as there was a contingency provision of £50 million. This relates to events in 1991.  The reason there was nothing included in my Vote was because it was not known how large the final disallowance would be. As regards that disallowance, it is now £71.982 million, which is £24 million less than that originally proposed by the Commission.  It was divided into two main categories, £50.8 million for general beef storage and £18.4 million for multiple tendering for beef intervention. While the disallowance represents a reduction of some £24 million, the Government has decided to mount a legal challenge to the specific multiple tendering fine of £18.4 million.  A figure of £3 million would be more accurate as there was no economic gain to this country.  The Government has also decided to appeal the general beef storage fine on the basis of independent advice from senior counsel on the grounds that the Commission did not carry out an assessment to quantify the level of loss.  While there were undoubtedly problems, we consider that fine excessive and the appeal will go before the European Court of Justice in due course.</P>
    <P>The year 1995 was an excellent year with an increase of 8 per cent in farm incomes, but that is unlikely to be repeated this year.  Last year was an outstanding year for milk producers with an increase in output of 5.6 per cent, while pig production increased by 16 per cent and cereals increased in value terms by 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>A BSE compensatory package was negotiated on 26 June.  The general share-out of that scheme will result in an increase of £19 in the ten and 22 <Col N="861" /> month male beef premiums and an increase of £22.40 in the suckler cow premium.  The national envelope is £13.3 million and in indicative broad terms I intend to allocate £8 million of that to an increase in the deseasonalisation premium from 20 March to 8 June in the order of £50.  Some of the animals that qualify for that grant will also qualify for an extra £19 under the 1995 special beef premium.  I also intend to allocate a further £5 million to a scheme covering female animals, including heifers and so on.  Undoubtedly that will involve administrative obstacles and I welcome submissions from Deputies as to the best way to proceed as a DSP-type system is not in place.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Presidency compromise on the deseasonalisation premium for the future are favourable to Ireland. The trigger for the period 1 September until end November will be 35 per cent. If the benefit is triggered in the Republic, the North will also gain.  That is a new provision.  Previously the threshold was 40 per cent and we have gone under that level.  Taking an average of last year's slaughterings, the island average would have decreased to 34 per cent.  We got that concession as part of the price package.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L1 the provision of £19.35 for market intervention was framed at a time when intervention beef was thought to be a thing of the past. There is a prospect of not only a major intervention requirement for the autumn, and there is already some beef intervention activity, but also considerable resumed purchasing of butter and skimmed milk powder for storage. While markets may recover, we must sell 500,000 animals between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I hope to visit Libya on 15 and 16 July.  I am pleased contracts with Australians and others have unravelled and there is an opportunity to export to those markets.  The best case scenario would be to export 100,000 animals there and to export 100,000 animals to Egypt, but that level of exports may not be achieved.  That would leave 300,000 <Col N="862" /> animals in a shrinking market and the backlog would be more difficult to deal with on an monthly basis because of stockpiles building up in the Continent. Our biggest customer is Russia, but the more beef that is put into intervention, the more customers, like the Russians, will pull back and stop buying from a member state, opting to buy intervention beef.  While one may gain from intervention in the short term, one will lose in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Now that we hold the Presidency of the EU, I have discussed the matter with some of my European colleagues and I am extremely concerned about the prospect for the autumn and the remainder of this year.  The market position is difficult and there could be an over supply of 20 per cent of beef, which is unprecedented in the beef regime.  I have set up a group in my Department to consider the strategy I have outlined as well a system of traceability and guaranteeing Irish food and all that needs to be done in that regard. However, there is a short term market difficulty and under the present intervention rules certain markets are inaccessible. I have had major discussions with Commissioner Fischler who has said he has budgetary difficulties.  This matter will need priority political attention, not only by our Government but by European Governments.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C2 there is a provision of £49.7 million for ERAD.  Last year we carried out a review of the effectiveness of the TB and brucellosis eradication scheme and a restructured scheme was launched on 1 April of this year.  The new arrangements place an onus on the farmer to arrange and pay for the first herd test.  The State will carry the administrative and operational cost of the scheme, the costs of any additional herd test required during the year and compensation costs.  While farmers will be liable for additional testing costs of £14 million per year, they will be offset by a reduction in the levies of £10 million per annum.  The TB forum is meeting and while there are always disagreements on compensation <Col N="863" /> and so on, there will be a net reduction in gross expenditure of £7 million.  That is being applied to REPS.  I have secured agreement from the Minister for Finance to allocate an additional £8 million to REPS.  I had talks this morning and I hope that the dispute with IMPACT will be resolved early next week.  I am concerned about REPS, particularly the large number of problems with compliance and the validity of farm plans on second year inspections. At a time when farmers need money, that problem has the potential to cause considerable difficulties and I am considering introducing overtime and additional staff resources to deal with REPS as many dry stock farmers need those payments.</P>
    <P>The national development strategy on food in terms of Forbairt and so on is progressing well.  Subhead H1 refers to the provision of £7.075 million for grant aid to An Bord Bia.  That represents the normal Exchequer contribution to the board and aid towards promotional costs.  However, taking account of EU funds of £9.541 million, that brings An Bord Bia's income from public funds this year to £16.616 million, I compliment An Bord Bia which has set an ambitious target of increasing Irish food and drink exports from £4.3 billion in 1994 to £7 billion in 1999.  The Horizons Food Fair organised by An Bord Bia was generally acknowledged as a success, with the largest ever assembly of food buyers and retailers in Ireland.  I compliment the staff and all those involved in organising the fair.  A comprehensive programme of activities and services focused on red meat and beef, in particular, will be required for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>For the first time the Vote for Forestry has been merged with that for Agriculture and Food.  The provision in the Vote for Forestry amounts to £58.5 million and subhead L covers grant assistance, mainly for afforestation.  The sum of £9.2 million is provided in subhead M7 for the promotion of forestry development under the terms of the <Col N="864" /> Operational Programme for Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99.  I received these extra funds for training, harvesting equipment, woodland improvement and reconstitution for which substantial grant assistance will be made available.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that on Monday last I launched the first ever national strategy to develop our forestry sector over the next 40 years.  This will be of particular interest to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, since your county has the highest level of afforestration nationwide.  With 8 per cent only of our land planted, we have by far the lowest level of afforestration in Europe.  Our target is to increase that to 17 per cent. Some one million acres of land could yield a better economic return from forestry than from agriculture.  This strategy and framework deals with the A to Z of forestry, everything from yield class to obtain quality output, to a minimum of two species, to obtain a broad planting target to 60 per cent Sitka spruce, 20 per cent other conifers and 20 per cent broad leaf.  To attain forestry development compatible with the environment we have doubled the planting distance from the road, ten metres, from houses, 30 metres, so that the light around people's homes will not be diminished by this type of forestry development.</P>
    <P>What we are really talking about is an investment of EU and national funds at a ratio of 75:25, of £3.1 billion, for a country with practically the best climate for forestry production and no tax.  The most durable, viable form of alternative enterprise to agriculture, at present experiencing difficulties in milk and meat, is forestry.  While this policy is not very popular in some areas, it is the best investment farmers can make.  Most important of all, it will create 11,000 downstream jobs, increasing from 16,000 to 27,000 in wood products and in the sawmilling sector.</P>
    <P>We have also addressed the issue of Coillte and its future.  We are endeavouring to develop an asset of £1 billion for the taxpayer.  A future Government <Col N="865" /> can decide the best way to handle that asset and obtain maximum return for the taxpayer.  We are focusing on improving its bottom line performance, on future planting, mostly by way of farm forestry, on farmers planting their worst land, thereby obtaining greater output from the remainder of their land. We have said that, if a satisfactory sales agreement is reached for the likes of sawmillers, who are experiencing difficulty in getting saw log at a reasonable price, a new transparent system can be put in place, to which end I have had discussions this week with the Irish Timber Council and Coillte Teo.  The bottom line is that, if Coillte is prepared to agree to a satisfactory arrangement, I would be positively disposed to allowing it some shareholding in the sawmilling sector.  However, it is a carrot and stick exercise in so far as we must reach a balanced agreement that will allow our timber processors, such as Woodfab &mdash; in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency &mdash; and others, who have been experiencing problems, greater opportunity to develop.  We must establish a satisfactory basis, leaving it open to the highest bidder, but resulting in a transparent system, fairly operated so that we can operate internationally.</P>
    <P>Another scheme for which demand has exploded is the early retirement scheme for which a provision of in excess of £40 million is being provided this year under subhead L5, the pension rate having increased this year from 1 January by 2.8 per cent.  By the end of last year more than 3,700 farmers received pensions, the present average being £9,300 per annum for up to a decade, a corresponding number of young farmers having been allocated land resulting from the provisions of that scheme.  While the average farm size released under the scheme is 21 hectares, after enlargement, this has increased to almost 50 hectares.  I am confident the implementation of this scheme will contribute significantly to the general structural improvement of Irish farms while helping to maintain a farm population. <Col N="866" /> Farm investment is dealt with in subheads M1 and M2 &mdash; the overall matter of control of farmyard pollution, the farm improvement programme and so on.  This year and next year we have allocated extra resources to deal with the unprecedented demand for grants for these purposes, to the extent that we had to suspend the submission of applications last year.  Subhead M2 covers a further year of the milk subsidised restructuring scheme.  Some £2 million have been made available for a subsidy of between forty pence and fifty pence per gallon, for small producers who need it to have access to quota.  There are many more comments I could make about headage payments and so on.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis is the single, most serious problem to have affected the common agricultural policy since its inception more than 30 years ago.  The gravity and importance of it to our economy cannot be understated.  As we face into a difficult autumn I assure the House I will give this matter priority, endeavouring to reopen markets, to get compensation paid and ensure that intervention and export refunds are satisfactory.  The Government will leave no stone unturned to ensure that this, our vital national economic interest, is properly protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to respond to this interesting, constructive debate.  This type of debate provides Members an opportunity to review the year's economic and budgetary position, to set the scene for the remainder of the year and into the following one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key, central goal of all economic and budgetary policy is to enhance the economy's capacity to grow, to achieve the maximum sustainable rate of growth in output and employment.  All aspects of the Government's economic policy are directed at that aim, at promoting economic performance.  A Government's record on growth is arguably the best single yardstick for measuring the success or failure of economic policy.  If <Col N="867" /> Government policy in different areas contributes to solid growth for the economy overall, it is a mark of the general soundness of policy in those different areas.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has already outlined the Government's achievements on the economic and fiscal front. He has pointed to the fact that the indicators show clearly that our economy is in its strongest position for many years. I will not repeat all the points the Ministers made but will underline one factor: by reference to the most important standard of all, the rate of growth, our economy is among the strongest within the European Union and the industrialised world.  I too pay tribute to previous Governments.  This type of economic growth did not occur within the space of a year or two but is the consequence of a consistent policy practised by Governments over the current decade.</P>
    <P>The latest Central Statistics Office figures show that Ireland's gross domestic product grew by 10 per cent last year.  Even allowing for international receipts and payments, in particular for the fact that repatriation of profits by multinational firms may change the picture, we are still looking at growth in gross national product of more than 7 per cent.  This performance ranks best within Europe and is one of the best within the entire industralised world. Many Members who contributed to this debate appeared to have lost sight of this growth record and the obvious conclusion to be drawn from it, namely, that the Government's approach is working effectively.  This strong economic growth has not occurred by accident but is the result of the careful work of Government in the preparation of recent budgets as well as on the public expenditure Estimates we now debate.</P>
    <P>Government policy has been consistent with budgetary, monetary and exchange rate policy underpinning our overall economic strategy.  We have a record of solid achievement on all of those fronts.  At home and abroad the <Col N="868" /> Government's approach has been strongly endorsed.  Whenever I travel to Brussels or elsewhere I hear more plaudits of our performance than at home.  I suppose that is the nature of politics here, if not elsewhere.  The business and investment confidence this strategy has promoted, in turn, has supported continued growth within our economy.</P>
    <P>Naturally, not all contributors to this debate focused on the success of the Government's economic policies. Nevertheless, a growth rate of 10 per cent in gross domestic product speaks for itself and requires no defence.</P>
    <P>While stressing what has been achieved in economic growth, I do not deny that many important, very difficult challenges lie ahead, principally the very intractable and difficult problem of unemployment, the main social challenge we face in common with many of our European Union partners, which is why the Government places employment at the top of its list of priorities during its Presidency of the EU.  By securing the continued strong development of the economy, the Government is working to solve the problem in the most effective way, namely, by creating sustainable employment.  For many years there was much comment to the effect that Ireland seemed to be locked into a cycle of jobless growth &mdash; the economy is growing but it was felt that this was not being translated into employment on a significant scale.  The implication was that even when the economy grew we would have to reconcile ourselves to the fact that large numbers of jobs could not be created. We are at last seeing a significant increase in employment.  The labour force survey, which is the most accurate barometer, shows a substantial increase in the number of jobs in 1994-95.  That is being continued this year.</P>
    <P>Since the major economic indicators clearly show the success of the Government's approach, criticism is being directed at other areas.  In today's debate, for example, a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy McCreevy, argued that the Government <Col N="869" /> has not exercised proper control over spending, the implication being that our record on this score undermines our achievements elsewhere.  However, the fact that under this Government GDP growth has reached 10 per cent cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>Leaving this aside, criticism of the Government's record on spending is misdirected.  The rate of growth in spending is at its lowest level since 1989. Most of the criticism has centred on a difference of about 0.5 per cent but, although we did not achieve exactly what we set out to achieve, we have maintained low levels of public expenditure growth.</P>
    <P>We have also provided resources for important priority programmes such as health, education and social welfare and continued to advance taxation reform. Most important, the Government has done this while ensuring that the Exchequer borrowing requirement remained at a low level.  Recent figures indicate that the borrowing requirement is about £150 million below the budget day figure.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Maastricht Treaty, Ireland and Luxembourg are the only EU members that, to date, meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria. That record does not need to be defended, and we intend to continue down that road.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to give the House the impression that the Government is in any way complacent about the future. I am particularly aware that between now and the end of the year the Government will have to consider expenditure plans for 1997 and the medium term and, in the light of those plans, frame the 1997 budget.  This will not be a simple task.  Deputy McCreevy is right to harp on public expenditure. What has happened in relation to BSE, health and law and order, places expenditure pressures on the Government which have to be handled.  We must have regard, however, to the constraints we have set ourselves in regard to the public finances as well as those set out <Col N="870" /> in the Maastricht Treaty.  The Government will also have to provide for continued social development.  The recent serious concern we have all felt about crime shows how important this is.</P>
    <P>Progress on taxation reform must be maintained and accelerated.  That will be a central focus in the negotiations which it is hoped will develop in the autumn on a new national agreement, because the concept of serious tax reduction, particularly in personal taxation, will be an important element.  The Government is determined that the budget and economic policy will continue to support the growth of the economy, increased investment and additional employment.  It is also determined that this will be done within the parameters which have governed its policy to date.</P>
    <P>All the speakers mentioned the issue of law and order which has been well ventilated today and during the past few weeks in this House.  One aspect of that which the Taoiseach has asked me to take charge relates to speeding up the construction of new prisons.  I intend to devote myself to that task in the most efficient and cost effective way.</P>
    <P>The sooner the public squabbling in Bord na Móna is brought to an end the better and I hope that will happen today.</P>
    <P>On the peace process, I have been privileged to be involved for the past three weeks in the detailed negotiations under way in Belfast.  The work is at the preliminary stage of agreeing rules of procedure.  There was a conflict between rules of procedure and the ground rules enshrined in the legislation.  However, the issue is being resolved, although it is slow and frustrating work.  It is hardly necessary to tell the three ex-Ministers on the other side of the House that there are nine parties and two Governments involved, many from diametrically different sides of the argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot run the show here with three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must hope there <Col N="871" /> will be a tenth party.  It is not surprising that when nine parties and two Governments sit down together to speak about the most difficult problems facing the nation that progress would be slow initially.  However, as an indication to the House of the attitude of the parties yesterday the chairman got agreement to an intensive schedule of meetings through to the end of July, and agreement to a level of participation during the month of August.  Therefore, the notion that these negotiations would cease for a long holiday is mistaken. These discussions will go on intensively every week through to the end of July and, at a lower level, during August with full resumption in the first week of September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Governments felt it important not to break off negotiations next week.  It was suggested that the marching season might not be the right time to meet, but the feeling was that if we marked the marching season by a decision not to speak we would be adding to tensions that might exist, and that was an important signal to send. The performance of the chairman, former Senator George Mitchell, has been <Col N="872" /> quite exceptional.  He has shown himself to be a man of great ingenuity, of extraordinary patience and great ability, and his two co-chairmen no less so.  The general atmosphere between the parties has been one of determination to listen to one another in a relatively friendly atmosphere, and given the background of some of those parties, that is an important sign for the future.  Although progress has been slow and somewhat frustrating, the atmosphere is cordial, if not always perfect and the chairmanship has been excellent.  There is hope in what is happening.  I agree with Deputy Ahern; we all hope that the party which is not yet there will find it possible to be there.</P>

    <Title>Report on Strategy for Enterprise in 21st Century: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the opportunity to have a debate on this worthwhile report because, for the first time, we have set out a long-term perspective on what we, as a nation, can achieve, the potential of enterprise, and how we can adjust and adapt enterprise to achieve real results. The report sets out very significant targets that could be reached over the next 15 years if we make sensible decisions, for example to increase employment by 310,000 as it estimates, to halve unemployment, to cut long-term unemployment to 50,000, to increase the level of GNP per head from 65 per cent of the EU level to 100 per cent and to raise the quality of life of our people across the whole range of indicators of success of our economy and society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have set more ambitious targets in the area of employment.  We are entering a period where the very high level of labour force entrants currently running at 23,000 plus, and which will continue for the next five to ten years, will begin to fall off towards the end of the period.  If anything, we could achieve more on the employment front than the target set.  However, the precise <Col N="875" /> targets are not that important.  What is important is that it sets a vision for our enterprise, what can be achieved, setting out important goals as to where we can go if we have consensus, if we are willing to make difficult decisions at times about tough policy options.  We have achieved a tremendous amount in recent years through consensus in the community to make employment our number one priority.  In recent years there has been a dramatic improvement across a number of indicators.  For example, by the end of 1996 we will, in just three years, have created an additional 122,000 jobs.  That is more than a 10 per cent increase in the numbers at work in just three years which is unprecedented in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>According to the labour force survey measures, we will have achieved a drop of 47,000 in unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the live register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That will constitute a 21 per cent reduction in unemployment, from 15.6 per cent to 11.7 per cent. There will be a dramatic 4 per cent reduction in three years in the rate of unemployment.  Comparing the comparable figures across Europe, we are close to the European average, there has been a dramatic transformation of our economy on employment performance.</P>
      <P>We have also achieved dramatic improvement in other areas.  We have brought down our debt ratio over a sustained period.  In 1987 our debt ratio was at 125 per cent of GNP and we have brought that to 81 per cent.  This is a dramatic improvement because we have been willing, as a society, to put other matters second to our main priority of getting a sound financial base for employment performance and focusing on employment growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is &mdash; and this is very important at a time when we are coming to the renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; that <Col N="876" /> not only have we attained those very significant achievements on employment and public finances we have been able to translate it into take-home pay for ordinary workers.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to look at what happened in the seven years before and after 1987.  In the seven years before 1987 on paper there were significant pay increases.  An increase of 100 per cent in gross pay was achieved but this was eroded by the ravages of inflation to the point there was a decline in real terms of 20 per cent.  A further slice was absorbed in tax with the result that take-home pay fell by 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the seven years since 1987 there has been a degree of consensus about the way in which the economy should be managed and much lower increases have been accepted.  An increase of 36 per cent has been achieved, one third of the figure achieved in the seven years before 1987.  Because inflation has modified gross pay has increased by 12 per cent in real terms while take-home or disposable income has increased by 22 per cent.  This represents substantial growth.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that consensus on a set of objectives has worked in the economy in the past eight to ten years and can work again.  What Forfás has stated is that there are exciting opportunities to be grasped in the next 15 years if we build consensus on key objectives.  That is a key element and what makes this report so important.</P>
    <P>It is time to take stock.  We are by no means perfect and Forfás warns against complacency about our economic performance. We all recognise that long-term unemployment is a serious problem. It continues at a high level by comparison with other European countries.</P>
    <P>The report identifies the key forces of change to which we will have to adapt and with which we will have to grapple in the next 15 years, given that we want to achieve the goal of full employment and higher living standards.  In this respect serious challenges confront us.</P>
    <P>We can no longer talk about a home and overseas market &mdash; this is no secret <Col N="877" /> to those who have been following the debate in this House and elsewhere &mdash; as if the two do not cross over.  There are now world markets.  Companies quite happily switch sources from one continent to another.  We are truly competing in a global marketplace where one has to be competitive and produce quality goods in order to survive.</P>
    <P>Another major factor that will affect performance over the next 15 years is the rapid rate of technological change, including product innovation.  What is also significant is that it is diffusing much more rapidly.  There was a time when technology was developed in the high income countries of the west while the low income countries, perhaps in the Far East, lagged way behind.  The position has changed dramatically.  In the space of ten years countries such as Korea have moved from the bottom to the top of the league.  They are at the leading edge.</P>
    <P>In the next 15 years &mdash; I suspect Deputy O'Rourke would agree with this &mdash; of far more importance to our economic survival will be the quality of our human resources rather than fixed assets such as plant and machinery.  It is increasingly obvious that the companies which succeed are not the ones with huge balance sheets but the ones which have developed their human resources and which have flexible and innovative work forces which respond rapidly to change.  This is underpinned by training and education systems.  They have the vision to use people of quality.</P>
    <P>Another major factor is that with the convergence of technologies such as telecommunications equipment and computers there is an information revolution which will transform the way we work and the way all businesses operate. The challenge is to ensure we are in a position to seize the opportunities and minimise the threat presented by all these forces of change.</P>
    <P>The key question is how can we achieve and sustain competitive advantage in this rapidly changing world.  It involves much more than competitive cost structures.  While we have to be <Col N="878" /> aware of labour, power and telecommunications costs, services which are important in terms of our ability to compete, the determining factor will be how successful we are as an innovative economy in making creative use of people's talents and in getting companies and individuals to buy the notion of life-long learning.  It is the qualities and skills people possess that determine the extent to which they are successful.</P>
    <P>We have been slow to adopt such an approach.  The House will be familiar with the figures which show that there has been under-investment by Irish companies in training and human resources development by comparison with other countries.  The House will be aware also that people in this country, once they leave the formal education and training system, are much less likely to avail of second and third education opportunities.  There is a need for a major change in outlook.</P>
    <P>Forfás has identified the critical infrastructure and areas which have not always been seen as being of importance to enterprise.  They include education. This will have a bearing on how successful we are in the next 15 years.  Many see this as a conflict and argue that education will be dragged down a barren stony road if it tries to serve the needs of enterprise.  The position is changing dramatically.  Companies will fail if they are not creative and innovative and do not allow their employees to work in teams and to be enterprising.  They must be allowed to develop their full personality. Similarly, an education system which does not teach people to be innovative and enterprising in the workplace is failing those who participate in it.</P>
    <P>Other areas will be of equal importance. More and more the quality of our environment is a key resource in terms of our competitiveness.  Telecommunications is another key element of infrastructure.  There is a valuable section in the report dealing with logistics, covering the combination of the transport system to deliver solutions and allow products to be transported <Col N="879" /> from one location to another on time in the cheapest possible way.  This is not just a question of hardware but also of software and the necessary skills required in managing the system.  This presents a challenge.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the need for stronger and more effective competition laws.  The House dealt with this matter recently when significant improvements were made to our competition law.  We also need a competitive and efficient capital market.  In this respect the report points to an equity gap.  Small and emerging companies find it difficult to get their hand on venture capital at reasonable rates.  The capital market should channel savings into employment creating enterprises.</P>
    <P>The labour market must also operate efficiently.  As we all recognise, our tax and welfare system as they have evolved in recent years have conspired to create problems within the labour market. There are incomes above which it does not pay to receive an increase in salary or work hours.  It does not pay certain categories to seek work because they would lose benefits and incur losses. The Government will continue to address this issue in an effort to create a more effective and flexible labour market where there are no obstacles to people taking up work opportunities.</P>
    <P>The report identifies the key policy themes which need to be developed.  It focuses on the importance of an enterprise culture where it is respectable to be in enterprise and create profit and of a system which removes barriers and encourages competiveness.  I support the identification of the services sector as the unsung hero of employment performance in the past and the key to employment development in the future.  Forfás predicts that 85 per cent of employment created over the next 15 years will be in the services sector.  It proposes a threefold dimension for the interaction of the State with services. The bottom grade is made up of the traditional services in the home market. Obviously the State cannot subsidise <Col N="880" /> one player as opposed to another and it must facilitate a competitive environment and provide information and advice to those setting up in this sector. The second grade, which should have a higher level of support, is made up of services which have the potential to be innovative, grow and find overseas markets, while the upper grade, which should have the highest level of support, is made up of internationally traded services which trade virtually 100 per cent overseas.  I broadly agree with that philosophy which will be one of the themes developed in the strategy paper on services which I hope to publish later in the year.</P>
    <P>The report focuses on the problems of indigenous manufacturing and the need for companies in this sector to reposition their products.  Too much of our traditional indigenous manufacturing is in low margin business which trades into the UK market where it is too exposed to competition from low cost countries.  Companies in this sector need to reposition their products, build scale in Irish enterprises and underpin this development with profitability.  Forbairt has pointed out the need to focus on companies which have the capacity to grow and create high value markets for themselves.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the need for us to be at the leading edge of human resource development and to produce quality people who will provide innovative solutions to problems in the market place.  It also states that we need to help the many people who left school without the necessary qualifications to build up their skills so that they are equipped to meet the demands of the market place.  This is a major challenge which must be underpinned with much innovative thinking, which is already beginning to emerge.  In this context, the innovative training opportunities offered by the local employment service need to be further developed.  This is a theme which will be developed in the White Paper on human resource development which I hope to publish later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The other key elements addressed in the report are the need for lower levels of taxes and a reformed tax structure. Forfás recognises that this is a controversial area and that there are wider dimensions to designing a tax structure than simply looking at the needs of enterprise.  Obviously consideration must also be given to equity, fairness and what people regard as acceptable. The report clearly underlines the need for a tax structure which will give people the incentive to be enterprising and which rewards enterprise and work.</P>
    <P>The report identifies innovation as a key dimension in helping us develop as a country.  Most Deputies will not be surprised to learn that we underinvest in research and development compared to other countries.  The level of investment in this area has been increased in recent years but it is still too low.  We need to focus more clearly on research and development in the creation of a successful enterprise culture.  The STIAC report dealt with this issue in detail and pointed out the necessary changes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is working on this area.</P>
    <P>The report outlines the need for a proper framework for assessing the competitiveness of the economy.  This is a crucially important theme which I hope to work on in the near future in the development of a proper structure for increasing competitiveness.  The trend nowadays is for companies to measure their competitiveness against that of others and as a country we must measure our competitiveness against that of other countries.  In recent years our ranking on the world competitive list has dropped.  We maintained our ranking this year but it is still not good enough if we are to be a key player in world competitiveness.  It is, therefore, very important to monitor our competitiveness across a range of measures. Competitiveness is not only about labour costs, it is also about innovation, education systems, the capacity to bring new products to markets, the way we manage resources etc.  This will be very important element in the future and I <Col N="882" /> am very keen to develop it in an ongoing way so that we have a continuous focus on the factors that matter.  The Culliton report developed this to some extent and it is now time to develop it further so that we can cope with the challenges facing us over the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>The report is a worthwhile contribution to the debate on economic policy. It is timely that it should be published when we are moving into the next round of negotiations on where we are going as a country, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, levels of payments etc.  All these matters will be determined by the challenges facing us, including tangible challenges such as the economic and monetary union and the disciplines that will impose on us.  Forfás does not regard the report as an A to Z policy prescription and it wants a vibrant debate on the challenges facing us over the next 15 years so that there is consensus on important issues such as telecommunications, the services sector, innovation, human resource development, world class logistics, a reformed and effective tax structure and the need to harness the opportunities thrown up by an information society.</P>
    <P>The Government must make its plans against the wider backdrop of the 15-year challenge.  We will seize those opportunities and the White Paper on the services sector will take up this challenge. We have already appointed a group to the information society who will provide the Government with the key ingredients to take a lead in this crucial sector which the Forfás report underpins as the multi-lingual hub and the telecommunications sector for Ireland.  This report is welcome and I look forward to a debate on it.  It is important that we begin to shape our thinking about the opportunities that lie ahead in the next 15 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Forfás document <i>Shaping our Future: A Strategy for Enterprise in Ireland in the 21st Century.</i>  The cost of this document which extends to 302 pages is a cause of regret.  We have been supplied with a summary.  I welcome much of the report and the strategies the Minister has outlined.</P>
      <P>It is a source of concern and deep dismay that we are debating this report on a day when the unemployment figure on the live register stands at 8,000 higher than at the end of May of the same year, an increase of 3,800.  We are debating this report on an appropriate day when, sadly, the unemployment figures show a huge increase.  With the exception of the Minister, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and the official from the Department of Enterprise and Employment we are in an empty House debating the position of the long-term unemployed whose lives have been blighted.  This unacceptable number of long-term unemployed is the highest in Europe and remains unaccceptable for a country that holds the Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's strategy papers about which he has spoken were rubbished by media commentators &mdash; a little unfairly I would have thought.  The strategy papers being planned for the services sector, for training, human resources, management etc. and the paper, already published, which deals with long-term unemployment are acceptable as forward strategy.  For five years in the Department of Education when I started the debate on the Green Paper I maintained a hands-on day-to-day commitment to solving the difficulties, problems and challenges which beset the education sector at that time.  Any Minister worth his or her salt has a strategy. Without a vision for the Department one is leading, one may as well not <Col N="884" /> be in the business.  Clearly there is a need for a vision and that it be translated into strategy papers, documents, initiatives and so on.  I agree with all that because one has to leave a legacy to future Ministers.  I left the legacy of the Green Paper to the subsequent Ministers, Deputies Noel Davern, Séamus Brennan and the current Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach.  The White Paper bears many of the marks of the initial writing in 1990-91.  That is proper.  It provides the continuum and leads to sustained political leadership and development.  That does not take from the fact that the Minister should give sustained attention to the daily challenges and difficulties which beset his Department.  That is where the Minister and his two colleagues in the Department fall down because there is no political leadership on the issue of unemployment. There is a complete reliance on telling us we are the envy of Europe and the world does not know how we are doing it, that we have sustained high growth etc., all of the clichés that are meaningless to the huge number of people who are unemployed as evidenced by today's live register.  It is a social disgrace.</P>
    <P>As politicians we cannot say we are serving our citizens if we cannot put our hearts and our minds to settling and defining the unemployment problem. We must realise that the live register refers to a huge number of real people. The Minister may rubbish the live register if he wishes but the Government of which I was a member conducted our business having regard to the live register. We were content to do so and to realise that those who signed on were real people.  It is easy for us standing here in Dáil Éireann.  We should know from our daily dealings with constituents that there are untold tales of misery in real Ireland as distinct from the Ireland of &ldquo;spiralling growth rates&rdquo;, the pretend Ireland where we are the envy of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister commenced by referring to employment and unemployment.  In June 1995 there were 276,000 people <Col N="885" /> unemployed.  I recall a debate at that time on the Estimates when the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte asked for another year to make progress.  In June 1996 the number of people unemployed increased to 283,000.  during the Minister's year of stewardship at the Department of Enterprise and Employment the number of unemployed persons, as evidenced by the live register has jumped 7,000.  It is nonsense to talk about us being the envy of Europe.  We are not the envy of Europe, we are the shame of Europe as evidenced by the numbers unemployed here.</P>
    <P>I agree we need long-term strategies. The Minister has done well in plotting the long-term strategy but he must do much more and must have a hands-on sustained commitment dealing with the day to day difficulties and challenges of his Department, the chief one being the unacceptably high level of unemployment. The Minister is only scratching at the surface.  Any Minister who would say we have done remarkably well when unemployment levels have increased from 276,000 to 283,000 could only be living in wonderland.</P>
    <P>My request for this debate was granted, even though the Taoiseach said in a derisory manner that it was a matter for the Whips.  That was when he thought he was riding high.  In the past debates on such reports often did not take place for months or even years after their publication, but on this occasion it is taking place at least relatively close to the report's publication. It is unfortunate that we are dealing with it on the last day of the term, but I am pleased to know it will be taken again.</P>
    <P>The report proposes the establishment of more bodies and councils.  It proposes the establishment of a council on competitiveness.  While competitiveness is extremely important, it does not require another body to deal with it. The report does not dwell on the barriers to enterprise posed by the proliferation of agencies.  I have frequently advocated a reduction in the number of <Col N="886" /> such agencies.  I agree that in our time in Government the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Séamus Brennan, and I were party to a decision which led to a proliferation of agencies, but when we get back into Government my main task will be to abolish many of them.</P>
    <P>Now that Forfás has completed this major piece of work, it should cease to be a separate agency and become integrated with the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Its mission is complete.  The Department could then establish two policy divisions, one to deal with large businesses and another to deal with small or medium sized ones. The panoply of agencies is causing confusion and chaos and has resulted in the development of an internal market and competition between the agencies.  In many cases it has resulted in the waste of vast amounts of business people's time.</P>
    <P>Agencies offering to support businesses include Forfás, Forbairt, IDA Ireland, the Trade Board, An Bord Bia, FÁS, and so on.  There are 35 county enterprise boards, 35 area partnership boards and 36 Leader groups.  There are 150 State agencies dealing with enterprise matters and employing vast numbers of people.  The area development board structure employs in the region of 400 staff.  The county enterprise boards employ 140.  Forfás employs 120, Forbairt employs 813, IDA Ireland employs 275, SFADCo employs 194 and FAS employs 2,042, but they are nearly all chiefs, with very few indians.  There are 50 different EU and domestic sources of funding, eight Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility for enterprise under various guises.  Allied to this we have the Minister for Education's nonsensical decision to set up ten regional boards of education.  These will prove to be a paradise for procrastination and bunkers of bureaucracy, with the inevitable duplication, confusion and chaos for consumers and claimants.</P>
    <P>I support devolution but we live on a small island with a small population.  We <Col N="887" /> do not need an endless number of bodies catering for different areas of business. What happened to Government by Ministers and officials?  What happened to getting to grips with the job?  There are more quangos and more people and bureaucracy in the area of enterprise, but less service to the people.  People with business ideas submit applications to all these agencies for fear they might lose out on some form of funding.  The manner in which enterprise is dealt with is farcical.  If it were not so serious it would be comical.  In a regional office of IDA-Forbairt there is rivalry about who should deal with clients who telephone the office who merely want to know if their initiatives are worth while and if they would get funding for them.  I know the Minister partly agrees with me in this regard.  The decision to set up ten new regional boards of education will not improve the curricula or provide better access to education of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>I have argued for the streamlining of agencies and the establishment of a &ldquo;one door to enterprise&rdquo; concept in each county, but the Minister's response is to commission further studies and reports.  He is in the grip of consultants. I accept that if he is to fulfil his remit as a Minister a certain amount of strategy work must involve devising strategic policies, but that should not happen at the expense of dealing with daily challenges. He should not close his ears to the cries for help from the large number of unemployed people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has commissioned 35 studies from consultants at a cost of £1.4 million and many more are pending, with the cost increasing each time.  Dozens of studies and reports are ongoing in the Department.  The only decisions being taken by the Minister are those to commission further studies.  A total of £21 million has been allocated in the Book of Estimates for consultants throughout all Government Departments, an increase of 20 per cent on 1995.  That is only the tip of the iceberg and does not take account of the <Col N="888" /> amount spent by agencies such as Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland, which between them spend approximately £2 million annually on consultants' reports. That is nonsensical.  Forfás commissioned 19 background studies for the report before us.  I am concerned that this document will lead to another raft of studies.  I agree with the Minister's proposal to carry out a study on the services sector, in which he has had a keen interest since his time in Opposition.</P>
    <P>What has happened to decision-making? Why do Ministers not go into their offices each day, make a number of decisions and carry through on them? Although I had a teaching background, I was at sea for some months when I was first appointed Minister.  I experienced trouble at first although I pulled myself out of it.  I never forgot that I was in charge and that it was up to me to take decisions on a daily basis.  What happened to decision-making?  Has it disappeared with the consensus of the three parties in Government?  Politically, that is clearly leading to a stultification of decision making.  No one can take a decision because it might hurt the feelings, ethos or ideology of somebody in one of the other Government parties. The justice area is a clear example of that.  I have frequently said that the instincts of the Minister for Justice are right yet they cannot be implemented because neither the Minister for Social Welfare nor the Tánaiste must be upset. For that reason, the Taoiseach refused to talk about bail and would not let the matter raise its ugly head.</P>
    <P>When the Castlerea Prison issue arose I remember the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, saying on television there are other ways of dealing with crime.  There are, but they involve much social work and rehabilitation which must go in tandem with penal servitude: you cannot have one without the other.  The Castlerea Prison project was cut because at the time it suited the Government to get a ready amount of money.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance plaintively asked what the remedies <Col N="889" /> were for more State spending.  I advocate dropping the ten proposed regional education boards.  They will be paradises of procrastination amounting to a huge bureaucratic colossus requiring several million pounds, yet no one will gain more access to education because of them.  That is my party's suggestion for the Government if it wants to find extra funding but that Minister and his party had to be kept tranquil at all costs, otherwise they might kick up and we must not rock the boat.</P>
    <P>Politically, it is always put to us that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, experienced difficulties.  It may well be there were but at least we did things.  With this Government it seems that passivity, engendered by the wish not to rock the boat, is leading to inaction and we have seen the results all around us.  We have seen chaos in the Department of Justice and in the unemployment figures.  We have also seen chaos caused by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry.  If I were Deputy Lowry I would never get out of bed because the minute he wakes up in the morning and puts his foot on the ground he is a walking disaster as regards every area under his aegis.  It is no wonder he gave the Luas Bill to the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle.  At least she brought some sense to it.  The central targets of this report are clear.  They relate to the creation of 364,000 net new jobs in manufacturing &mdash; primarily in services, and I recognise the Minister's commitment to the services industry &mdash; leading to an unemployment rate of 6 per cent by the year 2010.  It is an ambitious target and I do not quarrel with it.  The Minister said earlier that he did not agree with targets, yet President Santer had laid out a clear target for Europe during his Presidency of the European Commission of halving European unemployment by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>For over a year I have called for targets to reduce long-term unemployment and to that I add the need to set such <Col N="890" /> targets for the unemployed generally. Rather than having what is regarded throughout the country as a platitudinous debate on the economy, we should set a specific target for reducing unemployment in the next six months.  If the Minister does not reach the target I will not criticise him if he has made some effort to reach it.  We have to do that, otherwise nothing will happen.</P>
    <P>It is right to place emphasis on the services sector where the potential is huge but the discrimination that has operated against it is also huge and those blockages need to be removed.  It is also good that the equation constructed puts such a strong emphasis on reducing unemployment, particularly long-term unemployed.  The report should have put this issue to the fore.  It is the biggest problem, with crime representing a vast waste of human resources and a loss of economic opportunity.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the local employment service in its 14 areas is a key to tackling the problem of long-term unemployment.  In any civilised society the best measure must be its ability to encourage enterprise so that employment is created for its citizens. That will be the test for us over the coming 15 years.  Half the unemployment rate is long-term and unless we take radical action that group will always be enormous.  We must take the steps now.</P>
    <P>Challenges are also posed in this document for business and trade unions. Business is expected to spend 3 per cent of payroll costs on continuous retraining as well as investing in research, development and technology.  Training will have to be in the ownership of the employers much more than it is now.</P>
    <P>The document pinpoints the weakness of indigenous industry and sets challenges for that sector as well as for the Government.  It has also emphasised the necessity for competitiveness of utilities such as Telecom Éireann. However, the deal which was masterminded by that arch-strategist, Deputy Lowry, would not make one <Col N="891" /> confident that the strategy will have anything to do with what will eventually emerge.  Trade unions are expected to look at the longer term and have a view of the employment objectives of this plan.</P>
    <P>What concerns me most about the report is that an exclusion factor is in operation.  Those in steering groups are very much the insiders.  The outsiders remain outside peeping in an odd time when the curtain is drawn back, but mostly it is drawn.  I am worried that this report reflects just one prescriptive dimension.</P>
    <P>We have to raise our sights to the future, looking at new markets and building links with South East Asia.  We have been divorced from that region as we are the only European country without a direct air link to it.  Luxembourg has extensive cargo links there and last month a direct air link opened between Lisbon and Asia.</P>
    <P>We are at a turning point in a new Europe.  Economic and monetary union is on a fast track and change is happening apace.  This document is important for that reason.  It is challenging, interesting and comprehensive but it must not be left to gather dust on a shelf.  It should not just become the basis for one thousand other reports.  Action must flow from the document.</P>
    <P>I am glad this debate has taken place because in the past such debates were delayed for months, if not years.  One argument I have about this report concerns the proliferation of agencies, the procrastination and the endless delays.</P>
    <P>I question the veracity of the growth rates which are trumpeted by the Government and which have also been trumpeted by previous Governments. Much of that growth is coming about through transfer pricing arrangements. Somebody should look at how these growth rates are measured and what they really mean.  If we have growth rates of 7 to 10 per cent we should have had a consequent drop in unemployment, yet we have not.  In many respects those growth rates are an illusion.  We <Col N="892" /> are living in a time when growth is mainly dependent upon transfer pricing arrangements and that was the case for previous Governments also.  Multinational transfer pricing arrangements allow the type of growth figures that feature daily and weekly in ERSI and other reports, but many of them are not for real.  We heard today that unemployment has increased by almost 8,000 &mdash; in June 1995 the figure was 276,000 and two years later it is 283,000.</P>

The manoeuvring process is starting for the next election. I notice the Fine Gael Party has started talking, as it always does coming up to a general election, about tax reform.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has had its opportunities in regard to tax reform.  It could have taken dramatic action, but it did nothing of the sort.  By the end of this <Col N="895" /> year, when the rainbow coalition has been in power for two years, it will have succeded in increasing the total tax take by £1.3 billion, income tax by £500 million and the tax burden on the hard-pressed PAYE sector by more than £400 million.  In just two years it will have driven up the tax bill by 12 per cent, in a period when inflation stood at 4 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy may not.  He will have an opportunity to <Col N="896" /> speak in a couple of minutes.  I welcome the remarks made by Deputy O'Rourke, a number of which I intended to make and, therefore, will not repeat at length.  The idea that government is the answer to all problems, task forces deal with all issues, consultants are the repository of all wisdom and setting up more quangos every week is the way this country will get out of its economic difficulties is radically mistaken.</P>
      <P>I agree completely with Deputy O'Rourke that the daft proposal of the ideological looney left to impose on education ten regional boards in which educational policy will be more democratic is absolutely for the birds.  The expenditure on that project, were it to be implemented, would be between £20 million and £50 million.  That daft project will divert from real education needs into bureaucracy a huge sum of money which this country cannot afford. The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has not yet brought the Education Bill before the House, but it will be opposed and, if I have anything to do with it, repealed at the earliest possible stage.  This is a small country of five million people and we do not need ten regional education boards any more than does the city of Manchester.  We need a system of education that delivers where resources are most needed, in the classroom, not in the office blocks.  We cannot afford any more mistakes.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proliferation of job creation agencies, I was glad Deputy O'Rourke acknowledged the error of going down that path.  I am not saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; but that departure into a multiplicity of local agencies was one of the most misconceived notions ever to strike this country.  Deputies, including Deputy Broughan, must be getting tired from the sheer weight of the post we are getting from all these agencies, each production glossier than the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, recently produced a verbose and rather idiotic document on broadcasting policy.  I was surprised to get an equally elaborate <Col N="897" /> document from the Combat Poverty Agency, which must have cost many thousands of pounds to publish, drawing to my attention poverty issues in broadcasting. The only poverty issue involved in that is poverty of intellect.  We do not need magazines, books and volumes to tell us about poverty issues in broadcasting. This is the madness of Labour in power.  A Minister produces a report the size of a telephone directory on poverty issues in broadcasting, most of which was unintelligible to those of us who have to make do with ordinary words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A statement in the report reads: &ldquo;Further reductions in personal income tax are needed to promote enterprise and the incentive to work&rdquo;.  We all agree with that but do we propose to do anything about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The document then suggests that by the year 2010, 80 per cent of all taxable personal income should be liable to be taxed at a standard 25 per cent rate with the remaining income taxable at 40 per cent.  With the greatest respect to the authors of this document, which must have been some kind of ideological compromise, that suggests we should take the next 14 years to establish what the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party says can be done in the next budget.  Who are we codding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If taxation has a disincentive effect on <Col N="898" /> enterprise and employment, why should we contemplate postponing arriving at relatively sane tax levels until the year 2010?  It either has an effect on employment, enterprise and the will to work, or it does not.  If it is the right medicine, it is completely inconsistent to say we should deal with it on an incremental basis that will achieve these results by the year 2010.  If taxation is a problem, it must be the case that radical action is needed to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I want to make a simple point in that regard.  Between 1989 and 1992, tax rates came down from 35 per cent to 27 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall tax rate increased.  The Deputy should tell the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the top rate of tax reduced from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.  If that kind of change can be made to the tax system in three years, how can it possibly be said we must wait 14 years to achieve a change of lesser significance in terms of the rates?</P>
      <P>The report recommends that 80 per cent of people should be on the low rate of 25 per cent, but 60 per cent are already on that low rate.  To move people at the rate of 2 per cent or 3 per cent per annum is an appallingly humble target, if I may use that phrase.</P>
      <P>I believe Deputy Broughan agrees with me in large measures on the effect of tax on the incentive to work.  He is one of the radicals of this Government in that respect but he is in the wrong party.  I am not giving him an invitation &mdash; he is carrying other bits of baggage that might make it difficult for him to move to my party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I know he shares the fundamental thesis I have advocated for the past ten years, <Col N="899" /> namely, that this country must face up to the issue of taxation.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is really interested in this issue, he must face up to the fact that the greatest competitor for jobs in the Irish economy that any small employer faces is the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  Every day people are forced to make a rational choice as to whether they spend 40 hours a week in heavily taxed employment or opt out of the economy and go back to welfare.</P>

      <P>That is the reason there is an additional 7,000 people signing on this week.  It is not because the economy has got sicker in the past month, that it is going downhill or that we do not have a sane system of tax on work: it is that ordinary people faced with ordinary decisions about their own lives have to make a choice and, because of the mad policies we pursue in this country, that choice makes it more worth while not to work than to work.  We can argue them this or that way but those are the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>One way of getting around this problem is to use mechanisms like family income supplement to help those who want to work to overcome the poverty and welfare traps. Another way is to examine the whole culture of unemployment, in particular the young unemployed, and to ask ourselves if we want anybody under the age of 25 to be paid by the State to do nothing.  The answer to that question must be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a community we must face up to <Col N="900" /> the proposition that people in the 18 to 25 years age group should never get a handout from the State on the basis that they abstain from work.  The State must offer training, third sector employment and some useful activity to those young people because to tell them they should start down the road of personal despair and ruin, and become a feature of our dole queues, is the most demoralising message the State can convey to them.</P>
    <P>Whatever action is taken, whether it is Tony Blair's view of welfare to work, there must now be a system whereby those who are embarking on the labour market for the first time are not offered money by the State as a form of human set-aside not to work during the prime of their working lives.  That is the radical challenge we face.</P>
    <P>The report deserves serious consideration. It recommends private sector provision of public infrastructure in roads, etc.  This has been underplayed but why should the private sector not provide finance for the Luas project or the Dublin-Belfast motorway?  The report also recommends demerger and sale of Cablelink.  Why did the Government press ahead with the sale of Telecom, including Cablelink, to KPN-Telia&mdash;&mdash;</P>
