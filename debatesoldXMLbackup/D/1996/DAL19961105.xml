      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I met the president of the Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Yasser Arafat, on Tuesday, 29 October last.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>At the meeting I reaffirmed the full support of Ireland and the European Union for the Middle East peace process.  I stressed that the European Union fully supported the key principles which underlie the peace process, namely, land for peace and self determination for the Palestinians. These principles are essential to the achievement of a just, comprehensive and durable peace in the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> I also stressed that the European Union's commitment to peace in the region was underlined through the significant financial and economic assistance which it gives to the region and through the decision of the European Union to appoint Mr. Miguel Angel Moratinos, the current Spanish Ambassador to Israel, as a special EU envoy.</P>
    <P>President Arafat, in response, indicated to me that the Palestinian National Authority remained fully committed to the Middle East peace process. He welcomed the involvement of the European Union and in particular the visit of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to the region after the Special European Council in Dublin on 5 October last.  He looked forward to the visit of the EU Troika later this month and asked the European Union to use its influence with the Israeli Government to ensure that agreements which have already been made are adhered to.</P>
    <P>I indicated in response that Prime Minister Netanyahu would be visiting Dublin later this month and that I would raise with him all matters in relation to the Middle East peace process.  I also confirmed that the EU would maintain a full and active role in the peace process and that the situation would be reviewed by the European Council at its meeting in Dublin on 13 and 14 December next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>will the Taoiseach accept the Israelis are showing considerable resistance to any meaningful role for the EU?  In that context what assurances was he able to give President Yasser Arafat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed role for the EU was welcomed by all the participants, including the Israelis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte specialta a chur roimh na daoine go léir atá ag féachaint ar Teilífís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Despite all the tension and shocking violence no one says the Israelis or the Palestinians should not continue to talk or that the peace process is dead and there is no hope for it in the future.  Is there a lesson to be learnt here for the talks in Northern Ireland?  What can happen between now and the Summit on 15 December that would assist President Arafat?  He kindly agreed to meet me as leader of the Opposition.  In thanking the Government for its co-operation he urged me to continue to use our unique position to its full with other member states between now and 15 December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Clearly we are having an extension of the question from Palestine to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the first part of the Deputy's question is concerned, I agree with all the statements he made about it being necessary for people to talk to one another and so on.  I also <Col N="4" /> agree that is a lesson all engaged in any peace process can usefully learn.  With regard to what can be done between now and the Dublin European Summit in December, the most immediate step would be an agreement to the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron.  That is part of the accord that has not yet been implemented.  There should also be a stop to further settlement and we should see the opening of the final status negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Americans seem heavily engaged on the Israeli side and President Arafat is grateful to President Chirac for his intervention, is there anything else that we, as the Presidency of the European Union should do to try to help?  It seems as if President Chirac has stolen a march on the European Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The visit by President Chirac to the Middle East which was very welcome took place after the visit of the Tánaiste, on behalf of the EU Presidency.  There is full co-ordination and co-operation between France and all other member states who have a useful role to play in the Middle East and the Irish EU Presidency in all initiatives that we take.  There is a common European Union line on all the outstanding and contentious issues in the Middle East peace process.  We are continuing to use our economic and political weight as a Union and as the largest customer for the goods produced in all of the countries in the Middle East.  As the largest aid donor to the Palestinian area we continue to use our influence in every way possible to push the parties towards agreement.</P>
      <P>I indicated in answer to an earlier question by Deputy Harney the immediate steps the Union would like to see taken.  From the point of view of the living conditions of people in the Palestinian area, it is urgent that the closures policy adopted by Israel for claimed security reasons be lifted.  This closures policy represents, in effect, the punishment of the entire population of the Palestinian areas for acts committed by a small minority and is causing immense damage to the economic prospects of the people concerned. The hardship and the loss of income of people living in the Gaza portion of the Palestinian area are severe and have been observed on behalf of the EU Presidency by the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, and brought by him to the attention of all concerned.  It is a matter of great humanitarian urgency that this closures policy be mitigated and ultimately cease.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said the Israeli Foreign Minister will visit Ireland.  If so, is it his intention to raise that matter with him when he visits?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ensure the Israeli Government is not allowed veto the trip to the region by the EU Troika by imposing a condition that it is not allowed visit Orient House?  Will he ensure that any visit by the European Union will visit the PLO office in Jerusalem, Orient House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the forthcoming troika visit will not be to Jerusalem. It will be to Gaza to meet the Palestinian authorities.  The Israeli authorities will be met in Cairo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds very much like a copout and it is nothing less.  On the provision of an airport for the people of Gaza, will the Taoiseach ensure the veto of the Israelis on the construction of an airport will be lifted?  Will he agree that the Palestinian people, like the rest of the world, are entitled to their own state rather than a homeland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union is doing everything it can to have that airport provided and opened.  I will raise the matter with the Prime Minister Mr. Netanyahu when he comes to visit me.  I also raised it with the Foreign Minister Mr. Levy when he visited here.  I understand substantial funds are available to open a port for shipping in the Gaza area, mainly from European Union sources.  It is important that port be opened because the Palestinian people in the Gaza area, live in one of the most densely populated places in the world.  They have very little means of providing for themselves other than through trade.  It is of cardinal humanitarian, political and economic importance that they have air and shipping links for trade purposes so that they can make a living.</P>
      <P>To what did the second part of the question relate?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I failed to recollect the second part of the question.  The European Union favours self-determination for the Palestinian people and it is for them to determine what form that should take.  Obviously, we want that done in a way which is consonant with the interests of their neighbours and is based on a peaceful accommodation with them.  The purpose of the final status negotiations, which the European Union and Ireland want to see open soon, is to resolve the issue of what form the Palestinian right to self-determination should take.</P>

      <P>Let us make some progress on other questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the reason the troika will visit Gaza but not Jerusalem is the prior notice of objection from <Col N="6" /> the Israeli prime minister it would not be welcome to visit Orient House in Jerusalem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the European Union decided to visit Orient House in Jerusalem is that the European Union does not accept the Israeli occupation of east Jerusalem; we have never accepted that.  The Union does not share the Israeli view of the status of Jerusalem.</P>
      <P>The israelis have always wanted EU visitors to meet them in Jerusalem.  To ensure that would not be construed as taking their view on the status of Jerusalem the Union devised the policy that while visiting Jerusalem to meet the Israelis the troika would call on Orient House.  However, the proposed troika visit will not go to Jerusalem and, therefore, the issue does not arise.  The contact with the Israelis will be in Cairo and with the Palestinian authority will be in Gaza, the area administered by the Palestinian authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important in a peace process that people should attempt to avoid needless confrontations.  The approach the troika will take, contrary to that advocated by Deputy Burke, is the correct one given the sensitive stage at which the peace process is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless confrontations about issues of punctiliousness are not necessarily in the interests of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <Quest>if he will report on the statement he made at the Europe of the Regions Conference at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, on Tuesday, 29 October 1996.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20342/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed the &ldquo;Europe of the Regions&rdquo; Conference at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on Tuesday, 29 October.  As it is quite lengthy, I have arranged for my address to be circulated in the Official Report, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>The following is my address:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to acknowledge the initiative of the Institute of European Affairs in jointly organising this conference.  I think it is also only fair to acknowledge the valuable work done by the Philip Morris Institute in helping to inform debate on the major issues and challenges facing the European Union.  Papers produced <Col N="7" /> on European issues by the institute are of a high standard.</P>
    <P>Regions provide a vital step in the ladder which leads from the citizens of Europe, via local and regional government, to the national state and on to the European Union.  We are, therefore, all part of a Europe of Nations, a Europe of the Regions, a Europe of the People.</P>
    <P>Regional Policy in Europe has come a long way from its humble beginnings in 1975.  The original European Regional Development Fund, European Regional Development Fund, was established with comparatively limited terms of reference.  That was the beginning of a process which has seen the EU develop a range of instruments and policies designed to reduce regional disparities.</P>
    <P>The Structural Funds are an integral and vital part of EU economic and social cohesion policy.  They are designed to compensate for the fact that the benefits of European economic integration, and the Single Market in particular, are not equally distributed across the Community.  They are intended to improve the productive potential of peripheral regions so that they can compete more effectively in an integrated Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland, through effective implementation of Structural Funds programmes and our successful efforts in creating a supportive macroeconomic environment, has made good use of its Structural Funds assistance leading to progressive convergence towards EU average GDP and GNP per head.  However, Ireland has, and will continue to have for some time, very substantial development needs.  Our national income level, most appropriately measured in terms of <i>per capita</i> GNP rather than GDP &mdash; is still insufficient to allow us to realise our full potential as a region of the Union.  There is much to be done to raise employment opportunities to the level enjoyed by more advanced member states.</P>
    <P>For example, despite substantial investment under the Community Support Framework, CSF, and the Cohesion Fund our internal transport infrastructure is still relatively under developed by European standards.  It will require further large scale investment.  Our location on the edge of Europe means that high access costs continue to be an additional burden faced by firms in our trading sector over and above that faced by their competitors in more central locations.  These cost handicaps are quantifiable and are directly linked to our geographic location.</P>
    <P>Ireland's indigenous industries are still weak and under-developed compared to indigenous industry in the more developed regions of the Community.  This sector will need support well into the next century to upgrade its R &amp; D capacity, to improve its management and marketing capabilities so that it can match the best in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> While Ireland has a reasonable R &amp; D capacity it is well below that of the more developed regions of the Community where the tradition for centres of excellence goes back centuries.  Although the revolution in information technology has made possible the rapid communication of ideas, peripheral regions such as Ireland will need continued Community support to upgrade their R and D capacity.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, much we can do to help ourselves.  Financial and investment institutions in Ireland do suffer from having a higher priority for shorter-term returns relative to institutions in continental countries.  We need to examine the market pressures that create this short-term outlook and the overemphasis on physical security in our financial system. Germany and Japan may have lessons for us in this regard.</P>
    <P>Economic and social cohesion by definition means more than closing the gap in living standards and employment opportunity between Ireland and the Community average. We must at the same time address the specific needs of the most socially disadvantaged. In Ireland's case one of the most pressing social problems facing us is the comparative extent and pervasiveness of long-term unemployment. If we are to achieve social cohesion this problem must continue to be tackled.  We need EU help with this.</P>
    <P>But, again, there are things we can do to help ourselves.  Long-term unemployment is closely linked to educational failure.  The long awaited regionalisation of our educational system will enable us to address the factors which give rise to school-drop out rates being much higher in some areas than others and to regional and school variations in leaving certificate results.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the new round of structural Funds for the period 2000-2005 will commence after the Intergovernmental Conference concludes, probably in mid-1997.  The negotiations will take place at a time when the European Union is facing unprecedented change in preparing for enlargement to the East.  This enlargement, incorporating countries with considerable development needs, will be a new challenge for the principle of cohesion and convergence.</P>
    <P>However, the principle of economic and social cohesion, firmly enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty must be fully maintained and implemented.  The enlargement to the East which will bring many benefits in terms of both stability and economic opportunities, should not undermine the application of cohesion policies to existing member states.  This will not be easy.  All choices have costs.  Enlargement will have costs as well as benefits, and it is best to know that.</P>
    <P>One relevant factor in relation to the next round of the Structural Funds relates to income per head of population.  This is one of the key criteria used to determine the allocation of <Col N="9" /> structural funding under the current round and is measured using Gross Domestic Product, GDP.  In so far as Ireland is concerned, the rapid growth of our economy has greatly enhanced our convergence to average EU GDP levels; from 63.4 per cent of the EU average in 1998 to an estimated 89.7 per cent in 1995 and over 90 per cent for 1996.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered though, that in the case of Ireland, GDP considerably overstates national income.  Our GNP is about 12.5 per cent lower than our GDP.  GNP is a more accurate measure of national prosperity because it allows for profit repatriation and external debt service payments.  GNP measures the money we actually have to spend.  This disparity is not mirrored in other member states.  Their GNP and GDP figures are much closer.</P>
    <P>The Commission's interim report to the Madrid European Council on the effects on the policies of the EU of future enlargement to the East set out preliminary orientations for the development of cohesion policy.  This would indicate that the Commission do not envisage any dramatic change in the proportion of budgetary resources devoted to cohesion within the existing member states for the period 2000-2005.  It would also suggest that there will probably not be any major departure from the concentration of the funds on the regions of the Union &ldquo;whose development is lagging behind&rdquo;.  As a federation, the EU's overall budget is tiny when compared with other federations.  The integrative force of the single currency will force Europe to look at the size of its budget.</P>
    <P>To sum up, Ireland has demonstrated that it has the capacity to use Structural Funds effectively.  In many ways it has been a showcase for the merit of well-formulated and targeted EU regional policies.  I am satisfied that funding for the many needs which will remain after the current round of structural Funds is fully justified and that we will use them to best effect to complete the modernisation of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Committee of the Regions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The establishment of the Committee of the Regions under Article 198 of the Treaty on European Union saw the role of regions within Europe being formally recognised by all the member states.  The committee allows regional and local interests to be effectively represented at a European level.  The committee is formally consulted by the Council and the European Commission on legislative proposals and initiatives in a wide range of areas ranging from education to economic and social cohesion. This recognises that in some countries, like Germany, the regions have almost as much power as the federal government.  This is not true of other countries, and we cannot impose uniformity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> The Intergovernmental Conference, IGC, in its consideration of the institutions of the Union will examine the role and functioning of the Committee of the Regions.  Ireland believes that the Committee of the Regions as a relatively new body has worked well.  We are fully supportive of the committee and are open to considering any measures which would enhance its role, while keeping in mind at all times the importance of preserving the institutional balance of the Union.  In this regard, we need to bring regional policy closer to our people.  How many Irish citizens know of the existence of the Committee of the Regions and who represents their region on the committee?  Very few, I fear on both counts.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Regional Policy in Ireland</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally lacked a formal regional government structure although in the past there were non-statutory regional development organisations which were concerned with regional planning and development.  In other areas, such as health services, tourism and industrial development, regional structures were also developed However, these regional structures developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, each with its own remit and, in some cases, different geographic area.</P>
    <P>In 1994, in order to formalise and reform this situation, eight statutory regional authorities were established.  Each authority comprises elected representatives from the principal local authorities in the region.  This gives the authorities a representative mandate of a kind while also giving them a direct link to the local authorities in the region.</P>
    <P>The regional authorities in Ireland were consulted in drawing up the national plan on which the community support framework is based.  The various sectoral programmes in the CSF also take account of the development needs of the regions.  Regional authorities through their EU operational committees monitor the implementation of Structural Funds programmes in their regions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Devolution Commission</i>
    </P>
    <P>While the regional authorities are relatively recent, the system of elected local government at community and city level is long established. It provides a vital focus for local democracy and democratic accountability.  It is fair to say, however, that local government in Ireland exercises an unusually limited range of functions.  This is anomalous, given the strong sense of local identity which characterises Irish society.  It contrasts with the vibrant voluntary sector at local level, which has been at the heart of our strong network of local development bodies, supported by the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>To address this anomaly, last year the Government established a devolution commission on local government reform.  The commission's task is to recommend a renewed system of local government guided by the principles of subsidiarity, accountability, <Col N="11" /> integration, effectiveness and participation. The commission has published its interim report which outlines a framework for the future direction of local government here.  The Government has accepted many of the commission's recommendations, including that the local government system should have three levels &mdash; regional, county and sub county.</P>
    <P>We have also accepted that local government should act as the focal point for local development effort for the future.  We must also retain the vitality and innovation of the present system, which was so strongly endorsed by the OECD in its report on Irish local development policy, earlier this year.</P>
    <P>However, the defining characteristic of local government is the electoral process, the mandate thus given to members of local authorities and their accountability to the electorate.  The Government, therefore, considers that the essential requirement for local government renewal is an enhancement of the role of the elected members of local authorities in setting policy for local services and giving political leadership to socioeconomic development at local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is currently preparing a report on how the primacy of the electoral process should be reflected in the local government and local development systems.  In particular, the Minister is preparing recommendations on how the distinct role of elected members relative to the officials of local authorities and other bodies engaged in public service delivery and socio-economic development at local level can best be expressed and supported.  The Government believes that this will enhance the capacity of local government to fulfil its role in a democratic society, not least by providing a greater incentive for capable and talented citizens to offer their services to the community through the local democratic process.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, in consultation with the Minister of State with responsibility for local development is also drawing up frameworks for partnership and co-operation between local authorities, which embody representative democracy and local community development organisations, local partnership companies and county enterprise boards and Leader groups, which embody participative democracy.  These frameworks will reflect the different situations in different areas, and will take account of EU and other statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we have asked the commission to accelerate its analysis of additional functions which might be transferred to local authorities and to come forward with proposals for the devolution of powers and functions to local authorities before the end of the year.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that devolution is not easy because, as we have seen in debates on local taxes and services, the <Col N="12" /> public often expects uniformity in local arrangements rather than local variations.  Real devolution will mean real differences from one area to the next.  This variation may be the price of effective local democracy.  With effective devolution, it is a price worth paying for the creativity and innovation which real empowerment makes possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General EU Agenda</i>
    </P>
    <P>I would now like to speak to you on the major issues on the EU agenda which are currently preoccupying the Irish Presidency. When the Irish Presidency of the EU commenced on 1 July last, I identified the following key priority areas: secure jobs; safer streets; sound money and a peaceful Europe. The Irish Presidency has been fully engaged to seek to make real progress in these areas under the existing Treaty.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Secure Jobs</i>
    </P>
    <P>Europe needs to create a strong, job-creating economy.  Unemployment is a waste of human resources and contributes to social problems such as crime and social exclusion.  To raise the skills and improve the competitiveness of our workers we need to take co-ordinated European action on education and training and on investment in infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We also need to adopt a proactive approach at local level and this is an area where Ireland has given a lead through the local development programme.  Local partnerships helped many statutory bodies to co-operate with one another at local level in a systematic way, sometimes for the first time.  The involvement and co-operation of the social partners is also vital.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency is on course for the adoption of substantive conclusions on employment policy at the Dublin European Council in December and thereby chart an employment strategy for Europe for the future. This strategy must ensure that the EU continues to take account of regional disparities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Safer Streets</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am glad to state that the Irish Presidency has seen major progress in measures at EU level in the fight against crime.  Criminals do not respect or allow themselves to be hampered by national borders.  Nor should we allow ourselves to be hampered by borders in tackling them.  Recent steps taken by the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will therefore see increased co-ordination and co-operation between police forces in combating organised crime.</P>
    <P>We must also confront issues such as Cybercrime, where people are using the Internet and information technology to commit crimes.  We have seen how those perpetrating the gravest crimes against children are using technology to promulgate information about how these unspeakable crimes can be <Col N="13" /> organised and committed.  In response to this depravity the Irish Presidency has acted to have the remit of Europol extended to deal with trafficking and abuse of children.</P>
    <P>Likewise, in relation to drug trafficking, we have to develop a co-ordinated response at all levels to bring international drug traffickers to justice.  The Dublin European Council in December will adopt substantive conclusions which will greatly assist a coordinated Europewide response to drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Action is of course also needed at national and regional level to deal with drug abuse.  In Ireland, the recent report of the ministerial task force on drugs recognises the crucial role of local communities in tackling drug abuse.  The simple message is that all levels of Government and the community must be involved in a co-ordinated way to tackle crime and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sound Money</i>
    </P>
    <P>Turning to the priority of sound money, the Irish Presidency has made good progress in relation to economic and monetary union.  It is important to continually place on the record that, contrary to some claims, EMU will be good for jobs.  A stable currency is good for jobs.  It is no accident that the post-war period was a period of fixed exchange rates and high employment.  In contrast, the period after the 1973 oil shock featured currency instability and falling employment.</P>
    <P>The convergence criteria for EMU are the recipe for stable economic growth, low interest rates and thereby more jobs.  They create a framework in which long-term business planning will become possible.  The elimination of transaction costs for cross-border exchanges will promote increased trade and tourism across borders.  It will also, incidentally, lower the barriers between border regions in different nation states and allow them to overcome one of the burdens of peripherality. The conclusions of the December Dublin European Council will be a further important benchmark on the road to commencement of EMU on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Peace in Europe</i>
    </P>
    <P>The fourth priority is peace in Europe.  I believe that increased political and economic links between the EU and other countries will ensure the promotion of peace in Europe.  This was the principle behind the original Coal and Steel Community and I believe that it still holds good today.  Peace in Europe will mean better security for the regions of Europe.</P>
    <P>Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe cannot be taken for granted.  The bloodshed and pain of the Second World War are still within living memory.  One of the ways of ensuring that the European Union, and the peace and prosperity it has brought about, survive into the next century is to keep it relevant to the needs and concerns of its citizens.</P>
    <P>I believe that regional and local bodies have an important role to play in this process.  They <Col N="14" /> act as a conduit between the national and European levels and the individual on the street.  Regional governments are a vital link. They provide a crucial bridge in ensuring that a Europe of nations is also a Europe of people.</P>
    <P>Thank you.</P>

      <P>The Government is considering, with the aid of the devolution commission, a number of issues which might be suitable for devolution to local authorities.  Also, the Minister for the Environment is examining the role of local authority elected members, as distinct from management, to see if a shift of responsibility can be made in favour of members in defined areas of activity.  Further, the Minister for the Environment is currently in consultation with the Minister of State with responsibility for local development, drawing up frameworks for partnership and co-operation between local authorities and the many local partnership and community development organisations being aided from public funds and are operating coterminous or parallel with local authorities.</P>

      <P>The devolution commission is being invited to produce a series of reports rather than one final report, each of which will be decided upon quickly when it arrives.  A Cabinet subcommittee will meet immediately when a report on a particular area of devolution comes to hand with a view to making the necessary decisions on implementation.  That mechanism is in place so there can be a quick follow up to a report.  However, obviously, we have to wait until reports are submitted by the devolution commission, which is continuing to work intensively.</P>

      <P>Has the Government given any more thought to whether Ireland should be broken down regionally for the next round of Structural Funds?  What decisions has the Government made on that matter?  I asked some time ago if we were preparing regional statistics on a <i>per capita</i> basis so that we could make a case on a regional basis if the entire country was not accepted as an Objective One region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland will make its case for the retention of Objective One status on a number of grounds which I outlined in my speech on the occasion in question.  I referred, in particular, to the under development of our internal transport infrastructure; the fact we are one of the few island members of the Union without access such as the Channel Tunnel to surface transport to other member states means we suffer from certain, inherent, in-built handicaps simply because of our geographical location.  I also drew attention to the difficulties facing small, indigenously owned industry here and the comparative under development of our R and D capacity.</P>
      <P>In addition, the measure used by the European Union to determine the income of countries, namely gross domestic product, is not a suitable means of measuring Ireland's real income position.  There is a gap of 12.5 per cent between our GNP and our GDP.  I made the case that our GNP is a more real measure of our true position. In colloquial terms, our GNP measures the money we have to spend and our GDP measures the money we have to spend plus money that comes in and leaves again in almost the same transaction because it is not available to us to spend domestically.  In measuring the true income position of any household or country it is more appropriate to use disposable income rather than theoretical income.  Hence the Government will make a case for the retention of Objective One status.  The negotiations on this matter do not open until mid-1997 and we should not prematurely yield ground in any issue concerning it or engage in any exercise of the kind suggested by the Deputy which could be construed as preparing to yield ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a significant statement; it is the first time the Government has declared its policy on how the negotiations on the next round of Structural Funds will be handled.  I am glad the <Col N="16" /> Taoiseach made this statement as many national bodies believed the matter would be dealt with in other ways and not on a nation-wide basis.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that when the decision has been made we should build our case on it.  What preparations are under way to build a case which shows we can live within the criteria applied to the last round of Structural Funds in 1993?  It is not only a question of GDP and GNP, which have been affected by repatriations.  To complicate the matter further, the EU has started to use the GGD position, the general government deficit position.  Even though we will probably be at the EU average and will meet all the Maastricht criteria in regard to debt etc., what work is under way to develop and prove our case so that the Government and Opposition can row in behind it?  This will enable us to maximise our efforts to secure as much funding as possible under the Regional Fund, the European Social Fund, FEOGA and the other specialist funds available at that time.  The data available from the Central Statistics Office will not help us to sustain our case, and that has been the difficulty for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed work on this matter is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  The Department of Finance, which has always been responsible for Ireland's management of EU funds, is taking the lead role in the preparation of our case.  In my speech at the Royal Hospital I set out the broad case for the continuance of support for Ireland from the Structural Funds under Objective One for the period 2000-05.  We will develop this case in the coming months, but obviously it is not in our interests &mdash; or in those of the Union &mdash; to open this debate prematurely.  We are still operating within the existing Delors package arrangement and we should continue to implement this.  One of the most convincing things we can do to justify further support is to show we are using the money well and doing everything within our power and resources to complement the achievements and aims for which we are receiving European money. I highlighted this in my speech and referred to a number of measures we can take to achieve these objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach arrange for either him or the Minister for Finance to set out the work being undertaken in preparation for the next round of Structural Funds?  It is not simply a matter of saying the M50 or the Athlone bypass are great developments.  We must organise ourselves properly so that we can fight this major battle, ensure we can live within the criteria laid down for the last two rounds of Structural Funds and argue a coherent case.  This will not fall out of the sky and the Department of Finance, the Central Statistics Office and other experts must prepare the data.  It is a year since I first asked about the preparations which were under way to enable us to organise ourselves properly for the <Col N="17" /> next round of Structural Funds.  We are talking about billions of pounds for the national economy in the areas of agriculture, training and economic and infrastructural development.  It is not enough to say we will do this, that or the other.</P>

I have to read not only the speech given by the Taoiseach at the Royal Hospital but also information circulated in the Official Report.  Given that all the questions on Northern Ireland tabled for answer today were ruled out of order, I cannot raise the matter about which everyone else is speaking.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that the policy decisions on tourism contained in the 1987 Fianna Fáil document have been changed?  Will he also confirm that there has been an increase in visitor numbers from 1.8 million in 1986 to 4.2 million last year and that the number of overseas tourists &mdash; this is more narrowly defined in the statistics &mdash; increased from 640,000 to 2.3 million during the same period?  Has the Government given any consideration to what will happen after March 1997 when the Fianna Fáil policy on tourism no longer applies?  If it has given any thought to this I cannot find one word about it in any speech or article.</P>

This pattern has been maintained for the three months from January to March of this year with a figure of 685,000.  The number of tourists increased from 641,000 in 1986 to 2.314 million.</P>

      <P>The figure of 640,000 in 1986 was a result of the policies of ruination pursued by the Minister of State's party in Government for five years.  Will the Minister of State explain how the 16 per cent growth rate achieved by successive Fianna Fáil led Governments over the past eight years, and now just about maintained, will be continued over the coming years when there is no Government policy on the matter?</P>
      <P>This issue is a major concern to all tourism groups.  They do not know where the market development fund will come from, what will happen on the capital programme or whether the Minister for Finance will contribute to the fund as did the former Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy.  Given that the Fianna Fáil plan expires in a few months, when will these questions be answered so that those concerned with tourism will know if there is any policy direction?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State acknowledge the difference between statistics for visitors and for tourists and that the figures he indicated for visitors include those who travel over and back across the Border on the same day. There has been a big increase in that figure since the ceasefires.  Will he confirm that one should refer to the &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; of the number of tourists made by the Central Statistics Office and Bord Fáilte because we do not have an adequate method of calculating the number of paying tourists?  There is a gap with regard to tourism planning and a need to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We covered this ground approximately three weeks ago when I explained that there are three determinants for calculating the inward and outward flow of tourist numbers. First, the returns from passenger transport companies give the total passenger movement by route of travel.  Second, the country of residence survey is used to estimate the distribution, by country of residence, for each route.  This survey covered 185,000 inward and 209,000 outward passengers in 1995.  Finally the passenger card inquiry is used to estimate, for various areas of residence, the reason for the journey, the length of stay, the expenditure and the fare costs.  This survey covered 137,000 inward and 165,000 outward passengers in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three sources are combined to provide the quarterly and annual estimates.  It is the <Col N="21" /> accepted practice that, using these as the three indicators, we arrive at figures which are largely comparable with those of Bord Fáilte, which are used to gauge our actual tourist figures in addition to other figures.  The level of disparity between the two different sets of figures, using two different methodologies, is minimal.</P>

      <P>Is it true that a Mayoman who works in London and travels home, as many do, via Knock Airport at weekends, becomes 50 tourists for the purposes of compiling statistics, given that he travels home 50 times per year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a regular and poorly informed controversy.  Every time it is raised the tourism or travel statistics are criticised for over stating Irish tourism performance.  The argument usually revolves around the question of whether business or leisure travel and, for example, visits <Col N="22" /> to relatives or travel by soccer fans constitute real tourism.  They do not.</P>
      <P>As I have explained, three clear and distinctive methods are employed.  We use figures from the travel companies, both air and sea, because they already have information on the destination of people and the reason for their journey.  The country of residence survey covered 185,000 inward and 209,000 outward passengers the purpose of their journey, where they were going and how long they were staying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I became President of the ECOFIN Council in July I set out my priorities in the economic and monetary union area in accordance with the mandates given to ECOFIN by the Madrid and Florence European Councils.  Briefly, these require ECOFIN and, in their respective fields of competence, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute to present conclusions to the Dublin European Council in December 1996 showing further substantive progress towards ensuring a smooth transition to <Col N="23" /> economic and monetary union.  Three areas are involved.</P>
      <P>The first concerns strengthening budgetary discipline in stage three of economic and monetary union among member states that adopt the euro.  This work follows from the treaty provisions in relation to the avoidance of excessive deficits, and the specific proposals made by Germany last year for a stability pact to operate among member states in economic and monetary union.  The second involves study of the range of issues, particularly in the monetary policy area, raised by the fact that not all member states will adopt the euro from the outset.  The third is the legal framework for the use of the euro.</P>
      <P>Very satisfactory progress has been made on all three areas so far during our Presidency.  In Dublin in September I hosted an informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to review progress and to chart the course to the December European Council. This meeting ensured that we are well on our way to achieving our Presidency objectives.</P>
      <P>On the stability pact, Ministers endorsed the idea that member states in economic and monetary union will be obliged to submit stability programmes outlining their plans for keeping their public finances in order so that their general government deficit will be kept below the treaty reference value of 3 per cent of GDP over the course of a normal business cycle.  There was also broad agreement that member states not in economic and monetary union should submit convergence programmes showing a commitment to manage their public finances in accordance with the principle of convergence.  All member states agreed with the idea of an early warning system to help prevent excessive deficits arising.</P>
      <P>Article 104c of the Treaty on European Union provides for sanctions to be imposed, including the imposition of fines, if a member state fails to take effective action to remedy an excessive deficit.  At Dublin, there was a consensus that as a general rule when sanctions are first imposed, the member state involved should make a noninterest-bearing deposit; and that after two years a deposit should be converted into a fine of the same amount if the deficit continues to be excessive.</P>
      <P>Finally, there was agreement that the pecuniary sanctions provided for in the treaty should have both fixed and variable components and should be of a magnitude sufficient to discourage excessive deficits.  Further work is being carried out on the scale of sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second area, the Dublin informal Council also made progress on the objectives and main features of a new exchange rate mechanism. There was a consensus that the central rates of currencies in the new ERM should be set by reference to the euro only, to reflect both its anchor rule and the goal of convergence to the euro area.  We also called for work to be done on the issue of strengthened surveillance of <Col N="24" /> exchange rate policies of member states outside the euro area, with a view to making more effective the obligation in article 109m of the treaty for member states to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest. Finally, there was agreement at Dublin on the need for certain legislation on the legal framework for the introduction of the euro to be produced as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The progress made under the Irish Presidency so far was reflected last month when the Commission adopted legislative proposals on the stability pact and on the legal framework for the introduction of the euro, as well as a draft communication to Council on the relationship between participating and non-participating member sates.  As for the rest of our Presidency, we will be chairing a working group on the draft legal framework for the introduction of the euro with a view to as much agreement as possible being reached on it in advance of the European Council in Dublin in December.  Work is also continuing within the Monetary Committee, on the Commission's legislative proposals on the stability pact.</P>
    <P>Early next month ECOFIN will finalise reports for presentation to the European Council which will show substantive progress on the three areas I have outlined.  Many key elements of the stability pact and of the legal framework for the introduction of the euro have been agreed and I expect further progress to be made before the end of the year.  The main parameters of the new ERM are almost settled, although the details cannot of course be finalised until the European Central Bank is set up in 1998.  Work on other aspects of the relationship between participating and non-participating member states is ongoing in the context of improving multilateral surveillance.  The work on the legal framework for the euro is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>I should not neglect to mention in the context of our Presidency role that, although there is now no likelihood of a decision in 1996 to proceed to economic and monetary union in 1997, there is still a Treaty procedure under which the European Council must decide, before 31 December 1996, whether a majority of member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, whether it is appropriate to enter the third stage of economic and monetary union and, if so, to set the date for the beginning of the third stage.</P>
    <P>The European Council has of course already decided that 1 January 1999 will be the starting date for economic and monetary union, so the outcome of this procedure is already clear.  The procedure must nevertheless be carried out.  Our aim is that the Dublin European Council will reaffirm the 1 January 1999 commencement date for economic and monetary union and drive home the message that the move to economic and monetary union on that date is irreversible.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt the negotiations on economic and monetary union <Col N="25" /> are complex and difficult.  Some European experts recently attended the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, one of whom stated the timetable is sacrosanct while another said the criteria are sacrosanct.  What is the Minister's view in that regard?  Are the criteria immutable or is the timetable immutable?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has posed a valid question on which there has been a great deal of debate in many capitals across Europe and beyond.  The main body of the treaty text is explicit in regard to the timetable.  The five Maastricht criteria are not embodied in the body of the text <i>per se</i>; they are attached to a Protocol. If one wished to be entirely legalistic, one could say the treaty gives explicit reference to the timetable whereas the five Maastricht criteria are not embodied in the main text.  However, the need for sustainable convergence is embodied in the main body of the text and the five criteria are an expression of what is understood to be sustainable convergence.  In reality, the timetable and the criteria are embodied in the treaty and both are very solid.</P>

      <P>The two issues do not add up. A number of statements from the German Minister and utterances from the president of the Bundesbank suggest that adherence to the criteria must be met.  Is the Minister saying the timetable is immutable and that economic and monetary union will proceed on 1 January 1999, even if the criteria are not met?  As the Minister recognised, there is considerable divergence of opinion in this regard.  Is it the Minister's view that the criteria are more important than the timetable or <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has altered the thrust of his first question in his supplementary query. However, I did not obfuscate my answer.  He asked me what the treaty explicitly stated and I outlined that clearly.  The timetable is explicitly stated &mdash; while the criteria are not &mdash; in the main body of the treaty, which refers to sustainable convergence.  This is defined in the Protocol where the five criteria, with which we are familiar, are outlined.  Both have equal importance and it is not a case of one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the debate and speculation as to whether countries will qualify or meet the criteria, or whether the criteria can be altered in respect of various matters, but it is unproductive at this stage.  If we agree with the economic and monetary union project and recognise that the timetable for commencement is 1 January 1999, <Col N="26" /> we must ensure that as many countries as possible which aspire to participation qualify on the day. Hazarding guesses as to what might happen in advance of that is mere speculation and serves little or no useful purpose other than to give fuel to those who fundamentally disagree with the project, who do not want it to happen and who will use every device possible to undermine its credibility.  This is not the position of the Deputy or his party but I do not wish him to be inadvertently ensnared in a pointless intellectual <i>cul de sac</i> which does not advance the debate.</P>

      <P>By necessity the Minister's reply was detailed and, consequently, the supplementary queries are also detailed.  I thank the Minister for his advice but I am capable of taking my own counsel.  This debate did not start in Ireland but was brought to the forefront by Germany.  It is the main driving force and must participate in economic and monetary union at the outset.  Germany has made these noises for a considerable time; the debate has not arisen only in Ireland or elsewhere.  Conflicting views have emerged from Germany and it has said that the criteria must be met.  Given that it will be the main participant in economic and monetary union, it is legitimate for Ireland and the Minister to have a view.</P>
      <P>I take it the Minister does not have a view that the criteria are more important than the timetable or <i>vice versa.</i>  However, he cannot have it both ways; he must take a view one way or the other.  Does he agree with the utterances from Germany that the criteria are more important or does he consider that the timetable will proceed willy nilly even if the criteria are not met?  This is a fundamental point because if and when Ireland participates in economic and monetary union, the decision cannot be reversed.  It must be debated because we cannot decide six months or years later to get out of the system.  This issue is of fundamental importance and a wide ranging debate is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the criteria which underpin sustainable convergence are not met and the European Council judges that a sufficient group of countries have not met them, the economic and monetary union project will not proceed if that is the outturn of the recorded result of the 1997 budgets.  It is my considered view that speculation on whether the criteria will be diluted or modified is not helpful at any stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must draw the Deputy's attention to the existing constitutional legal position.  The electorate of this Republic voted to alter the Constitution to include a treaty which, <i>inter alia</i>, contains specific timetables, one of which is no later than 1 January 1999.  I am not aware of any provision which allows anybody, as far as the <Col N="27" /> citizens of this or other countries which held referenda or made formal resolutions of parliament are concerned, to alter that timetable without having recourse to the bodies which made the decisions.  The Deputy asked which is of more importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Both are of considerable importance for the reason I outlined.  The project will not sustain itself in the future unless convergence is self evidently sustainable.  In addition, the project cannot proceed unless the obligations of the treaty, including the timetable obligations, are met.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if the Government will meet the level set for public expenditure for the current year as set down in the programme A Government of Renewal; if not, the likely outturn for public expenditure levels for the current year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20325/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, stated it was intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over 1996-97.  It did not set a specific target for this year.  The real increase in gross current supply services spending provided for in this year's budget was 2.7 per cent.  In my statement on the publication of the end-September Exchequer returns, I indicated that the increase in nominal terms in non-capital supply services expenditure to the end of September was 5 per cent over the same period last year, but that the end year outturn was expected to be somewhat higher.  A nominal increase of 5 per cent is equivalent to a real increase of just over 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The two biggest additions to the budget provision for current spending are for EU disallowances regarding the beef fines and the cost of measures to contain the effects of BSE. The first of these big additions to spending was out of the Government's control while the second is the result of an unforeseeable development almost completely due to events outside this country which no Irish Government could have controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the pre-budget White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure it was indicated that a provision was included towards meeting the cost of EU disallowances.  A footnote stated that, should the EU fines be levied in 1996, the expenditure would fall on the current budget.  The figure was not specified because the EU Commission had not reached a decision on the disallowances.  The disallowances decided by the Commission, some £70 million, are £20 million higher than the budget provision; the full £70 million is an <Col N="28" /> addition to the budget provision for current expenditure.  It is a once off cost.  In effect, the Government provided £50 million in nonprogramme outlays because it did not want to declare publicly what it thought the scale of the fines would be.  The full amount of £70 million is an addition to the budget provision for current expenditure and it is a once off cost.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis has increased spending in two ways.  First, intervention will cost an additional £20 million gross.  Second, Garda pay and allowances for BSE related duties on the Border could cost up to £25 million.  Both of these steps were essential to safeguard the beef industry.</P>
    <P>In a limited number of cases, the Government decided to authorise additional spending where it felt this was essential.  The anti-crime package is an example.</P>
    <P>There are also pressures on health and social welfare spending.  On health, the main pressure arises on demand-led schemes such as the community drugs schemes.  The nature of these schemes is such that it is difficult to estimate costs accurately.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, the main overrun relates to the payment of the Christmas bonus at an estimated additional cost of £38 million in gross spending.  The falling trend in the live register will help to contain this cost.  Additional PRSI buoyancy will ensure that net social welfare spending will come in on or about budget.</P>
    <P>The percentage increase in net spending, and the consequential impact on the budget, will not be as great as that in gross spending because the extra costs on agriculture will be part funded by the EU, and PRSI receipts are very buoyant.  In addition, it is expected there will be further offsetting savings on other Votes.</P>
    <P>My Department's latest assessment is that these pressures could mean that gross current supply services spending may be slightly over £200 million more than the budget provision.</P>
    <P>The only major public service pay elements of this £200 million arise from Garda BSE and anti-crime activities.  Their cost amounts to about £30 million, or 15 per cent of the £200 million approximately.  The EU disallowances, at £70 million, account for a further 35 per cent.  The balance of about £100 million, or 50 per cent, will go on additional services to the public.</P>
    <P>There are normally end-year savings.  Taking account of these, my Department's best estimate is that the 1996 outturn should show an increase of just over 4 per cent in real terms.  EU disallowances and BSE-related expenditure account for more than half of this at about £115 million.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that public expenditure is under control.  There is no loss of determination to constrain spending where this is possible.  The two biggest additions to my budget provision for current spending, the EU disallowances and the BSE measures, were exceptional and unavoidable.</P>

      <P>The main focus in the negotiation of the pay arrangements to follow the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will be competitiveness, which is the key to economic growth, employment and social progress.  Against that background the aim will be to achieve pay moderation and certainty of pay costs, supported by reductions in taxation.  Taxation is intrinsically tied in with the level of public expenditure, of which the public service pay and pensions bill is a major factor.  An increase of 10.5 per cent in public service pay would add an estimated £505 million per year to that bill.  Such an increase, as well as any other additional expenditure commitments sought in the context of a new programme, would, obviously, restrict the resources available for taxation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that if instead of concentrating on gross pay increases of £1.5 billion over three years we concentrated our efforts on tax reductions for everybody, both in the public and private sectors, real take home pay could increase and the scope for tax <Col N="30" /> reductions over those three years would be huge compared with anything that could be possibly contemplated if public sector trade unions demand a gross increase of £1.5 billion over those three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The presentation yesterday by the second secretary in the Department of Finance, Mr. Tutty, to the social partners outlined clearly the advances made over the past three years within which a clear link was drawn between economic growth brought about by an improved competitive position and enhanced take home pay, including tax reductions.  There is a quantifiable lesson in that for everybody, irrespective of where they work or would like to work in our economy, that a combination of pay moderation and real tax reductions can leave money in people's pockets and can enhance the prospects of the economy.  I agree with the Deputy that provided we can get that message across, how we share the cake becomes a secondary issue.  The proof is in the existing agreement which delivered far more than anybody would have thought or was projected by the previous second secretary now the secretary of the Department, Mr. Mullarkey, when he made a similar presentation three years ago to a similar group of social partners.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree it is not simply a matter of £505 million pounds in each year, if we are talking about a 3.5 per cent pay deal for each of the three years, because implicit in that deal is local and specialised wage bargaining, special cases and some form of negotiation on productivity and the like?  Will he take this opportunity to indicate that kind of demand as an opening shot in a negotiation is totally inconsistent with making any significant progress over the next three years on tax reform?</P>

      <P>The Deputy in using the clause, &ldquo;that type of demand as an opening shot&rdquo;, has perhaps answered his question.  I do not want to prejudice the outcome of the negotiations, but I will repeat what I said at the initial meeting of the social partners held in Dublin Castle on 23 October.  As Minister with responsibility for the wider public service, including civil servants, and as an employer acting on behalf of the taxpayer, my experience of the local bargaining clauses in the public sector under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has been far from satisfactory.  Experience of the existing agreement must and will inform our attitude to any new agreement in regard to such types of subsidiary arrangements other than the headline agreement that might be arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Over recent years, there have been major changes in the methods of delivering retail financial services, particularly in the use of increasingly sophisticated information technology based systems.  The emergence of telephone banking and plastic money along with the future potential of the electronic purse and the Internet are major factors in this changing environment.  It would be unacceptable if those already disadvantaged were to be precluded from availing of the widespread benefits and convenience of existing retail banking services which many of us take for granted.  Improving access to these services for the whole community is one of the objectives of the Government's policy of creating a more vibrant and competitive retail banking market and the restructuring of the State banking sector.</P>
      <P>Increasing competition in the retail banking services market will help to improve access by reducing the costs of banking services to the consumer.  The initiatives taken by the Government in this regard include the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, the recently published Central Bank Bill, 1996 and the Credit Union Bill which is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.  These changes which, I appreciate, will take time to work through the system, should help to improve the access of the disadvantaged to banking services, by making the system more competitive and responsive to consumer needs.  However, allied to changes in the market and the regulatory environment is the increasing pace of change in the technology itself.</P>
      <P>The ability of today's more sophisticated technology-based systems to deliver a complex range of services to a mass audience at low cost, has the potential to change the face of banking as we know it and to bring many other players into the market without the need for costly branch networks.  These changes will contribute to an environment where banks, building societies and other financial services providers will be seeking to maximise their transaction volumes so as to generate scale economies across their networks. This will result in much wider access and availability of these services without reference to the nature or circumstances of the person seeking to use the service.  The Government will continue to take into account the pace at which retail banking services become available to the disadvantaged and to examine ways in which it can be accelerated.</P>

      <P>That is a matter of great legal dispute.  If the Deputy had participated in the debate in this House prior to 1989 he would realise there is no formal owner of TSB.  There is an owner of the proceeds in the event that it is disposed of but as regards control&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This question is about making banking more accessible to the unemployed and those on low incomes.  When the Minister was in the Department of Enterprise and Employment much work was done on the credit union Bill. There is great indecision and turmoil in the Labour Party on this issue, with some backbenchers suggesting that the credit unions should be amalgamated into the third banking force.  We are all lobbied by the credit union movement and I am concerned about the Bill. Will the Minister admit that the confusion on the third banking force is causing a delay on the credit union Bill?  Are the rumours true that we will get a half-baked credit union Bill, with some proposed sections dropped?  Will the Minister move away from the ideological issue so that it does not mess up the credit union movement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very pertinent question and I will try to answer it as briefly as I can.  The credit union Bill has been a long time in gestation and I regret the delay, part of which has been due to factors beyond most people's control.  It is a very large Bill dealing with more than 1.6 million individual members of credit unions, with assets in excess of £2 billion. We want to ensure that the credit union movement, which for many people is a real alternative banking system, is given the best possible legal basis on which it can operate.  No concerns relating to the so-called ideological issues to which the Deputy referred have altered or interfered with the design or bringing forward of the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that for a variety of internal reasons within the relevant Department, with which the Deputy may be familiar, progress on this Bill has not been as satisfactory as we would <Col N="34" /> like.  I am assured, however, that a final draft is nearly ready and I think I am correct in quoting the Taoiseach as saying that it will be published either immediately before Christmas or very soon afterwards.</P>
      <P>That Bill will, <i>inter alia</i>, give to the credit union movement powers to do things it is currently prevented from doing.  That is one of the reasons we want to provide for the credit union movement within the framework of an overall third banking force.  Another factor since this idea was first promoted is the computerisation of the existing 600 post office branches, with a further 529 branches to be computerised, which provide electronic money services, household budgeting and other services that are essential for a section of the community who in the past have been victims of moneylending and have not had the resources to defend themselves.  The intention is to provide access to a range of services they can afford.</P>
      <P>It is not a million years since State employees, officials in the Office of Public Works, were refused permission to cash their cheques in mainstream banks a couple of hundred metres from their place of work in Lad Lane.  In order to avoid that kind of monetary apartheid we want to introduce a system that will, with the use of new technology, which is moving at an incredible pace, enable everybody in society to participate equally.  In introducing such a system consideration will be given to the necessary additional changes the credit union movement will need on top of those it sought when the Bill was first proposed.</P>
      <P>I was responsible for this matter for two years and I regret, as does the present Minister in that Department, the slowness of progress with the legislation, but notwithstanding the internal problems we are now in a position to bring forward the Bill, publication and design of which have nothing to do with any extraneous factors to which the Deputy referred.</P>

Could I put it to the Minister that the dead hand of Government in that time has significantly affected the TSB's opportunities for expansion in the banking world, has had a serious effect on the morale of staff etc. and that it is very unfair, nearly dishonest at this stage, of Government to have made no decision about a bank that has had opportunities but has been prevented from moving in any direction because of Government indecision?</P>

      <P>In response to my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, on 25 September 1996 regarding the possible sale of the TSB, the Minister said that this is a delicate and complex matter.  Did he have in mind the delicacy of the matter as it relates to the reported difficulties between himself and the Tánaiste regarding his proposals and the Tánaiste's objections to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I had in mind the very delicate and complex matter that while the State is the beneficiary of the proceeds we cannot in any way legally write the conditions under which it is sold, nor can we write conditions into the clause that protects the interests of the customers and staff.  Getting an agreement by way of privately arranged sale which was originally proposed when Deputy McCreevy and I shared the same Government benches would, were I to bring that proposal to the floor of this House, leave me open to legitimate criticism from everyone in this House.  It could have been said that I had acquiesced to a sale which had not been subject to the normal scrutiny of public tender and had not taken into account the interests of either the staff or the customers.</P>
      <P>I must have regard to the legalities of the situation which were put in place by a Government of which Deputy McCreevy's party was part.  Legislation was enacted in 1989 which gave the Minister of the day no control over the direction in which that bank could go other than to be the end beneficiary of the proceeds.  I am trying to deal with that situation which of its complex nature is highly delicate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax reductions in the years 1994 to 1996 were an important element in securing economic and social consensus over those years, and they will also be important in consolidating and building on that progress in 1997 and the years beyond.  The creation of the budgetary headroom for such concessions will require that an appropriate balance be struck between taxation and public expenditure.</P>
      <P>In the context of the discussions on a new national programme, it is important that all sides agree on the right mix of policies that will, among other things, deliver a competitive Irish economy and strong economic growth; ensure that there will be positive fruits of economic growth to be shared equitably; allow Government to continue to reduce the level of debt and the burden this places on all members of society through an exorbitant interest bill; allow enterprise, employment and the general wellbeing of our society to grow and flourish; ensure that Ireland is in a position to qualify for economic and monetary union and all the benefits that this, through lower interest rates and transaction costs, will bring to our economy; and allow Government to tackle the problems of social exclusion and to make Ireland a better place for all our citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's answer with which we all agree, is tax reduction over the next few years, from his preliminary discussions with the social partners, to be a central plank in a negotiation of the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work?</i> Gross income is irrelevant as a measurement of prosperity or real wealth for any citizen.  Net income is the real measurement of wealth because the gap has become so big between the two.  We are all of that view.  Has the Minister got a sense from his preliminary discussions with the social partners, given the mix he has to deal with, that real effort to change and restructure taxation across a range of issues, not just a simplistic tax reduction which is not really tax reform, is central to what might form a real substantive successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the inaugural meeting in Dublin Castle we had for the first time people who were not part of the traditional social partnership, whose absence had been criticised by different parties on previous occasions.  We had groups such as the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, CORI and others who said in their contributions to the opening debate that agreement to public sector pay agreements and agreements between employers and employees <Col N="37" /> where they had a tax impact would have a consequence on those social groups which will be affected by what is left in the kitty for social distribution.</P>
      <P>We cannot award ourselves large nominal increases if the funding of those increases requires additional or currently maintained levels of taxation.  That would disimprove our competitive position in a rapidly increasingly competitive world.  If we do this we will have less money available for the things that most of us in this House want to do.  The conclusion, irrespective of what point of the ideological spectrum you start from, is that real take home pay will be determined substantially by tax reduction and that space has to be made within the overall macroeconomic parameters for realistic tax reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Within that context, has the Minister some concerns about our competitive position?  That is the key element that has improved in the past few years.  Concerns have been raised by the governor of the Central Bank and others recently about that position and whether we will be able to sustain it in coming years.  I am interested in the Minister's opinion that competitiveness and what we have achieved by that has been largely due to restraining public expenditure and the tax reductions that we have been able to make.</P>
      <P>Without competitiveness we have nothing and all the other points he has made, valid as they are, are as naught unless that central competitiveness is achieved to sustain and increase the number of jobs which we must keep creating within this economy.  We do not have the space available in other European economics, for different demographic reasons.  We must create large numbers of jobs on an annual basis and competitiveness is the key to doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the measure was simply our ability to create additional jobs, we would not have a problem.  We know we have a problem. We have to ensure that those people who are driving this economy and creating the wealth receive more sustained incentives for working as hard and as productively as they do.  That clearly is manifest in the wish for an increase in real take home pay.  The most effective way to increase real take home pay for all of us, whether we work in the public or the private sector, is to improve productivity by ensuring that our competitive costs do not rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex area, but one of the simplest ways to achieve that is to reduce the overall burden of taxation, specifically the level of income tax, in particular in those sectors of the productive workforce where the cross over between dependency on social welfare in its entirely and gainful employment in the economy is of such marginal benefit that some people choose not to bother to make that change.  That is the focus of attention.  I will send a copy of the presentation made on behalf of the Government <Col N="38" /> by Michael Tutty, the Second Secretary of the Department of Finance to every Deputy.  It outlines in statistical and total terms the progress that has been made.  By inference, it gives an indication of the kind of progress that could be made with the next agreement, if we get one and the discipline to which we all subscribe is adhered to.</P>
    <P>I have said in and outside the House and repeat that neither I as Minister and my party nor this Government claim ownership of the economic success we are currently enjoying.  It is the product of successive agreements and the full participation of all the social partners.  Unless we continue to recognise that ownership of that success is shared by all of us we will not be able to build a secure foundation for a future agreement.  It is quite clear that a reduction in personal income tax depends, among other things, on the stabilisation of public expenditure. We cannot have increased levels of public expenditure, including high levels of public sector pay on one hand and tax reductions on the other, and fit within the macroeconomic framework to which we all subscribe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question posed was whether a combination of public expenditure control and tax reduction would play a significant role in formulating the next <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The Minister has said here and on other occasions that there must be firm control on public expenditure.  Will the Minister agree that in reply to an earlier question he said the commitment as laid down in the programme, A Government of Renewal for the lifetime of this Government will not be met?  It was not met in 1995, it will not be met in 1996 and, in reply to Question No. 16, the Minister said it will not be met in 1997.  The Minister must agree that without firm control of public expenditure and if commitments made in the programme for Government are thrown out, it gives very little credibility to any commitments to long-term improvements in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy asked that question because I answered this clearly in an extensive reply to the second priority question. Regrettably, there was no chance to put supplementary questions but there is nothing to stop the Deputy putting those questions again.  I itemised the areas, approximately £200 million out of £12,087 million, very clearly.  Of that extra £200 million, 15 per cent went on pay, mostly for policing the Border for BSE and for the Garda Síochána in relation to the crime package this year; £72 million of that £200 million went on EU fines, for which we had made provision elsewhere for £50 million.  In accountancy terms, and I bow to the Deputy's superior knowledge in this area, the full £72 million comes into that £200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Christmas bonus of £38 million for social welfare which we have built into regular policy will be funded from the buoyancy of that area. The additional costs we incurred above and <Col N="39" /> beyond what I provided for the Government in last year's budget have largely arisen because of the BSE crisis and the crime package.  If an Opposition Deputy thinks the Government should absorb those additional costs for the farmers and the citizens on crime and at the same time stick to the figures from last budget day by reducing current account costs in health, education, environment or anywhere else then he or she should show me where to reduce them.  I openly say there is an overrun of £200 million and have given the reasons.  If someone feels we should not have that overrun or that we should have found it somewhere else to balance our books in accordance with the position on budget day, then that person should show me where.</P>

Instead of saying that if there is so much money available for public sector pay then there will be less available for taxation, why not invert the process to say that this will be the tax package and that the money available for public sector pay and increased public spending is now the residual.  The Government should be committed to this tax package over the life of the programme.  Why does the Minister not turn the argument around and point out to the public sector unions that public sector pay increases take second place to tax reductions to which the Minister is committed?</P>

Is the Minister now telling us that commitment is not worth the paper it is written on and that for as long as we have good economic times, we will <Col N="40" /> spend and spend, not caring about the consequences?  There will be consequences and a future Government will have to take drastic measures in that regard.  The pain will be suffered in the main by those for whom the Minister's party expresses concern.  People at the lower end of the scale bear the brunt of corrective measures. The Minister's party is spending and spending.</P>

      <P>An IRA ceasefire is important because it is the means by which we can have all party negotiations, including Sinn Féin.  It is important that the ceasefire is unequivocal and one on which there is no going back.  It is important that is made clear in the way in which <Col N="42" /> it is framed, if it occurs.  It is for the Republican movement to convince us in the terms it uses, that a restored ceasefire is unequivocal.  As the Tánaiste said, the terms of an announced ceasefire will be an important and decisive factor.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that it is not wise to think in terms of creating a new peace process as some people have suggested.  A peace process and a talks process is already available.  The current talks process represents the result of painstaking work over many months.  It contains a number of elements which did not exist in any previous talks process such as independent chairpersons, ground rules which are fair to all and a sufficient consensus rule which does not allow a majority to overrule the views of a minority.  The process is designed to facilitate the inclusion of all parties, including Sinn Féin, and as Deputy Bertie Ahern said, transition from policies which included the use of violence to policies which exclude it.  It is with such care that the Mitchell principles were devised.</P>
      <P>I hope we will have a ceasefire which will enable the discussion to include all parties. Everybody must exercise his responsibilities in this matter and make the necessary efforts to understand and accommodate the concerns of others and to deal with their fears.  In that regard, the efforts made by Mr. John Hume, in particular, to bring about a ceasefire have been helpful and useful and have the full support of the Government.  His efforts are continuing with the constant involvement and support of the Government.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach in hoping there will be a renewed IRA ceasefire.  There was never any justification for violence nor is there now.  It is time the Republican movement made up its mind and chose between politics and violence.  These are not interchangeable tactics. We have all party talks and it is important that nobody has a veto in that talks process, whether it is the Provisional IRA or the Unionists.  It is equally important that the process is not stalled and that it moves on to deal with the substantive agenda.  There is a huge onus on the constitutional parties to ensure that process works because when constitutional politics fails, the vacuum is inevitably filled by the men of violence who use it as an excuse.  Mr. John Hume, the two Governments and everyone involved have our support in seeking a full restoration of the ceasefire so everyone can be at the talks which is what we always wished.  People have excluded themselves from the talks because of their support for and continuous condoning of violence as a way to achieve their political ends.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach said.  When he referred to people speaking about a new process, he did not talk about anyone on the Fianna Fáil benches because we did not refer to that.  Many people outside the House continuously talk about the word &ldquo;permanence&rdquo;. The Mitchell principles are the new factor.  If <Col N="43" /> there is a ceasefire, the IRA, or Sinn Féin being its political representative, would have to sign the Mitchell principles which would link it to paragraphs 32 to 38 of the principles.  It is not necessary to argue about these issues as we did in the spring and autumn 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to any party in the House when I spoke about people talking about recreating a new peace process.  As every party in this House recognises, we have open to all a peace process and a talks process into which a great deal of work has gone, founded on the Mitchell principles and the ground rules document.  No aspect of the problem is excluded in discussions and no party has a veto on what may be discussed.</P>
      <P>The passport for entry into the talks is the abandonment of violence.  There cannot be a two track process where violence is used part of the time or its use is retained as an option.  The Mitchell principles clearly exclude any option for any participant to revert to violence at any time. They are unambiguous and exacting in the demands they make on those who sign up.  The Mitchell principles are not an empty formula; they are extremely demanding and require wholehearted commitment.  Once that commitment is made, the talks process is open.  It is a fully inclusive process from which no subject is excluded.</P>

It would be scandalous for us to proceed with this legislation without the House having seen the details of this proposed sell off and without knowing the exact price and the conditions involved.

      <P>The working time directive is scheduled to clear the House by 24 November. If it is being delayed until next year, that is new information to the workers and employers who are interested in it.  Legislation covering superannuation for State workers, including the Civil Service, local authorities, health boards, the Garda Síochána, the Army and others, provides that whenever a grade gets an increase relevant pensioners also get it.  It has been brought to my attention by many Fianna Fáil Deputies that various grades of staff have been told that, regardless of what is achieved in the negotiations taking place under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> on restructuring, pensioners will not receive their increase.  One letter from the Department of Health to our spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and other letters I have seen make it clear that there is uncertainty in this regard.  This is creating great anxiety for pensioners and widows and widowers of pensioners.  Will the Minister clarify the matter?

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Central Bank Bill provides for a range of new measures relating to the powers and obligations of the bank.  The main Acts relating to the Central Bank are the Central Bank Acts, 1942, 1971 and 1989.  The last major revision of Central Bank legislation was the 1989 Act which, as well as updating the charter of the bank itself, also extended considerably the powers of the bank to supervise banks and other financial institutions and introduced a deposit protection scheme for depositors.</P>
      <P>The present Bill includes provisions relating to payment systems and cross-border credit transfers, as well as dealing with a number of other matters in Central Bank legislation which require updating and amendment.  These include provision for the accountability of the Governor of the bank, extension of the bank's supervision and enforcement powers, including new provisions for the supervision of <i>bureaux de change,</i> and a number of miscellaneous technical provisions.</P>
      <P>A limited number of amendments are included to ensure compatibility with certain defined provisions of the Treaty on European Union, which took effect with the start of the second stage of European Monetary Union on 1 January 1994.  However, the Bill does not address the legal issues arising from the move to stage 3 of European Monetary Union.  Although extensive preparatory work has been done on the legislation required in connection with the move to stage 3 of European Monetary Union it would be premature to finalise it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 108 of the Treaty requires each member state to ensure, at the latest by the date of the establishment of the European System of Central Banks, that their central bank legislation is compatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.  With stage 3 of European Monetary Union commencing on 1 January 1999, this will be early 1998.  The legal division of the European Monetary Institute is currently drafting guidelines for the adaptation of central bank legislation in all member states to Treaty provisions.  It is not yet clear when these guidelines will be finalised. It has been decided to wait until these guidelines are available before legislating for stage 3 of European Monetary Union.  The EMI has been <Col N="49" /> consulted and they have agreed with this approach.  Therefore, the Bill now before the House is largely a technical one.</P>
    <P>As the volume and speed of large-value payments messages has been increasing, their speedy settlement at central banks has become more and more important.  This has led to an increasing concern world-wide about the settlement process for these payments and the systemic risk implications resulting from the possible inability of a bank to settle its payments obligations at a central bank.  This concern led to a group of payments and settlements experts, representing EU central banks, producing a report which recommended a set of standards for the settlement of large-value payments.</P>
    <P>There is a major drive in Europe to standardise and co-ordinate national initiatives in this area. The Central Bank has been involved in this process and has committed itself to installing a real time gross settlement system in Ireland by the end of 1996.  The essential feature of RTGS is that the settlement of a payment instruction and its transmission to the receiving bank are simultaneous.  Currently, seven of our EU partners operate RTGS and all but two of the rest have committed themselves to having it in operation by the end of 1996.  The other two will have RTGS in 1997.</P>
    <P>From a competitiveness point of view, it is important that the processing of Irish large-value payments is at least equal to that of the other EU member states.  Also, from a purely prudential point of view, RTGS would reduce substantially the systemic risk associated with the system of end-of-day settlements currently operating in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Central Bank to oversee the collection of cheques and other payable orders by licensed banks are contained in section 26 of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  While these powers have been of service, they are limited in scope to three licensed banks and to the terms and conditions and rates of charges applied to the collection of such cheques and instruments.  The Central Bank has no role in the approval of payment systems nor a direct right of supervision and intervention. The growth of international trade, the size of daily settlements, the increased use of electronic payments and the volatility of trade flows have caused individual central banks to take steps to address the various risks arising in their own domestic payment systems, in particular the risk of default, breakdown and liquidity shortage which would have grave implications for the security and stability of the banking system.</P>
    <P>Similar steps are now required in Ireland, particularly for large-value transactions.  The current payments system which has served well to date is not properly equipped to respond adequately to the increasing pace of change in money transmission services.  Discussions on the restructuring of the current system have been ongoing for some time and are at an advanced stage.  The Government is particularly concerned <Col N="50" /> to ensure that payment systems in the State are effective, efficient and open and that the systems themselves do not add to, or cause, instability in the operation of financial markets.  To this end, in addition to facilitating the introduction of RTGS, the Bill provides for a significant change in the area of payment systems generally.  In brief, the bank will be given the power, for the first time, to approve the establishment of payment systems and vet their rules.  These powers will also apply in the case of existing payment systems.</P>
    <P>Apart from those which form part of a bank's operations, <i>bureaux de change</i> have been effectively outside the scope of any official supervision since the abolition of exchange controls some years ago.  The need to introduce a supervisory regime at this point arises from our international commitments in the area of money laundering.  The Financial Action Task Force of the OECD, the international body set up to combat money laundering, has strongly recommended that those countries which do not currently supervise <i>bureaux de change</i> should do so because of their potential use in the money laundering chain.  While we are not bound to follow the views of the FATF in this matter, failure to do so would undoubtedly leave Ireland open to criticism.</P>
    <P>The Government has, therefore, decided to include provisions in the Bill to give the bank the appropriate powers of supervision.  These provisions are based very closely on existing provisions relating to the supervision of moneybrokers as set out in Chapter IX of the Central Bank Act 1989 and will require <i>bureaux de change</i> to be authorised by the Central Bank with the standard provisions regarding appeal to the Minister for Finance where the bank proposes either to withhold or revoke an authorisation. The degree of supervision of the operations of <i>bureaux de change</i> would largely be a matter for the discretion of the Central Bank under a general framework set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, contains a list of investments in which trustees are empowered to invest.  It gives to the Minister for Finance power to designate other investments or to delete investments.  This is done by ministerial order.  Such orders require a motion approving them to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The list of investments which are currently designated is largely confined to fixed-rate securities, bank or building society deposits and a small number of unit trusts whose investments are restricted to Government securities and bank or building society deposits. The only equities on the list are the shares of the two main banks &mdash; Bank of Ireland and AIB. Following a request some time ago for the designation of certain other company shares, the existing approach to the designation of trustee investments was reviewed.  It was concluded that the approach adopted to date was no longer appropriate and that a revised approach should be adopted.  This would have the following main features: as far as possible designation should be <Col N="51" /> in respect of categories of investments rather than individual investment products to avoid the appearance of giving an official endorsement to individual products; the powers of trustees should be widened to include investment in equities, whether directly or indirectly, through collective investment schemes; the investment powers of trustees should be subject to certain conditions regarding the level of their foreign and equity investments.</P>
    <P>While the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, gives the Minister for Finance power to amend the list of investments by order, it does not give him power to impose conditions on the investment powers of trustees.  Provisions in this Bill amend the 1958 Act to give the Minister this power.  The requirement in the 1958 Act that each order made under it must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas is also being removed. Effectively, a legislative procedure is required for what is essentially a regulatory matter.  Instead of the requirement for the passing of a motion approving ministerial orders made under the 1958 Act, the normal procedure which is used for orders made under the Central Bank Acts i.e. that they are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and become effective unless an annulling resolution is passed within a specified time, is being inserted.  These are, essentially, enabling and simplifying provisions.</P>
    <P>Several other matters requiring attention are also incorporated in the Bill.  The extension of the supervisory and enforcement powers of the bank is proposed to bring them up to date with best current practices.  Provision for the accountability of the bank is also included.  The Bill also provides for the formation or acquisition by the bank of subsidiary companies.  A number of the central banks enjoy such a facility.  The provision is an enabling one only, and the exercise of this power by the bank will require the prior permission of the Minister for Finance whose approval will also be necessary for the terms of the memorandum and articles of association of any such company.  The Bill also provides for the amendment of certain provisions of a number of Acts.</P>
    <P>I will now move on to a more detailed description of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the usual provisions on citation, interpretation, regulations and repeal clauses. Part II provides for authorising the establishment and supervising the operation of payment systems in the State.  Briefly, these provisions will require all payment systems to be approved, and have their rules vetted, by the Central Bank.  The bank may impose conditions on approval, revoke approval and issue directions to the system or its members.  In circumstances where the bank proposes to refuse or revoke approval, an appeal may be made to the Minister for Finance.  This will complement the capacity of the Competition Authority and the European Commission to examine the competitiveness of any proposed arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Part III gives authority for the formation or acquisition of subsidiary bodies by the bank.  The provision is an enabling one only, and the exercise of this power by the bank will require the prior permission of the Minister for Finance, whose approval will be necessary for the terms of the memorandum and articles of association of any such company.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the accountability of the Governor of the Central Bank, while having due regard to the independence of the bank.  It provides for the attendance by the Governor of the Central Bank, if so requested, before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and the furnishing to that committee with such information as it may request.  Provisions are also included in relation to the provision of advice and assistance to the Central Statistics Office in relation to the compilation of balance of payments statistics as well as minor amendments concerning the terms and tenure of office of the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Part V provides for the supervision, by the bank, of <i>bureaux de change.</i>  Part VI amends a number of provisions of the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1989, the Cheques Act, 1959, the Building Societies Act, 1989, the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, and a number of other enactments.  I will now turn to the detail of these changes.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 are the usual short title and interpretation provisions.  Whereas these usually do not call for any special comment I would like to make particular mention of section 2 (2) which defines &ldquo;deposit&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Banking business&rdquo; is defined essentially as the taking of deposits.  There is, however, no Irish legal definition of what constitutes a deposit.  It seems incredible that we have come this far without a definition.  As the savings market becomes more competitive, the distinction between deposits and other forms of investment is becoming blurred and the lack of a legal definition of a deposit is causing concern. This anomaly caused particular concern during a recent successful prosecution of a finance company by the Central Bank.  Section 2 (2) provides for such a definition to be incorporated in Irish law by means of an amendment to section 27 of the 1971 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the laying of regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 4 sets out the legislation being repealed by this Bill. In particular the section provides for the repeal of sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Central Bank Act, 1942.  These sections deal with &ldquo;associated Banks&rdquo; and as this term no longer applies these sections are not required.</P>
    <P>Section 5 defines &ldquo;payment system&rdquo; and &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill.  Section 6 allows the bank to become a member of, or be a party to the establishment or operation of a payment system.  Section 7 provides that no new payment system can be established without the prior agreement of the bank.  Section 8 deals with existing payment systems and provides that, within three months of the passing of this Act, the rules of existing payment systems must be <Col N="53" /> approved by the bank or the system will be deemed to be disestablished.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the Central Bank may approve the rules of a payment system subject to conditions or requirements and that the application for approval may be in such form as the Central Bank may determine.  It also provides that the approval by the Central Bank of the rules of a payment system does not constitute a warranty of the solvency of the system.</P>
    <P>Section 10 outlines the procedure where the bank proposes to refuse to approve of the rules of a payment system.  Section 11 provides that the provisions of section 17 of the Act of 1971, which relates to the keeping of books and records, shall apply to payment systems and members of payments systems as if they were holders of a banking licence.  Section 12 empowers the bank to direct a system, or any member of a system, to cease activity, or to cease operating as a member as the case may be, in certain circumstances.  The section provides for an application to the courts, by the bank &mdash; for confirmation of a direction under this section &mdash; or by a payment system, or members thereof, for the setting aside of a direction.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the revocation of approval by the bank of the rules of a system in certain circumstances, subject to the agreement of the Minister.  It also sets out the procedure to be followed by the system in these circumstances. Section 14 is an offences and penalties provision. Section 15 allows the bank to impose certain requirements for membership of a payments system.  Section 16 amends section 26 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, which deals with the collection of cheques.  The powers of the Central Bank to oversee the collection of cheques and other payable orders by licensed banks are contained in that section.  While these powers have been of service, they are limited in scope to licensed banks and to the terms and conditions and rates of charges applied to the collection of such cheques and instruments.  This amendment allows the bank to extend the scope of section 26 to other parties or instruments and extends the meaning of licence holder to include a credit institution within the meaning of Regulation 2 of the European Communities (Licensing and Supervision of Credit Institutions) Regulations, 1992, Sl No. 395 of 1992, i.e. any undertaking, other than a credit union or friendly society, whose business it is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credit on its own account.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the Minister may, after consulting with the bank, prescribe fees to be paid by all entities supervised by the bank under any enactment.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that once payments have been debited from a credit institution's account in the Central Bank on the instructions of the credit institution concerned, the payment becomes final. This is to ensure that once payments have entered a payment system they cannot be revoked. <Col N="54" /> Revocation of a large value payment could result in the unwinding of a number of other related payments within the system and this could have serious consequences for the system as a whole.</P>
    <P>Section 19 allows payment instructions and authorisations to and from the Central Bank to be of a form other than in writing.  This allows for electronic, or other, transmission of instructions.</P>
    <P>Section 20 substitutes a new section for section 7 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which provides for certain particular powers of the Central Bank. It is necessary to provide the bank with specific powers relating to its increased involvement with payment systems.  The opportunity is also being taken to express other specific powers of the bank in a clearer fashion to better reflect modern practice and conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is a technical provision to allow the Minister transpose into Irish law the proposed EU directive on cross-border credit transfers.</P>
    <P>Section 22 gives authority for the formation or acquisition of subsidiary bodies by the bank subject to the consent of the Minister.  This provision is an enabling one only, and the exercise of this power by the bank will require the prior permission of the Minister for Finance. Approval will also be necessary for the terms of the memorandum and articles of association of any such company.  The functions of any subsidiary company established or acquired under the terms of this section will be restricted to those of the bank, and any guidelines or obligations applicable to the bank will also apply to such companies.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that the Governor shall attend before a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann &mdash; currently the Finance and General Affairs Committee &mdash; and furnish that committee with any information requested, having due regard to the independence of the bank and subject to any restrictions imposed on the Governor under the Central Bank Acts, for example, the confidentiality provisions of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  This statutory obligation on the Governor to attend before the committee will replace the informal arrangement which is currently in place and the terms of reference of the committee will have to be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 24 empowers the bank to assist the Central Statistics Office in the collection, compilation, analysis or interpretation of balance of payments, national accounts or any other financial statistics including, where appropriate, the actual collection of data for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 25 amends section 19 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which deals with the appointment and tenure of office of the Governor of the Central Bank and extends the prohibition on the Governor from being a director of a licensed bank to all commercial credit institutions, financial institutions or insurance undertakings.  This is in view of the bank's new role in supervising a wide range of other financial institutions under recent legislation, for example, the building societies, TSB, ACC, and ICC Acts, <Col N="55" /> as well as the Stock Exchange and Investment Intermediaries Acts.  The section makes it clear that the prohibition does not apply to the Governor being a member of the European Monetary Institute.  Furthermore, the prohibition does not apply to shares held by the Governor in any commercial credit or financial institution by means of an insurance policy, ordinary savings account with a building society, or units in other collective investment schemes purchased by him or her, although we will be waiting for that.</P>
    <P>Section 26 amends section 20 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which prohibits the holding of shares by the Governor in a bank, and extends that prohibition to credit institutions, financial institutions or insurance undertakings.  Section 27 is an interpretation and definition section.</P>
    <P>Section 28 makes it illegal to carry on the business of a <i>bureau de change</i> without authorisation from the Central Bank and sets out the procedure involved in the grant or refusal of an authorisation by the Central Bank.  This section also provides that existing operations will have a period of six months after this section comes into operation to obtain authorisation from the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 29 requires <i>bureau de change</i> businesses to comply with any requirement laid down by the Central Bank.  Section 30 applies the provisions of section 17 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, to <i>bureaux de change</i> in relation to the keeping of books and records.</P>
    <P>Section 31 outlines the powers of the court to deal with failure by a <i>bureau de change</i> to comply with a requirement or condition of the Central Bank.  Proceedings may be held otherwise than in public if the court consents.  Section 32 requires the Central Bank to publish a list of <i>bureaux de change</i> once a year and to publish notice of any revocation of an authorisation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 33 is an offences and penalties provision.  Section 34 relates to the revocation of authorisation of a <i>bureau de change</i> by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank must seek the consent of the Minister to the revocation unless the revocation has been requested by the person who was authorised or where the revocation is as a consequence of the withdrawal of authorisation by another member state of the Community in which the bureau has its head office.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with various miscellaneous provisions.  Sections 35 and 36 amend the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, and the Cheques Act, 1959, to confer legal status on cheques marked &ldquo;account payee only&rdquo;.  This will help to counteract fraud and should also ensure more speedy transfer of cheques to recipients.  Section 35 also provides an indemnity to banks arising from any refusal to cash the cheque or to transfer the cheque to another in pursuance of an endorsement on the cheque to that effect.</P>
    <P>These provisions have been requested by the Insurance Industry Federation, the IIF.  The IIF wishes to ensure that cheques made out to <Col N="56" /> policyholders and transmitted via insurance brokers etc. must be handed on to the client and cannot be converted in any way to the use of the intermediary.  The federation believes that this is a basic safeguard for the ordinary investor and will reduce considerably the fraudulent conversion of clients' money.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides that a uniform term of office of five years from date of appointment will apply to all directors of the bank, other than service directors.  At present, section 24 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, prescribes a term of office of five years from the expiry of the term of office of the previous incumbent.  Where a new director is appointed during the term of office of his predecessor the term lasts only until the term of office of his predecessor would have expired. These provisions are unnecessarily cumbersome and have led to difficulties and uncertainty in practice if there has been a delay in filling a vacancy.</P>
    <P>The section, therefore, provides that a uniform term of office of five years from date of appointment will apply to all directors including the current directors.  In the case of a service director on the board, that director will have no set period of office but will hold office at the pleasure of the Minister and may be removed at any time.  The only current service director is the Secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 38 amends section 28(2) of the Central Bank Act, 1942, transferring responsibility for notifying the Minister of vacancies on the board from the board to the secretary of the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 39 extends the provisions of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which relates to non-disclosure of information by the bank. Various amendments facilitate the disclosure of information in relation to the conveyance of statistical information to the Central Statistics Office, the disclosure by the bank of information received from another regulatory authority where that authority has given permission, the ability of the bank to request information from entities it supervises in response to requests for such information from regulatory authorities outside the State, the bank's obligations under the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and the conveyance of information to the European Monetary Institute in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 40 applies the duties of auditors, as set out in section 47 of the 1989 Act, to all entities, financial institutions, exchanges and moneybroking businesses supervised by the bank. The effect of this amendment is such that auditors of entities supervised by the bank will be required to furnish information to the bank in certain specified circumstances, namely, where the auditor comes across matters likely to affect the solvency of the entity; where there are material deficiencies in the financial systems of control; where there are material inaccuracies or omissions in returns to the bank, or where the auditor proposes to qualify his or her certificate. The auditor must also notify the bank if he or she <Col N="57" /> proposes to resign as auditor.  The bank may also seek specific information from the auditor in relation to the affairs of the entity.</P>
    <P>Section 41 facilitates the protection of the payment system in the event of a liquidation by requiring that the Central Bank be notified of any petition for winding-up before the petition is presented.  In a number of countries there exists a provision in law called the &ldquo;zero-hour rule&rdquo; whereby a liquidator of a defaulting bank can ask the courts to set aside all financial transactions and payments made by the bank between the time the liquidator was appointed and the previous midnight, zero hour.  Among EU authorities there is a general concern to involve the central bank at an early stage so as to limit the potential damage to payment systems of any such rulings.  There is no precedent for such a ruling in Ireland but it is not precluded.  The requirement that the bank be notified of any petition for winding-up before the petition is presented should ensure the protection of the payments system in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 42 extends the provisions of section 75 (2) of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which sets out the application of Chapter VI of that Act dealing with acquiring transactions, to include acquiring transactions entered into with the prior approval of the Central Bank, Section 43 amends section 76 of that Act, which sets out the limitations on the validity of acquiring transactions.  This provides that in all cases a person can apply to the High Court to seek relief from the null and void provision where the failure to get the bank's prior approval for an acquisition arose from inadvertence or oversight and where the circumstances are such that, had the Central Bank been notified in time, it would have given its approval.  These sections of the 1989 Act require that any person proposing to acquire 10 per cent or more of the shares of an Irish bank must obtain the prior approval of the Central Bank.  If no such approval is sought or obtained, any acquisition is null and void and title to the shares involved does not pass to the new holder.</P>
    <P>Section 44 amends section 90 of the 1989 Act, which relates to the supervision by the Central Bank of firms established in the International Financial Services Centre to allow the bank to enforce its supervision from an earlier date specified by the bank.  Under the existing legislation, Central Bank supervision commences when the tax certificate is issued by the Minister. However, several firms operate in the centre in advance of receiving the certificate.  This section allows the bank to enforce its supervision from an earlier date specified by the bank, for example, the date on which a firm's application to set up in the centre is accepted.  The practice whereby firms are approved in principle and start operations prior to certification has become well established and the supervisory law must recognise this.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that the Minister may, by order, exempt certain firms or services in the IFSC from supervision by the bank.  Section 46 <Col N="58" /> allows the bank to exempt certain firms or services from the application of supervisory requirements in part or in full where the application of such requirements is not practicable or necessary to safeguard the public or the reputation of the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides that where a firm in the IFSC has had its certificate withdrawn it will, nonetheless, remain subject to supervision and direction by the Central Bank until it has discharged its liabilities in whole or in part to the satisfaction of the bank.  This will ensure that the bank retains supervisory control over these firms during the winding-up process.</P>
    <P>Section 48 amends section 104 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which relates to the publication of prospectuses by the promoters of any new financial futures or options exchange in the State. The amendment empowers the bank to require any such promoter to put a &ldquo;health warning&rdquo; on the prospectus to the effect that, if such be the case, the exchange has not yet been approved by the bank and that such approval should not be taken for granted.  Section 49 amends section 139 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to enable the Central Bank to engage in the provision of settlement facilities for the buying and selling of securities and other instruments by financial institutions and to act as a depository or custodian of such securities and instruments.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 to 54 delete provisions in Irish law which conflict with Article 104 of the Treaty on European Union which prohibits monetary financing of the public sector by central banks. Section 55 provides that no employee or member of the board of the bank will be liable for damages for anything done or omitted in the discharge of duty unless it is shown that the omission or act was in bad faith.  This provision is similar to ones incorporated in the recent Stock Exchange and Investment Intermediaries Acts and is designed to bring the Central Bank Acts into line with those enactments.  Section 56 is consequential on section 2(2) and provides for an adjustment of the definition of &ldquo;Banking Business&rdquo; contained in section 29 of the 1989 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 57 amends section 11 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, to allow the Central Bank to revoke a banker's licence if the bank organises its business or corporate structure in such a way as to avoid or escape effective supervision by the bank.  This amendment caters for the lacuna in prudential supervision shown up by the BCCI affair in the UK.  In this case the BCCI organised its operations so as to divide them among a number of states and thus avoid and confound effective financial supervision by any one state.</P>
    <P>Section 58 amends section 48 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, which allows the Central Bank to issue bonds to licence holders by extending the facility to issue bonds to all credit institutions which, of course, includes building societies.  It is desirable to extend this definition in the interests of consistency with the wider supervisory role of the bank.  Section 59 provides relief to the Bank of Ireland, at its request, from certain restrictions <Col N="59" /> imposed by its charter and by legislation.  Section 60 provides for the conferring on the Central Bank of a statutory power to apply to the civil courts for an injunction in respect of the taking of, or advertising for, deposits by a person not licensed or authorised to do so under the Central Bank, building societies, TSB, ACC or ICC Acts. A recent prosecution by the bank against a finance company, although successful, highlighted a weakness in the bank's powers.  The offence related to the advertising for deposits by a company which had no authorisation to do so.  A substantial delay occurred between the date on which the advertisement was first noted by the bank and the final hearing of the prosecution, during which time the bank had no power to prohibit the company from accepting deposits. This section seeks to overcome this delay by way of the injunction procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 61 confers on the bank the same powers of inspection as provided for in the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  That Act conferred on the bank strong powers of inspection of certain investment business firms. This measure was designed as a reaction to the growing number of firms engaging in nonlegitimate investment business.  The banking sector does not have comparable regulation of potentially illegal deposit takers and there is a genuine concern that some firms, particularly those which heretofore operated investment business, may turn their attention to the banking area where they may perceive a legislative weakness.  This section will remove that weakness.</P>
    <P>Section 62 is consequential on section 61 and provides that a judge of the District Court may issue a warrant authorising a member of the Garda Síochána and any others named in the warrant to enter a specified premises to search for and take possession of documents which an officer of the Central Bank of Ireland believes are held on the premises.  The warrant will have effect for one month from date of issue and any documents seized may be retained for a period of three months or until the conclusion of criminal proceedings.  It will be an offence to obstruct the exercise of the warrant.</P>
    <P>Section 63 provides for the bank to be subject to value-for-money audits under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  In order to facilitate separate arrangements to make the bank accountable to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs an order was made under section 21 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, which had the effect of excluding the bank from examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This order, in turn, had the unintended effect of removing the bank from the list of bodies subject to the value-for-money audit under the Act.  This section provides for the bank to be subject to such audits.</P>
    <P>Section 64 amends section 101(a) of the Building Societies Act, 1989, to provide for more equitable treatment of certain joint account <Col N="60" /> holders as respects voting rights and the issue of free shares in the context of future conversions of building societies.  The need for this amendment arises from experience with the conversion of the Irish Permanent to a public limited company. There was controversy regarding a number of joint account holders who did not qualify for free shares because of the order of the names on an account or shareholding following death or marriage of a joint account holder, even though the joint account would have otherwise met the relevant qualifying criteria, in particular being a shareholder for two years.</P>
    <P>Section 65 imposes a requirement to supply the Minister for the Environment with information and returns for the purposes of his functions in relation to the national housing programme to all credit institutions, which includes banks, and mortgage lenders.  This amendment arises as a consequence of the fact that banks now account for a significant share of the mortgage market. The bank is already permitted to disclose this information in relation to building societies.</P>
    <P>Section 66 amends the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, to enable the Minister for Finance to impose conditions on the investment powers of trustees and the requirement for positive Oireachtas approval of orders made under the Act will be removed in favour of the standard provision that such orders take effect unless annulled by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 67 provides for the last stage of the implementation of the European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations, 1995. These regulations afford protection to customers in the event of the insolvency of a credit institution by providing that their deposits, up to a maximum of 15,000 ECU, will be refunded. Optional exclusions from the cover of the scheme, contained in Annex 1 to the Deposit Guarantees Directive, require primary legislation and thus could not be implemented by the regulations in July 1995.  For example, deposits which will not now be covered by the scheme include those made by financial institutions, insurance companies and collective investment schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 68 is a technical amendment to the ICC Act, 1992, and specifies that references to &ldquo;the Company&rdquo; in section 3(1) of that, or any regulations made thereunder, are to be construed as including any subsidiary of ICC Bank plc.</P>
    <P>Section 69 amends the Stock Transfer Act, 1963, by the substitution for the &ldquo;Gilts Settlement Office&rdquo; of &ldquo;Central Bank of Ireland Securities Settlement Office&rdquo; and provides that the Minister may change the name of that office by regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 70 allows banks from states outside the EU to establish representative offices in the State, subject to certain conditions.  Such offices will not be allowed to accept deposits in the State or provide banking services and may only provide advice and information on the services which are provided from outside the State by the banks in question.  There is no need to cater for the establishment of representative offices by EU <Col N="61" /> banks as such banks already may do so as a result of the implementation of the relevant banking directives.  The existing law is unclear about the status of non-EU representative offices.  Such offices are common in other member states and are a feature of all the main international financial centres.  Apart from helping to fulfil our GATT obligations, this section will open up the facility of a representative office to major US, Japanese and other non-EU banks wishing to establish a presence in the IFSC but which may not wish to seek a banking licence in the State.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her detailed exposition of the Bill.  I am sure it was not a deliberate intention to avoid gender proofing it.  Legislation on the Central Bank is unlikely to raise the temperature of the public. The activities of the bank and the echelons of higher finance are beyond the comprehension of most people.  However, the bank has a pivotal role in the lives of almost all because the decisions it takes on interest rates, monetary policy, etc., directly impinge on the lives of everybody.  Any legislation on the bank deserve serious analysis by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank Act, 1989, was the last legislation in this area.  This Bill is entitled:</P>
      <P>An Act to make provision for the regulation by the Central Bank of Ireland of payment systems and <i>bureaux de change</i>, and to amend and extend the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1989 and other enactments, and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>Over half of the 70 sections to the Bill do not relate to the Central Bank and it is only by the greatest stretch of the imagination that one could describe any or all of the amendments as being related to it.  I am not happy that we should legislate in this way, with over half of the sections falling under a miscellaneous heading, and with some of the earlier sections having no connection with the bank.</P>
      <P>Most of the Bill comprises bitty amendments without any discernible pattern or cohesion.  I understand the desire of the Department of Finance to use the opportunity presented by the Bill to clear up other legislative areas and introduce amendments to other Bills.  This tendency, which is not confined to the Department, is not the correct way to proceed with legislation.  It means that practitioners in given areas face enormous work in researching primary legislation and amendments thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This can sometimes lead to interesting developments, especially in the Finance Acts.  If I recall correctly, nobody paid much attention to a section of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, until a tax consultant used its provisions as a basis on which to establish skilful avoidance schemes.  Others followed over subsequent years.  These allowed the purchase or building on and development of land to create an annuity on same which effectively allowed one to <Col N="62" /> charge the cost of the land many times against the profits of the business.  They were challenged and fought by the Revenue Commissioners until well into the 1980s when a compromise was reached with most of the construction companies involved.  The courts never finally decided who was right.  It is an example of how a section of a Finance Act, not directly related to the area of taxation, was capable of being used in a manner which was unintended.</P>
    <P>This Bill lists Acts referred to which include the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1989, the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, the Cheques Act, 1959, the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882 and the Data Protection Act, 1988.  This makes it difficult to comment on the Minister of State's speech because the expertise and resources required to research such legislation are beyond anybody on this side of the House.  A plethora of officials from the Department of Finance, for whom I have the highest regard, must have been involved in researching these Acts.  It is not a satisfactory way of proceeding with legislation.</P>
    <P>There are some sections about which I have specific concerns, which I will refer to later.  I suspect that the Bill is part of a feather bedding operation to ensure that the Central Bank will have functions to perform in Ireland when most of its traditional or historic jurisdiction will disappear to Frankfurt upon our entering European Monetary Union.  The bank must face the fact that its role will be diminished in a couple of years and it should not now be contemplating diversification with a view to guaranteeing job security.</P>
    <P>All politicians have faced the fact that if and when European Monetary Union occurs the traditional jurisdictional powers of the Central Bank, as with other central banks, will disappear. The Minister of State said that the Bill does not cover the transfer of such power, but that provision for this will be made in a later Bill to be introduced in 1997 or 1998, major legislation for the bank and for whichever Minister brings it to the Oireachtas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of economic and monetary union many of the Central Bank's powers will be transferred to the European Central Bank.  Many of the Bill's provisions are mere feather bedding and give the Central Bank a wide range of new <Col N="63" /> roles because it will lose its traditional ones.  I learnt a great deal about agencies, semi-State operations and the Civil Service while I was Minister.  Ministers may not get excited about losing certain powers to other Departments, but civil servants will convince them &mdash; if they are Ministers for long enough &mdash; that it is more or less a badge of honour for a Minister not to lose powers to another Department.  The Minister is sent to Cabinet fortified by troops and a leak to a newspaper may result in a report that a certain Minister is taking powers from another Minister. This is guaranteed to inspire the Minister concerned to ensure that he or she retains the powers of the Department.  The same applies when dealing with Estimates.  I have referred on a number of occasions to the dearth of political comment in many of our newspapers and other media in this regard.  Some idiotic correspondents &mdash; I say that in the kindest terms &mdash; are fed this type of information and may report that a particular Minister has lost out to another in terms of a scheme, while very few examine if the scheme was necessary in the first place.  Nobody examines if it might have outlived its usefulness. This legislation gives more powers to the Central Bank in the knowledge that most of its powers will be transferred to the European Central Bank in due course.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to deregulate the economy in line with our competitors all over the world, rather than the converse.  It is not satisfactory for the Minister to introduce a provision, such as that contained in section 20 which lists the new powers of the Central Bank, without identifying which of the powers listed are new and which were not contained in the Central bank Act, 1942.  The explanatory memorandum merely refers to the new section 7 of the Central Bank Act, 1942 which provides for &ldquo;certain particular powers of the Central Bank&rdquo;.  Are we expected to research this matter for ourselves?  At a minimum, the explanatory memorandum should set out the powers that are new and why such changes are deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>It would be naive to discuss changes relating to the Central Bank without referring to the debate on economic and monetary union.  In the past few weeks some commentators and academics expressed concern at the lack of debate relating to the concept of monetary union.  I refute this allegation in so far as it relates to politicians and this House.  I am at one with the Minister for Finance who stated at a dinner last Thursday night that he had availed of every opportunity in the past two years to address this subject. Furthermore, for the past 18 months Question Time and meetings of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs have been largely dominated by economic and monetary union.  The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs devoted some months earlier this year to bringing before it a number of experts and commentators, the meetings with whom were televised.  It has not been through lack of effort <Col N="64" /> on behalf of the Oireachtas that the debate on economic and monetary union has not lit up the general public.  I doubt it ever will, but I join others in hoping that there will be a wider debate in this area in the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The conference of economists which took place recently in Kenmare, one of the most beautiful parts of the country, concentrated the minds of the public somewhat on the development of economic and monetary union.  On a weekend that lacked other stories, the newspaper editors gave the conference greater coverage than they would normally.  The financial pages of most national newspapers and certain magazines have given economic and monetary union a good deal of coverage.  A number of institutes and bodies, such as the Institute of European Affairs, have run many successful conferences which have devoted a great deal of time to teasing out matters relating to economic and monetary union.  Unfortunately, however, the debate has been confined mostly to financial experts and those who take an interest in European affairs.  A number of business people are not very enthusiastic about the matter, notwithstanding the fact that IBEC, ISME and other organisations have held seminars to develop the topic.  I hope there will be a wider ranging debate on economic and monetary union in the next year and that it is not confined to those with a particular interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>Because of my involvement in politics, I might not have kept up to date with all events in the financial area in the past decade or so, but the development of economic and monetary union has intrigued me for a long time.  I have taken a professional interest in the development of the internal market.  I have also taken an interest in the foreign exchange markets because I am aware of the changing operations of many institutions, businesses and individuals over time.  This debate has interested me for many years.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger, particularly in Ireland, that if one raises questions about a concept which everybody perceives to be good, one is likely to be accused of damaging it.  That does not apply only to financial matters, such as the debate on economic and monetary union.  I am well aware that in politics, given the party of which I am a member, the questioning of tenets can give rise to difficulties.  Politicians should be to the forefront in opening up the debate and posing serious questions on economic and monetary union and that should not be construed as mischievous but for the betterment of all.  If everybody agrees with an idea and has the same approach to it, nobody offers an alternative viewpoint.  A number of angles of economic and monetary union have not been faced by the official side of the Irish argument and it is time this was done.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Kenmare economic conference which was attended by many economists.  They have the luxury denied to politicians of being able to change their minds from week to week.  They have the bonus of never <Col N="65" /> being held accountable.  Journalists also have this unique cop out clause but politicians must make the tough decisions and they will be blamed <i>ad infinitum</i> if a decision is wrong.  To prove my point about economists, one only has to read their utterances this year on the probable rate of the IR£ against sterling in late 1996.  Good manners prevent me reading into the record the views and predictions of respected economists on this matter; they would prove very embarrassing.</P>
    <P>I am sure economists can put forward good reasons why the position in November 1996 is not as they predicted.  However, it is unusual that economists and journalists are the only people who can get over this problem but the same facility is denied to politicians and Ministers in particular.  If they make a mistake regarding economic and monetary union, the Ministers and Government of the day, not the economists or civil servants who advised particular courses of action, will be held responsible.  My only reason for highlighting their erroneous predictions regarding the exchange rate is to show that economics is not an exact science.  In the recent past, some have questioned whether it is a science at all.  This is a debate for another day but, at a minimum, it is fair to state that there is a plethora of conflicting views on economic and monetary union and each view can be justified in its own right.</P>
    <P>The most interesting development this year was the publication of the ESRI report regarding the implications for the economy.  Stripping away the verbiage, it can be said that the benefits to the economy of joining economic and monetary union, not withstanding whether the United Kingdom joins at the outset or stays outside, are marginal.  Even those who prepared the report for the ESRI were surprised by the results of their investigation.  Most commentators would have been of the view that the benefits would be far greater but the ESRI report shows that any benefits are within the bounds of statistical error. We are fooling ourselves if we believe that joining economic and monetary union without the UK as a full member will be a panacea for the economy into the next millennium.  There will be casualties and many industries and firms will go to the wall.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback by the small gain to the economy of economic and monetary union, even if the UK joined at the outset.  One of the authors of the report, Mr. John Fitzgerald, appeared before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  He supports the idea of economic and monetary union and he said he was also taken aback by the findings.  In a best case scenario the benefit to the gross national product would be approximately 1 per cent.  Some tenuous suppositions and assumptions underline that theory.  If the UK stays outside from the outset, the benefit to the economy, as suggested by the ESRI model, would be much less.</P>
    <P>In a best case scenario under the ESRI model, the maximum number of jobs which could be created is 20,000.  According to the Labour Force <Col N="66" /> Survey and other independent assessments in the last two years, up to 50,000 jobs have been created, but we have not noticed a dent in the live register.  The changes in the register probably do not relate to the growth in the economy but, at its kindest, to adjustments people are making to their signing on arrangements.  There will be casualties as a result of economic and monetary union &mdash; the ESRI makes no bones about that matter &mdash; and it is time we broadened the debate to ensure people are aware of the fall out from joining economic and monetary union.  This is the position even in a best case scenario, which from the Irish perspective would be if the UK joined from the outset.</P>
    <P>I am an ardent advocate of the Maastricht criteria and economies and governments should fulfil such criteria even in the absence of economic and monetary union.  This will not come as a surprise to anybody who has listened to me during my political life.  I favour tight financial and monetary discipline and it is only since the State adopted such a discipline from 1987 that it has been possible to turn the country around. People in the Department of Finance agree with this view and probably did so in the 1970s and 1980s but nobody listened to them.  Politicians were inclined to listen to them afterwards so I am preaching to the converted in that regard.</P>
    <P>In recent times it is good that all the political parties in the House, from the far right to the far left &mdash; if such a difference continues to exist in Irish political ideology &mdash; have come to realise that tight financial discipline has produced positive results.  We were told for years that it was not possible and would not work.  I favour the Maastricht criteria and we must be in a position in 1998 to satisfy them.  I am sure we will satisfy the criteria and the only blip on the horizon recently has been inflation.  This relates to the appreciation of sterling against the IR£.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>European monetary union must have some mechanisms to deal with asymmetric shocks to an individual economy. There is little point in setting down rules for a stability pact, which envisages penalties for lax fiscal discipline, when an individual economy might be dealing with, for example, a BSE crisis. Those and other matters relating to economic and monetary union will be debated again in this House, but it is important to set down a few markers at this stage.</P>
      <P>One of the principal features of the Bill is the introduction of a new licensing arrangement for so-called payment systems and <i>bureaux de change.</i>  Those areas are to be controlled by the Central Bank and the Bill contains a number of standard provisions about the licensing authority being able to grant or refuse to attach conditions and so forth.  There is a certain amount of interparty play acting relating to the sections on the payment systems.  Some time ago the Democratic Left arm of the Government made some noises in this area and that, I believe, is the background of these sections.</P>
      <P>There is a case to be made for the Central Bank to have some role in this area, but many of the sections are a reflection of empire building by a number of State agencies.  Within the public service there are many conspirators who think nothing of involving as many bodies as possible in the exercise of a particular power, irrespective of the cost or bureaucratic inconvenience of such a construction.  For example, in section 66 the Minister for Finance is required to consult six different persons or bodies.</P>
      <P>The regulations pertaining to the licensing of a payment system are fraught with legal problems. The Central Bank will be involved in the process at a very early stage.  In the event of fraud, collapse or some other circumstance which causes loss to a private individual, it is certain that the Central Bank will be a defendant in the proceedings.  In that regard I notice the usual &ldquo;get out&rdquo; clause for employees of the Central Bank. Such a &ldquo;get out&rdquo; clause has become a feature of nearly all Bills relating to agencies coming before the House in the recent past.  The purpose of such &ldquo;get out&rdquo; clauses is to ensure that no employee or director, no matter how incompetent or stupid, can be held responsible or prosecuted.  In recent times an enormous amount of effort seems to have been put into all Bills to ensure that civil servants and employees of State agencies are never held responsible for mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister of State explain how she can justify giving the Central Bank jurisdiction in the matter and at the same time, by way of section 6, provide that it may become a member of such a system?  It does not take too much thought to conjure up a complaint by a disappointed <Col N="69" /> applicant that the Central Bank is favouring its own application &mdash; the application in which it is involved as against the application of the disappointed applicant.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy about the provisions of the Bill extending the powers of the Central Bank. In a nutshell, why have those additional powers become necessary since we last legislated in this area in 1989?  What has happened in the meantime that has necessitated the pushing through the Oireachtas of those additional powers?</P>
    <P>I await the views of the Minister of State regarding whether existing payment systems need to be regulated.  I need to be convinced that such regulation benefits the public, unless regulation of the system by the Central Bank will in some way guarantee no major frauds at the consumers' expense.  Everyone knows that no such regulatory system &mdash; whether self-regulatory or supervised by the Central Bank &mdash; can ever give such a guarantee.</P>
    <P>There are numerous provisions relating to the payment systems, but only two sections dealing with the single most important provision of the Bill will affect ordinary people in their daily personal or business transactions.  I refer to sections 35 and 36 which introduce the notion of non-transferable cheques.  I am aware that position exists in the United Kingdom.  The effect of these sections will mean that cheques marked &ldquo;account payee&rdquo; can be dealt with only through that person's bank account.  Will the Minister of State inform the House which banks asked for that protection?  I note from her speech that it was the Irish Insurance Federation.  This relates to policy cheques, which constitute only a very small amount of the total cheques written in a year.  At least the Minister of State put on the record the institution that requested that provision.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom there is a thriving business for the encashment of account payee cheques at a discount of 4 per cent on the basis that the company cashing them indemnifies the bank against any loss.  Is the Minister for Finance not running counter to the general trend of policy in the social welfare area, which is to encourage people to accept payments by cheque encashable in their local supermarket or post office?  The proposals in the Bill will erect another barrier between the rich and the poor, those with bank accounts and those without them.  This proposal is ill thought out and runs counter to the general trend or policy in many other areas and I ask the Minister to consider deleting this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many other instances of special pleadings from sectional groups.  In this era of openness the Minister must tell the House the institutions that lobbied for certain changes. For instance, which building society lobbied for section 64 and why are we being asked to comply <Col N="70" /> with its request?  Did the Central Bank plead for the provisions of section 22 empowering it to form or acquire a company?  What functions does the Central Bank consider it cannot currently perform without being empowered to form a company?  Does it have particular proposals in mind as to companies it would like to establish or companies whose shares it would like to purchase?</P>
      <P>Sections 44 to 47 relate to companies in the International Financial Services Centre.  I have no objection to changes relating to IFSC operations, but it is important to mention some pertinent points relating to the existing regulatory framework.  The IFSC has been our major economic success in the past ten years.  I adverted to that on a number of occasions in the House and congratulated the persons who backed the concept from day one.  One of the main reasons for its success was the ready access to decision makers from intending applicants and the speed at which decisions could be made by the authorities and licences granted.  Any of the players in the centre would put that forward as probably the key factor in locating in Dublin in the early years as against competing centres.  The competition has copped on and other countries now provide as speedy a service as Dublin did in its early years.  However, within the past few years the speed and accessibility in Dublin has not been what it used to be.  There is more bureaucracy and red tape and it is becoming increasingly harder to get a decision.  A conversation with any of the players would confirm that the foregoing is correct, but new applicants are afraid to speak out because of fear of offending some powerful official or body.</P>
      <P>There are also too many committees, subcommittees and layers of bureaucracy.  The worldwide competition for new entrants to this business is growing.  If we do not return to the system of the early days Dublin will lose out heavily.</P>
      <P>I need to be convinced that a number of provisions in the Bill are necessary.  A Bill entitled &ldquo;Central Bank Bill, 1996&rdquo; should not include many of the miscellaneous items which, I suggest, have nothing to do with matters relating to the Central Bank.  Neither am I convinced that the new powers are needed.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Minister of State on the matter.</P>

      <P>I very much welcome the Bill dealing with the Central Bank.  As Deputy McCreevy illustrated, it affords us a rare <Col N="71" /> opportunity to discuss one of the most important issues facing this country and the European Union, an issue which is largely ignored in terms of debate in the national media and among the public at home and in the other 14 member states. As soon as European Monetary Union is established and assuming Ireland joins from the start, the Central Bank will be reduced to a small branch office of the European system of central banks based in Frankfurt.  That relegation, although profound for the Central Bank, is the most obvious and tangible surrender of the national sovereignty since the Act of Union 176 years ago.  It took 121 years to revoke the Act of Union, and then only in respect of part of our country.  European Monetary Union will be irrevocable.  In 1800 the parliament in College Green was unrepresentative but even so, according to reports, it had to be bought, bribed, flattered, ennobled and coerced into making its fateful decision.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the decision on European Monetary Union has been made.  That was one of the nuggets &mdash; some would say time bombs &mdash; within the bounds of the Treaty on European Union, otherwise known as the Maastricht Treaty.  Not alone will no one have to be bought, bribed, flattered, ennobled or coerced to give effect to a decision to enter European Monetary Union, it will not even require a debate. Apparently the precise legal and constitutional position is that provided the European Monetary Institute deem that we meet the criteria set down we have no choice but to join with effect from the commencement date.  That is the view of purists and Euro enthusiasts but it is also the common sense reading of the constitutional amendment giving effect to the Maastricht Treaty.  Little detailed consideration has been given by this House to the implications of European Monetary Union for Ireland or the European Union.</P>
      <P>It is not only Euro sceptics who wish to raise questions on this vital subject, but many like me who are deeply committed Europeans have serious concerns.  I support the widening of the European Union.  I also support in principle the idea of a single currency, but I would argue strongly that if it is ill-timed or ill-designed it has the potential to create havoc and even to undo the European Union.  This issue was discussed in great detail on two occasions at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and some very interesting points were raised.  With the exception of one extensive report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> the debates on this issue have been notable for their lack of reportage by RTÉ and the media in general, particularly <i>The Irish Times.</i> There is an astonishing lack of awareness in the media of the fundamental importance of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two major factors are emphasised by those driving forward the idea of a single currency: first, the timetable and second, the criteria.  We are forced to meet a timetable regardless of the <Col N="72" /> consequences.  There cannot be a European single currency unless Germany and France are members, but at present neither of those countries meet the criteria set down.  The French budget as approved by the Assemblée Nationale barely meets the 3 per cent borrowing requirement and only after major fudging of the figures by including once-off payments for the sale of France Telecom.  It is clear the figures were fudged in France and fudging may be necessary in the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>
    <P>I would ask Commissioner De Silguy what would happen in the event of a conflict between the timetable and the criteria?  No conflict will be entertained or even envisaged.  Member states, particularly France and Germany, are prepared to fudge the figures to meet the timetable, but therein lies a mortal danger.  If we establish a single currency based on falsified or fudged figures we are building on a weak foundation.  We have become the prisoners of a timetable.  I am in favour of the principle of a single currency but not regardless of the implications.</P>
    <P>In addition to those factors there are other major concerns.  What would happen in the event of an unforeseen economic shock in one of the member states, such as an earthquake which causes great damage, as happened in Japan in recent years?  What would happen in the event of an unforeseen major crisis in an individual country?  We had the BSE crisis this year.  What would we do if our beef market completely collapsed?  We could not increase our borrowing because it is controlled by the Maastricht criteria and the proposed stability package criteria and we could not devalue.  There is no contingency fund at European level to meet such events.  What would happen if non-member states entered competitive devaluations or their currency drifted down as the Euro currency, which is expected to become a reserve currency, drifted up?  What will happen to the Single Market if, as is expected, some member states of the European Union join European Monetary Union while others do not? Would that not effectively undermine the Single Market or render it no longer a Single Market? What about the political implications for those countries that are not politically able to join the Single Market now or in the immediate future?  I raise these questions because they are important and because I am a committed European.  I want a lasting widening and deepening of the European Union.  I have raised this matter repeatedly.</P>
    <P>Another valid point was raised at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs by Deputy McCreevy to which no satisfactory answer has been given.  It has always been the practice to announce changes in currency ratios and relationships without notice, so as to avoid speculation on the currency.  The current situation is that a date has been fixed well in advance for the irrevocable linking of currencies.  Is it not possible or likely that there will be speculation against some currencies in the run up to this <Col N="73" /> date?  What happens to the prospective single currency and the membership thereof?</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the momentum for a single currency while overcoming all of these problems, I have raised, as have others, the question of a longer period of a parallel currency. Why do we not introduce a European currency with notes and coins in parallel with our national currencies for a period of three to five years? Why do the over enthusiastic Europeans dismiss completely the idea of a parallel currency?  I was recently in Croatia where there is a very good economy.  They use their national currency and the German currency is also accepted.  I was in Slovakia recently where the Austrian currency is accepted.  In Russia, Israel, Argentina and many other countries the American currency is accepted.</P>
    <P>I see many great advantages in having a parallel European currency.  I would like to see this idea proceeded with according to the timetable set down for the euro.  It would be possible for all member states to accept a parallel currency as well as their own national currency, so it offers the prospect of having the euro accepted throughout the European Union.  It also gives more time for economies to adjust to the new realities.  It avoids the partitioning of the Single Market.  It avoids or minimises the likelihood of competitive devaluations and it allows time for the European Union to address the question of contingency funds to meet any economic shocks.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to ensure that this is a major issue for debate at the European Council to be held in Dublin in early December.  It is time for the European Council to address the question of the timetable, the criteria, the methodology and the alternative ways of achieving a single currency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that this Bill is being introduced partly in preparation for the single currency, although it is not the major Bill and another one is due.  It is another landmark along the road to making the Central Bank merely a branch office of the European system of central banks.  That profound change in the status of the Central Bank has even more profound implications for the future of our <Col N="74" /> country and its sovereignty and for the future of the European Union.  I make no apology for spending all the time allotted to me on that important subject.</P>
      <P>The next European Council meeting, to be held in Dublin in early December should debate this issue.  All aspects of the issue should be considered, including the possibility of a parallel currency.  Rather than looking in dismay at the political problems in countries like the UK and Denmark, the Union should be trying to understand, facilitate and overcome those problems.  We will not do so if we proceed with a timetable that is impossible for them.  This is a vital subject for discussion at the European Council.  I hope we will have an opportunity for a prolonged debate on the subject in this House before too many more weeks elapse.  We should be given enough time not only to make statements but also to ask questions and to seek answers.  It is not good enough to sleep walk to Frankfurt and end up with a nightmare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was first mooted I was under the impression that it would largely deal with preparation for economic and monetary union.  I was surprised when it was published to find that so little of it dealt with that area, which I understood was its original intention.  It was inevitable that in the discussion on this Bill, which by and large deals with regulations and is technical in nature, Deputies would discuss monetary union as it arises within the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell and Deputy McCreevy have stated, this is a very important topic for this House and for the business community.  No group has discussed this issue more than the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  I can think of no other group that met in public session to hear the views on monetary union of eminent speakers from Ireland and abroad.  It is regrettable that much of that discussion and learning process has gone unreported by the media, with perhaps one or two exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues in the House know that I have an interest in monetary union.  I have listened to my colleague in the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, Deputy Mitchell.  The questions that he raised are very important and should be raised, but it is wrong to say that nobody else has raised these questions.  I reject that.  Questions are being asked.  As we move closer to monetary union questions will become more focused and answers will be demanded.  The ESRI report surprised even its authors, who said when they analysed it that they did not anticipate huge benefits or a sudden surge of benefits to the Irish economy because suddenly one has a single currency.  That is an inherent strength because it shows the stability of what we have achieved over the last ten to 20 years in the EU.  Monetary union and the single currency is part of the process.  We do not want chaos as a result of monetary union, as Deputy Jim Mitchell outlined. Events and various treaties over the past ten to <Col N="75" /> 15 years have been the building blocks leading us to monetary union.  We should embrace the process of absorbing ourselves into monetary union, which will benefit this country and Europe generally.</P>
    <P>Those who argue we could have chaos forget the other side of the coin; that if we fail to proceed with monetary union there would be chaos in the banking systems throughout Europe. We thought we had it rough some years ago when the IR£ was under sustained pressure and interest rates were astronomical in trying to sustain it but if monetary union and the single currency do not proceed, leaving us on our own, the consequences will be far more serious than anything that might come from organising ourselves to be one of the first round of countries to participate in the single currency.</P>
    <P>I also reject the notion that this is creating a trap within the EU; that there will be a divided Europe of those within the single currency and those outside.  That is simplistic analysis that does not stand up to scrutiny.  If one reads all that has been said by Ministers and Governments of various countries discussing monetary union, there is deep recognition that there must be some convergence for those outside.  There has to be stability between those using the Euro and those initially outside the single currency.  The majority of countries that will be outside it have stated it is their intention to participate in the single currency.  The UK and Denmark are the only countries which may meet the criteria and opt to stay out of the first round.  All other countries in the EU are anxious to be part of the single currency.  We can anticipate that beyond the establishment of the single currency those countries will want to ensure that the disciplines laid down within the Treaty and the stability pact criteria, however they are finalised, will be met by those countries.  Therefore, I am not as concerned as some would be at the consequences of the single currency.  The effects on the EU's structure, institutions and everything achieved by it over the last number of years if monetary union does not proceed would be of more concern.</P>
    <P>Much of the argument in this country has been coloured, rightly in some respects, by what may happen with the UK and monetary union.  It has a substantial effect on our economy because it is one of our major trading partners but the debate in the UK over the last number of years has not focused on the consequences of the single currency and its effects.  It has focused on the single currency not coming about, the date not being met, the criteria not being fulfilled and that, therefore, it will be dealt with on that basis.  It has also been coloured by the political difficulties within the British Government concerning the Eurosceptics and Tory backbenchers using many European issues, particularly monetary union, as the major political stake.  Much of their argument is unrelated to the single currency but is concerned more with domestic policy in the UK. This is regrettable as there are other views.  Today <Col N="76" /> in <i>The Irish Times,</i> Sir Leon Brittan, EU Vice-President for External Affairs, who served in a British Cabinet, said: &ldquo;Britain will be propelled into the single currency because it will not be able to afford to remain outside&rdquo;.  That is another view but it is not in isolation.  The CBI in the UK would also be of that view; that will have to be taken into account.  The City, as it is euphemistically called, in London is also deeply concerned about the consequences for the UK if it remains outside the single currency.  It is not as black or as simple a picture as has been painted here today of currencies that, like sterling, might remain outside and use their positions to devalue because they feel like it.</P>
    <P>That is not the reality of operating within Europe.  They would damage their own economy internally and on the world market.  It is a simplistic view that they would not take and does not stand up to scrutiny.  It has been put forward over the last number of years.  If the UK stays out of the first round, which seems likely, it will not be for very long.  Neither will it drive sterling to undermine those involved within the single currency.  The consequences for their own position would be equally horrendous.  It is not true that remaining outside gives it all the options and that those of us inside, especially Ireland, will suffer the consequences of it calling the shots, The argument is not that simple and the UK opting out is not likely to be permanent and have serious effects on this country.</P>
    <P>We have followed a policy over the last number of years, particularly since 1987, which has forced a discipline on this country.  All Members are willing to claim the benefits of our present economic situation.  In reality, the disciplines were imposed on us because of our desire to be a player in Europe, albeit a small one and that has seen the tremendous growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was a reference to the independence of the Central Bank.  The reality of &ldquo;Ireland Incorporated&rdquo; over the last number of years is that it is an insignificant cork on the tide within Europe.  Whatever decisions are taken in Europe will have a serious effect on us.  It would be better to be involved in the decision-making process than be outside.  One of the benefits for this country will be the setting up of the European Central Bank.  The fiscal policy is narrow and marginal.  The irony is that setting up a European Central Bank in which Ireland will be a legitimate partner on the board, so to speak, may give us a stronger voice than at present since such an institute does not exist and we are basically at the whim of the deutschmark.  That is a prospect which Ireland should move forward with and about which it should be confident.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we want to move the monetary union process forward at the present pace is that it is essential that the European economy be as unified as possible to take on the might of the American and Japanese economies and, in particular, the economies of the emerging Pacific Rim and the ASEAN countries which have grown substantially in the past few years. <Col N="77" /> No economic entity in the European Union, perhaps with the exception of Germany, has the capacity, resources and strength to act alone against those economies.  It is essential that Europe progressively form as a bloc.  Monetary union underpins and is an essential cornerstone in that process.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that asking questions is wrong or that one is negating one's desire to strengthen Europe and to be part of the European process.  However, it must be done in a balanced way.  I noticed recently that economists, particularly those employed by large institutions, tend to put forward their arguments based on the narrow vested interest of the institution or body by which they are employed.  Banking economists are raising questions and concerns and are becoming pale in the face as regards Europe because monetary union will mean that aspects of banking which are highly profitable at present, such as foreign exchange and dealing in foreign currencies, will be less so.</P>
    <P>We could all take a narrow view, look at what deeply affects us, go against the overall picture which has emerged in Europe and write off all the substantial benefits which have accrued over the past number of years.  It is wrong to base the argument on monetary union.  If one looks at an ESRI report, one may say the benefits are not great.  However, we are reaping the benefits of what has occurred in Europe over the past ten to 20 years.  This is part of that building process.  It is also wrong to say there have been few debates and reports.  The debate, particularly at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, has been extensive.  The ESRI, banks and Europe have produced reports and the Central Bank has commented.  I receive many reports which I do not have time to read.  This currency will become reality in time.</P>
    <P>If the UK were committed to monetary union, how would it affect the axis of France and Germany, the countries seen as the play makers and without whom this cannot happen?  It is a pity the UK did not involve itself more deeply in the process because it may have given it and countries like Ireland more options and may have influenced the final process, when it takes place and its consequences.  Another worrying consequence that has not been as highlighted as it was in the past because of the concentration on monetary union is the enlargement process.  I cannot see how enlargement will fit into the present structure in the Union and the single currency.</P>
    <P>What I do not like about the Bill is that it introduces more regulations to what should be a deregulated market, something which was referred to earlier.  Why does the Central Bank require these new structures, regulations and controls?  Section 22 empowers the bank to involve itself in and acquire a company.  What type of company would the Central Bank involve itself in or acquire?  Obviously, it will be in the financial market, but what role will it have?  Will it be a competitor with other legitimate banks? <Col N="78" /> How will it regulate against itself if it is a participator in the market place?  I do not understand this section and I was surprised by its inclusion.  Perhaps it will be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope the contributions which will be made and which will form part of our thinking on monetary union to which the Central Bank will be central are level-headed and are sufficiently broad-based to take account of the overall picture.  I hope people do not get up on their high horses over the next 12 months and focus on monetary union from a narrow vested interest viewpoint which will completely miss the argument.  It would be a shame if that happened. I regret there are signs of that occurring in some institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  I was surprised by the definition of &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; in section 2 (2).  Although similar words are used in connection with the concept of deposit for deposit interest retention tax, in this context some things might amount to a deposit which ordinarily people would not accept as a deposit.  Would a debenture be distinguishable from a deposit receipt or would a redeemable preference share amount to a deposit for the purpose of this definition?  Would a sum of money received on terms that it will be repaid with or without interest, whether on demand or at a fixed or determinable future date, not cover a redeemable preference share, for instance?  I wonder if the definition of &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; is too broad.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Cullen I have a difficulty with section 22 and the idea of the Central Bank setting up companies.  I imagine it could set up companies to run a mint, transport cash or provide international consultancy services to emerging banks in the Third World.  We should know about the area in which we are being asked to authorise the formation of such companies.  It is not a good enough safeguard for this House to say it will not happen unless the Minister agrees. This House should know the business of the Central Bank.  Part III of this Bill, which states companies can be set up and acquired with the consent of a Minister, is a blank cheque.  What will happen when they are asked to acquire a lossmaking company to bail it out?  That is the concern I have when I see a blank cheque of this kind proposed.</P>

I am not happy with that.  Part III is far too widely cast.  The Central Bank is our property.  It has its board of directors <Col N="79" /> but in another sense we are its political board of directors or at least its shareholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context, for as long as it exists and whatever functions it discharges post economic and monetary union, I am concerned that this notion of setting up companies may be a way to redeploy redundant surplus staff in Third World banks under the aegis of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I do not like the notion that the Central Bank is being given the degree of autonomy to set up subsidiary companies and acquire companies irrespective of the state of those companies.  That worries me considerably.</P>
      <P>It is a good idea that there should be some overall capacity to supervise &mdash; presumably in a minimal way &mdash;<i>bureaux de change.</i>  I presume as long as it concerns compliance with money laundering legislation they will be left to do their own thing.  I hope there will be no need for detailed supervision of those bodies.  The amendments to the law relating to cheques and negotiable instruments is reasonable and seems appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General seems to be given extra powers in relation to the Central Bank.  Will the Minister indicate whether the Comptroller and Auditor General will be entitled to audit any companies established under section 22 by the Central Bank or in which the Central Bank is a joint partner?  Listening to the Minister's contribution one might think the Central Bank, under section 22, will be merely the owner of small companies and can establish the companies.  This section allows it to take part in the formation or establishment or to own shares in a company.  It will be a minority shareholder as well.  I am a little sceptical of the Central Bank undertaking liabilities of this kind without some degree of control by the Comptroller and Auditor General unless we are talking about joint ventures with other central banks which would have a satisfactory degree of financial supervision and a satisfactory auditing function.</P>
      <P>Whereas I cannot profess to understand the detail of what the Minister said about the new payments system, it is appropriate that such a payments system be established and that Ireland should not be inhibited from participating in a type of payments system that applies throughout the EU.  It is satisfactory that the Central Bank should have a leading role in establishing, supervising and maintaining access to such a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to dilate to the same extent as Deputy Cullen on my view of the European Union but we should not be either Euro idealists or Euro sceptics in this House.  We should be Euro realists.  Being a Euro realist involves us in taking a much more clear headed view of Ireland's interests at any given stage.  We are <Col N="80" /> probably coming to the end of a period in which Ireland has been the unquestioning and unquestioned recipient of huge sums by way of transfers from the EU, and although it is an exaggeration to say EU transfer payments are about to come to an end in the next few years, it is nonetheless the case that Ireland's capacity to draw down through political influence huge sums of money from the European Union is limited. In that context, therefore, Ireland has to adopt a slightly less starry-eyed view of the European Union and our interests in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen raised the question of enlargement.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs when the question of enlargement arose and a report was prepared.  It struck me that it was entirely idealistic and unmindful of Ireland's real basic interests.  The assumption was that the bigger the European Union became, the better it was for Ireland.  We now know there are down sides to enlargement of the European Union and that we will have to share the cost of enlargement of the European Union.</P>
    <P>There are questions such as the degree to which the European Union can expand while remaining a cohesive political unit.  These words may come to haunt me in the future but I have my doubts as to whether one can go from the Black Sea to the tip of Scandinavia and say that is one manageable political entity.  The larger Europe becomes, the more it will become a Europe of nations rather than some kind of federal super state, and I am happy with that.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that economic and monetary union will create such a significant common element, that is, the currency, that there will have to be a compensating significant devolution of democratic control to control that currency.  The Euro sceptics in England would be concerned that by creating a Euro currency we are effectively taking a giant leap by implication down the road to a federal united states of Europe type model.  That is not necessarily so.  A currency union does not necessarily imply in the long term that type of close political union.  It is possible to have a Europe of nation states bound together in what is a currency as well as a customs union without necessarily establishing a superstate at the heart of that economic and political entity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of economic and monetary union and, unlike some of the Kenmare economists, I am not concerned about the sacrifice Ireland is making politically in giving up currency exchange rate policy to join in economic and monetary union.  I do not believe in the capacity of this country, certainly on our performance to date, to engage in Keynesian macroeconomic stimulation of our economy.  I would be just as happy if many years ago we had managed to persuade the Germans to allow us to use their deutschmark.</P>
    <P>I do not care what we use as long as it is a stable, low interest currency.  I do not care either whether the pound in my pocket is sterling or some other currency.  It is a conceit, particularly <Col N="81" /> on the part of politicians who like to believe they know something about economics, to think that we have huge macro-economic policy options. We are a small open economy, part of the European Union, and the sacrifice involved in giving up certain options to have a stable currency is not a huge political sacrifice.</P>

At the very end of this hour long trial of strength and skill, the competitors, who are extremely fatigued by that time, have to run up what is called a &ldquo;travelator&rdquo; and crash through a paper barrier to end up lying prostrate on the ground at the point where they have won.  In the period 1997-2000, the lifetime of the next Government, we will have a unique opportunity to ensure that Ireland does not end up like the &ldquo;Gladiators&rdquo; and crash exhausted into EMU after a crash diet of compliance with the Maastricht convergence criteria.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that we hit the ground running in terms of EMU and are competitive thereafter and have no great difficulty in complying with the requirements of the stability pact in the wake of our entry into EMU, we must, between 1997 and 2002, undertake radical reform of our economy.  We must take steps now to ensure that Ireland is lean and fit to be an active participant in the post-EMU economy if we join the EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that end it is absolutely essential to do something about taxation on work.  Post-EMU much of our capacity to ameliorate the effect on our economy of our system of high tax on work will be swept away.  Post-EMU, in an ever more closely integrating European Union, Ireland will have a skilled and substantially young workforce available to it.  What that workforce will not have is the advantage of geographical location or of being part of the larger economies and the economies of scale that go with that.  Ireland will have disadvantages which flow from our peripherality, our geographical location and our demographic composition.  Our workforce, which is the one advantage we have, deserves to have a Government and a political system which recognises that that workforce must be given a competitive advantage within Europe of a radical kind, not just 1p in the £1 more than a worker in the United Kingdom or in the Ruhr, but a radical advantage where the State takes less out of the employment contract between employer and employee, and substantially less than the German, Belgian, Dutch or English states where capital may choose to locate in preference to Ireland.  We have to give our workforce a dramatic advantage in terms of their tax <Col N="82" /> treatment over other places in Europe.  Otherwise the laws of economic gravity will apply and capital will go where it gets the best return in terms of geographical location coupled with a benign tax system.  That is why PAYE workers should look to the next Government, whatever its composition, to deliver on the one thing the political system can deliver to the people as a whole, that is, a system whereby employment is situated in a zone which is tax advantageous to the worker and the employer and thereby gives Ireland, in so far as it lies within the power of an independent state within the European Union, a significant advantage as a location for employment compared with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>That is the one thing that the Irish political establishment can do for the economy, and that carries with it significant implications in relation to taxation policy, public sector pay policy, public expenditure generally and the like.  If in the period 1997-2002 we undertake a radical transformation of the way in which we run our country, control public spending and tax work, and the way in which Government does or does not opt to regulate, operate, own and capitalise huge areas of our economy, I am confident we will not be like the athletes in &ldquo;Gladiators&rdquo;, collapsing at the moment of supposed victory.  On the contrary, our entry into EMU will be a circumstance that will give rise to greater opportunity for growth.</P>
    <P>In that context it seems that there is precious little apparent understanding that we cannot have a three-year wage deal at 10 per cent and regard taxation policy over the next three years as a residual, that we cannot allow public spending to grow at the rate at which it is growing now, that if we fix targets for public spending growth we have to stick to them and that something has to give in order to do that, and that politically we cannot be in the hands of people who are unwilling to face up to the implications of controlling public spending and instituting radical tax reform &mdash; those two things are political twins.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to argue about who was the worst or best at controlling public spending in the past.  I am a positive politician.</P>

Therefore, on the occasion of the introduction of the Central Bank Bill, I wish the Minister well. Subject to the few niggling points I have made, particularly about Part III of the Bill, I hope it will come into effect.  I believe the Minister will enjoy the co-operation of the parties on this side of the House so that it can become law as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Minister for Defence for his failure to articulate a coherent policy on Defence matters particularly in regard to the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the reduction in numbers serving in the Defence Forces, having regard to security requirements in the Border areas, United Nations and elsewhere;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the necessity to strengthen the Air Corps and Navy to deal more effectively with fishery protection and drug interdiction;</P>
      <P>&mdash;ignoring the concerns expressed by Army wives in relation to conditions for soldiers serving in the Border areas;</P>
      <P>&mdash;failure to be honest about barracks closure;</P>
      <P>&mdash;lack of concern for spouses and children of deceased soldiers who did not opt for the Spouses and Children's Pension Scheme;</P>
      <P>&mdash;delay in recruitment and changes in the scheme with regard to age qualification and lack of recognition for the contribution made by young FCA members; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;confusion in the VER Scheme and failure to review the five year contract scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost unprecedented to be back here in a short few months with a further Private Members' motion on defence matters.  The Minister has managed to reduce the morale of the Defence Forces to its lowest ebb for many years and to have created raging uncertainty.  He has raised the spectacle once again of having Army wives back on the streets to try to serve their husbands' interests.  There is untold frustration in the Navy and in the Air Corps and the voluntary early retirement scheme is in unbelievable confusion.  I said here a few months ago that the <Col N="84" /> public sometimes takes security and peace for granted and think it is permanent but it is often fragile, therefore it is crucially important that we always have a Defence Force which has a high morale, is efficient and effective, believes in what it is doing and works to a national strategic plan.</P>
    <P>An Army cannot be cobbled together.  It takes many years to achieve the required standard of training and morale and to ensure that sufficient finance is available and is spent wisely.  At its present strength the Defence Forces cannot discharge its main role.  It is not possible to do this unless a well organised plan is implemented over a period.  Chopping and changing Defence recommendations and allocations of finance each year makes any effort to carry out a Defence plan an extremely frustrating exercise.  The morale of any Army is the most important factor in developing and maintaining the highest standards of training, efficiency and general behaviour among all ranks.</P>
    <P>The strategic plan should cover the full ten year period of the reform programme, with full details of the exact phasing in of the arrangements.  The actions to be taken during each phase should be sketched out and made public.  There should be an integrated plan with action on each of the main areas &mdash; structures, personnel, equipment and infrastructure.  Each phase of the plan should show its target.  We simply do not have that strategic plan.  I call on the Government once again to state its ultimate plan.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government will produce a White Paper on Defence at the end of its first year in office.  We will engage in real and meaningful consultations with the representative associations and with the military professionals who care deeply about the Defence Forces and their future.  Valuable contributions can be made by members who have wide experience in military matters, who have won over years of work in 20 countries worldwide respect in peacekeeping and in other activities.  I have no doubt from the discussions I have had with military personnel that they desperately want to eradicate the serious organisational and other weaknesses in the Force.  They want the Defence Forces to be a vibrant, well equipped, efficient and effective organisation, and that is what we want to achieve also.</P>
    <P>To solve the problems which have been created over many years will be costly in terms of time and money.  The failure of the Government to produce an overall strategic plan has added greatly to the uncertainty which, regrettably, pervades every section of the Defence Forces. Fianna Fáil will have a more all-embracing analysis.  The impact of change and the future shape of the Defence Forces must take account of the wider State and community interests.  The major decisions which must be taken relating to the Defence Forces, including the facilities they occupy, are clearly of national strategic importance and require a large number of inputs.</P>
    <P>The military tradition of the State is one of integration of the Forces into the community and <Col N="85" /> that will be maintained.  We therefore must have a mission statement.  That is even more important in a time of dramatic change.  For most of us change is difficult.  In the Army it can put solidarity under strain.  It can create new anxieties between colleagues and gloom about the future. Truly effective organisational change needs to preserve the best traditions of the organisation while achieving the work in different technological socio-economic and structural conditions.  The preservation of tradition is important to morale; a tradition once lost may take a long time to re-establish.  Successful military operations cannot be reduced only to skills, to information processing and intelligence. There are intangibles, such as traditions and expectations, which profoundly influence behaviour.  These traditions and expectations are embedded in the organisation's culture and the way to solve them is through the participative approach &mdash; involving people, discussing the problems openly and making sure they understand the target.  Mr. Jim Brady, President of PDFORRA, speaking at the recent annual delegate conference on the voluntary early retirement scheme said:</P>
    <P>Nobody knows for certain what they would be entitled to.  There are cases of four people with similar service records being offered completely different terms.  One man could receive all his leave plus his entitlements and his Voluntary Early Retirement package in contrast to his colleague with the exact same service who receives no money, no leave and no entitlements for two and a half months.  The tooth-fairy arrived in August and left £1.5 million under the pillow for a select few.  And finally to confuse matters even more if you had already received an order now you could switch to the tooth-fairy offer but there was a hitch &mdash; you lost all your leave and entitlements...</P>
    <P>And now we wonder are they making it up as they go along.  Morale in the Defence Forces is at an all time low.  There is great uncertainty. People are worried.  They are asking questions.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that we are here this evening discussing these problems.  Morale, confidence and enthusiasm must be generated in the Defence Forces and these questions must be answered. Nowhere is that more necessary, after we solve the problems relating to the voluntary early retirement scheme, than on the question of recruitment.  The Defence Forces have been starved of recruitment.</P>
    <P>We need to deal with the five year contract. Fianna Fáil in office will review the contract.  We will look to a blend of youth and experience to lead the Army forward into the future.  We must get a reasonable return on the investment made in time and training for young people in the Army.  Five years is not sufficient enough to achieve this.  The present scheme fails to differentiate line privates from specialists with non-trade skills, such as cooks, drivers, <Col N="86" /> information technology specialists and paramedics.  That is clearly a serious flaw which needs to be rectified.  Privates who work in a unit where no vacancies occur, regardless of their capacity or how good they are lose out to other in units where vacancies occur.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will develop a career structure for enlisted personnel.  It is crucially important for the morale of the Force that terms of pay, conditions of service, career development and social needs are protected and developed.  Career development under the proposed manpower policy must be realistic, reward people for effort and be capable of fulfilling their career aspirations.  Under Fianna Fáil the criteria for promotion and extension of service will be changed.  We will ensure people who enter the service will have a much better idea of what will happen in the future as distinct from the raging uncertainty which prevails at present.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is that uncertainty more greatly emphasised than in the stance of this open, transparent and accountable Government on barracks closures.  There has been statement after statement clearly indicating there will be no closures in the first phase.  This is a ten year plan. We expect greater honesty about what will happen after the first three of those ten years.  As sure as night follows day, when one reduces the number in the Defence Forces one has two choices: closing some of the barracks or transferring more personnel from field and general military operations into administration. The Government has shrunk from telling us its plans.  It has also shied away from understanding the social and economic effects of barracks closures in certain areas.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will deal in greater detail with the problems in the Border areas.  However, at our recent meetings with Army wives the spectre was again raised of those women having to take to the streets to get across to this Government what is happening in Border areas.  They want to help their husbands in this crisis.</P>
    <P>There have also been letters to the newspapers from individual soldiers serving in the Border areas.  One stated:</P>
    <P>I am a driver and to drive for those hours, that is, six or seven hours, and then go back out at 3 a.m. to drive for another six hours, and it is not uncommon to clock up 200 to 300 miles in a duty, increases the fatigue factor.  On a few occasions I had to ask the gardaí to stop because I was so tired.  I was becoming a danger to myself, my passengers and other road users.</P>
    <P>That young soldier was so frustrated that he felt it necessary to write to an editor to ask him to highlight the problems faced by him and his colleagues which are totally disregarded by the Minister and his Department and are being vehemently denied.</P>
    <P>The president of PDFORRA stated in relation to the Border area:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> Our members read about the use of the Army for BSE patrols on the Border and they wonder why the Irish Farmers' Association knows about this before they are told.  They ask why the people affected are not told first. Soldiers have found themselves working in difficult conditions with no additional resources.  The handling of the BSE Border patrols is symptomatic of the mismanagement of the restructuring plans in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Is it too much to ask that all soldiers serving on the Border are treated with some dignity and rewarded for their service?  These are men and women who have in the past few months taken on additional duties in order to safeguard the economy of this State.  Many have been forced to work up to a 72 hour week to ensure there is adequate cover along the Border.  For the pleasure of patrolling the Border they receive 30p per hour after tax.</P>
    <P>Their wives, and others, in their representations to us have clearly indicated that the allowances and the understanding by the Minister for Defence and his Department of what is involved here are considerably less than we would expect in this day and age.</P>
    <P>While I have harsh words to say about the Minister, I will now say some harsh words about the military authorities.  I would not like to be responsible for building a resentment towards the institution in which a person had worked for 23 years.  A sergeant who had served in the Army for 23 years, was never on sick leave and served in the Lebanon, developed a serious illness.  We understood no changes would be made immediately prior to the introduction of the voluntary early retirement scheme which would injure the rights of those individuals.  Two months before the voluntary early retirement scheme was introduced, that young sergeant was transferred from &ldquo;C&rdquo; to &ldquo;E&rdquo;, leaving him in no position to qualify for the retirement scheme and, of course, facing immediate discharge.  It was not enough for him to have to face the future with this illness &mdash; which never kept him a day away from work &mdash; in circumstances where his young family and his wife were worried about him, he also had to be deprived of his right.</P>
    <P>This cries out for immediate action by the Minister.  It is inhuman and immoral.  It belongs to an age when workers were trodden on by their employers.  I had no idea it could happen in 1996. I had less of an idea it could happen to someone who served for 23 years without a blemish on his record or without losing a day's work.  Somebody somewhere made sure he could not qualify for the voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that example because it is tied into the representations made by a soldier in relation to his plight on the Border, the hours he was required to drive and the difficulties he faced.  It is also tied into the representations made to us by the wives of Army personnel on the Border who <Col N="88" /> spoke about their difficulties and the way in which they are treated.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have no wish to make that difficulty any worse.  We ask the Minister, his Department and his colleagues to look at what is happening and to do something about it rather than ignore the plight which has been directly brought to their attention tonight and in many other ways, and to come forward with solid proposals.  We do not need the spectacle of those ladies trying to fight for their husbands in this way.  We do not need to see the Army, of which our people are proud, made to face those difficulties without an understanding of what is involved.  One of those ladies asked me to ask them to come and see where the Border is.  That is how they feel about the way in which they are being treated.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Air Corps and the Navy. Last week when Deputy Power and I expressed concern about understaffing in the Naval Service the Minister told us everything was all right. Brian O'Keeffe, a RACO representative, was forced to appear on television last night to highlight the problems being experienced by his organisation.</P>
    <P>The tasks carried out by the Naval Service include fishery protection, drugs and arms interdiction, search and rescue and pollution control and monitoring.  The role of the Service in many of these areas has been expanded significantly in recent years due to developments, such as the relaxation of the Irish Box restrictions and access by Spain to the Box from last January. This has resulted in a requirement for an increased level of boarding.  The role of the Naval Service in respect of drugs interdiction, criminal justice matters &mdash; under the Criminal Justice Act &mdash; and pollution control &mdash; under the dumping at sea legislation &mdash; will be further expanded and formalised in the future.  We have been told that over-fishing has led to a decline in fish stocks in Irish waters.  This will require greater policing and enforcement of the law in the future.</P>
    <P>The primary area of operation of the Naval Service includes the Irish sector of the European economic zone, commonly referred to as the 200 mile limit.  This area, which covers 132 square miles, constitutes 16 per cent of Union waters. Within this zone the areas of particular focus include the Irish territorial sea, the 12 mile limit and the Irish Box, an area of approximately 35 square miles designated by the EU as a sensitive area.  Some insight into the scale of the task facing the Naval Service can be gained from the realisation that within the EU only Great Britain has more territorial waters than Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service has an aging fleet and an insufficient number of ships, while the number of personnel has been reduced from the required 1,300 to approximately 1,000.  Is it true that EU funds to support the purchase of ships by the Naval Service will not be made available because the European Commission believes that the manpower is incapable of running the present fleet of seven ships?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> The fishery protection task has become more complex in recent years due to the raft of technical measures which must be enforced.  In the 1980s the boarding and inspection of a fishing vessel rarely took longer than 30 minutes whereas today this operation can take hours.  The increased surveillance capability of the Air Corps does not alter the situation in terms of enforcement of the law by the Naval Service at sea.  Aircraft are an invaluable asset in terms of locating vessels but the vast majority of offences can only be detected by the physical boarding and inspection of vessels by Naval Service personnel.</P>
    <P>A decision must be taken on the optimum fleet size for the Naval Service in the medium and long term.  Following that decision, a strategic plan incorporating the procurement of the required additional ships should be developed.  It is of critical importance that future Government decisions on the procurement of ships include authority to recruit the additional personnel required to crew them.  In the past the Naval Service, on receiving a new vessel, was not given additional personnel either for crewing or for increased shore support.  This has contributed to the difficulties being experienced by the Service.</P>
    <P>While the difficulties in respect of overall numbers have been repeatedly identified, no serious effort has been made to address them.  As I said last week, the Minister is ignoring the problem.  Since the publication of the Price Waterhouse report in 1994 overall numbers in the Service have decreased through natural wastage and the voluntary early retirement scheme while the number of tasks has increased.  The lack of personnel in the Naval Service is a critical problem.  The current overall strength is 155 below the authorised strength, which is only 85 per cent of the established figure.</P>
    <P>The time for talking is over.  The Naval Service has been given new powers and is required to carry out new and different tasks.  Hundreds of millions of pounds are being lost to the economy through the illegal fishing of our waters by foreign vessels.  The Government must recruit new personnel to the Service.  The total number of people expected to leave the Service last year and this year is 150.  Many personnel are unable to take leave and they regard the Service as a sinking ship.  I plead with the Minister to increase the number of personnel he proposes to recruit in 1997 so that a reasonable number of the present intake will have an opportunity to join the Service.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the FCA, another area where the Government has managed to create an all time low in terms of confidence.  When it returns to Government, Fianna Fáil will ensure that the number of personnel in the FCA is maintained at its present level and that the proposal in the Price Waterhouse report of a massive reduction in the number of personnel is not entertained.  We have an opportunity to give young men and women who want to serve in the FCA and An Slua Muirí the training and encouragement they deserve. Most countries the same size as Ireland have a <Col N="90" /> first and second line reserve with a greater number of personnel than we are asking the Minister to recruit.  By not rejecting the proposals in the Price Waterhouse the Minister has reduced the level of morale in the FCA.  People from all areas serve in the FCA and in some cases they can be used to support the Army and carry out certain functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  I compliment him and Deputy Power on putting down this timely motion.  The amendment to the motion speaks volumes about the behind-the-scenes efforts being made by the Government to downgrade the Defence Forces. The amendment refers to a balanced programme of reform which is another way of saying that the Defence Forces will be downgraded.  During difficult times the Department of Defence suffers from a lack of resources.  However, despite the so-called economic boom, the Government seems hell bent on reducing the number of personnel and barracks.  The Government amendment does not refer to some of the key issues raised in the motion.  For example, apart from referring to a programme of reform, it has remained silent on the closure of barracks.</P>
      <P>On the issue of morale, which is at an all time low, especially in the Border areas, events over the past couple of months have effectively amounted to the straw that broke the camel's back.  My party leader, deputy leader, the two spokespersons and I attended a meeting in Dundalk with Army spouses in the Border areas. They expressed their grave concern, not only for the morale of the Army and the personnel in the 27th Infantry Battalion in Dundalk, but also for their marriages because of the difficulties arising from excessive workloads placed on soldiers due to recent changes and difficulties along the Border, especially with regard to BSE.</P>
      <P>The Army wives accept that members of the Garda Síochána were rightly paid for their magnificent work in preventing the spread of BSE across the Border.  However, the Government introduced changes and effectively removed gardaí from BSE Border patrols. Consequently this work has fallen on the line of least resistance, members of the Army, those who are invariably brought out to deal with emergencies, such as forest fires in the Ravensdale mountains overlooking Dundalk.  It is time that the Government and the public became aware that the Army cannot be taken for granted. It is a matter they ignore at their peril.</P>
      <P>The Army wives who met us pointed out that they had formed NASA, the National Army Spouses' Association, which went into abeyance following the establishment of PDFORRA in 1990.  However, in view of the problems that have arisen along the Border because of BSE, they have decided to reactivate themselves to highlight what they consider to be inequities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BSE enforcement regulations, which came into force in March this year, was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Army personnel &mdash;<Col N="91" /> mostly men &mdash; are being asked to work a 70 to 80 hour week, effectively on an empty stomach. On Question Time last week the Minister said he would be very annoyed if people were taking up duty without hot meals.  However, according to representations made to us, these people work for prolonged periods, in some instances without proper sustenance.</P>
    <P>The subsistence with regard to duty made to the civil power is no longer in being, but there is an allowance payable to personnel on duty.  They get £7.12 for up to five hours' work, £15 for nine hours and over £20 for 15 hours.  In addition, they receive a Border allowance of £43.81 per week. Normal deductions, such as tax and PRSI, must be made from this.  The allowance of £43.81 per week contrasts with the allowance of £44 before deductions payable to Army personnel who work 24 hours on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>A solider on 24 hour duty must do two six hour shifts on the Border and two six hour shifts on stand-by in the barracks.  His day begins on standby before 9 o'clock in the morning when he works along the Border for six hours, up to 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  He remains in the barracks from 3 o'clock until 9 o'clock in the evening when he returns to the Border, travelling huge distances in some instances.  He then returns to barracks at 3 o'clock in the morning and stays there for five or six hours, until 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock the next morning.  Another shift dovetails into this to ensure a shift is on the road when another is in barracks and <i>vice versa.</i>  According to representations we have received, soldiers get sandwiches and a litre of milk between three persons before they go on the road.  Meals are supplied in the barracks.</P>
    <P>There are considerable periods when these people are on duty for 24 hours.  Their main bone of contention is that they have been asked to do what members of the Garda Síochána &mdash; nobody suggests that they should not have been paid &mdash; have been doing over the last number of months but they are not being paid any special allowances or receiving any recognition.  In addition, it is putting a huge strain on their families because by the time a soldier returns home he requires 24 hours sleep to recover from an exhausting 24 hour stint on the Border.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not disregard this issue.  It will build up and it is one on which people are already organising.  This side of the House agrees that proper recognition should be given to men and women doing sterling duty on the Border to ensure that not only does BSE not come into the State, but that the paramilitary threat from the northern side of the Border is kept at bay.  He should give due regard to and not turn his back on them.</P>
    <P>Morale is at an all time low in the Aiken Barracks because of this issue.  That attitude is replicated along the Border.  This is a vital issue if the Minister is to maintain a sense of loyalty and duty in our Army.  If he disregards that he will do so at his peril.</P>

In tabling this motion in Private Members' time the Opposition succeeded in rehashing a mixed bag of well worn criticisms which are wilting at this point.  This motion is long on negative criticisms but short on positive proposals.  The Minister and I have dealt with all these issues on many occasions.  I will gladly deal with them again here to demonstrate for the House the progress this Government has made with the much needed reform of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged by all concerned that reform of the Defence Forces is necessary.  When in Government the Opposition presided over the examination of the Defence Forces by the consultants engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group.  Members will recall how the selective leaking of that report, beginning in July 1994, gave rise to much rumour and unhelpful speculation about a number of issues.  These rumours served only to fuel the fears and anxieties of members of the Defence Forces and their families &mdash; fears and anxieties that had no basis or foundation in fact.</P>
      <P>This Government has taken the reform process in hand.  A comprehensive implementation plan for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces was speedily drawn up.  With the full involvement of the military authorities and the representative bodies all the cards were laid on the table so that all participants in the process are now working in full knowledge of the ultimate objective.  That objective is a Defence Forces structure and organisation tailored to the roles laid down for it by the Government in 1993.  It will be a leaner, fitter organisation with an enhanced operational capability.  It will be an organisation of which military personnel can be justifiably proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased level of public awareness of the Defence Forces and its problems dates from the late 1980s when there was considerable agitation <Col N="93" /> about the establishment of representative associations for the personnel of the Permanent Defence Forces.  This issue was successfully addressed in the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 under which both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association were established. When that legislation was being processed the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces &mdash; the Gleeson Commission &mdash; examined conditions of service in the Defence Forces and made recommendations. The Gleeson Commission also identified a number of serious organisational problems facing the Defence Forces primarily in the area of manpower policy.  Such was the concern raised by this report that further scrutinies were undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group at the instance of the Government.  In the last of its three reviews the Efficiency Audit Group employed Price Waterhouse consultants to undertake a root and branch examination of the Defence Forces.  These consultants employed the expert services of a number of retired high ranking Canadian military officers to assist them in their research.  Their report was completed in July 1994.</P>
    <P>The Efficiency Audit Group report contained a penetrating analysis of the most important problems facing the Defence Forces and made recommendations for their solution.  It has fallen to this Government to act on that report.  Thus, in July 1995 the Government announced that it had accepted in principle the conclusions of the Efficiency Audit Group on the need for major reform in the structures and organisation of the Defence Forces.  Deputy Smith called for a clear mission statement.  Our objectives include properly structured well equipped Defence Forces capable of fulfilling their role in the most effective and efficient way, with the capacity and flexibility to adapt to a changing environment; Defence Forces that provide a challenging and rewarding career; and management organisation and operation of the Defence Forces in accordance with best practice.</P>
    <P>The Government was particularly conscious of criticisms by the Efficiency Audit Group to the effect that the age profile of the Permanent Defence Force was too high, its top management structure was inappropriate to modern conditions, its operational effectiveness was impaired by ineffective geographical disposition with many military personnel engaged on administrative duties which could be undertaken by civilians and too many medically unfit personnel.  This resulted in a shortage of operational personnel occasioned by inefficiency and not by a general shortage of manpower and there was an inappropriate ratio of pay to nonpay expenditure with insufficient funds for equipment, buildings and training.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the very serious position indicated by the EAG report, this Government moved immediately.  An implementation group, <Col N="94" /> led by Mr. A.D. Barry, was commissioned to draw up a specific three year plan to identify which of the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse consultants could be put into effect in the short term.  The Government specifically tasked the implementation group with preparing a plan which would address the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force on a three brigade structure with a manpower level of around 11,500.  I draw Deputies' attention to the fact that the three brigade structure and the target strength of 11,500 are based on proposals drawn up by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>The programme of reform of the Defence Forces this Government is implementing is the most far-reaching and widest ranging reform or change the Defence Forces have seen since their foundation.  Clearly this is a most complex process and one which cuts across every area of military life.  It does not take a great deal of insight to appreciate that in any organisation there will be certain resistance to change.  Voices will be raised in protest when certain interests are perceived as being threatened.  The Government is anxious to handle the reform of the Defence Forces in a sensitive and humane way.  For this reason it has placed consultation with the representative associations at the head of its priorities in the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  Before detailing the steps the Government has taken in this regard I will outline a number of key areas where reform has already begun and is well in progress.</P>
    <P>The high age profile of the Permanent Defence Force has already been adverted to as a very serious problem.  Specifically, the Government has approved a number of policy initiatives designed to address this problem, chief among which is the introduction of a voluntary early retirement scheme about which I will say more later.  In addition, the Government is committed to recruiting some 1,000 new entrants into the Permanent Defence Force in the three year life of the plan.  The plan also provides for the induction of recruits into the Permanent Defence Force for a five year fixed term contract, following which their continuance in service will be determined by criteria drawn up following consultations with PDFORRA.  Advertisements were placed in the national newspapers recently and the selection process has already commenced.  On completion of this process it is intended that 200 recruits will be enlisted on 30 December.</P>
    <P>High among the Government's priorities will be the position of those who do not wish to make a long-term career in the Defence Forces, but who wish to acquire skills and training that will benefit them when they seek employment on the job market.  These include office management, IT skills, driving, cooking, stores management and security work.  The plan also suggests that more opportunities for young non-commissioned officers to achieve commissioned rank should be developed.  This is something to which the Government is committed.  In relation to <Col N="95" /> manpower policy for commissioned officers there are proposals, which will also be the subject of consultation with RACO, for a reduction in retiring ages or a capping of years which may be served on promotion to a higher rank.  A study will also be undertaken to examine the feasibility of introducing short service commissions to address the perennial problem of a shortage of junior officers.</P>
    <P>Matters are already in train to reorganise the Defence Forces around a three brigade infantry organisation.  The Air Corps and the Naval Service will remain as service corps of the Permanent Defence Force.  The infantry brigade group will be the main operational element of the Army and its basic military formation with a conventional all arms capability.  In tandem with the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force structures there will be rationalisation of the command control and top management arrangements.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Government has been most anxious to ensure that the personnel of the Permanent Defence Force take ownership of the entire reform process and are at one with it. Towards this end the Government has striven to ensure that RACO and PDFORRA and the personnel whom they represent are kept fully informed of all developments as they happen. The Minister has met representatives of both representative associations on eight separate occasions in the past year or so to hear their opinions and discuss with them his views and those of the Government.  It is of great importance that the representative associations and the personnel of the Defence Forces regard the entire process of reform as a positive opportunity for the Defence Forces rather than as something which has been imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>Participation in the process of change by the representative associations is vital to the successful implementation of the reorganisation and reform process.  Thus, the representative associations have been repeatedly consulted on all aspects of the implementation plan.  These consultations and discussions have taken place under the auspices of the Defence Forces conciliation council.  This is the most appropriate forum in which to deal with the various issues either side may wish to raise.  The associations have been told on a number of occasions that there is a degree of flexibility in the way in which the implementation plan will be given effect and I am happy to reiterate this assurance.</P>
    <P>While it would be preferable to reach agreement with the associations on every issue we must be realistic enough to appreciate that such a scenario is unlikely.  As I stated previously, an extensive process of reform, such as the one we have undertaken, will involve a degree of resistance from certain interests.  Thus, the representative associations will pursue their own agenda and continue to represent their members to the best of their abilities.  It would be wrong, therefore, to pretend that if both sides have <Col N="96" /> examined an issue from every conceivable angle but have not been able to reach a mutually acceptable compromise the Government can abdicate its responsibility to make decisions in the national interest.  Hard decisions may have to be made down the road but the Government is confident that it will be possible to reach an accommodation with the representative associations on a wide range of issues.  In this way, the process of reform when it has been the subject of extensive consultations will come to be seen not as a threat but a challenging opportunity to the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The first part of the restructuring process is concentrating on the structures and organisation of the Permanent Defence Force.  However, during the three year implementation plan, the reserve Defence Forces will be the subject of a special study by my Department.  The Minister has already met members of the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association and explained and discussed aspects of the EAG review with them.  As we progress at a later stage to a more detailed examination of the reserve there will be ample opportunity for full consultation with the association.</P>
    <P>I am trying to adopt a positive approach to this debate in outlining the measures which have been initiated by the Government in relation to the reform of the Defence Forces.  However, I take issue with the Opposition Deputies' motion which suggests that the Government has failed to articulate a coherent policy on defence matters.  I take a completely contrary view.  Such a comprehensive and detailed policy programme in relation to the Defence Forces has never been stated by any previous Government.  All major aspects of Defence Forces reform for the next three years are contained in the 133 pages of the Defence Forces review implementation plan.  This has received the widest circulation throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>For the first time military personnel have available to them a comprehensive and detailed written statement of Government intentions in regard to their future and I disclaim any allegation that nobody knows what is happening. At the same time they now have, and have had for a number of years, a sophisticated machinery for articulating their views and concerns through their representative associations.  It is fair that Deputies should recall the remarkable transformation which has taken place in military affairs in the past seven years.  Prior to the introduction of representation military personnel had no effective voice with which to articulate the way they felt about their remuneration and conditions of service.  Now, following the successful introduction of the representative associations, they have a regular input into the formation of departmental policy through the consultative process and &mdash; something which Governments may not always like &mdash; a high media profile to give voice to their concerns.</P>
    <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Defence Forces was introduced <Col N="97" /> as part of the implementation plan.  The first charge which must be refuted is that there is any confusion concerning the voluntary early retirement scheme &mdash; known as the VER scheme &mdash; for the Defence Forces.  Deputy Smith claimed a member of the organisation said they do not know what is happening.  However, there is no confusion concerning the VER&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unless we are talking about the obvious confusion of Deputy Power and Deputy Smith.  There is no confusion on the part of the forces so I do not know to whom the Deputies are talking.  It is important to understand and repeat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must listen to them before he would be aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this is an entirely voluntary scheme and no member of the Defence Forces is being made to leave compulsorily or against their wishes.  I stress that no member of the Defence Forces is being forced to avail of VER.  Anyone who says otherwise is being mischievous and raising unnecessary concern and confusion.</P>
      <P>The Government's main concerns have been to ensure that the scheme makes sense in relation to the needs of the Defence Forces so that we create the type of Defence Forces this country needs and to ensure that the scheme makes sense from the point of view of the taxpayer who is footing the bill.  Initially the VER scheme was targeted at personnel in categories where it was expected that the level of take up would be reasonably high.  These included: personnel aged 50 and over on 31 December 1996; medical category C personnel; Naval Service personnel who suffer from chronic sea sickness, and members of what is often described as &ldquo;the hump&rdquo;, namely, members of the 46th to 53rd cadet classes and third potential officers course.</P>
      <P>When discussing the VER scheme we should remember that we are talking about taxpayers' money.  This year alone the taxpayer will be required to provide an additional £16 million to fund the scheme.  Over the three year life of the plan this figure will be in the order of £50 million. It is obvious, therefore, that the VER scheme must achieve its objectives.  We must also remember that the VER scheme involves management spending additional money, that is, money over and above the normal allocation, in order to achieve savings in the long-term.  VER is not being funded to provide a windfall for the fortunate few.  It is a management tool and its success or value will be judged by management criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By any standard, the VER scheme is attractive. This is borne out by the number of personnel who applied.  The number of applications received was <Col N="98" /> over twice the number of places available.  The terms of the scheme are generous and Deputies will be interested in some examples of the type of financial package available.  A commandant aged 39 years will receive a VER gratuity of £38,173 in addition to his normal retirement gratuity of £21,052.  That is a total tax free lump sum of £59,225.  He will also receive a pension of £9,858 per annum payable immediately and for the rest of his life.  A sergeant with 21 years service will receive a VER gratuity of £26,643 in addition to his normal retirement gratuity of £8,540.  That is a total tax free lump sum of £35,183.  He will also receive a pension of £125.45 per week payable immediately and for the rest of his life.  These figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The VER scheme was introduced following the most exhaustive and detailed planning.  The composition and presentation of VER schemes in other public service organisations were studied to ensure that my Department's scheme incorporated all of the necessary features to make it clear, unambiguous and easy to understand and avail of.</P>
    <P>With the assistance of outside consultants a comprehensive information booklet was prepared which explained the VER scheme in simple and lucid terms and gave detailed advice on such matters as eligibility, how the lump sum and pension would be calculated, social welfare and other entitlements and how to apply for VER.</P>
    <P>Before the scheme was launched command service advisory teams were selected, trained and established in each of the commands and in the Naval Service and Air Corps.  Those teams were specially trained in all aspects of the VER scheme and were able to provide pre-decision counselling and advice on topics such as social welfare entitlements, taxation, insurance, health insurance, timeframe of the scheme, as well as providing detailed information on the terms and conditions of the scheme and assistance in filling out the application forms.  Personnel management units in each location provided additional support.  At all times the approach was one of adopting best practice.</P>
    <P>Applications for VER were evaluated by a board especially established for this purpose.  It comprised military personnel including an NCO, a representative of the Department of Defence and an outside civilian with experience in this area.  Following evaluation by the board, successful applicants were given 14 days to indicate their acceptance or otherwise of the offer of VER.  Pressure was not put on VER applicants. This scheme was and is entirely voluntary and no one was, at any stage, coerced or compelled to apply for VER.  Once the formal offer was accepted by the applicant, the decision became irrevocable.</P>
    <P>The scheme was oversubscribed and, therefore, it was not possible to offer VER to everyone who applied for it this year.  As an exceptional measure in response to approaches by both representative associations, members of the <Col N="99" /> Defence Forces who wanted to leave the force in the short term were facilitated by allowing them to avail of unpaid pre-retirement support leave. Personnel who availed of that concession will receive their full VER and pension gratuities in January 1997.  This concession was intended primarily to facilitate the small number of personnel who, it had been represented by the Representative Associations, were in a position to take up alternative employment immediately. It was not thought that the concession would be of interest or of benefit to the majority of personnel who could not be accommodated by this year's scheme.  Some 20 officers and 99 NCOs and privates availed of the concession.  Personnel who did not avail of it did not prejudice their right to apply for or be considered for next year's VER scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern accused the Government of not addressing the issue of barrack closures in its amendment.  That issue, which is one of the Opposition's hoary old chestnuts, does not arise.  It will conveniently grab a headline because it is an emotive issue.  Those who continue to raise it show scant regard for the concerns and worries of members of the Defence Forces and their families.  The Minister and I have made it abundantly clear at every available opportunity that the question of barrack closures does not, and never has, formed part of the implementation plan.  Barrack closures is simply not on the agenda.</P>
    <P>I will deal specifically with the issue of pensions which has been raised here.  Provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they opted in writing not to become members.  The widows of soldiers who opted out receive the same PRSI pension as widows generally.  In other words, there is no question of widows being left without anything.</P>
    <P>In 1985 a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted when all soldiers &mdash; as well as pensioners and the representatives of deceased soldiers &mdash; who had opted out of the scheme in 1978 were again invited to reconsider their decision and to join a revised scheme.  Unfortunately, only a relatively small number availed of that option.</P>
    <P>At this stage, all soldiers who were serving when the original scheme was introduced in 1978 have had two opportunities to join the scheme. Only the widows of those soldiers who chose on the two occasions not to become members of the contributory scheme are ineligible for supplementary pensions under the scheme.  While the position of these widows has been sympathetically considered, I regret to say that, for a variety of reasons, it has not been found possible to make any concession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> While I have every concern for the spouses and children of deceased soldiers who consciously opted out of the contributory pension scheme, I regret I cannot make any concession to them. This issue was raised with the Opposition when in it was in Government and it was forced by the same facts to reach the same conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service and Air Corps perform some of the tasks central to the redefined roles of the Defence Forces.  The Government has already given a firm commitment that we will not leave the Naval Service or the Air Corps without adequate manpower to run and maintain ships and aircraft.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years a growing appreciation of the value of our marine resources has coincided with a period of growth and development for the Naval Service and Air Corps.  The extension of our exclusive fishery limit to 200 miles offshore marked a turning point in our appreciation of the importance of the sea as an economic asset.  As a result the Naval Service and the Air Corps have seen considerable growth and development.  Some time ago we reached agreement on the new EU fisheries surveillance five year package, which, for the first time, includes an element of funding for operational costs for Ireland.  As part of that package Ireland has been granted funding to ensure the implementation of the new entry-exit arrangements which came into force on I January this year.  In relation to the programme for 1997, Ireland's application, which has been submitted, provides for a downpayment for a new patrol vessel.</P>
    <P>The continuing success of the Naval Service in fishery protection, in search and rescue and its important role in dealing with pollution threats have resulted in a much more widespread appreciation of its outstanding work.  The Air Corps perform vitally important functions in search and rescue, air ambulance, security operations and, from time to time, assist in nonmilitary operations such as the relief of distress in emergency situations arising from natural disasters.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for preventing the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.  The Defence Forces, including the Naval Service and the Air Corps, respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance. The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 will increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  Furthermore, a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service has been established by the Government.</P>
    <P>Recognising the diversity of tasks performed by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, the Government decided that, as an integral part of the process of implementing the recommendations of the efficiency audit group, separate in-depth studies should be carried out on their structure and organisation.  Those studies are being done <Col N="101" /> by consultants on behalf of the efficiency audit group.  The consultants have experts in maritime and aviation matters on their teams.  I understand that the studies will be completed around the end of this month.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the incidence of duty along the Border has increased due to BSE patrolling. However, where a person is required to work additional hours in any given week, compensatory time off is provided.  To ease the burden in this regard 50 additional personnel reported to the 27th Infantry Battalion recently to assist in the performance of BSE patrol duty. Additional support from non-Border commands is planned for the near future.</P>
    <P>In 1972 Border duty allowance was introduced for those personnel engaged on duties on the Border.  Personnel working in Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £49.57 per week in the case of officers and £43.81 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates.  The allowance is paid, irrespective of the hours worked, on a continuous basis, including during periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.  In addition to Border duty allowance a military service allowance of just over £2,000 per annum is payable to all ranks.</P>
    <P>In regard to pay and allowances to members of the Permanent Defence Force, the average gross pay of enlisted personnel at £320 compares very favourably with incomes generally.  Considering that the average gross weekly earnings for a male industrial worker, which includes overtime, service pay, shift and other allowances, is £315.15 per week, I do not think military personnel can be bracketed with the poorly paid.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues on the other side of the House for giving me additional time.  I want to make it clear that the very negative impression conveyed by the motion is in stark contrast with my personal experience.  In September I witnessed our troops in their peace-keeping role. When the roles of the Defence Forces were restated in 1993 peace-keeping was identified as one of the principal tasks to be carried out.  Irish soldiers have built up an enviable reputation world-wide as peace-keepers.  Frequently patience and diplomacy may be as necessary as the conventional skills of the soldier.  Decades of experience have shown that Irish soldiers have these qualities in abundance and the number of requests the Government receives from the United Nations confirms the high regard in which Irish soldiers are held.</P>
    <P>On my recent visit to the Middle East I saw at first-hand the tremendous work being carried out by Irish troops in the cause of peace.  I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations force in Cyprus.  The force commander, Brigadier General Vartiainen was loud in his praise and made special mention of Ireland's contribution down the years to UNFICYP.  The Chief of Staff of UNFICYP, Colonel Talbot, also commended the Irish involvement.</P>
    <P>I also visited the Irish contingent serving with the United Nations interim force in Lebanon. <Col N="102" /> Our single biggest contribution to the United Nations in terms of personnel continues to be the UNIFIL mission.  Irish contingents have served with UNIFIL since 1978 and while the mandate has not yet been fulfilled a great deal has been achieved in the intervening years.  An important contribution has been made to the lives of thousands of Lebanese people who have been protected from the worst excesses of the conflict and have been allowed to lead a near normal lifestyle.  One of the highlights of my visits to South Lebanon was the ceremony for the presentation of medals by the force commander to the Irish troops serving there.  The force commander, Major General Wozniak, paid generous tributes to the work carried out by successive Irish battalions.  He stated that Irish troops had made an immeasurable contribution to the efforts by the United Nations to fulfil the mandate laid down by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>While in the Middle East I took the opportunity to travel to Damascus where I met Irish military observers serving with the United Nations truce supervision organisation.  The issue of the Golan Heights, which I visited while in Syria, is crucial to the ultimate success of the Middle East peace process.  In Damascus I also met Major General Mustafa Tlass, the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence. General Tlass expressed his country's appreciation of Ireland's contribution through its involvement in the UNTSO mission to the whole peace process.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government approved the participation of the Defence Forces in the United Nations standby arrangements.  The concept of stand-by forces for UN peace-keeping missions has been in development since 1990.  This system is intended to enhance the United Nations' capacity for a rapid response to emergencies. Member states will specify resources which could be made available within agreed response times for UN peacekeeping operations mandated by the Security Council.  These resources may be military personnel or units, civilian police, civilian personnel, equipment or services.  Our commitment in terms of military personnel will be up to 850 people.  This is indicative of the Government's strong commitment to peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to press ahead with the most comprehensive programme of reform ever been undertaken in the Defence Forces.  I have every confidence that the adaptability displayed by members of the Defence Forces down the years will continue.  I have no doubt that the organisation and its representative bodies will respond to the challenge which the EAG process presents.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Army and the Minister on the recent historic event where a young lady was taken into the Army Equitation School.  I know this young girl and have witnessed her achievements over many years.  I compliment Colonel Ringrose who will retire next year &mdash; he retired this year as chef d'équipe of the Aga Khan team &mdash; for the tremendous job he has done over the years and the great successes he has achieved, despite the fact that successive Governments have given a pittance &mdash; £500,000 &mdash; to the Army Equitation School.  Because the school does not have a transport box, it has to hire transport for its horses, which is ridiculous.  I ask the Minister to consider allocating an extra £80,000 or £100,000 to enable the school, which has brought great honour to this country and elsewhere in terms of horse sales, to purchase a transport box.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue relating to a woman who visited my clinic last Saturday, a widow with six children who worked for 19 years as a civilian in Kickham Barracks in Clonmel.  The woman gave me the last two cheques she received with a notice stating that in future she would receive her cheques per fortnight instead of per month.  Her pension, even though it is only £1.20 per month &mdash; 30p per week &mdash; is to be paid at 60p per fortnight.  I sent the cheques back to the Minister for Defence with a letter stating that I cannot understand how anyone who worked for 19 years for the military authorities could receive such a paltry and insulting pension.  The cost of issuing the cheque, without taking into account the cost of computerising the payment, is almost half the pension.  That woman was ashamed to go to the bank to cash her cheques.  The Minister should take up this matter with his senior colleague in the Department who has the audacity not only to pay such a paltry pension but to break it down to a fortnightly payment.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that as a result of consultation matters have never been clearer, but that is not the case.  There is total confusion within the Army.  Rumours of military barracks closing, whether in Clonmel, Kilkenny, Fermoy, Ballincollig, Limerick or elsewhere, create great uncertainty within the Army.  Young men who have bought houses are afraid that if they do not join the voluntary early retirement scheme they will be transferred.  There are no assurances in that regard.  There is lack of advice to personnel in the Army and the Civil Defence on whether it is more profitable for them to retire or to stay at work.</P>
      <P>A number of other issues have to be considered, such as the social issues of whether or not the barracks will close.  The real issue of barracks closure as the Minister knows is that if enough people avail of the early retirement scheme there will be no personnel left to service the barracks.  It is a clever way of achieving what the Minister wants.  The Minister is not closing the barracks; the barracks will close because of the uncertainty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that both the Minister and the Department of Defence refused to properly <Col N="104" /> recognise the worthwhile contribution of all battalions of the FCA this year.  There was a formal ceremony in Dublin for those in the LDF and the FCA but nothing was organised within the command areas by the Department and the Army.  Nothing was done to recognise the people who gave up their free time to serve in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The chief of staff said recently that because of the shortage of personnel in the Army, FCA personnel might be required to do military service on a full-time basis.  If it is good enough to be considered for that service, the FCA should be recognised before the end of this year in every battalion area and every company area.  Those men and women who served in the past and who continue to give their voluntary service should be recognised.</P>
    <P>The information available about voluntary retirement is confusing and there is much uncertainty for those who availed of the scheme. They have no incomes.  They were not entitled to draw unemployment benefit.  They were not entitled to take up a permanent job because they were not sure whether they would be accepted for voluntary early retirement.  They could not get unemployment benefit in the local labour exchange.  The Minister tells us that this year they will get a payment of between £3,000 and £4,000 in two sums before Christmas.  That will not pay the debts they have incurred from either the credit union or banks, if the banks were generous enough to lend money to people in these circumstances.  They are not extremely generous in that regard to people serving in the Army or in any industrial job.  I would be surprised if the personnel involved do not end up in debt as a result of that uncertainty.  I hope to see a far greater social service introduced in the Army so that professional social workers can help personnel and ensure that people are properly informed and advised in the best interests of their careers, their families and their future.</P>
    <P>I want the case of a woman who worked in Kickham barracks for 19 years, a widow with six children, to be considered.  She is paid a paltry pension of 60p per fortnight.  It costs more than half that for the civil servant to put the cheque into an envelope and put a stamp on it.  We should ensure that no such disgraceful pensions are paid out.  When those cheques arrived on the Minister's desk yesterday morning I hope somebody had a twinge of conscience about them.  I hope somebody asked why this lady gets only £1.20 per month at 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Department had the cheek to tell her it will be made easier for her, that she will be paid once a fortnight.  Once a fortnight she will get 60p after 19 years work.  Compare that to what is paid out to Army officers.  It is not good enough to treat a civilian worker in that fashion.  That is not the way to treat a victim of circumstances, a widow who was desperate to get work to support her children and who had a sense of duty towards her family.  I will give her name to the Minister after this debate.  I want to see that wrong <Col N="105" /> corrected.  I want to see the recognition of her plight.  In her declining years she should have something more to look forward to than a pittance of 30p per week from the Army.</P>

      <P>I support the motion eloquently proposed by my party spokesman on defence, Deputy Smith, and by Deputy Power. We are debating a very important arm of our Constitution.  The Army is very stretched because of many problems in our country.  We have the BSE problem on the Border and the prospect of a new political situation which I hope will not arise.  This creates further problems for the numbers and personnel of the Defence Forces. Side by side with that I understand 700 Irish troops serve with the United Nations every six months which also creates problems.</P>
      <P>Due to retirement and the voluntary retirement package, personnel are not being replaced at the required level.  Some 300 will take voluntary retirement this year and it is envisaged that 900 will retire in 1997.  That will put major strain on the Army.  Who will man Army posts around the country?  Will the personnel be available?  That question remains unanswered.</P>
      <P>We have a very effective Air Corps and Naval Service.  The latter deals with fisheries protection and drug interception.  I congratulate the Naval Service on major seizures of contraband.  Were it not for their vigilant approach and watchful eye, much of this material would not come into the hands of the authorities and would be used for illegal purposes.  Our Naval Service is not given due recognition for the wonderful work it does in protecting our very valuable fishing industry.</P>
      <P>In the years ahead, our fishing industry will become more and more valuable as a natural asset that has been untapped for many years but we will come under greater attack from foreign trawlers from the major fishing countries because of the richness of our seas.  If we do not strengthen the Naval Service by giving it the necessary equipment, we will lose much of this rich asset and the fish that are so valuable to our economy.</P>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention by a number of Army personnel that the gardaí who go on duty to the Border for a two-month stretch get a sum of approximately £3,000 while Army personnel who go on Border duty come home with £320.  There is something wrong there and the situation has to be examined.  They are playing a major role on the Border.  They are away from home and all they are entitled to is a £45 allowance before tax.  After a two-month stint they get approximately £320.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of personnel retiring in the next two years will definitely lead to the closure of many barracks.  I ask the Minister to be honest with the people in those towns who are dependent on Army personnel for the much needed income to shops and businesses and also to be honest with the members of the Defence Forces.  There is no point in hiding behind reports because we are all aware that major changes are <Col N="106" /> taking place.  Army barracks are not being maintained.  They are being run down and there should be no doubt in anyone's mind about that. They are very seriously run down.  One army barracks in my constituency, Fitzgerald Camp near Fermoy, had the first motor squadron.  It is in a serious state of decay and in need of urgent repair.</P>
    <P>Civilian staff are not being replaced, be they qualified or general operatives.  Craftsmen such as carpenters, who are necessary for the maintenance of these camps, are not being replaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this important issue.  I am concerned and disappointed &mdash; and it is no reflection on my good friend from Cork, Deputy Allen &mdash; that the Minister for Education is not here to address this issue.  She has been asked to receive deputations on several occasions this year but she has been unhelpful.  It is saddening to have to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 170 pupils attending Gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís in Mallow.  It has eight classrooms and eight teachers and was established in 1985.  The structure is mainly Portakabins which have strong fungus growth in the timbers which is unsafe for children and teachers.  The site is owned by Cork County Council and a proposal has been made to the Department of Education to purchase the site from the council so that a new development can be put in place.  This was conveyed to the Department in January 1996 and, to date, nothing has been forthcoming but letters and Dáil questions being asked that receive negative answers, in some cases, the response: &ldquo;we will be in touch&rdquo;.  We are now looking for action.</P>
      <P>The conditions in the school are bad, the floors and windows are rotten, the roof is leaking and fungus grows on the windows.  I do not wish to be sensational, my policy is to be constructive.  This is a most unhealthy atmosphere for teachers and pupils.  Classrooms are small and do not satisfy Department of Education criteria.  Without being sensational, the fire officer could close the school at the stroke of a pen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were it not for the love of the Irish language, the school would not exist.  There is fantastic <Col N="107" /> commitment from teachers and parents of the children who attend the gaelscoil.  It is one of the more innovative gaelscoileanna on the island.  It is a shame that any Minister should end that innovation and commitment to education through the Irish language.  Our tradition is to support our national tongue.  I am not a great speaker of Irish but I greatly admire those who develop, foster and promote our language as part of the cultural identity we have inherited.  It has been the spoken language of many great and dedicated Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to take this message on behalf of my Mallow constituents. Knowing the work he is doing, perhaps he will have a word in the Minister's ear.  It is time she listened to the dedicated teachers and people of Mallow and gave them a school worthy of the name and of which we can be proud.  The Irish language should be fostered and continue to grow in the great town of Mallow where Thomas Davis, William O'Brien and many other Irish patriots were born and educated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising the matter.  It gives me an opportunity to clarify the position. Gaelscoil Thomáis Dháibhís was established with temporary recognition in 1985 to meet a demand in the Mallow area for education through the medium of Irish.  Permanent recognition was granted to the school in May 1990.  The school is located in prefabricated accommodation, which is less than satisfactory, adjacent to Mallow vocational school.</P>
      <P>I should mention at this stage that an application from the school for minor improvement works has been approved and grant aid has been provided.</P>
      <P>My Department accepts that the existing accommodation is not adequate for the school's needs and that permanent accommodation is required.  Generally, there are two options for the provision of permanent accommodation for gaelscoileanna.  One is to provide a new school building on a new site and the other is to secure existing primary school accommodation which has become surplus to requirements due to falling enrolments.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the overall accommodation in the Mallow Centre. Where there is existing surplus primary school accommodation, as in the case of Mallow, my Department must give that option serious consideration as an alternative to the funding of a new site and building.  The Deputy will appreciate that every effort must be made to make effective use of public money, particularly at a time when the demand for building projects exceeds available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the urgency of the need for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Thomáis Dháibhís, my Department is also examining the question of the acquisition of a <Col N="108" /> site.  A potential site, which was identified by the board of management of the gaelscoil, has been inspected by an architect from the Department and is considered generally suitable.  However, while contact has been made with the owners regarding its availability, it has been established that the site does not have direct road access and the question of arranging access through an adjacent site is being examined at present.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the question of providing permanent accommodation for the school is being treated as a matter of urgency in my Department.  Deputy O'Keeffe's views will be given to the Minister as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to bring this matter to the attention of the House.  I have received correspondence from the two principals of St. Philip's national school, Clonsilla, which conveys the validity of the case.  The correspondence is from Principal Brian Wall of the junior national school and Principal Michael Downes of the senior national school.  It says: &ldquo;Enclosed is a copy of a request from the above schools for a computer teacher to serve the needs of both schools.  We would be more than pleased if you could make representations to the Department of Education on our behalf&rdquo;.  The letter to the Department was written by Fr. Des Hogan and Fr. Tom Colreavy, chairpersons of the schools and reads as follows:</P>
      <P>As you are no doubt aware, the above schools are situated in a Disadvantaged Area with all its attendant problems.</P>
      <P>For the past number of years both schools have endeavoured, with great difficulty, to expose the children to the benefits of Computer Education.</P>
      <P>We have begged and bought, restored and renovated, and to date we have three computers in the Senior School and six in the Junior School.  We would now like to pool our resources within one classroom area (and we have one to spare) and roster the various classes for their computer period.</P>
      <P>We have a teacher who is more than qualified to teach any recommended programme to the children of both schools.</P>
      <P>What we are now asking [for] is an extra teacher, which in reality, works out at a half teacher for each school, to replace a &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; teacher if one were granted to us.</P>
      <P>We feel that the children deserve this and it may place them on a more equal footing with children from other areas, whose parents can afford extra-curricular tuition, or whose schools &mdash; because of their location &mdash; are able to resource a teacher to do what we are striving to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would appeal to the Department to look favourably on this request.  Also, the Department must be aware that due to falling numbers, each of the two schools will lose a <Col N="109" /> teacher to the Panel at the end of this academic year.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in Dublin 15 that previous Ministers, Taoisigh and Governments, including the present one, have succeeded in attracting some of the world's leading computer based industries to the area, including 3Com, IBM and Intel and Hewlett Packard in north Kildare. Tremendous job creation successes have been achieved in west Dublin and north Kildare.  The computer is at the heart of that employment.  A disadvantaged primary school in this area is looking for meagre assistance to ensure pupils get the opportunity to lay the foundations for a computer career recognising the success of job creation projects in Dublin 15.  It is a reasonable request and I hope the Minister will respond positively.  We are asking for a redeployment of resources and a recognition of the importance of a computer based education for primary school pupils.</P>
    <P>We had a successful meeting with the Minister on the location of the regional technical college in June.  She was impressed by the fact that we brought in employers from computer based industries in the greater Blanchardstown area and emphasised the potential for the regional technical college to offer technically based subjects.  If the Department takes action at primary school level, it would be appreciated and it would be a positive step in educating primary school pupils in computer technology at this early stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Primary education is founded on the belief that high quality education enables children to realise their potential as individuals and to live their lives to the fullest capacity as is appropriate to their particular stage of development.  A good primary education gives children a firm basis for future participation in and progression through the education system.</P>
      <P>The primary school curriculum is based on the following principles: the full and harmonious development of the child with due allowances made for individual differences; the central importance of activity and guided discovery learning and teaching methods; and teaching and learning through an integrated curriculum and through activities related to the child's environment.</P>
      <P>These principles identify a child centred approach outlined in the 1971 review of the primary school curriculum which radically changed the philosophy and methodology of primary education from its previous emphasis on subject centred, didactic teaching.  Primary education now emphasises the central position of the individual child and promotes a curriculum related to the child's needs and interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child centred principles of the 1971 curriculum were endorsed in 1990 in reports by the Review Body of the Primary Curriculum and <Col N="110" /> the Primary Education Review Body.  The following year the Minister for Education invited the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to conduct a continuing review of the primary curriculum, while retaining the basis of the principles adopted in 1971.</P>
    <P>The review is taking account of the rapid social, scientific and technological change which is taking place, and of Ireland's position in the European Union and the wider world.  It is also aiming at a more precise statement of objectives where possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in terms of student behaviour and attainments.  In addition, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will make recommendations on the time allocations necessary to achieve the stated objectives for each subject taught.  This will be particularly important because of the need to balance a wide range of curricular objectives with the amount of school time available.</P>
      <P>Scientific and technological developments have an enormous influence on our society, whether through their economic and social effects or through their impact on individual lifestyle.  In a fast-changing world it is important that people are able to understand such innovations and to evaluate their implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from their wider effects, science and technology play an important role in the student's intellectual formation, complementing educational experiences in the arts and humanities.</P>
      <P>The development of a new science programme will form an integral part of the review of the social and environmental programme now in preparation.  This new programme will foster the development of scientific thought processes and approaches to problem solving, with an emphasis on critical and constructive thinking, which will have applications in other parts of the curriculum,</P>
      <P>Until the review of the primary curriculum has been fully completed, and its contents assessed, the Deputy will no doubt appreciate that it would be inappropriate for the Minister for Education to assign additional staffing resources to the schools in Mountview for computer studies.  I would, however, point out that in addition to the mainstream staffing of 24 teachers between St. Philip's junior and St. Philip's senior schools, the two schools have in total nine ex quota posts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has <Col N="111" /> not come to the House to address the matters raised by three Deputies pertaining to education. It is scandalous that she should treat Adjournment debates in this manner and has done almost since the beginning of her term in office.  The major issues raised related to Gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís in Mallow, computer education in Dublin 15 and the Youthreach dispute where industrial action is pending following a ballot, but the Minister did not see fit to come to the House to respond.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter to highlight the scandalous treatment of teachers working in the Youthreach centres throughout the country.  The teachers and personnel involved work 48 weeks per year and 35 class contact hours per week which is way and above the norm applying to the mainstream educational system.  They work on a year-to-year contract, have no permanency and have the worst conditions in the education service.  Their work is particularly stressful and there is a high turnover of staff because of the combination of poor working conditions and the intensive nature of the work involved.</P>
      <P>Young people aged between 15 and 18 years participate in Youthreach.  These young people do not normally have formal qualifications from the education system.  They are generally referred from second level schools to Youthreach.  Most of them would have had difficulty surviving in the mainstream second level system.  Within this age cohort these young people are clearly the most disadvantaged in the education system and their needs are great.  It is a sad indictment of the Minister for Education that those working with the most disadvantaged sector in the second level education system are the most poorly treated and paid in the education system.</P>
      <P>This situation makes a mockery of the Minister's claim to be the Minister for the disadvantaged.  She is anything but that.  The European White Paper on training stressed the need to give the best pay and conditions to those who work with young disadvantaged people who deserve the best we can give them.  We are doing the exact opposite in Ireland.  The people working in Youthreach do not have any security, are underpaid and work in poor conditions.  They are performing miracles on behalf of us all.</P>
      <P>The CHL Consulting Group carried out a study of the staffing arrangements of Youthreach for the Department of Education.  That study concluded last April and in its report there is a clear illustration of the success of Youthreach despite all the difficulties and the poor conditions experienced by their personnel.  The people working in these centres who are at the frontier of combating disadvantage enjoy success, but they are treated in a contemptuous way by the Minister for Education and the Government. They deserve better treatment than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should intervene to resolve the dispute which has been ongoing for a considerable period.  The TUI has been in negotiation with the Department for a long time but no progress has been made.  The fact that 95 <Col N="112" /> per cent of the 250 people employed in Youthreach centres voted for industrial action is a clear illustration of the degree of frustration and anger on the ground.  This is yet another example of Labour Party hypocrisy in action.  The rhetoric is fine but the reality on the ground is very much different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to set out the position on this matter.  There is not an industrial dispute between the TUI and the Department in relation to this matter.  It might be helpful if I briefly outline the background to the Youthreach programme and the issues now at hand.</P>
      <P>Youthreach was launched by the Ministers for Education and Labour in October 1988 and initiated in January 1989.  It comprises a two year programme of education, training and work experience for unqualified early school leavers in the 15 to 18 year age group jointly delivered by the vocational education committees and FÁS.</P>
      <P>Youthreach was established initially as a temporary experimental programme.  This status is reflected in the employment of staff in the vocational education committee sector who are engaged either on a one year renewable contract or on a part-time basis.  These conditions of employment are central to the TUI claim in respect of its members engaged in Youthreach.  In this context paragraph 6.37 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> contained a commitment to discussions being held to review the staffing arrangements for the Youthreach programme in the education sector.</P>
      <P>Against this background the Department of Education commissioned CHL Consulting Group to carry out a review of the arrangements and conditions in Youthreach.  The report from the consultants made recommendations on the duties, staffing structure, qualifications profile and status of employment of staff on Youthreach having regard to the needs of the client group, the objectives of the programme and the provision in comparable services.  My Department has been engaged in discussions with the TUI in this connection.  I understand the result of a ballot by Youthreach staff will be presented to the TUI executive which will consider the course of action it proposes to take.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Youthreach programme is targeted at young people who leave school without qualifications and who are thereby at a significant disadvantage in the labour market and at risk of long-term unemployment.  The Youthreach programme plays a significant role in enabling these young people to redress the educational disadvantage which affects their life chances.  I am sure the Deputy will share my concern that any action which might be taken by the TUI in pursuit of its claim should not deprive these young people of their education and training opportunities, even for a short duration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter. The cost of insurance has long been a scandal which has continued unchecked for many years. Personal injury settlements in 1994, the last year for which figures are available, amounted to £410 million, an enormous sum of money for a country of this size and population.  The situation continues to disimprove.  It is not a surprise, therefore, to learn from the recent Deloitte &amp; Touche report on insurance costs that premiums here are higher, sometimes much higher, than elsewhere in western Europe.  On average claims are four times more expensive than in the United Kingdom.  In this context the announcement of a five per cent further increase in premiums by Guardian PMPA, which has 30 per cent of the Irish market, is deeply regretted.</P>
      <P>The level of premiums is directly related to the size of awards.  Any attempt to reduce the cost of insurance must focus on the level of awards.  The Government has apparently decided to support the proposals outlined in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  Those proposals will not work.  Deloitte &amp; Touche rejected the idea of capping awards but the case in favour of capping was not properly considered.  Capping exists in a number of jurisdictions.  Some countries in the European Union have capped awards to control insurance costs.  If it is good enough for those countries, what is the objection to it here?</P>
      <P>The central proposal is to establish a tribunal for small claims &mdash; the term &ldquo;small&rdquo; is not defined &mdash; where the issue of liability is not at stake.  This proposal does not bear close scrutiny. The report envisages that legal representation would not be encouraged at such a tribunal and that it would operate similarly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of serious fallacies in this proposal.  First, it would not be constitutionally possible to exclude legal representation.  The suggested model is the Employment Appeals Tribunal at which legal representation has now become the rule rather than the exception.  There is no reason to believe that people seeking awards for personal injuries will do so without the benefit of legal representation however much discouragement is provided.  Second, any claimant can go to court &mdash; this is a constitutional right &mdash; as an alternative to going to the tribunal.  If after a short period of operation it emerges that the <Col N="114" /> level of awards granted by the courts exceeds those granted by the tribunal, most if not all claimants will naturally go to court and the tribunal will become virtually redundant.</P>
    <P>What precisely is the Minister's objection to capping awards, a device being increasingly resorted to by countries that wish to reduce insurance costs?  If there is a fundamental objection, why not establish a tribunal which would decide on awards up to a level of, say, £250,000, or any level, whether or not the issue of liability is at stake? It would require a constitutional amendment to compel people to avail of this tribunal rather than going to court.  However, it is certain that a constitutional referendum designed to reduce the cost of insurance would be supported enthusiastically.  For several years now successive Governments have paid lip service to the notion of reducing insurance costs, yet they have continued to rise inexorably.  Any proposal to reduce the costs of insurance must be accompanied by radical proposals to control the level of awards.  Otherwise the overall costs will continue to grow to the detriment of the economy and at the expense of thousands of jobs.</P>

      <P>The recent increase in motor insurance costs to which the Deputy refers applies only to the Guardian PMPA Group which has increased its premiums by 5 per cent on average with effect from 1 November of this year.  I am not aware that other insurers in the market have announced similar increases in their premium rates.</P>
      <P>I have already, in answer to written and priority parliamentary questions in the House on 25 September and 22 October last, cited the reasons given by the insurer in question, namely, that deteriorating road accident statistics during the course of 1996 have caused the motor insurance industry to anticipate a rise in the number and cost of claims and to make provision to meet this rising cost by increasing premiums.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has consistently said that the major factor driving up the cost of claims is a rise in accidents as a result of careless or drunken driving and, more recently, excessive speed.  If that is true, and I am having the industry's view currently examined, until there is an abatement in such road traffic offences leading to accidents and mishaps on our roads, insurance costs will continue to remain at a high level for some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factors which give rise to increases in motor insurance claims, leading to insurance price increases, such as drunken driving, uninsured driving, speeding or careless driving, road traffic offences or prosecutions and other accidents and claims as a result of negligent behaviour on the roads fall within the province of several Ministers, notably the Ministers for <Col N="115" /> Justice and the Environment.  It is to be hoped that the imminent introduction by the Minister for the Environment of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences from 1 December next will give rise to safer driving practices and lead to fewer accidents and subsequent motor insurance claims.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the recently published Deloitte &amp; Touche report, to which he also referred, where the consultants have concluded in relation to private motor insurance that the key factors affecting the premium rates offered to Irish motorists are the individual driver's maturity and safety record and that motor insurers in Ireland quote widely differing premiums for similar risks.  The report also indicated that drivers with good claims experience have seen their insurance premiums reduced in real terms since 1990.  In this regard the Deputy may well be aware of quite recent reductions of the order of between 5 and 10 per cent announced by insurers during the course of 1995 and early 1996.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on numerous occasions in the House in regard to the position of young and inexperienced drivers as a high risk category.  The established facts in this regard, which I have previously detailed in response to previous questions are as follows: the most recent statistics available from the National Roads Authority show that almost 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal and personal injury accidents were young drivers, and 41 per cent of the road casualty victims in 1995 were between the ages of 18 and 34.  The analysis provided by the sixth report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board showed that claims frequency declines with age of policyholder for all types of cover.  The analysis also showed that, in terms of relative claims cost, the 17 to 24 year old policyholder is a greater risk than those aged 25 to 30 who, in turn, are a greater risk than those aged over 30.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland provides further evidence of the high cost of claims associated with the young driver.  The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for a 17 to 24 year old driver is over twice that for a 36 to 40 year old driver, and that motorists in the younger age group are responsible for over three and a half times the claim costs of motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.  Given the facts, it is not surprising that young drivers may experience difficulty in obtaining quotations for motor insurance and that from an underwriting and solvency perspective, insurers will quote relatively high premiums to young and inexperienced drivers.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report concluded that the inculcation of safer driving standards in young drivers is the key to reducing their high accident rate and to obtaining lower premium quotations. In this regard, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the specific recommendations by Deloitte &amp; Touche in relation to the introduction of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers <Col N="116" /> and for a driving related course of education for secondary school students.</P>
    <P>Action in relation to these recommendations is the responsibility of the Ministers for the Environment and Education.  I also understand that an insurance incentive scheme is currently being established by agreement between the Irish Insurance Federation and the Driving Instructors' Register whereby insurance discounts will be offered to young drivers who have completed an agreed number of driving lessons over a calendar year.</P>
    <P>It is a recognised principle on an EU-wide basis that in order to meet stringent solvency and reserves requirements, insurance companies must be allowed freedom to set their insurance rates in the light of their underwriting experience without seeking prior approval from the supervisory authority.  In this regard my Department has no function in relation to prior approval or prior systematic notification of increases in motor insurance premium rates.  There is no longer a statutory requirement on insurers to seek prior approval of such rates since the abolition of price control in 1986, nor are insurers required to justify increases to my Department.  Prior approval is now also prohibited under domestic insurance legislation following the implementation of the third non-life insurance framework directive of 1994.</P>
    <P>Underwriting losses have been a feature of motor insurance business for many years. However, these losses may be offset by investment returns on the reserves required to be held to meet outstanding claims.  The insurance annual report for 1995 will provide, for the first time, on a company by company basis, details of attributable investment related to specific classes of insurance.  This will enable my Department to examine the performance of individual insurers in terms of their overall profitability in the context of insurance premium levels.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche report in alluding to this matter has suggested that the supervisory authority might review the relevancy or the efficacy of taking into account investment income in the contest of insurers' own underwriting targets and the consequent effect of insurance costs.  This aspect of the insurance industry's operation will be examined in the overall context of the implementation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Government, in its consideration of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, accepted the recommendations in favour of the creation of a personal injuries tribunal and agreed to the establishment of a special working group to advise the Government on its establishment.  The objective is to create the most efficient, prompt, lowest cost and fair system for coping with the consequences of personal injuries from the point of view of the individual, society and the economy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 November 1996.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give the precise cost of extending deductibility to business cars generally. However, on the basis of the information available in relation to the purchase of motor cars in recent years, the Revenue Commissioners consider that such a measure would cost in the order of £50 million per annum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 37 together.  The total number of people employed in the public service on 1 January 1996 was 215,467.  This is the latest date for which figures are compiled for the public service as a whole.</P>
      <P>In the Civil Service there are agreements between my Department and other Departments on staffing levels to be achieved by 1 July 1997. Additional posts may only be created by specific Government decision.  While the numbers in the Civil Service grew in the first half of 1995, numbers fell in the corresponding period this year, and this trend continued in the quarter to end-September.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in July 1995 that a total of 350 additional posts were fillable in the education sector for the 1996/97 academic year. The number of posts at first and second level will be determined by pupil numbers in accordance with the relevant pupil teacher ratios.  The number of posts at third level will be determined by the budgetary allocation for 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> In the health sector, the Government decided in June 1995 that there would be an increase of the order of 600 in 1996, in line with a slower rate of development in this sector this year.  Numbers in the sector in 1997 will depend on the allocations decided in the 1997 Health Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in July last that a further 400 gardaí should be recruited by end-1997 and a further 211 civilians by early 1997 as part of its anti-crime package.</P>
    <P>Under a plan agreed by the Government in March of this year, numbers in the Defence Forces are to be reduced by about 1,300 to 11,500 over three years.  To facilitate this policy, a voluntary early retirement scheme has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The position in the various parts of the public service that I have outlined shows that there is a consistent policy to contain overall public service numbers, to agree to increases only where there is a compelling social or economic case for doing so, and to reduce numbers where this is feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 58 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the Government's policy on economic and monetary union (EMU), the Treaty on European Union signed at Maastricht in February 1992 commits the European Union to move to the third stage of economic and monetary union no later than 1 January 1999. Deputy Brennan will recall that Ireland did not seek an opt-out from participation in economic and monetary union in the negotiations preceding the Treaty.  The Deputy will further recall that a referendum was held on the Treaty in June 1992 and that almost 70 per cent of those who voted in it endorsed acceptance of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Brennan that preparations for the third stage of economic and monetary union will be an important item on the agenda <Col N="119" /> for the European Council in Dublin in December.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my response to a priority question today from Deputy McCreevy, when I took up office as President of the ECOFIN Council, I set out the priorities in the economic and monetary union area in accordance with the mandates given to ECOFIN by the Madrid and Florence European Councils.  Effectively, these require ECOFIN and, in their respective fields of competence, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute, to present conclusions to the Dublin European Council in December 1996 showing further substantive progress towards ensuring a smooth transition of economic and monetary union.  Three areas are involved.</P>
    <P>The first concerns strengthening budgetary discipline in stage three of economic and monetary union among member states that adopt the euro.  This work follows from the Treaty provisions in relation to the avoidance of excessive deficits, and the specific proposals made by Germany last year for a &ldquo;stability pact&rdquo; to operate among member states in economic and monetary union.  The second involves study of the range of issues, particularly in the monetary policy area raised by the fact that not all member states will adopt the euro from the outset.  The third is the legal framework for the use of the euro.</P>
    <P>Very satisfactory progress has been made on all three areas so far during our Presidency.  In Dublin in September I hosted an informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to review progress and to chart the course to the December European Council. This meeting ensured that we are well on our way to achieving our objectives.</P>
    <P>This was reflected last month when the Commission adopted legislative proposals on the stability pact and on the legal framework for the euro, as well as a draft communication to Council on the relationship between participating and non-participating member states.</P>
    <P>Early next month ECOFIN will finalise reports for presentation to the European Council which will show substantive progress on the three areas I have outlined.  Many key elements of the stability pact have been agreed and I expect further progress to be made before the end of the year.  Details of the new ERM are almost settled, although the details cannot of course be finalised until the European Central Bank is set up in 1998. Work on other aspects of the relationship between participating and non-participating member states is ongoing in the context of improving multilateral surveillance and the legal framework for the euro is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>As regards deadlines, the December 1995 Madrid European Council decided that the third stage of economic and monetary union would commence on 1 January 1999.  This was confirmed by the Florence European Council in June and will be reaffirmed by the December European Council in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The 1995 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General showed a total Revenue debt of £1,950 million, of which the Revenue Commissioners estimated that £553 million would be collected.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the total debt, which includes arrears of PRSI, contains a high level of unreal debt due to the presence of estimated tax liabilities from the pre-self assessment era, which are now considered to be excessive, as well as debts for companies in liquidation and debts for businesses that have long since ceased to trade and cases where the taxpayer has died or emigrated.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in recent years in reducing the overall Revenue debt.  For example, the overall debt has reduced from £2.9 billion in 1989 to £1.9 billion in 1995, a reduction of £1 billion.  In 1990, the arrears represented 48 per cent of the total taxes collected, whereas in 1996 the arrears represented 20 per cent of total taxes collected.  This reduction of £1 billion in the total debt has been achieved through improved current collection and the ongoing Revenue programmes aimed at addressing the entrenched arrear, which have resulted in the collection of some £330 million over this period as well as the write-off of substantial apparent arrears and uncollectable tax in the categories mentioned.</P>
      <P>The programmes aimed at the entrenched arrears will continue and indeed will be accelerated over the coming three years, in order to eliminate, as far as possible, the unreal debt from the overall Revenue debt figure.  As I have indicated these programmes involve a number of measures, including the collection of old arrears that are properly due and payable, using legal action where appropriate; the discharge or reduction of estimates that are now considered excessive; and the write-off of taxes where there are clearly no prospects of recovery.  Full details of all taxes written off are published in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Revenue must satisfy his requirements in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure for historical arrears of PRSI which is included in the overall figure is £253 million of which £55 million was estimated to be collectable. Under delegated authority from the Department <Col N="121" /> of Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners have responsibility for collection of PRSI.  Non payment of PRSI is pursued at the same time and in the same manner as other unpaid taxes. Accordingly, arrears of PRSI are included in the arrears collection programmes, as outlined earlier.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners staff co-operate with officials of the Department of Social Welfare through joint inspection units.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of the Revenue Commissioners must be to ensure collection of current taxes.  Significant initiatives have been taken in recent years in this regard and these are reflected in the excellent tax receipts.  While everything possible must be done to deal with the historical arrears the level of resources devoted to their pursuit must take account of the reliability of the old debt as well as the prospects of recovery.</P>

      <P>On 21 October the Committee on Budgets put forward a further proposal to include 100 MECU for the Peace Programme in a reserve in the 1997 draft budget.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission has not come forward with any proposals to abolish zero rates.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Commission has recently produced a paper entitled &ldquo;A common system of VAT&rdquo;, (Com (96) 328 of 22 July 1996), which outlines the Commission's views on the current system and suggests a number of alterations.  The main recommendations contained within the paper concern a single place of registration for traders for all taxable transactions in the EU, the determination of revenues due to each member state by statistical calculation of the taxed consumption on its territory and the approximation of rates to a considerably greater degree than at present.  The standard rate, it is suggested, could be set within a narrow band and a small number of reduced rates would be allowed, but their number and scope would be limited.  The Commission also recommends a uniform application of EU VAT law across the Union and modernisation of the system to take account of economic, judicial and technological developments.</P>
      <P>The Commission has the right of initiative under the EU Treaties, but proposals related to taxation must obtain the unanimous approval of the Council.  In this context, the Government will consider any proposals made by the European Commission in relation to a common VAT system on their merits and with due regard to the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> As rgards duty free shopping, the provisions of EU Directives 91/680/EEC and 92/12/EEC authorise the continuation until 30 June 1999 of duty free shopping facilities for travellers within the EU.  This measure was agreed so as to allow the operators involved sufficient time to diversify their activities.  There have been no proposals in respect of duty free shopping from the Commission to date.  Given the absence of such proposals, the facilities in question will cease on the date mentioned.  Duty free facilities for travellers to and from the EU are not affected by the directives referred to.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully alert to the situation that prevails with regard to illegal street trading in smuggled cigarettes and tabacco and are taking steps to combat this problem.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners have statutory responsibility for preventing the illegal importation of tobacco products and the sale of unstamped products within the State.  Customs are working in close co-operation with the Garda in a series of on-street joint operations with a view to suppressing this illegal trade.  Arising from these operations an increasing number of prosecutions in the courts have taken place.  It is intended to intensify these efforts.</P>
      <P>Apart from efforts at street vendor level, investigations are continuing in an effort to trace the source of tobacco products feeding this illicit trade and urgent inquiries are being pursued in this area with the investigation services of our EU partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> Overall, about 33 million cigarettes and 7,066 kilos of roll-your-own tobacco have been seized since January 1993 to date, at import points and from distributors and street traders.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am satisfied that the Commissioners are taking steps to deal with this problem which include the extension of tax stamps to roll-your-own tobacco from 1 October 1996.  Additional measures will, of course, be taken as necessary.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has made no proposals for a uniform rate of VAT to be applied throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>The position is that the European Commission has recently produced a paper entitled &ldquo;A common system of VAT &mdash; a programme for the single market&rdquo; (Com (96) 328 of 22 July, 1996). The paper gives a general outline of the Commission's ideas regarding a common system of VAT together with a timetable detailing proposals, with might lead to the adoption of such a system, that the Commission plan to make over the coming three years.  The main recommendations contained within the paper are a single place of registration for traders for all taxable transactions in the EU, the determination of revenues due to each member state by statistical calculation of the taxed consumption on its territory and the approximation of rates to a considerably greater degree than at present. The Commission has indicated in this paper that, in its view, under the system envisaged, a single standard rate of VAT within the Union would be ideal for the purpose of avoiding tax-based distortions of competition but that an approximation within a band could prove sufficient.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider the Commission's detailed proposals on the VAT system, when they emerge, on their merits and having regard to the national interest.  All fiscal measures require unanimity at Council for their adoption.</P>

      <P>Every effort is taken in framing finance legislation not to discriminate against particular classes of taxpayers including those with disabilities. Indeed, there are a number of measures in the Finance Acts which address the position of the disabled.  These are the disabled drivers scheme, the blind person's tax allowance, the disabled person's maintenance allowance, paid to a disabled person or his or her guardian by a health board, which is exempt from tax, and zero rates for VAT on a wide range of medical equipment and appliances used by disabled people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition there are a number of provisions which apply to those who are permanently incapacitated.  Among these are the exemption of <Col N="126" /> income from court awards for incapacitated persons from income tax; the retention of covenant tax relief without restriction for the incapacitated; a £700 tax relief for the parents of an incapacitated child; a special exemption for incomes derived from leases by incapacitated farmers; tax relief of up to £7,500 to cover the cost of employing a person to take care of an incapacitated taxpayer or the incapacitated spouse of a taxpayer; and a disregard of the income of a person living with an incapacitated taxpayer for RPT purposes.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to be sensitive to the needs of the disabled within the usual constraints of budgetary resources and I hope that the list of measures set out demonstrates successive Governments' concern in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know the package of measures announced by the Government on 25 July included measures geared specifically at targeting the proceeds of crime.  In particular, the Government announced the setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau in order to bring together in a more structured way the resoures and expertise of the various agencies, includiing the Garda, the Revenue authorities and the Department of Social Welfare, involved in this difficult area.  There had been no lack of commitment in the past but the difficulties which have arisen from different agencies tackling the problem within their own functional areas had been recognised.  A concerted effort is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> The bureau initially began operating on a nonstatutory basis in August last and the necessary legislation to provide a statutory basis for its operations was enacted on 11 October 1996 following detailed examination as it passed through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of the legisation, the Minister for Justice on 30 July announced the appointment of a Garda chief superintendent to head the bureau and the appointment of a legal officer.  Staff from the various agencies including Revenue have been assigned to it.  Consequently, the bureau has been operational for some months and is, I understand, active in pursuit of the assets of suspected criminals.  The objectives of the bureau are to identify the assets of persons which derive or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal activity; to take whatever action is necessary under the law to deprive criminals or suspected criminals of their assets or to deny them in whole or in part, the benefit of those assets.  This includes taxation of income and gains in appropriate cases; and to carry out investigations and the preparatory work of legal proceedings in pursuit of the above objectives.</P>
    <P>The bureau has been making good progress since it was set up and I am confident that it will be an effective instrument for tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are co-operating fully with these measures.  The Revenue officials serving in the bureau bring to it all the relevant powers available under tax legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the setting up of the bureau, two further pieces of legislation, the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, and the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, were passed by the Oireachtas on the 25 and 26 July.  The Disclosure Act now gives a statutory basis on which Revenue can provide information to the Garda where it is suspected that a person has profited from crime.  The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, provides for the confiscation of property which constitutes directly, or indirectly, the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>Prior to the setting up of the bureau, the Revenue Commissioners had been active in targeting certain persons suspected of profiteering from crime.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot comment on individual cases but I am advised by them that in a number of cases, assessments under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983 had been raised and, in other cases, certain other activities preparatory to raising such assessments had been taken.  These latter cases have now been passed to the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new legislation, together with the other measures already in place, will deliver a coherent and focused response against organised crime.</P>

      <P>The basis of the determination of rateable valuation of commercial property is net annual value i.e. the rental value of the property.  Among the factors that determine rental values are: the operation of the property market, changes in economic conditions, the profitability of a business and changes or developments to property.</P>
      <P>In arriving at the net annual value, the valuer has regard to the actual state of the particular property and all relevant factors that have a bearing on the value of the property.  These will include seasonal factors.  Rateable valuations assigned to properties in seasonal holiday resorts reflect the degree of seasonality and its effect on business in these resorts.</P>
      <P>Any ratepayer dissatisfied with a rateable valuation or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>

Against that background the aim will be to achieve pay moderation and certainty of pay costs, supported by reductions in taxation.  Taxation is, of course, intrinsically tied in with the level of public expenditure, of which the public service pay and pensions bill is a major factor.  An increase of 10.5 per cent in public service pay would add an estimated £505 million per year to that bill.  Such an increase, as well as any other additional expenditure commitments sought in the context of a new programme, would, obviously, restrict the resources available for taxation reductions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is the co-ordinator in Ireland of two EU funded programmes specifically aimed at the Border region (counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo).  The programmes concerned are the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme 1994-99 and the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland 1995-99.</P>
      <P>The programmes between them provide for additional EU investment in the Border counties of £120 million.  When the full amount of public investment provided under the programmes is taken into consideration the extent of additional funding available to the Border counties exceeds £160 million.  This investment is additional to what is available to the Border counties under the Community Support Framework and other Community initiatives.</P>
      <P>Other questions down for answer today deal with the current position under the peace programme so I will deal specifically with the INTERREG Programme in this reply.</P>
      <P>The Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG programme was approved by the Commission on 27 February 1995.  The guidelines allow for a continuation of measures which were found to be successful under INTERREG I.  The Deputy may be aware that the INTERREG I Programme was extended beyond its original conclusion date to avoid an excessive time gap between the end of INTERREG I and the commencement of INTERREG II.</P>
      <P>Under the INTERREG Programme the European Commission approved an EU aid allocation to Ireland to the end of 1999 of approximately IR£72 million.  The allocation to Northern Ireland was STG£53 million.  The significantly higher figure of EU funding available for the Border counties by comparison with Northern Ireland reflects a prioritising of resources to the Border region by the Government.</P>
      <P>In addition to the EU funding, the Government is committed to the provision of matching funding.  The total amount of public funding available, therefore, to the Border Counties under this Programme exceeds £100 million.</P>

    <P>The programme is divided into five subprogrammes, covering infrastructure (roads, energy, transport, telecommunications), environmental protection (management of water resources and removal of pollutants), natural resources (agriculture, fisheries, forestry), human resources (training and education) and economic development (tourism, community development, and special measures in economic development such as linkages).  This last subprogramme <Col N="131" /> contains a technical assistance measure to underpin the operation of the Programme.</P>
    <P>As a coherent economic development strategy for the Border region is dependent on adequate infrastructural foundations the bulk of the funding on the southern side has been allocated, as agreed by the Government, to the infrastructural and environmental protection subprogrammes.  Roads, sanitary services, electricity networks and telecommunications are vital underpinnings to the tourism, agricultural, food processing, industrial and service sectors.</P>
    <P>The broad sectoral span of both the INTERREG and PEACE programmes requires ongoing and particular attention to ensure that the programmes, along with IFI funding and other relevant initiatives, as well as the mainline programmes, are complementary and integrated while keeping for each its own distinctive profile. In this connection Deputies will be aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Donal Carey, has been given specific responsibility in relation to funding arrangements in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Border counties also benefit from the International Fund for Ireland which contains a substantial element of EU funding.  The fund is the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as at end October, 7,876 forms of evidence of participation in the 15 per cent incentive amnesty have been produced by taxpayers to the Collector-General. According as the Revenue Commissioners continue to pursue outstanding liabilities on record for the relevant periods, further forms of evidence are likely to be produced by taxpayers on an ongoing basis.  In relation to the forms of evidence already received, 3,920 cases have already been fully dealt with and £18,966,895 has been discharged from the tax records.  I am informed by the Commissioners that the work is time-consuming and that, while substantial inroads will be made into the remaining cases on hands by the end of the year, the work will continue into 1997.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that due to its clandestine nature it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the level of smuggling of tobacco products or its effect on Exchequer revenue.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners have statutory responsibility for preventing the illegal importation of tobacco products and the sale of unstamped products within the State.  In view of the specific street-trading dimension, Customs are working in close co-operation with the Garda in a series of on-street joint operations.  It is intended to intensify these efforts.</P>
      <P>Apart from efforts at street vendor level, investigations are continuing in an effort to trace the source of tobacco products feeding this illicit trade and urgent inquiries are being pursued in this area with the investigation services of our EU partners.</P>
      <P>Overall, about 33 million cigarettes and 7,066 kilos of roll-your-own tobacco have been seized since January 1993 to date, at import points and from distributors and street traders.  There has been an increased number of prosecutions for smuggling of tobacco products and prosecutions have been taken against certain street sellers.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I am satisfied that the Commissioners are taking steps to deal with this problem which include the extension of tax stamps to &ldquo;roll-your-own&rdquo; tobacco with effect from 1 October 1996.  Additional measures will, of course, be taken as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently supported <Col N="133" /> initiatives aimed at consolidating the peace process and promoting economic regeneration in the Border counties.  A number of specific initiatives are already focused on economic regeneration in the Border area.</P>
      <P>The European Union Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is aimed at Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  It involves a total EU expenditure of approximately £240 million over three years and Government funding of £65 million.  Over £60 million of this expenditure is taking place in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland, established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986, has received contributions from the United States, the European Union, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  The fund has already provided over £90 million for projects in the Border counties in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>The Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG programme 1994/1999 established under the EU Structural Funds has approved EU funding for the six years 1994/1999 of over £72 million for the Border counties.</P>
      <P>In addition, the US Government has supported the peace process through measures to develop trade and investment between the United States and the region.  President Clinton held the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in May 1995.  The US Department of Commerce held a further economic conference in Pittsburgh in October.  Both conferences were quite successful in helping to encourage business partnerships between US and Irish companies, which will continue to bear fruit over the longer term.  Also, earlier this year, the Taoiseach appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Donal Carey, to chair an Interdepartmental Task Force on funding arrangements in the Border region.  The report of the task force has been published and arrangements are being made by the Minister of State for general circulation.  The report contains a number of specific recommendations to improve co-ordination and to facilitate accessing of available funding in the Border region.</P>
      <P>The initiatives I have outlined indicate that the Border counties are being assisted very actively in promoting economic regeneration.  I can assure the Deputy that these initiatives will be continued and be vigorously promoted by the Government to ensure that the maximum possible benefit accrues to the region.</P>

      <P>A great deal of work has already been done to enhance the information provided in the appropriation accounts, which are the annual accounts of Government Departments.  As the Deputy is <Col N="134" /> aware, the statutory appropriation accounts are cash-based and the additions made to date have been concerned with introducing elements of an accruals nature and non-cash charges such as depreciation.</P>
      <P>These changes, which arose from a joint working group involving my Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General, are being implemented over a three year period; the final phase will cover the accounts for the current year. The changes were discussed with and approved by the Committee of Public Accounts before the process commenced.</P>
      <P>The Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries, in the context of the strategic management initiative, also made recommendations in relation to financial management systems, including accrual accounting, and a working group under the chairmanship of the Secretary of my Department has been set up to develop and implement their proposals.  The working group will draw on the experience gained in preparing a set of accruals accounts which were produced for the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>So far as the wider public accounts are concerned, that is the receipts and payments of the public sector as a whole, the Deputy will also be aware that the General Government Deficit, which is one of the criteria applied to assess fiscal performance under the Maastricht Treaty, has become of increasing importance in the Irish budgetary context.  It also incorporates elements of an accrual system of accounting, which will be accentuated when we move to a revised set of European statistical conventions scheduled to come into effect in 1999.</P>

    <P>In regard to the control of the public sector pay bill it is the Government's policy to contain it at a level which is consistent with the needs of the services being provided, and with the requirements of prudent management of the public finances and in particular the requirements of the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union.  The Government's policy is to ensure that public services are provided in the most efficient and effective manner possible and to this end has introduced the strategic <Col N="135" /> management initiative in the Civil Service and similar initiatives in other areas of the public service.</P>

      <P>In general, it makes no difference to the RPT liability whether a family residence is jointly owned by both spouses or is in the sole ownership of one spouse.  I am informed that there are, however, a limited number of circumstances where separate or sole ownership of family property can give a more favourable RPT result than if the property in question were jointly owned.  This arises where there is more than one residential property owned and occupied by the family and in certain cases where the reliefs for elderly occupants apply.</P>

    <P>However, it has to be borne in mind that RPT is only one of many factors to be considered before family members decide to transfer property ownership.

      <Quest>if the Central Statistics Office has been able to determine the average impact on the consumer price index of a movement in the Irish pound and sterling exchange rate in either direction.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19864/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office's work in relation to the consumer price index comprises the collection, collation and dissemination of information on the level of prices in Ireland, and the rates at which those prices are changing.  This work involves comprehensive field surveys and sophisticated statistical analysis, but it does not extend to investigating why prices have changed, or why they may change in the future.  In this respect, I understand that the Central Statistics Office's position is no different from that of the generality of national statistical institutes which compile official inflation figures in other countries.</P>
      <P>Exchange rates affect consumer price inflation, especially in open economies such as Ireland.  Other things being equal, an exchange rate depreciation will put upward pressure on inflation, while an exchange rate appreciation will have the opposite effect.  Where exchange rate change is being related to inflation change, the usual measure of exchange rate movement is the trade-weighted effective exchange rate, rather than any particular bilateral exchange rate.  As its name implies, this index assigns a weight to the Irish pound-sterling exchange rate which is broadly proportionate to the share of total Irish trade which is conducted with the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of exchange rate change on inflation is complex, and quantifying the impact of <Col N="137" /> exchange rates on inflation, particularly over a short period of time is difficult.  In the first instance the pass-through effect of an exchange rate change between the Irish pound and some other currency could be seen in import prices from that country, which would tend to rise in Ireland in response to an exchange rate depreciation, and to fall in response to an exchange rate appreciation.  Taking the depreciation case for illustration purposes, the resultant import price rise would prompt Irish economic agents, where possible, to source cheaper products elsewhere, either from the domestic market or from countries against whose currencies our exchange rate had not depreciated. Where competing domestic or overseas suppliers existed, they would have scope to increase their market share in Ireland by leaving their prices unchanged while equivalent imported products, from the country against whose currency the Irish pound had depreciated, were rising.  A further complication would be the extent to which the bilateral exchange rate movement reflected intrinsic Irish pound weakness, or generalised strength of the other currency.</P>
    <P>These and other factors mean that the links between exchange rates and inflation are complex, and this is reflected in a variety of viewpoints on the importance of particular bilateral exchange rates such as Irish pound-sterling and Irish pound-deutschmark.  In the case of Irish pound-sterling, it is sometimes asserted that the actual impact on inflation is greater than sterling's weight in the effective exchange rate index would imply, usually on the grounds that a high proportion of goods imported from the UK are consumer goods rather than capital goods or materials.  This view is disputed by other authorities however, who cite the contrasting evolution of inflation in Ireland and the UK to argue that the sterling rate is not significantly more important than its effective exchange rate index share would indicate.</P>
    <P>In practice, it is extremely difficult to isolate the specific influence of the Irish pound-sterling exchange rate as distinct from all the other factors which affect inflation.  These include the advent of the Single Market, shifts in trading patterns, changes in the composition of UK manufacturing, and structural changes in retailing.</P>

      <P>The total EU funding available for the initiative to support the peace process in Northern Ireland and Border counties (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo) is 300 million ECU (IR£240 million) over three years (1995/1997).  Funding for a further two years is subject to a Commission review.  Up to 80 per cent of the funding is available for activities in Northern Ireland and at least 20 per cent (approximately £48 million) for activities in the Border counties.  At least 15 per cent of the overall amount is reserved for activities carried out in a cross-Border context.  The European Community finances up to 75 per cent of the cost of measures under the initiative.  The balance of the cost comes from the Exchequer and other national sources.</P>
      <P>An unusual feature of the programme is the extent to which implementation of the various measures has been devolved to intermediary funding bodies and the particular emphasis on actions to combat social exclusion which permeates every measure and sub-programme of the programme.  The intermediary bodies are funded by way of global grants on foot of legal agreements signed between them and the EU Commission.  This departure from the norm was strongly recommended in the course of widespread consultation in the eligible areas carried out by the EU Commission Task Force and the two administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> The Deputies are aware that under the terms of the global grant agreements the Commission has given discretion to the intermediary funding bodies as to how the measures for which they are responsible are to be administered.  The relevant bodies in the Border counties are Area Development Management Ltd. (ADM) and the Combat Poverty Agency (CPA).  Those bodies report to the Departments of the Taoiseach and Social Welfare respectively and operate under Boards of Management on which those Departments are represented.  Co-operation North, in conjunction with IBEC/CBI (NI) manages the measure supporting cross-Border business and cultural linkages.  The Department of Foreign Affairs monitors activities under this measure.</P>
    <P>My Department, together with the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland, is responsible for the overall co-ordination of the programme, but has no operational role in the day to day activities of the intermediary funding bodies.</P>
    <P>The bodies' statutory responsibilities became effective on 8 December 1995 when with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on behalf of the Commission, they signed the global grant agreements governing how the funding was to be administered.  The bodies then had to set up offices, take on staff etc. and this process was substantially completed by end February 1996. Since that date the bodies have been actively involved in implementing the actions provided for under the measures.  ADM and Combat Poverty have set up office in Monaghan town, and all of the measures for which they are responsible are managed from there.  The office also provides a local focus for Co-operation North.  In this way liaison between the bodies is enhanced.</P>
    <P>Another innovative delivery mechanism involves county council-led task forces, operating in each of the six Border counties.  They are responsible for delivering a wide range of actions in the urban and rural regeneration areas.  The task forces have a considerable degree of discretion in deciding how the allocation is to be spent but the programme requires that representative and relevant local interests be consulted as appropriate.  The Department of the Environment has responsibility for overseeing the activities of the task forces.</P>
    <P>The total EU funding disbursed through these devolved mechanisms totals £33.7 million or over 70 per cent of the amount allocated to the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Commission accepted that a small number of measures could not appropriately be devolved to intermediary funding bodies.  The Department of the Environment is responsible for EU investment totalling £5.2 million under the cross-Border infrastructure measure.  A further £5 million in EU funding has been provided for measures involving cross-Border co-operative actions between public bodies.  These measures <Col N="140" /> are monitored by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The loan subsidy provisions are being administered by the European Investment Bank through the medium of the commercial banking system in the Border area.  The Department of Finance is responsible for overseeing this measure and almost all available funding has already been committed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance also implements the technical assistance measure, totalling nearly £1 million in EU funding.  Its function is to support the administration of the programme. Nearly all the technical assistance budget goes to meet the running expenses of the intermediary funding bodies.</P>
    <P>The total commitment figure to date is almost £28 million, or over 58 per cent of the EU allocation to the Border counties.  I think that this figure is highly satisfactory given the difficult circumstances pertaining and it represents a high current pace of commitment as most of it has been committed within the last six months.  I expect that rate of progress to continue and improve now that all of the delivery mechanisms are fully operational.  While the bulk of commitments to date can be accounted for by the activities of State agencies the intermediary funding bodies have been recording impressive progress recently.  In the coming months I would expect them to account for an increasing share of commitments.  It should be borne in mind that in many respects they had to engage on a steep learning curve and the areas of the programme for which they hold responsibility are among the most sensitive and difficult.  I am satisfied that all of the funding available will be drawn down before the expiry of the programme.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to circulate an appendix to this reply setting out the figures to end September 1996 in respect of total commitments and projects assisted under the programme.  The table includes details of the specific measures administered by Area Development Management and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the document referred to by Deputy Byrne, although I gather that it is in fact a study rather than a survey.  I understand that it does not predict a sudden drop in the value of sterling against the euro in the first three years of economic and monetary union.  It says, rather, that if the pattern of sterling behaviour against the deutschmark (DM) since 1979 were to be repeated, and the euro were to behave like the DM, then sterling could experience a sudden fall against the euro within two to three years of the commencement of stage 3 of economic and monetary union in 1999.  It also says, however, that several factors could influence sterling's behaviour against the euro if the United Kingdom does not join economic and monetary union and that it is impossible to forecast these in advance.</P>
      <P>The UK has not yet decided whether or not it will participate in economic and monetary union from the outset, and in any event I do not propose to comment on what the behaviour of sterling would be likely to be if it does not.  I would however point out to the Deputy that the question of the relationship there is to be between the euro and the currencies of member states not participating in economic and monetary union from the outset is currently under discussion at EU level and is a matter of concern to all member states.  Apart from the question of the new ERM, which the UK Government has indicated it does not propose to join, there is unanimity that all member states, whether in economic and monetary union or not, should pursue sound and stability-oriented economic and fiscal policies, and that increased multilateral surveillance is necessary for this objective to be met.  Proposals for such increased surveillance are currently being examined, in the context <i>inter alia</i> of making more effective the obligation in Article 109m of the Treaty on European Union for member states to treat their exchange rate policy as a matter of common concern.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Andrew's suggestion, I am, of course, aware of the concerns some sectors of industry have expressed in relation to the Irish pound-sterling exchange rate over the past 18 months or so.  However, it is primarily a matter for Irish exporters themselves, as it is for exporters in other countries, to cope with the economic environment in which they find themselves.  This includes coping with the currency fluctuations.  I have no plans to provide special assistance, whether by way of the establishment of a sterling stabilisation fund or otherwise, for Irish small and medium sized enterprises in the circumstances described by the Deputy.  I would of course point out that the value of sterling has recently risen and is at present close to parity against the Irish pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> The Government has of course an important role in trying to ensure that the economic environment is as conducive as possible to economic activity.  The present environment is characterised by low inflation, high growth, rising employment, moderate wage developments under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, interest rates close to historically-low levels, sound public finances, a balance-of-payments surplus and a high level of investment under the Community Support Framework: all of these factors are beneficial for economic activity.</P>
    <P>In addition, in each of the last three budgets, considerable Exchequer resources were allocated to employers through reductions in their PRSI contributions.  This was done to assist employers to maintain and create employment and was targeted at lower-wage, labour-intensive sectors of Irish industry.  The 1996 changes in employer PRSI reduced the costs of employment of virtually all employers.  The ongoing cost of the PRSI reductions provided for employers in the 1994, 1995 and 1996 budgets is some £124 million annually.  There have also, of course, been substantial income tax reliefs, mainly targeted at the low-paid, and changes in the corporation tax regime designed to assist businesses not benefiting from the 10 per cent corporation tax scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 68, 70 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report on the Economic Implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union, an independent study which I commissioned earlier this year, is a comprehensive analysis of the impact of economic and monetary union on the Irish economy.  A primary focus for the study was an examination of the possible effects where the UK, at least, stayed outside the euro zone.  The consultants concluded that, on balance, membership of economic and monetary union, even were the UK not to join, would be beneficial for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The detailed sectoral analysis in the ESRI report of the impact of economic and monetary union on the tourism, retailing, agriculture, manufacturing industry and financial services sectors should be of considerable interest to all those wishing to obtain information on the effects of economic and monetary union, both in the Border counties and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Cullen's question regarding discussions with the UK, the UK Government has indicated that it will not decide whether the UK will participate in economic and monetary union from the outset until closer to the economic and monetary union start date of 1 January 1999.  I have not separately met with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss the UK position.  Of course ECOFIN, the Council of Finance Ministers, which meets almost every month, provides me with an opportunity to discuss the preparations for economic and monetary union with all my EU colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, said that it was intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over 1996-97.  It did not set a specific target for this year.  The real increase in gross current supply services spending provided for in this year's budget was 2.7 per cent.  In my statement on the publication of the end-September Exchequer returns, I indicated that the increase in nominal terms in non-capital supply services expenditure to the end of September was 5 per cent over the same period last year, but that the end-year outturn was expected to be somewhat higher.  A nominal increase of 5 per cent is equivalent to a real increase of just over 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The two biggest additions to the budget provision for current spending are for EU disallowances and the cost of measures to contain the effects of BSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> The first of these big additions to spending, EU disallowances, was out of the Government's control.  The second, BSE related expenditure, is the result of an unforseeable development almost completely due to events outside this country, which no Irish Government could have controlled.</P>
    <P>In the pre-budget White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure it was indicated that a provision was included towards meeting the cost of EU disallowances.  A footnote stated that, should the EU fines be levied in 1996, the expenditure would fall on the current budget.  The figure was not specified because the EU Commission had not reached a decision on the disallowances.  The disallowances decided by the Commission, some £70 million are £20 million higher than the budget provision; the full £70 million is an addition to the budget provision for current expenditure.  It is a once-off cost.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis has increased spending in two ways.  First, intervention will cost an additional £20 million gross.  Second, Garda pay and allowances for BSE-related duties on the Border could cost up to £25 million.  Both of these steps were essential in order to safeguard the beef industry.</P>
    <P>In a limited number of cases, the Government has decided to authorise additional spending where we felt this was essential.  The anti-crime package is an example.</P>
    <P>There are also pressures on health and social welfare spending.  On health, the main pressure arises on demand-led schemes such as the community drugs schemes.  The nature of these schemes is such that it is difficult to estimate costs accurately.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, the main overrun relates to the payment of the Christmas bonus at an estimated additional cost of £38 million in gross spending.  The falling trend in the live register will help to contain this cost.  Additional PRSI buoyancy will ensure that net social welfare spending will come in on or under budget.</P>
    <P>The percentage increase in net spending, and the consequential impact on the budget, will not be as great as that in gross spending because the extra costs on agriculture will be part funded by the EU, and PRSI receipts are very buoyant.  In addition, it is expected there will be further offsetting savings on other Votes.</P>
    <P>My Department's latest assessment is that these pressures could mean that gross current supply services spending may be slightly over £200 million more than the budget provision.</P>
    <P>The only major public service pay elements of this £200 million arise from Garda BSE and anti-crime activities.  Their cost amounts to about £30 million, or 15 per cent of the £200 million approximately.</P>
    <P>The EU disallowances, at £70 million, account for a further 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>The balance of about £100 million, or 50 per cent, will go on additional services to the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> There are normally end-year savings.  Taking account of these, my Department's best estimate is that the 1996 outturn would show an increase of just over 4 per cent in real terms.  EU disallowances and BSE-related expenditure account for over half of this at about £115 million.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that public expenditure is under control.  There is no loss of determination to constrain spending where this is possible.  The two biggest additions to my budget provision for current spending, the EU disallowances and the BSE measures, were exceptional and unavoidable.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to expand the value-added tax system.  VAT is governed by European law, with which Irish law must comply.  Any proposals at EU level to alter the tax system must be made by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>In relation to allowances at the standard rate of income tax, the position is that in the 1994 budget the phased standard rating of mortgage interest and medical insurance premium reliefs were introduced.  Medical insurance relief is now fully standard rated since April 1996 and mortgage interest relief will be fully standard rated from April 1997.  In addition, new reliefs introduced in the 1995 and 1996 budgets are being provided at the standard rate of tax.  These new reliefs include reliefs for donations to Third World charities, rent relief for people under 55 years of age, third level education fees, service charges and alarms for the elderly.  The question of tax allowances generally and their extension or restriction is a matter for consideration in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that statistical indicators since the beginning of 1996 are showing any significant slowdown in economic growth or demand.  On the contrary, the available data point to a continuation of the pattern of strong growth which has characterised Ireland's economy in the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Domestic demand and consumer spending in particular have been quite strong thus far in 1996. Car sales have been particularly buoyant, with over 106,000 new cars being registered in the first <Col N="146" /> nine months of the year, representing a rise of some 30 per cent on 1995 levels.  The strength of new car sales helped overall retail sales to grow by 7 per cent year-on-year in the first seven months of 1996; excluding garage activity, a rise of close to 5 per cent was recorded.  However the value of retail sales in the latest three month period actually fell slightly by comparison with the preceding three month period.</P>
    <P>The statistics available for the building and construction sector suggest that activity so far this year has been quite strong.  Employment in the sector in August was some 6.8 per cent higher year-on-year, while house completions in the first six months of the year, at over 15,000 were 12.6 per cent higher than in the same period of 1995.</P>
    <P>Exports rose by 12.9 per cent in value terms over the first half of 1996, while the corresponding rise in imports was 12.3 per cent. Manufacturing output in the same period was also quite buoyant, rising by some 12.5 per cent year-on-year.  Manufacturing employment continued to register gains, with numbers at work in the sector growing by 4.6 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter.</P>
    <P>In relation to employment generally, the recently released Labour Force Survey confirms the pattern of strong growth.  In the 12 months to April 1996, the number of persons at work in the economy increased by 45,000.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the buoyancy in other sectors, the agricultural sector has experienced a sharp reduction in the value of beef output due mainly to the BSE problem, though other production areas within agriculture appear, in aggregate, to be doing quite well.</P>
    <P>Tax performance is an important leading indicator of economic performance, as the trend in tax receipts offers some insight into payroll trends and the level of consumption.  Over the year to date, buoyancy in virtually all tax heads has been a striking feature of the Exchequer returns, and a large surplus over the budget day target is clearly in prospect.</P>
    <P>In its mid-year report, Economic Review and Outlook 1996, my Department forecast that GNP would grow by 6 per cent in volume terms this year.  The key assumptions underlying that projection were that personal consumption would rise faster than in 1995, investment would broadly sustain the high growth rate achieved in 1995, and exports and manufacturing output would continue to grow strongly, though at a more moderate rate than in 1995.  If achieved, this forecast growth rate of 6 per cent will represent one of the highest outcomes in the industrial world, though it will slightly lag behind the official 1995 outturn of 7.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>In light of the emerging picture which I have just outlined across the broad sweep of the principal economic indicators, I expect that my Department's mid-year growth forecast for 1996 will be attained, if not exceeded.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the programme, A Government of Renewal.  The programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes and especially those with families.  Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of tax reform has been, and will continue to be, on reducing the level of income tax while implementing base broadening measures, where appropriate.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from residential property tax in 1996 to date amounts to £12.3 million.  The projected yield for the year 1996 is £13.5 million.  This will exceed the 1995 yield by £1.4 million.</P>
      <P>The due date for filing residential property tax returns and paying any tax due is 1 October each year.  The Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to process all returns and payments until some time afterwards.  Accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to provide the Deputy with a breakdown of 1996 payments on a county by county basis.</P>
      <P>However it is anticipated that such breakdown will not differ substantially from that for valuation date 5 April 1995.</P>

      <P>The issue mentioned by the Deputy was discussed by two economists in a paper presented at the Dublin economic workshop economic policy conference in Kenmare last month.  However, I understand that two international researchers responsible for much of the published analytical work referred to in the paper have subsequent to that work presented more favourable analyses of Ireland's situation and capacity to participate successfully in economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall, earlier this year, I commissioned on behalf of the Government an independent study of the economic implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union. This study was carried out by the ESRI which published its report in July.  The report reviewed the approach referred to by the Deputy and argues that &ldquo;...most economists find the optimum currency area literature incomplete and unsatisfactory...&rdquo; and goes on to say &ldquo;In a sense ...we may regard the modelling exercise of this [ESRI] report as a fleshed-out implementation of the cost and benefit calculations hinted at by the optimum currency literature&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The substantive finding of the ESRI report is that membership of economic and monetary union for Ireland would, on balance, be economically advantageous even were the UK to remain out and with allowance made for possible sterling/euro exchange rate turbulence.  This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the ESRI found that the unquantifiable benefits of economic and monetary union membership for Ireland are also likely to be positive.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy might wish to note the enhanced integration of the Irish economy with the continental EU countries generally over the past two decades, a trend that would be likely to be reinforced as the full potential of the European Single Market is realised with the single currency, the euro.  At the beginning of the 1970s over 55 per cent of our merchandise trade was with the UK.  By 1995 the UK's share had fallen to less than 30 per cent.  In 1995 other EU markets combined accounted for 36 per cent of Ireland's merchandise trade.  This trend reflects the success of Irish industrial and agricultural producers in exploiting the opportunities for market diversification presented by EU membership.</P>

      <P>The Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the IMF is the principal means by which the IMF provides financial support in the form of highly <Col N="150" /> concessional loans to low-income member countries facing protracted balance of payments problems.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that fundamental concerns have been raised particularly by the NGOs in Ireland about the efficacy of ESAF type operations as the mechanism for assisting the poorest countries to achieve a position of debt sustainability.  I empathise with their position.</P>
      <P>I have used a number of specific opportunities to press these views at IMF level.</P>
      <P>I have informed the Managing Director of the IMF that any further participation by Ireland in ESAF would need to follow rather than precede implementation of the joint IMF/World Bank debt relief initiative for the highly indebted poor countries.</P>
      <P>The spring and annual meetings of the IMF/World Bank provide further opportunities to advise individual members of Irish concerns.</P>
      <P>The principal means of influencing policy decisions at these levels is, however, through our representation on the executive board of the IMF and the joint IMF/World Bank development committee.  The executive directors meet regularly to approve loans and/or discuss policies. Executive directors for larger shareholders represent only their own country.  Other executive directors represent a group of countries known as a Constituency.  The Canadian/ Irish/Caribbean constituency is one such constituency in the IMF and the World Bank. Ireland is represented at this level by the Canadian Executive Director who is apprised of the Irish interest through out Irish resident alternate executive director.  I am happy that the Irish position on ESAF has been ably made and is well understood in the IMF.</P>
      <P>At EU level the opportunity to press the Irish cause centres around the preparations and discussions that take place in advance of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.</P>
      <P>Member states of the European Union are represented in an individual capacity at the IMF/World Bank.  A statement on behalf of the EU covering both Monetary (IMF) and Developmental (World Bank) issues and the general economic outlook of the EU is however presented by the president in office of the EU at the annual meetings.  This statement is subject to clearance by the member states of the EU and represents a consensus of views between the member states on the various topics covered.</P>
      <P>I am informed that at present Ireland is the only member state of the European Union that has not committed to contributing to the initial ESAF and to providing bilateral contributions to facilitate its continuation for a second phase.  It is expected that ESAF will become a self-financing mechanism after that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy of non-participation in ESAF in its various forms is perhaps the most potent and <Col N="151" /> pragmatic form of expression available to me as a Minister to signal our concerns about the instrument at this point in time.</P>

In the past three years, our strong economic growth has translated into strong employment creation &mdash; some 136,000 net additional jobs have been created in that period.</P>
      <P>The effect on unemployment also has been marked &mdash; there has been a net reduction of 40,000 in unemployment over the three years.  The employment/unemployment figures I have quoted are based on the Labour Force Survey, which is the authoritative source for these figures, as stated by the Central Statistics Office.  The figures show beyond all doubt that the strong economic and employment growth has been accompanied by a marked reduction in unemployment as confirmed by the Labour Force Survey.</P>

      <P>A decision was taken at the IMF/World Bank annual meetings in October 1996 to proceed with <i>The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative &mdash; A Programme of Action.</i></P>
      <P>The debt initiative will take almost immediate effect with beneficiary countries participating before the end of 1996.  A preliminary review of experience with the operation of the Debt Initiative will be held at the spring 1997 meetings of the IMF and World Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint IMF/World Bank initiative must be regarded as a significant success for both <Col N="152" /> organisations and a tribute to the tenacity and negotiating skills of the managing director of the IMF and the president of the World Bank.  It also manifests the outcome of a considerable and complex process of negotiation in which most parties to the dialogue have had to compromise.</P>
    <P>The Initiative is significant for a number of reasons: it is directed at HIPCs who are demonstrating a track record of sustained strong policy performance (economic adjustment) and who are capable of achieving overall external debt sustainability in the medium term; the initiative commits the international financial community to take additional action to reduce the debt burden of the HIPCs where existing mechanisms are unlikely to be effective; coordinated action by all creditors is envisaged and central to the success of the initiative; the initiative will be implemented flexibly, on a case-by-case basis and with full participation by debtor governments; the IMF is actively participating in the Initiative; the World Bank has committed an initial contribution of US$500 to the Initiative with an indication of a willingness to contribute more in later years if World Bank resources permit; the Paris Club (bilateral lenders) have agreed to an 80 per cent stock of debt reduction; other multilateral agencies are also being asked to define their participation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the debt initiative represents a significant step forward in the manner in which the problems of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries can be dealt with by the bilateral and multilateral lending institutions.</P>

    <P>It would not, in fact, be necessary to amend the National Lottery Act, 1986, to allow for unclaimed prize money to be allocated to a beneficiary fund as suggested by the Deputy.  The provisions in relation to unclaimed prizes are contained in the rules of the lottery which are made by me as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> For the following reasons, I do not propose to amend the rules along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  The rules are drawn up to achieve an appropriate balance between turnover allocated towards prizes and towards the national lottery surplus which supports the beneficiary fund.  To divert moneys originally allocated for prizes would upset this balance and could also tend to undermine support for the games by players.  The national lottery company considers that players generally tend to take the view that unclaimed prizes should be made available for distribution as future prizes.</P>
    <P>Unclaimed prizes are used, for example, to fund lotto superjackpots, for special draws associated with scratch card games and as prize supplements to certain scratch card games.  These uses stimulate player interest in the games.</P>

    <P>Information on random audits initiated in 1996 is not yet available.</P>
    <P>In 68 per cent of the completed random audits for the three years in question there was no additional yield and a further 7 per cent produced a yield of £1,000 or less per case.  The individual yield from the balance varied from £1,000 upwards but it can be taken that the higheryielding cases, and most of the lower and medium-yielding cases, would have been picked up by targeted audits had they not already been the subject of a random audit.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of cases who are selected for audit are selected on the basis of perceived defects in their tax returns or supporting accounts and not on a random basis.  The total number of <Col N="154" /> these comprehensive self-assessment audits on the self-employed, including farmers, initiated since inception in 1990 to the end of 1995 was 12,589 (excluding companies).  These are in addition to normal PAYE (employers) and VAT audits.  The purpose of the random element of the audit programme is to demonstrate to taxpayers that there is a risk of audit for every self assessing taxpayer even where incorrect returns have the appearance of being correct.  However, experience suggests that taxpayer behaviour is influenced more by the perception of Revenue's ability to detect suspect tax returns in a systematic way, rather than by the risk of random selection of a return.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 92, 93, 94, 103 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from the National Children's Nurseries Association regarding the VAT treatment of child minding services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in this regard is governed by European VAT law, with which Irish VAT law complies fully.  Under the EU Sixth VAT <Col N="155" /> Directive, education is an exempt service for VAT purposes, but this exemption does not extend to childcare services or nurseries.  Such facilities are liable for VAT when they are provided in the course or furtherance of business and if their annual turnover exceeds, or is likely to exceed £20,000.  However, I should point that non-profit making child minding services provided by public bodies or recognised charities are exempt from VAT.  In addition, crèches and playschools which follow a clear educational programme may be exempt if they come within the terms of the exemption for children's education.  In the majority of cases, it is the experience of the Revenue Commissioners that childcare services rather than education are provided by such crèches and playschools.  In such instances, VAT would be chargeable on the childcare element.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether a particular facility is liable for VAT.</P>

      <P>To date, a total of £242,250 has been made available to Galway, Donegal and Mayo county councils for island access projects and I expect to be in a position to confirm funding to Cork county council shortly.  Details of projects which have received funding to date are listed in the following schedule.</P>
      <P>A number of projects are still being assessed by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee and I hope to be in a position to announce further funding in respect of these from the financial envelope shortly.</P>
      <P>On foot of the report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development, new mechanisms have been established in order to deal with the development of access and related infrastructural work on the offshore islands, which was identified as a priority issue and towards which the Government made available an additional £1 million this year.  Island access projects are selected and prioritised by the islands committees of the relevant local authorities.  These projects are then assessed by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee and recommendations regarding funding subsequently made.  Funding in respect of each priority access project is allocated to the relevant local authorities in accordance with normal Government accounting requirements.</P>
      <P>Funds have been made available for priority access projects and will continue to be made available on the basis of proposals agreed by the local authorities islands committees.  All proposals with the objective of achieving an acceptable level of access services to offshore islands will be considered by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has expressed dissatisfaction to the British authorities in relation to the fact that a number of Irish prisoners being held in Belmarsh Prison have not seen their families for very long periods, in certain cases, for over two years, due to the fact that the British authorities are insisting on a regime of closed visits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances in which the particular prisoners to which the Deputy refers are being held.  I understand that four of these prisoners have recently been moved to the special secure unit (SSU) at Full Sutton prison.</P>
      <P>The Government has expressed its concern on a number of occasions to the relevant British authorities both within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference and through the Irish Embassy in London with regard to the system of closed visits which has been in operation for these prisoners since June 1995.  We have highlighted the humanitarian difficulties caused for those prisoners, including in relation to family contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> The British authorities have responded that the application of the policy of closed visits is a function of these prisoners' categorisation.  They have stated that these prisoners' categorisation is periodically reviewed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the applications made by three of these prisoners to be temporarily transferred to Northern Ireland to enable them to receive accumulated visits, I refer the Deputy to my answer to his written Question No. 67 of 30 October 1996.  The British aurhorities continue to advise that these requests are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>I note that these prisoners have applied for transfer to this jurisdiction under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  I reiterate that we stand ready to receive all such prisoners who seek to transfer to this jurisdiction under the Convention.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that we will continue to express the Government's concern to the British authorities about humanitarian aspects of the policy of closed visits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the particular circumstances of the individual referred to by the Deputy and I confirm that, on my instructions, her recent application for compassionate leave was raised on a number of occasions with the relevant British authorities.  As the Deputy will be aware, the British authorities decided to refuse compassionte leave to the person in question for security and jurisdictional reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I understand that a previous application made by her for compassionate parole remains the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in the Northern Ireland Court of <Col N="161" /> Appeal.  I am informed that a decision in the matter is expected shortly.  I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor developments in this matter closely in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question relating to this prisoner's application for permanent transfer to Northern Ireland, I am aware that this prisoner has been on temporary transfer to Northern Ireland since July 1994.  I am also aware that she is in the process of making a legal challenge to the status of this transfer.  I am advised that this case is due to come again before the courts shortly.  I would like to assure the Deputy that I have instructed my Department to follow this matter closely.</P>
    <P>On the general question of prisoner transfers, the Government has made clear to the British authorities both through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and through the Irish Embassy in London its support for the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.  The Government has welcomed the transfer of Republican prisoners from prisons in Britain to Northern Ireland which have occurred since July 1994 and will continue to press for further transfers in the future.  We have pressed for these transfers to be permanent rather than temporary, since temporary transfers create uncertainty and impose certain difficulties for prisoners and their families which would be avoided if the transfers were permanent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that the Mitchell report pointed out that continued action by the two Governments on prisoners would bolster trust. Both Governments have again recognised in paragraph 12 of the communiqué of 28 February 1996 that confidence building measures will be necessary.  In the view of the Irish Government, a key component in such measures is a constructive approach to prisoner issues.  I would like to assure the Deputy that we will continue to emphasise the importance of proceeding in a humane and constructive manner in relation to prisoners in the period ahead.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the fact that the current taxation system ensures that a low earner must pay £73 for every £100 invested as against £44.25 for a high earner, thus inhibiting low earners from making adequate provisions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this question relates to tax relief on pension contributions.  It is not possible to account exactly for the difference between the two examples the Deputy has in mind without fuller details of the <Col N="162" /> actual earnings of the two individuals.  However, there are a number of factors which can contribute to the type of difference shown.  The first and most significant of these is the fact that the tax relief on pension contributions has always been at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax.  This means that the higher rate taxpayer gets tax relief of £48 per £100 while the standard rate taxpayer gets tax relief of £27 per £100.</P>
      <P>A further complication arises because of the interaction of PRSI and levies.  If the Deputy has questions on how these interact at different incomes, my Department would be happy to reply to any queries on this issue.  I do not accept that tax relief at the marginal rate inhibits low earners from making adequate pension provision.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to say if the customs post at Muff, or part of it, will be made available to the Red Cross.  The property is still required by the Revenue Commissioners (Customs and Excise) but it is expectd that it will become surplus to their requirements in about 18 months time.  If it is not required by any other Government Department, at that stage, the Commissioners of Public Works will contact the Red Cross (as has already been indicated to them) and advise them of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 100, 101 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, last year I established an inter-departmental committee to thoroughly examine the whole issue involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers.  Earlier this year the committee reported their findings which included a recommendation, since enacted, that cross-Border workers should be exempted from the 1.25 per cent health contribution levy and the 1 per cent employment and training levy.  A further recommendation was that there should be consultation between the Irish and UK revenue authorities in order to clarify the scope of Article 18 of the Ireland/UK double taxation convention.</P>
      <P>Article 18 is concerned with the taxation of governmental employees and it generally provides that they should be taxable only in the State of the government for which they work.  In order to qualify under this article, the employee must be rendering services to the government or a local authority and must be discharging services of a governmental nature.  In a High Court case in this State, it was held that a nurse employed in a hospital in Northern Ireland by a regional health board was not employed by a local authority, nor was the person discharging functions of a governmental nature.  The rationale of this judgment would appear to be equally applicable to other similar type public service employments, such as teaching.  Indeed the UK have taken the view that teachers employed by local education boards in Northern Ireland are not governed by Article 18.</P>
      <P>Discussions have commenced between the Irish and UK tax authorities on the scope of Article 18 and whether it should be amended to make it clearer what categories of employment are covered.  Those discussions are still taking place and it is hoped that they can be satisfactorily concluded shortly.  However, it should be noted that Article 18 is intended to cover only a small class of government employees and the position of cross-Border workers generally will not be affected by the outcome of the negotiations.  It is important also to add that the 1976 Irish/British Double Taxation Agreement is a bilateral one and any changes must be agreed to by the UK government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a moratorium on collection pending the outcome of the discussion on Article 18, this would be inappropriate as the number of persons affected would be very small and changes, if any, <Col N="164" /> would not be retrospective from the date of the change.</P>

      <P>Under current fiscal legislation, it is possible to manufacture a spirit product provided the manufacturer is licensed to do so and the process is carried out under the control of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, however, that it is their policy to object to the use of the term &ldquo;poitín&rdquo; to describe a product distributed in the State.  The reasons for this include the strong association in the public mind of the term &ldquo;poitín&rdquo; with illicitly distilled spirits and the confusion that the use of such term would give rise to as to the duty status of such spirits. Under these circumstances, the issue of legalising poitín making does not arise.</P>

    <P>Also excluded from the calculations are tax receipts from deposit interest retention tax because it is not possible to apportion that tax between particular classes of taxpayers. Payments of deposit interest retention tax have been made by financial institutions to the Revenue Commissioners since the enactment of the Finance Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>2  PRSI for the self-employed including farmers was introduced for the first time with effect from 6 April 1988. The figures shown for 1988 and subsequent years include PRSI, health contributions, employment and training and income levies, as appropriate, as well as arrears of health contributions and levies paid in respect of years prior to 1988. The figures shown for years prior to 1988 are composed of health contributions and levies in so far as they are available.</P>
    <P>3  Income tax payable in respect of 1974-75 assessments, the year of commencement of the charge to tax on farming profits, was not due for payment until 1975.</P>

      <Col N="166" /> 5  Of the £82 million amount of tax paid in 1988, some £38 million was a once-off payment of tax arrears under the tax amnesty.  The corresponding amnesty amount included in the PRSI payments for that year is not identifiable.</P>
    <P>6  The yield in 1991 from farmers was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992.  Ordinarily these balances would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of changing the year of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>
    <P>7  Included in the tax amounts of £56 million and £90 million paid in 1993 and 1994 are once-off payments of tax arrears under the 1993 tax amnesty amounting to some £1 million and £23.5 million respectively.  The corresponding amnesty amounts in the PRSI payments for these years are not identifiable.</P>
    <P>8  The only relevant information available for 1996 is the post budget estimate for income tax from farmers of £74 million. The corresponding estimate for PRSI is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prime objective of creating a third banking force was to generate greater competition within the retail banking services market.  The Government has <Col N="167" /> been considering its options in this regard for some time with a view to identifying the most effective means of continually improving the level of competition in this market.</P>
      <P>Within the general framework of competition policy, the Government has instituted a number of initiatives which are targeted at the creation of vibrant and competitive markets in all spheres of economic activity with the aim of promoting economic development in Ireland.  The strengthening of the Competition Authority in the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996 and the creation of a Director of Competition Enforcement are key developments in this regard.  Specifically in relation to greater competition in the retail banking services market, the removal of statutory restrictions on services which can be provided by building societies which are now emerging as major players in all sectors of the banking market has resulted in major advances in the availability of services and improved access to those services.  The Consumer Credit Act, 1995 has improved the level of transparency in relation to fees and the cost of credit and has brought this whole area within the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The recently published Central Bank Bill will bring the central clearing system, operated under the auspices of the Dublin Bankers Clearing Committee, under the supervision of the Central Bank.  The Bill will confer powers on the Central Bank in relation to the establishment, supervision, and operation of payments systems in the State.  While the existing system has been examined by both the Competition Authority and the European Commission who have found that the operations of the system is not anti-competitive, the regulation of such a critical system within the banking sector by the Central Bank is appropriate.  Finally, a Credit Union Bill, which is currently being drafted will broaden the range of services which credit unions can offer and which will contribute further to competition and liberalisation of the market.</P>
      <P>The development of competition in the market place generally and in the retail banking services market specifically, is subject to continuing review to ensure that initiatives and statutory provisions currently in place are having the desired effect.  If necessary, such provisions as are in place will be modified, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, already referred to, being a case in point of such modification. Assessing the impact of existing and recently introduced provisions and the potential impact of alternative available options takes time. Moreover, the emergence of the building societies and the credit unions as major players in the personal financial services market has considerably changed the nature of the market and the availability of alternative competitively priced credit and service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dynamic and changing environment has obviously had a major impact on our <Col N="168" /> considerations of the role which the State banking sector can play and, in particular, how that role might be exercised.  There are a number of options for restructuring the State banks each of which would have varying impacts on competition, employment and the delivery of cost-effective, customer-based services.  This is a complex and difficult issue, but I would hope soon to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the Government on it.</P>

      <P>The current position is that witnesses attending before committees of the House of the Oireachtas are subject to the same laws of defamation and slander as any other witnesses attending hearings of other public bodies.  However, the Privilege, Compellability and Immunities of Witnesses Bill which is at Committee Stage, provides for a significant amendment to this position.</P>
      <P>The privilege of witnesses, as set out in the present text of the Bill which went through Second Stage last November, is that witnesses, except for a small number of specified exceptions, can be compelled to attend meetings of appropriate Oireachtas Committees.  These committees have the power to call persons and papers in their terms of reference.  These witnesses are obliged to answer questions when making such appearances.  This should ensure that there is no impediment in the way of committees investigating important matters of State.</P>
      <P>As witnesses are to be compelled to appear before Oireachtas Committees, then it is in the interests of natural justice that answers to questions or information supplied on foot of such appearances are privileged.  The text of the Bill presented at Second Stage provides for High Court privilege for witnesses in all cases except where a Committee Chairman instructs a witness to stop giving evidence and the witness refuses to do so.  In these cases, the witness shall be entitled to qualified privilege only.  It is not my intention to amend that position on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In preparing the National Development Plan covering the 1994-1999 period, the Government was determined to ensure that the development strategy adopted should promote balanced <Col N="169" /> regional development.  To this end, the Government built on the work of the sub-regional review committees established under the previous Community Support Framework (CSF) to provide for sub-regional involvement in planning and reviewing the expenditure under the Structural Funds &mdash; which include the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
      <P>The CSF is implemented through nine national operational programmes covering key sectors of the economy, under which European Regional Development Fund aid is transferred to Ireland. The main objectives of the CSF are to ensure the best long-term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long-term jobs and by reintegrating the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming so, into the economic mainstream.</P>
      <P>The existing allocation of Structural Funds under the Community Support Framework, 1994-1999 and the question of the impact of such spending on the regions within Ireland, including the western region, will be evaluated as part of the mid-term review of the CSF which is now under way.  It will be a matter in the first instance for the monitoring committees responsible for the constituent operational programmes and the CSF to consider any recommendations to emerge from the review process.</P>
      <P>Cohesion Fund expenditure is not part of the CSF and is not subject to the requirements of the CSF, including the requirement for a mid-term review.  The level of such complementary expenditure will, however, be taken into consideration in the mid-term evaluation of both the transport and environment operational programmes.</P>
      <P>I emphasise, however, that based on forecasts supplied by Government Departments, the total CSF &mdash; related expenditure in the west sub-region on a <i>per capita</i> basis will exceed the national average by 20 per cent for the 1994-99 period.</P>

However, the committee did recommend that cross-Border workers should be exempted from paying the 1.25 per cent health contribution and the 1 per cent employment and training levy on their Northern Irish income.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives.  First, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all registered nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act, and second to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware a number of changes have been made to the subvention scheme under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 by amending regulations which came into effect on 31 July 1996.</P>
      <P>One of these changes increases the threshold above which the circumstances of a son or daughter are assessed by a health board to establish if he or she is in a position to contribute towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a parent who has qualified for a nursing home subvention.  This amendment will have the effect of reducing the amount of time spent by health boards in assessing the circumstances of sons or daughters who are clearly not in a position to contribute towards the nursing home costs of a parent.</P>
      <P>However, I believe that sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so. The State recognises this contribution in the tax relief it gives on such payments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the current levels of subvention payable, it must be stressed that a nursing home subvention is not intended to meet the full cost of a nursing home fee, but to provide assistance towards the cost of nursing home care for those who cannot do so from their own resources.  I am aware that there are certain difficulties being encountered by some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  I will continue to endeavour to address these problems, and the issue of increasing the subvention rates, within the resources available to me.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The South-Eastern Health Board inform me that Cluainn Aráin is a 41 bed welfare home for the elderly.  Welfare homes are run by the health boards.  They differ from other health board long-stay institutions in that most of the residents, although elderly, are ambulant and capable of taking care of themselves.  As a result, these homes generally require a small number of staff, comprising a matron plus an assistant, a cook and some catering and cleaning staff.  Due to the low level of dependency of the patients, the health boards do not consider it essential that a nurse must be on duty at night and accordingly, night nurse cover is not provided in Cluainn Aráin.</P>

      <P>There are no standard rates of pay for &ldquo;emergency services&rdquo;, therefore it is not possible to cost such a proposal.  Public sector pay including that of ambulance personnel is determined through the normal industrial relations procedures.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993 sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994 during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a <Col N="176" /> range of productivity/efficiency measures, with referral for binding third party decision in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
    <P>As outlined to the Deputy in previous replies on 26 September and 17 October 1996, negotiations are ongoing to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity/flexibility measures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The rate of pay for on-call for ambulance personnel is based on the hourly rate.  A payment of 1/6th of the flat hourly rate is paid in respect of each hour on-call.  At 1 October 1996 this equates to 97 pence per hour for those drivers on the maximum of the scale.  On-call is defined as time when the employee is required to maintain himself fit and ready for duty and to be available to accept and respond immediately to a call to attend for duty.  When a driver is then called to duty he is paid the appropriate overtime rates for all work performed outside of the rostered working week.</P>
      <P>The on-call rate is one element of a remuneration package for emergency work.  In relation to other health service employees providing emergency cover a diversity of arrangements apply.  Therefore any one element of such a package cannot be directly compared between different groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The remuneration packages of ambulance personnel in the provinces and the Dublin metropolitan area are negotiated separately by each group.  Prior to 1982 ambulance drivers in the provinces had a separate and distinct history of pay determination.  In 1982 arising from a Labour Court hearing [LCR6914] the concession of basic pay parity was recommended by the court.  This was implemented with effect from 1 January 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two groups have continued to negotiate their remuneration package separately and in <Col N="177" /> 1993 the Dublin group reached agreement on a new remuneration package for drivers and attendants in the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In February 1994 during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin in response to the unions claim on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations.  Subject to the successful conclusion of the current set of negotiations on the productivity-flexibility elements on which the concession is conditional, parity of basic pay between the two groups will be restored.</P>
    <P>The question of the application of certain allowances and other concessions negotiated locally with the Dublin group were not part of this claim.  Differences do exist in relation to the payment of a travel allowance to the Dublin group.  The travel allowance emerged originally from its introduction in the local authority Dublin metropolitan area and was subsequently extended to the Eastern Health Board (Dublin area).</P>
    <P>This and other allowances peculiar to the Dublin metropolitan area have been the subject of a number of Labour Court cases for the non-nursing group of employees as a whole. Consistently, the court have recommended that allowances such as these, should not be extended to employees working outside the Dublin area. Particular emphasis has been laid on the origins of the allowances and the fact it would be &ldquo;neither practical or desirable that these payments should be extended&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Any other differences in relation to either the calculation of overtime or the payment of other allowances arose from productivity-flexibility arrangements negotiated locally with the Dublin group.  As a separate negotiating group they have entered into separate arrangements with the EHB on productivity-flexibility measures from which these concessions have flowed over time. Extension of any such concessions would represent separate further cost-increasing claims. The provincial group are entitled to only one such claim in the lifetime of the current agreement on pay as incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The claim for basic pay parity represents their claim under this agreement.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the provisions of section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards have the responsibility for the provision of general practitioner services for persons covered by medical cards.  Health boards fulfil this statutory obligation through contractual arrangements with participating general practitioners.

      <P>The contract between health boards and general practitioners for the provision of services under the general medical services scheme includes a requirement that the contract agreement shall terminate when the doctor reaches 65 years of age and in certain cases 70 years of age.  The contract agreement also contains provisions allowing a health board to make the arrangements it considers appropriate, including the award of a new contract following an open competition, for the provision of general practitioner services to the persons on the patient list of a contract holder who is due to retire.  Sale by a contractor of a health board contract for the provision of general practitioner services (or any interest therein) does not therefore arise.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 135, 136 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors work a &ldquo;basic&rdquo; 39 hour week.  However, they are liable to be rostered for an average of 65 hours per week.  The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following Labour Court Recommendation 11840.  Figures are not available on the longest working week of a non-consultant hospital doctor in 1995 or on the total number of doctors who worked in excess of the 65 hours per week in 1995.  The absence of this information is largely due to the absence of mechanisms to record unapproved or unrostered hours.  When overtime is paid to non-consultant hospital doctors for hours worked over 65 hours it generally follows agreements reached at local level.  This information is not readily available in the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The report on the Joint Pilot Study on Unrostered Hours of Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors carried out in 1994 by a group representative of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, the Irish Business Employers' Confederation, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Department of Health identified the problem of unrostered hours in certain specialities.  Following this report, the Department of Health and health service management representatives entered negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation and agreement has been reached on a mechanism to monitor and control working hours which will be introduced when other related matters which the parties are considering are agreed.</P>
      <P>This mechanism will in the future be available to deal with cases similar to the one of the non-consultant hospital doctors in County Limerick and will also deal with the comments made by the Rights Commissioner in relation to Labour Court Recommendation 11840.  I am not aware of any other similar overtime claims by non-consultant hospital doctors which have been investigated previously by a Rights Commissioner or other officers of the Labour Relations Commission nor of any similar claims pending.  The ruling of the Rights Commissioner relates to this individual case and has no impact on the remuneration of any other non-consultant hospital doctor.</P>

    <P>The National Cancer Strategy is aimed at reorganising cancer services to ensure that they <Col N="181" /> meet the needs of patients in the best manner.

    <P>In relation to the latter objective the health boards will be asked to draw up a set of priorities for the development of palliative care services in their areas and the proposed supra-regional cancer services, as outlined in the Strategy, will include a consultant-led palliative care service.  A programme of specialist palliative care in regional cancer services will be developed on a phased basis in consultation with the health boards and other agencies.  I will also be asking the proposed national forum on cancer services to provide detailed advice on the development of palliative care services nationally.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Strengthening the Protection of the Architectural Heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> The report acknowledges the existing listing system as part of the planning process, and recommends that this be built upon by addressing legislative and administrative weaknesses which exist at present.  It proposes that &ldquo;listing&rdquo; remain a responsibility of planning authorities but that it become a mandatory statutory function and that it be supported by the establishment of a central authority with advisory and co-ordinating functions.  It is recommended that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht nominate such a central authority with responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, for carrying out a National Inventory of Architecture, for establishing and publishing national criteria and guidelines for listing and for making recommendations to planning authorities regarding buildings which should be included in the list for preservation.</P>
    <P>The principal options in the nomination of the central authority outlined in the report are for the establishment of this function as part of the Heritage Service of my Department, or for its establishment under the aegis of the Heritage Council, with the principal objective being to ensure that a coherent, consistent and co-ordinated system is achieved.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding to address all the issues identified in the report, and the Minister for the Environment and I will be bringing forward to Government a package of specific financial, administrative, and legislative proposals based on the recommendations in the report and taking account of any observations received on those recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Dún of Drumsna, which has been termed the &ldquo;Gateway to Connacht&rdquo;, is a linear earthwork some 1.75km long cutting off a promontory formed by a loop in the River Shannon just south of Drumsna and Jamestown. The site has been dated to the 2nd century BC and represents one of the most sizeable manifestations of manpower use from the Celtic period.  The Dún of Drumsna is indeed a very important archaeological feature meriting preservation and protection.  While the site is not in State care, I am satisfied that there are adequate provisions under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, to fully protect this important archaeological site.</P>
      <P>The Dún of Drumsna will be included in the forthcoming Record of Monuments for County Roscommon, pursuant to section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, requiring any person proposing to carry out any works at or in relation to the site to give two months notice in writing to me as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

It is not possible, in advance of the tendering process, to say what the level of fee will be.

      <P>Arrangements for the provision of legal services to a local authority are a matter for the individual authority.  No analysis has been carried out by my Department in relation to the matter, and my Department has no information on the amount spent on legal fees.</P>
      <P>Based on staffing returns supplied to my Department, the local authorities who had full-time legal staff at 31 December 1995 were the county borough corporations of Cork, Dublin and Limerick; and the county councils of Cork, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Galway, Kerry, South Dublin and Wicklow.</P>

      <P>Consideration by planning authorities of individual applications for planning permission must be based on the proper planning and development of the area, particular regard being had to the provisions of the development plan. Among the purposes for which objectives may be indicated in the plan are objectives determining the provision and siting of schools and other community, including health, facilities.</P>
      <P>When a development plan is being reviewed, public notice must be given and it is open to any person or body to make submissions or observations on the draft plan; the local planning authority is required to consider such submissions or observations before making a new plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> I am aware it is the practice of some planning authorities to consult the relevant education and health authorities in the process of reviewing their development plans and I am considering whether this should be made a statutory requirement in all cases.  I consider this would be a more appropriate and more practical approach than requiring consultation on every planning application for a scheme of houses.</P>

      <P>The position is that in the certificate examinations all candidates have their work marked once.  Where they are not satisfied with the result, there is provision to have their work marked again in accordance with the procedures for re-checking which are notified to schools and candidates. There is no provision of any subsequent marking.</P>
      <P>I should explain that in the certificate examinations the work of all candidates is marked by examiners appointed by my Department.  Before beginning the work of marking, each examiner attends a marking conference where the procedures for marking are fully explained and where the draft marking scheme, drawn up by the chief examiner and his-her advisers, is applied to a number of sample scripts.  The draft marking scheme, which is related directly to the questions posed in the current year, may be adjusted, if necessary, in the light of the comments of subject associations and representatives of teachers and in the light of the experience of the examiners in marking the sample scripts.  The work of marking is subsequently carried out by the examiner in accordance with the marking scheme approved at the conference, in accordance with detailed written instructions, and under the supervision and guidance of an advising examiner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a school believes, in the case of a candidate entered by the school, that the result in a subject is seriously at variance with what was <Col N="190" /> expected, it is open to the school to apply for a recheck of the result.  The recheck process involves a full clerical check and a remarking by an experienced examiner, other than the original examiner, of the work submitted by the candidate in the examination.  Where the marks awarded by the recheck examiner are greater than the original total to the extent that an upgrade may be warranted, the script is further examined by the inspector for the subject.  An upgrade is approved where the inspector and the recheck examiner are both in agreement or where the upgrade is the result of a clerical error.</P>
    <P>In the case of the candidate referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the candidate's school applied for a recheck in the subject economics. The work or rechecking was carried out by an experienced examiner in accordance with the procedures which have been described.  The appeal examiner considered that the candidate's work merited an upgrading to a grade B2 and the inspector for the subject agreed, after examining the script, that this upgrade was warranted.</P>

The prioritisation of a project arises only after the contract documentation has been completed.  My Department has invited tenders for the work.  The deadline for receipt of replies is 7 November 1996.  When the tenders have been evaluated and the lowest suitable tender selected my Department will notify the school authorities.</P>

The course must be followed in a university or third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.  The following courses are excluded: postgraduate courses; courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, which are subject to a Higher Education Authority quota on places, and teacher training including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education, also subject to a quota; courses in colleges of further and higher education; courses in colleges akin to private commercial colleges in Ireland; and courses provided in colleges in Britain which are offered in a private commercial third level college in Ireland and which are validated by that British college.

      <P>An extension to cater for a projected long-term enrolment of 1,000 pupils has been approved for Ashbourne Community School, County Meath. Approval was granted in March 1996 for the appointment of a design team for the architectural planning of the proposed extension. The design team was instructed in April to prepare stage one documentation, that is, a site report, for submission to the Department.  The stage one submission was presented to the post-primary building unit of my Department in July and following detailed examination of the stage one report, a technical briefing meeting took place in the Department with the design team. The exact location on the school site of the proposed extension was discussed with the school authorities and agreement has been reached on the most suitable location.</P>

      <P>Under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, 1992 and 1994 the management and direction of Carlow regional technical college is a function of the director and the governing body.  I understand from the management of Carlow regional technical college that some difficulties have arisen since the beginning of this academic year with regard to temporary accommodation, staffing and the non-pay budget.  Following discussions with the college, my Department is awaiting a full report from the management on these matters so that the issues involved can be considered fully. It is also understood from the college authorities that staff illnesses at the beginning of the session led to a shortage of lecturing in Engineering but that temporary staff to cover this aspect have been appointed and students will receive additional hours to cover the earlier shortfall.</P>
      <P>As already indicated in my press statement of 13 January 1994 a sum of £4 million was allocated under the 1994 to 1999 European Regional Development Fund programme for capital developments at the college.  This sum remains available and my Department has conveyed approval to the college authorities to proceed with the planning and design of a learning resource centre, a catering and services building, improvements to existing buildings and upgrading site infrastructure including parking, access and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the college authorities that tender documentation in relation to the site infrastructure works will be issued shortly and that a main contractor will be on site in early 1997.  I also understand that design work on the <Col N="197" /> other capital projects is at an advanced stage and that tender documentation will be available during the first half of 1997.  A decision in respect of further capital funding for the college will be taken in the context of other priorities and overall resource constraints.</P>

This judgment dealt with the consideration to be given to a particular case of an application for release from detention from the Central Mental Hospital of a person who had been found guilty but insane and who is detained under the provisions of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883.  The considerations to be applied in the case of other applicants for parole from prisons did not fall to be addressed by the court.</P>

      <P>The closed circuit television monitoring system currently in operation in the Temple Bar area of Dublin was launched on 26 October 1995.  It was the first scheme of its kind in this country and was introduced with the co-operation of local interests and operated on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of all aspects of the Temple Bar system and its effectiveness during its initial period of operation was carried out earlier this year.  This review concluded that in the appropriate locations and under correct conditions urban CCTV systems can deliver benefits.  The Garda authorities report that the CCTV system has had a beneficial effect on crime prevention and detection in the Temple Bar area resulting in a significant reduction in the area's crime rate since its introduction.  It has contributed to the detection of a number of offences, including public order offences, road traffic offences and some crimes relating to robbery and drugs.</P>
      <P>However, it would be dangerous to assume that the introduction of CCTV is an answer in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> CCTV systems in public areas operate as an aid to policing and must be carefully planned and fully integrated into Garda operational procedures, given that there are obvious implications for the Garda in how they deploy their resources and personnel to cover the ongoing operation of such systems once introduced.</P>
    <P>The success of the system in the Temple Bar area is very encouraging and I am pleased to say that tenders are due shortly for a CCTV scheme for the O'Connell Street area of Dublin.  Having obtained Government approval in July of this year to provide additional funding, as part of the anti-crime package, for the expansion of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing, I have recently provided funding for Garda CCTV schemes in Finglas and Tralee, and I intend to approve further schemes in other areas.</P>

      <P>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has no function with regard to judicial training.  The board was established under the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 to advise the Government on the suitability of persons for judicial office.  A person wishing to be considered by the board in this regard must indicate to the board his or her agreement, if appointed to judicial office, to take such course or courses of training or education or both as may be required by the Chief Justice or President of the court to which that person is appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> The constitutional independence of the Judiciary excludes any action by me which could be interpreted as direct interference in the exercise of their judicial functions, including the imposition of a training or briefing programme on them.  Initiatives with regard to training of the Judiciary, therefore, are a matter entirely for the courts.  The Chief Justice has recently established the Judicial Training Institute and the provision of training for recently appointed judges will be among the matters for consideration by this body.</P>
    <P>I have always assisted with initiatives which the Judiciary have brought forward with regard to training and funds have always been made available to judges at all levels to enable them to attend training seminars and conferences both at home and abroad.  The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 specifically provides that I may with the consent of the Minister for Finance provide funds for the training and education of judges and the establishment of the Judicial Training Institute will ensure that the funds available are used in the most effective way possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are delays in the hearing of cases in the courts which extend to civil proceedings in respect of accidents at work and road accidents. It must be emphasised, however, that the time taken for the processing of such cases is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are outside the control of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 50 per cent of all civil cases initiated are subsequently not pursued through the courts system.  Of those that are, no case is listed for <Col N="204" /> hearing until a notice of trial is lodged by the parties involved.  The time that elapses between the issue of the proceedings and the lodgement of a notice of trial is entirely in the hands of the parties.  Once a case is listed for hearing it is subject to applications for adjournment from either party.  Indeed in many instances, cases are not pressed forward by, or are adjourned at the request of, legal advisers in the interests of their clients.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, therefore, to say what is a reasonable period of time for processing such cases.  However, in relation to those factors which are within the control of the courts I have outlined in this House and elsewhere on several occasions the very extensive range of measures I have introduced to tackle resource and other issues affecting delays in the hearing of cases, including civil actions, in the courts.  These include the largest ever increase, at one stroke, in the number of judges and support staff; radical overhaul of the courts by the Denham group; the provision, this year alone, of almost £7.4 million for the building and refurbishment of court accommodation; and the introduction in the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 of administrative and procedural reforms which have simplified and speeded up the processing of cases through the courts which will, in due course, enhance the overall efficiency of the courts system.  Long delays in the hearing of cases can lead to injustices and this is why I am taking all possible steps to ensure the courts have the resources they require to address the problem of delays and speed up the hearing of cases.</P>
    <P>The working group on a courts commission has published two reports to date and continues to examine all aspects of the operation of the courts system.  I look forward to receiving further reports in due course.</P>
    <P>Other Ministers have also taken initiatives in the area of personal injuries actions.  On 31 November 1996 the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology announced the establishment of a special working group to examine how best to create a personal injuries tribunal as recommended by a consultancy report on insurance costs in Ireland.  A working group on the administration of personal injury and accidental damage compensation claims made against the State was set up by the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General to consider the way in which State agencies deal with personal injury and accidental damage compensation cases and to make recommendations for the establishment of an executive body to act as a claims agency for the State.  I await the reports of both these working groups with interest.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the special task force on security for the elderly was that my Department introduce a once-off £2 million grant scheme to provide grant aid to voluntary organisations in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted. Subsequently, I established a national advisory committee on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána &mdash; neighbourhood watch &mdash; are represented to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved. The scheme is being operated on a once off basis. Funding under the scheme is available for community and voluntary groups only.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for equipment such as: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>The scheme, entitled a scheme of community support for older people, was advertised on Wednesday, 29 May 1996 in the national newspapers.  The scheme is open to any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people. Information on the scheme was disseminated through my Department i.e. headquarters, regional and local offices and through the networks of the various organisations represented on the national advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> The deadline for receipt of applications was 28 June 1996.  This was to allow time for my Department to assess all applications and to ensure that those most at risk benefit from the available funds before the onset of the winter months.  The scheme is being administered in each of my Department's regions with the aid of a regional advisory committee which mirrors the composition of the national advisory committee referred to above.</P>
    <P>A total of 525 applications have been received from voluntary organisations catering for approximately 14,100 individuals.  These include late applications.  To date, 392 groups have been approved for funding catering for approximately 10,400 individuals.  Applications received after the formal closing date were and are still being considered, in the light of resources still available under the scheme.  It is expected that all the available funds will be spent shortly.  At present my officials are preparing lists of all the groups that have received funding to date and these will be ready for the Deputy shortly.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the scheme will be evaluated by the national and regional advisory committees to assess its effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the scheme towards the end of the year.</P>

      <P>My Department received an application from the above mentioned group for funding towards the cost of personal development courses under the scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups.  Under this scheme grants can be made for a wide range of activities covering almost every aspect of personal and skills development for women.  Projects should involve the participants in the running of, and where possible, the design of the project itself.  Priority is given to projects aimed at developing the skill and expertise of individuals in setting-up and running projects in their communities; groups in disadvantaged areas; projects aimed at specially disadvantaged groups, and new projects establishing themselves in their communities.</P>
      <P>I approved a grant of £1,000 towards the cost of personal development courses under this scheme to the group.  The group has been informed that the cheque will issue as soon as the group furnishes my Department with a tax number as required under the tax clearance procedures under which grants from Government bodies are made.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and to age 19 in respect of children who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally challenged.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, I made provision in the 1996 budget for increasing the grant in respect of the birth of twins from £200 to £500 and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12.  While these improvements were announced in the context of this year's budget, they were backdated to apply to all newborn twins and those reaching the ages of four and 12 respectively on or after 1 January 1996.  To date over 1,400 families have benefited at a cost of almost £700,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to the improved grants, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 budget, these rates represent an increase of 45 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 36 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of other children.</P>
      <P>Assistance with back to school expenses is also provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards and funded by my Department. This year, I increased the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to £43 in respect of children from two to 11 years of age and £58 in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years of age.  This allowance benefits some 114,000 families with 270,000 children.</P>
      <P>Based on the present rates of payment, the cost of paying double child benefit in respect of twins would be in the region of £8.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided last month to approve the payment of a Christmas bonus again this year to certain social welfare recipients and others at a total cost of £41.7 million.  As in previous years, the bonus will amount to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments and there will be a minimum payment of £20.  It will be paid during the first week of December and will benefit almost 800,000 recipients and their 500,000 dependants, that is a total of 1.3 million beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>In line with previous years, the bonus will be paid to people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments, including those receiving old age, retirement, widows'-widowers', invalidity pensions, lone parent's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, carer's allowance, disability allowance, formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; as well as FÁS and CERT trainees.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments are not eligible for the Christmas bonus; these include recipients of unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance, disability benefit, supplementary welfare allowance, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and health and safety benefit.  The cost of extending the bonus to recipients of disability benefit is estimated to be of the order of £2.4 million.  As stated above, recipients of disability allowance are eligible for the bonus.</P>
      <P>The number of people in County Mayo who are eligible for the Christmas bonus is of the order of 22,500, not including those in receipt of disability allowance, the figures for which are not yet available on a county basis.  It does not include also those on community employment, FÁS schemes, CERT trainees or those getting long-term health board payments, all of which are relevant to other Government Departments.  The corresponding number of people in County Mayo in receipt of a social welfare payment in respect of which a Christmas bonus is not payable is about 8,000.  The categories are unemployment benefit with 1,600 recipients, short-term unemployment assistance, with 4,700 recipients, disability benefit with 1,100 recipients, supplementary welfare allowance with 500 recipients and maternity benefit with 100 recipients.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 202, 203 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>In 1993 the National Pensions Board in its final report, Developing the National Pensions System, set out the aim that there should be a national pension system which would provide pension benefits which would maintain a reasonable relationship with previous income levels, so that established standards of living could be maintained.  One of the recommendations of the National Pensions Board report was that a survey of occupational pension schemes should be carried out to establish their coverage and adequacy.  The last major survey related to 1985 and it was essential that up-to-date information should be available which would be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions were being formulated.</P>
      <P>Accordingly my Department and the National Pensions Board jointly commissioned a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute. This report, entitled Occupational and Personal Pension Coverage 1995, was presented to me last week.  The report shows that pension coverage is roughly the same now as it was over ten years ago.  This is despite the fact that, in the meantime, pensions have assumed a higher profile and in a situation where the issues associated with the ageing population have been highlighted as never before.</P>
      <P>Having considered carefully the findings of the report, my Department in conjunction with the National Pensions Board are sponsoring a national pensions policy initiative.  The purpose of this will be to facilitate a national debate on how to work towards a national pension system consistent with the aim of providing pension benefits which maintain a reasonable relationship with previous income levels so that established standards of living can be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative will be a two stage process.  Stage one will involve the production of a consultation document which will form the basis for general discussion among all interested parties, the social partners and the general public.  This document will set out the information and data currently <Col N="210" /> available on pensions coverage in Ireland and the key issues that now need to be addressed.  These issues will include coverage, the delivery of this coverage, its efficiency and fiscal and economic implications.  The document will also describe the alternative models of pension provision that exist in other relevant countries.  This consultation document will be available early next January. Responses to it will then be invited with a deadline for receipt of these likely to be the end of March 1997.</P>
    <P>Stage two of the initiative will then involve processing and analysis of the responses to the consultation document; reviewing critically selected pension models from other countries, relating these to Ireland and developing options in the Irish context; and preparation of a report including the formulation of recommendations on the actions that need to be taken to achieve a national pension system in line with the aim of the National Pensions Board as articulated in its final report.  The target date for the completion of this stage is next summer.</P>
    <P>This is an important time for pensions policy. We need to look comprehensively and very carefully, over a relatively short timeframe, at the present position.  We then need to make decisions and, most importantly, to carry those decisions through so that we face up to and deal with the medium and long-term issues so as to ensure that the living standards of future generations of pensioners are safeguarded.  This national pensions policy initiative is the first step to achieving this.</P>
    <P>The concerns raised by the Deputy in relation to the adequacy of pensions and their future provision will be considered in the national pensions policy initiative.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person who gave up work in 1988 to have a family and returned to the workforce in December 1994, and who now has health problems preventing her from working, is not entitled to any social welfare benefit on the basis of inadequate paid contributions for the previous four years in spite of the fact that she has sufficient credited contributions and having regard to the fact that her health problems are indirectly related to her having had a family.</Quest>

      <P>The contributory benefit schemes for persons who are unable to work because of illness are disability benefit and invalidity pension. Under social welfare legislation, to qualify for disability benefit a person must satisfy certain contribution conditions.  One of the conditions is that the person must have at least 13 paid contributions in a recent contribution year.  This <Col N="211" /> is to ensure that people claiming disability benefit have a recent attachment to the workforce. According to the records of my Department, the person concerned had three paid contributions in the 1994-95 contribution year and prior to that her last paid contributions were in 1987-88.</P>
      <P>To qualify for invalidity pension a person must be permanently incapable of work, have at least 260 paid contributions and 48 paid or credited in the last tax year before the date of claim.  The person concerned has a total of 103 paid contributions.  A person who does not satisfy the contribution conditions for social insurance payments may apply for a social assistance payment where they are in financial need.  The relevant schemes in this case would be either disability allowance, which is a social assistance payment in respect of long-term incapacity for work, or supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>Social insurance by definition includes features of State income maintenance schemes, based on the principle of solidarity.  The social insurance system as it has evolved in recent decades has a strong solidarity component.  The social insurance system is not however insurance in the fully commercial or actuarial sense.  The fact that an individual does not satisfy the qualifying conditions for a particular scheme does not mean that they should automatically receive a refund of their contributions.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>In relation to entry to the system at least ten years before pension age this condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961 and its objective is to link entitlement to pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All persons who enter social insurance for the first time after age 56 are entitled to a refund of the old age pension part of their contributions <Col N="212" /> provided that they do not qualify for such a pension either contributory or non-contributory.</P>
    <P>The yearly average condition gives rise to particular problems for people with gaps in their insurance records.  While a number of these problems have been addressed by my Department in recent years the National Pensions Board (NPB) report Developing the National Pension System recommended a <i>prorata</i> pension scheme, which, in its view, would resolve the problems arising from gaps in coverage in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>The NPB report recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured's lifetime, where, for example, an average of 45 or over, as against 48 at present, would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of ten to 14 contributions.  It also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased from 156, three years, to 520 contributions, ten years.  As such proposals could lead to a reduction in entitlement for future pensioners, when compared with present arrangements, they have to be evaluated very carefully.</P>
    <P>The report and the recommendations are at present being studied within the Department with a view to bringing forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report, taking account of the pensions funding issues.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he is examining in order to ensure that there is absolute transparency in the standards operated by life assurance companies and their agents in relation to the advertising of past performances, charges, fees and commissions; and his views on whether the absence of full disclosure has substantially eroded the confidence of the public in making such investments.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has been examining, in consultation with the life assurance industry and other interested parties, the nature and quality of information and advice required by the consumer in advance of completing a proposal for a life assurance policy to enable the policyholder to make a rational and fully informed investment decision.</P>
      <P>A particular problem in relation to life policies is that the proposer may not fully appreciate that these policies are intended as long-term investment commitments and that early surrender can result in returns less than the cumulative premium payments.  In recognition of that concern regulations are currently being drafted by my Department which will ensure that consumers are better apprised of the long-term nature of life policies and that the proposer will be given, in advance of the completion of the policy proposal, details of projected surrender values throughout the duration of the policy.  The regulations will also provide greater transparency in relation to charges, fees and commissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Security Industry Association in relation to the possible implications for the association of the proposed new working time Bill.  There have been a number of meetings and consultations with the two sides of the security industry at both ministerial and official level.</P>
      <P>The Bill which will implement the EU Directive on the organisation of working time has as its background concern the health and safety of employees and it is this concern which explains the provisions on minimum rest periods and the maximum weekly working time limit of 48 hours.</P>
      <P>The Bill builds in substantial flexibility while maintaining the fundamental commitment to safeguard the health and safety of workers.</P>
      <P>Article 6 of the directive provides that the average weekly working time of employees should not exceed 48 hours.  The directive allows for weekly working hours to be averaged over a period of six months for the security industry or, in particular circumstances, over a period of 12 months by agreement between the two sides of industry.</P>
      <P>I have given very careful consideration to the concerns of the security industry and other industries in the context of preparing this legislation which I hope to publish in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, this is a very unusual and complicated case which has been ongoing for some considerable period of time.</P>
      <P>To enable the Land Commission to divide a commonage the applicants must have an entitlement to shares in the fee simple. Unfortunately this is not the case in relation to the applicants concerned whose entitlement is limited to grazing and turbary rights.</P>
      <P>It would be relatively straightforward to divide the grazing rights among the applicants but their continuing preference is to be registered as owners of defined plots.  This requires the establishment of right to fee simple, a task which so far has proved impossible.</P>
      <P>The fee simple was held in trust up to the beginning of the century at which stage the trust lapsed.  This complicates the difficult legal arrangement in the process of being put in place to effect the division of these rights, so as to entitle the applicants to use defined plots.  Work in this regard is ongoing but given its unusual complexity it is not possible to say when this case will be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231, 233 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory power to issue drift, draft and other net licences for salmon fishing is exercised in their respective regions by the Regional Fisheries Boards under section 67 of the Fisheries Act, 1959 as amended by section 11 (4) of the Fisheries Act, 1980; and by the Foyle Fisheries Commission under sections 13 and 14 of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952 and sections 13 and 14 of the Foyle Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland), 1952.  I have no direct function in the issue of such licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria by which the boards must allocate net licences in all areas excluding the Kerry district, the Foyle area and the River Shannon tidal waters are set out in detail in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders, 1980 and 1982.  The criteria for the Kerry district are set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon by Drift Net (Kerry Fishery District) Order, 1982.  The conditions which apply to the allocation of drift net licences in the Foyle area are set out in the <Col N="233" /> Foyle Area (Control of Drift Net Fishing) Regulations, 1993.  The conditions applicable to the tidal waters in the River Shannon are set out in the River Shannon Tidal Waters (Issue of Fishing Licences) Regulations, 1935.  I am arranging for copies of the various orders and regulations to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Commercial salmon fishing licence fees are set strictly by reference to the instrument of capture <Col N="234" /> employed, rather than by the county or region. Different rates apply however in the Foyle area. The current rate of licence fee for each category is set out in table A.  The number of commercial licences issued last year by region is set out in Table B.  This is the best indication available of the number of fishermen engaged each year in commercial salmon fishing activity around the coast.</P>

      <P>Funding for renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet is provided under the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994 &mdash; 1999, with over £11 million of EU and Exchequer aid available to support total investment of some £31 million in the fleet over the period.  To date 131 modernisation projects have been approved for grant aid of over £4 million under the programme.</P>
      <P>The investment support strategy under the programme is designed to improve the efficiency and safety of the fleet while meeting mandatory EU fleet targets.  The good take-up to date of available funding is contributing to those objectives.  There has also been significant private investment in the Irish pelagic fleet in recent years which is now one of the most modern in the world.  A consultancy study is currently being undertaken to analyse, from all perspectives, the relative socio-economic and commercial merits of the introduction of new vessels into the whitefish fleet.  The outcome of this study will inform an assessment of future directions for fleet policy having regard to all relevant factors, including developments at EU level.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of the Irish Salmon Growers' Association that the proposed Fisheries Amendment Bill be published in order to allow as quickly as possible for the development of this sustainable, labour intensive and environmentally friendly industry, to restore the confidence of fish farmers and local communities in the Government's licensing procedure and to recognise the strides made at all levels of fish farming in improving efficiency, husbandry, marketing and processing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The views of the Irish Salmon Growers' Association and other organisations and groups on the need for a new legislative framework for the aquaculture industry are well understood and well known.</P>
      <P>The Government authorised the drafting of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill last May.  Work on the final draft of the Bill is almost complete.</P>
      <P>My Department is in regular touch with the ISGA in the matter and the objective is to have the Bill published and introduced as early as possible during the current Dáil session.</P>
