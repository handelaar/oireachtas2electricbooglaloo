      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy O'Donnell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that we suspend Standing Orders of the Dáil to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the release and rearrest of 15 dangerous prisoners last night and the role the Department of Justice played in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 2, the European Parliament Elections Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 10, statements on Shaping our Future: A Strategy for Enterprise in Ireland in the 21st Century, resumed; and statements concerning the Special Criminal Court following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the statements concerning the Special Criminal Court, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: statements which shall be confined to the Minister for Justice and to the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; following statements the Minister for Justice shall take questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Taoiseach's office communicated with me this morning about the statements and I appreciate that.  I am satisfied we will have an opportunity to debate that matter.  As I understand it, only the Minister for Justice will be involved in the statements.  In view of the saga that took place overnight it seems the Government lacks commitment to the criminal justice system and that there is no co-ordination on this matter. There is a serious breakdown in communications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a decision was made by the Cabinet, over which the Taoiseach presides, to allow the judge involved to delist. Once such a decision is made the Minister for Justice informs the relevant judge or at least the head of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not be here for the debate.  The Special Criminal Court operated for four months with a judge who was not entitled to be there even though a decision was made by the Cabinet on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not be here to answer the questions.  Since the Special Criminal Court is an important court why was the decision, made by the Cabinet, not communicated to the judge, the court or the head of the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with an agreement reached with the Deputy's party, the Minister for Justice will report to the House on that matter this afternoon.  The Deputy's party agreed to the procedure we are following in preparing and presenting to the House a timely and full report on this serious matter.  There is no delay in presenting the report, it will be presented this afternoon.  Deputy Ahern who may or may <Col N="479" /> not speak in the debate will certainly have an opportunity to put the questions he has raised to the Minister who will answer them on behalf of the Government.  That is a reasonable approach.</P>

      <P>On a point of order relating to statements on the Special Criminal Court, I consulted Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip and Deputy O'Donnell, the Progressive Democrats Chief Whip.  I put the arrangements for the statements and question and answer session to them and having consulted their parties, both agreed to those arrangements without reservation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are happy there will be statements this afternoon but they are on maladministration in the Department of Justice, not about the Special Criminal Court.  In view of the Government's statement last year that it was considering the report of Mrs. Justice Denham recommending the appointment of an independent commission to administer our court system, has the Government concluded its deliberations on this?  Will a commission, independent of the Department of Justice, be established to administer the courts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach replies, is the proposal for dealing with statements on the Special Criminal Court agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has accepted in principle the recommendations for court reform presented by the committee chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham.  A further report has been commissioned by that committee which is necessary to fill in the details on how those recommendations will be implemented in practice.  That report is awaited and court reform is being treated as a high priority.  It should not be suggested that there is an inference of responsibility in the courts in this matter.  I answered the Deputy's question but there is no connection between what we are to explain later through the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Government and the issues in the excellent report of Mrs. Justice Denham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Programme for Government there is a commitment to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  As that legislation has not been brought before the <Col N="481" /> House is it still the position that a Minister is responsible for all the activities in his or her Department and must be accountable for those to the House and the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the Ministers and Secretaries Bill is before the House.  Proposals are being put by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs which are being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is thinking of the Compellability of Witnesses Bill, 1996.  The Ministers and Secretaries Bill has not been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I was mistaken. That Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation. The heads of the Bill have been approved and it is being drafted.  I answered questions in the House on this a week or two ago when I indicated it is our intention to present the Bill as quickly as possible.  It is a high priority and I hope it is enacted in the first half of next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to reflect back to two years ago when he was in Opposition. As head of Government he now presides over this terrible shambles.  Does he &mdash; and in particular the Minister for Justice &mdash; not take responsibility for this shambles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to the statements this afternoon but when the Minister for Justice is dealing with this matter she might also deal with the Duncan case which is still outstanding.  That is the case of the criminal justice system losing important warrants from this jurisdiction and the UK in a shredder.  We still await the report of the investigation into that and it should be included in today's debate.</P>

      <P>In relation to the crisis relating to people with a mental handicap, is the Taoiseach satisfied with the funding of 21 places for 414 people without residential placement?  This is a vulnerable group of people.</P>

      <P>I have not scrutinised interests but if I misrepresented the Deputy's position it was in making the point that it was important in the debate on defamation to draw attention to the fact that he does interesting work for the Independent Newspaper Group.  He would have a certain sympathy for the interests of the group. That was the point which I was drawing to attention.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first Act relating to elections to the European Assembly, as it was then known, was enacted in 1977.  In the 20 years since, we have had four elections to the Parliament and numerous amendments to the law, some significant and some minor.  At present a person inquiring about European electoral law would need to refer to six separate statutes as well as regulations.  With the next elections to the Parliament due in 1999, the time is opportune to update the law and bring the entire electoral code for the European Parliament within the pages of a single document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will consolidate and amend the domestic law relating to European Parliament elections.  It will set out a comprehensive <Col N="485" /> procedure for conducting an election, from the appointment of the polling day to taking the poll, counting the votes, questioning the result and filling casual vacancies.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a continuation of the ongoing programme of electoral law reform.  Dáil, Presidential and local electoral codes have been consolidated and updated since 1992 together with the referendum code.  Given the special importance of electoral law and its direct relevance to each citizen, making the law more accessible and comprehensible to all is a necessary and desirable objective.</P>
    <P>Unlike other electoral codes, there are no specific constitutional provisions relating to European elections.  However, the European Community in a decision of 1976 laid down certain principles relating to the holding of direct elections to the European Parliament which have direct application in all member states.  It may be useful for the House if I detail the main principles still in force.</P>
    <P>Representatives to the Assembly, re-named the Parliament in 1987, are elected for a term of five years, each outgoing Parliament remaining in office until the first sitting of its successor.  It is incompatible with membership of the Parliament to be a member of, or employed by, certain EU institutions or to be a member of the Government of a member state.  Further incompatibilities may be laid down in national law.  Membership of the Parliament is not incompatible with membership of a national parliament.  No one may vote more than once in an election of representatives.  The poll must be taken throughout the Union in the same Thursday to Sunday period in June every five years.  Should it prove impossible to hold the election during this period, another period not more than one month before or after may be selected.  The counting of votes may not begin until after the close of poll in the member state whose electors are last to vote.  The Parliament verifies the credentials of representatives, taking note of the results declared officially by each member state.  It is empowered to rule on any disputes arising out of the provisions of the Community Act but not on disputes arising out of national provisions.  Each member state must lay down appropriate procedures for filling any seat which falls vacant during the five-year term of office of the Parliament.  Pending the entry into force of a uniform electoral procedure to the Parliament, and subject to the other provisions of the Community Act, the electoral procedure is to be governed in each member state by its national provisions.</P>
    <P>Article 138 (3) of the European Treaty, as amended by the Maastricht Treaty, provides for elections to the Parliament to be conducted in accordance with a uniform procedure in all member states on the basis of proposals drawn up by the Parliament.  No such procedure has been introduced to date.  This issue has arisen in the negotiations leading up to the Intergovernmental <Col N="486" /> Conference but it cannot be said at this stage whether such a procedure will be in place for the next elections due in 1999.  Nor is it certain that such a procedure would necessarily involve changing our system.  A uniform procedure is likely to involve some kind of proportional representation system, but the Treaty would not appear to rule out some discretion regarding the detail of the PR system to be adopted by individual member states.  The Bill, therefore, provides for our existing PR-STV electoral system.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty inserted a provision in the European Treaty that citizens of the Union have the right to vote and stand as candidates at European elections in their member state of residence.  The detailed arrangements for the exercise of these rights were set out in a 1993 Council Directive which was transposed into Irish law by the European Parliament Elections (Voting and Candidature) Regulations, 1994.  The provision of these regulations are incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Resident EU citizens have had the right to vote at European elections in Ireland since the first direct elections in 1979.  Under the 1993 directive, European electors included on the register for the 1994 elections are exempt from the new administrative requirements imposed by the directive.  Furthermore, in recognition of the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom extend reciprocal voting rights to each other's citizens at national Parliament elections, there is a derogation from the directive for Irish citizens living in the UK and British citizens living in Ireland.  The major change arising from the directive was the extension to resident EU citizens of the right to stand for election in Ireland to the European Parliament.  Overall, the directive has not had a significant impact on our registration and electoral arrangements and there is no indication that the review of the directive, to be undertaken before the next elections in 1999, will require any significant change in Irish procedures.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is essentially a consolidation measure, designed to restate existing law in a more convenient form and in a clearer idiom, it also contains a number of changes to bring the provisions into line with corresponding provisions in Dáil electoral law.  I will now detail the principal changes.</P>
    <P>The Bill omits the former provision for the office of chief returning officer and transfers the functions to the Clerk of the Dáil and to the Minister.  Originally this office was envisaged as the link at national level between the Parliament and the individual constituencies.  In practice, communication with the Parliament has tended to be via the Dáil, and the chief returning officer's role has consisted mainly of furnishing a return of representatives elected in such constituencies and the retention of election documents.  The Bill assigns these functions to the Clerk of the Dáil, who already has a substantive role in relation to <Col N="487" /> the filling of casual vacancies.  Other aspects of the chief returning officer's role are assigned by the Bill to the Minister, for example, certifying that Irish citizens wishing to stand for election in another member state are not disqualified under Irish law.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to questioning an election by way of petition is being brought into line with petition procedures in other electoral codes.  In the existing European code, a petition must be presented within 28 days of the declaration of the result.  The Bill provides that a petition may only be presented with the leave of the High Court which must be sought within seven days of the declaration of the result.  Furthermore, the petition itself must be presented within three days of the grant of leave by the court.  The objective of these changes is to provide an adequate opportunity for challenging the result of an election while, at the same time, limiting the period during which there may be any uncertainty about the election result.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, a person who holds office as Attorney General cannot stand for election to the European Parliament without resigning from that office.  This is in contrast to the position of Ministers of State who may stand for election while retaining their positions.  In view of the fact that the Attorney General is not a member of the Government, there is no justification for treating the two types of office holder differently.  The Bill will bring the post of Attorney General into line with that of a Minister of State by permitting the office holder to stand for election while providing that, if elected to the Parliament, he or she will automatically cease to hold the office of Attorney General.  This amendment is proposed solely to eliminate an existing legal anomaly, and not at the behest of the present distinguished holder of the office of the Attorney General or because he has indicated any intention of standing for election to the Parliament in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill effects a number of other changes which, while minor in themselves, together constitute worthwhile improvements in the European Parliament election code.  Examples of the kind of change involved include dropping the requirement of ministerial consent for the appointment of deputy local returning officers and making provision for the possibility &mdash; admittedly very remote &mdash; that insufficient candidates might be nominated to fill all the seats for a constituency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated above, the Bill includes changes to bring the European Parliament election code into line, as far as practicable, with the Dáil election code.  These changes include refunding the deposit to candidates whose votes exceed one-quarter of the quota, rather than one-third as at present.  The ballot paper is being brought into line with the <Col N="488" /> Dáil ballot paper.  It will permit references to a candidate's European political grouping and to the relevant replacement candidates list.  The period for retention of election documents is being reduced from 12 to six months and monetary penalties are being increased in line with similar penalties in the Dáil election code.</P>
      <P>The Bill re-enacts the existing European Parliament constituencies, each with the same number of seats recommended by an independent commission and used for the 1994 elections.  These constituencies are four seaters in Dublin city and county, in the rest of Leinster and in Munster, and a three seater in Connacht/Ulster.  Under the terms of the Electoral Bill, 1994, an independent commission would be established on the publication of the final results of each census with the task of making a report within six months on the formation of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies.  The terms of reference for the commission set out in that Bill are essentially the same as those given to previous non-statutory commissions.  The present Bill provides that the Minister must submit proposals to the Oireachtas for a review of European constituencies by 1 December 2003 at the latest, and at least once every ten years thereafter.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains 22 sections and four schedules.  The First Schedule lists the enactments repealed and the regulations revoked by the Bill. The Second Schedule comprises 150 detailed rules dealing with all aspects of the elections.  The Third Schedule defines the four European constituencies and the Fourth Schedule specifies the format of the ballot paper.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the main provisions in the sections of the Bill.  Sections 1 to 5 contain the usual technical provisions relating to short title, commencement, definitions, power to make regulations, expenses of the Minister and repeal of enactments.  Section 6 of the Bill implements the provisions of a 1993 Council Directive in relation to the registration as European electors of nationals of other member states ordinarily resident in the State.  The section provides that such nationals must apply to be registered and furnish a statutory declaration in support of their application.  It also provides for information exchange between member states in relation to electors so registered, with a view to preventing double voting.  In accordance with the provisions of the directive, these requirements will not apply to European Union citizens registered as European electors in the 1994-5 register of electors or to British citizens living in the State.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides that elections to the Parliament will be held according to the principle of proportional representation, each elector having a single transferable vote.  Voting will be by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>Section 8 provides that every person whose name is on the register of European electors in a constituency will be entitled to vote at an election to the Parliament in that constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> Section 9 specifies that electors may vote in person at the polling station, by post or, in the case of electors with disabilities, by means of special arrangement for voting at home.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the Minister to fix the polling day, the hours of polling and the date and time for the commencement of the count.</P>
    <P>Section 11 restates the law in relation to eligibility for election to and membership of the Parliament.  It also implements the provisions of the 1993 Council Directive in relation to nationals of other member states ordinarily resident in the State standing for election to the Parliament here. Thus, it provides that a person who has reached 21 years of age and is either an Irish citizen or a national of another member state ordinarily resident in the State is eligible to stand for election to the Parliament, to be nominated as a replacement candidate and to be a member of the Parliament.  However, a person is not eligible if subject to certain disqualifications applicable to members of the Dáil.  It follows that a person is disqualified if a member of the Garda Síochána or a whole-time member of the Defence Forces or a civil servant whose terms of employment do not expressly permit membership of the Parliament.  Persons of unsound mind, undischarged bankrupts and persons undergoing prison sentences exceeding six months are also disqualified.  Judges and the Comptroller and Auditor General are disqualified, unless they resign their positions.  Other persons disqualified are Irish citizens standing for election in another member state and nationals of other member states deprived of the right to stand for election in their home member state.</P>
    <P>Section 11 also provides that, if elected to the Parliament, the Attorney General, the chairman and deputy chairman of the Dáil or Seanad and Ministers of State cease to hold those offices. Furthermore, if a member of the Parliament becomes subject to any of the above disqualifications or becomes a holder of any of the above offices, he or she thereupon ceases to be a member of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>In compliance with the 1993 Council Directive, section 11 also provides for the issue of an attestation by the Minister that an Irish citizen living in a member state other than the UK who proposes to stand for election in that State has not been deprived of the right to stand for election in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under section 12, a person may nominate himself or herself as a candidate at the Parliament election or may, with his or her consent, be nominated by a European elector for the constituency concerned.  The section also provides that each registered political party and each non party candidate in a constituency may nominate one or more replacement candidates for the purpose of filling vacancies in the membership of the Parliament for that constituency.</P>
    <P>Section 13 stipulates that a deposit of £1,000 must be lodged by or on behalf of each candidate <Col N="490" /> before the close of nominations.  This is the same as at present.</P>
    <P>Section 14 applies the provisions in the Second Schedule to the conduct of European elections. These relate to the nomination of candidates, taking the poll, counting the votes, electoral offences, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 15 and the Third Schedule prescribe the constituencies for the European elections. The section also provides for submission of proposals to the Oireachtas for a review of European Parliament constituencies.  This must be done by the Minister for the Environment by 1 December, 2003 and at least once every ten years thereafter.  The Minister must take account of any report of a statutory commission recommending the revision of European constituencies.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that there will be a returning officer for each European constituency appointed by the Minister from among the local returning officers in each constituency.  The returning officers is responsible for functions which must be discharged centrally in each constituency, for example, the receipt of nominations, counting the votes and declaring the results of the election.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that there shall be a local returning officer for each county or county borough contained in the constituency.  The local returning officers are the city and county sheriffs in the case of Dublin and Cork and the county registrars in every other case.  The local returning officer is responsible for taking the poll and verifying the ballot paper accounts in the county or county borough and making all the arrangements necessary for this purpose, for example, providing polling stations and appointing presiding officers.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the payment by the Minister for Finance from the Central Fund of the reasonable election expenses of returning officers and local returning officers.  It clarifies the position that any damages and costs incurred by returning officers or local returning officers in court proceedings (including personal injury cases) shall be paid from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the filling of casual vacancies in Ireland's representation in the Parliament in accordance with Part 13 of the Second Schedule.  A vacancy is filled by the replacement candidate whose name stands highest on the replacement candidate list of the political party or the non-party candidate concerned.  A replacement candidate will not be eligible to fill a casual vacancy if he or she is already a member of the Parliament, is not eligible to be elected, is not willing to serve as a member or, in the case of a party list, is no longer a member of the party concerned.  If no replacement candidates list has been presented or the relevant list is exhausted, the Dáil may select a replacement from another replacement candidates list presented for the constituency concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Section 20 provides that ballot papers and other confidential documents relating to a European election may be inspected only under an order of the High Court.  Such an order may be made only where the documents are required for the purposes of an election petition or for the prosecution of electoral offences.</P>
    <P>Section 21 and Part 15 of the Second Schedule specify the procedure for questioning a European election by way of petition to the High Court. Leave of the High Court to present a petition must be sought within seven days of the declaration of the election result.  The Director of Public Prosecutions and any person registered as a European elector may apply for leave to present an election petition.  The petition must be presented within three days of the grant of leave by the court and must be accompanied by a security for costs of £5,000 unless the court sees fit to reduce the security.  The grounds of petition are limited to specific factors likely to have affected the result of the election.  These are: want of eligibility of candidates, electoral offences, obstruction of the election, irregularity or failure to conduct the election in accordance with law. The court will, if possible, determine the result of the election and, if it cannot do so, will declare whole or part of the election void, giving its reasons.  Where the court declares that the whole or part of the election is void, a fresh election must be held unless a general election of representatives to the Parliament is due within six months.  The decision of the High Court on a petition is final, subject only to appeal to the Supreme Court on a question of law.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that no person may be required in any legal proceedings to state how he or she voted.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule contains 16 parts, comprising 150 detailed rules for the conduct of the European Parliament elections, for filling casual vacancies and for dealing with election petitions.  The rules are listed on pages 16 to 22 of the Bill and are summarised in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a solid and worthwhile piece of consolidation law, incorporating a number of changes designed largely to harmonise with the up-to-date Dáil election procedures.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I welcome the thrust of this Bill.  It is consolidation legislation and is probably long overdue.  The first Act relating to elections to the European Assembly was enacted in 1977 and there have been a number of Acts since then. Anything that makes the electoral system clearer and brings it closer to the citizens is a good thing. It is desirable that the rules and regulations for different elections be standardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that this Bill should be brought forward during our Presidency of the EU.  It removes the differences in our legislation <Col N="492" /> between domestic elections and elections to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The problem of getting people interested in the European Parliament, and of getting them sufficiently interested to vote in such elections, is growing and needs to be addressed.  In a small way the Bill addresses that issue and helps to standardise procedures.  The provisions regarding the candidate's deposit, eligibility to qualify as a candidate, ballot paper formats, retention of election documents and so on which have been brought into line with the Dáil elections make for a uniform and a more easily understandable democratic system for all our citizens.  That is important because in the past we have heard of a democratic deficit in the EU generally.  The Parliament is probably the one body we can use to reduce the democratic imbalance and this Bill will go a small way towards doing that.</P>
    <P>The Parliament is accountable.  The Commission is not accountable in the European Union in the same way.  As the Government is now painfully learning, public representatives and institutions which acquire a veil of secrecy automatically undermine public support and confidence in the organisation whether of Government or Parliament.  In the interests of our country we, as parliamentarians, must highlight the potential role of the European Parliament because it remains remote and unfamiliar to the majority of the European electorate.  The reduced number of people who participate in European elections is a symptom of that.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the importance of the European Parliament in redressing the democratic deficit in European institutions generally most of the parliament's reports and resolutions are prepared by one of its 20 committees.  These are then debated and adopted when the Parliament meets one week per month in Strasbourg.  In general the committees meet in Brussels and the secretariat is based in Luxembourg.  The perception of citizens all over Europe looking at this structure of separation &mdash; where meetings are held in one place and the secretariat is in another &mdash; is one of disorganised and expensive public representation.  The institution that makes some decisions on behalf of the citizens of Europe cannot make a decision on where its headquarters will be based.  That is a long-standing debate within the European Union and is one that should be finalised without delay. Is it any wonder citizens are cynical about what the Parliament might or might not decide when they are still wandering around Europe?</P>
    <P>Unlike other areas of Community law where the Commission has the right of initiative in proposing reform, the European Parliament has the right to decide on the electoral system.  It is time the Parliament made that decision in relation to a common electoral system for European Union elections.  A uniform electoral system would be the political equivalent of monetary union which we are facing into in the next few years.  A unified system would have the <Col N="493" /> effect of bringing people together.  The system does not have to be exactly the same but the overall electoral system should be the same no matter in what country the election takes place. A system based on proportional representation but incorporating a list system is probably the one that would be generally accepted throughout Europe and would be the most palatable not only for the citizens of Europe but for those who contest the elections.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Attorney General in the event of his being elected to the Parliament.  I did not think the Attorney General, worthy as he is, would be interested in the European Parliament.  After he has completed his duty and taken a cut in salary in the public service as Attorney General, he would find it more lucrative to go back to the Bar.  However, the move in the Bill is a good one.  In passing we should pay tribute, even though they may not have been the most popular people in Government in the past ten or 12 years, to those who accepted positions as Attorneys General.  In general, they accept such positions in the interest of the public service and do a good job for less pay than they would earn in the private sector.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the contentious issue of the dual mandate.  There are Members on the Government side, not in the Minister's party, who are more familiar with this than we are.  For example, the Minister for Social Welfare, who knows all about double representation, spent some time in this House at it.  We should examine the question of the dual mandate.  Ministers and Ministers of State automatically lose their positions if they successfully contest a European election.  While membership of a national Parliament is not incompatible with membership of the European Parliament, we should look at a change which would allow Members of this Parliament stand for election to the European Parliament but they would have to decide which body they wish to be a Member of no later than the next election to either body.  They should not be able to retain the dual mandate indefinitely. Perhaps the Minister could table some amendments to that effect.</P>
    <P>In regard to the section which proposes to omit the position of chief returning officer and give the job to the Clerk of the Dáil and the Minister in certain cases, I note what the Minister said but I have reservations about it.  Other Members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas might have similar reservations.  When I was Government Whip I had great difficulty trying to arrange accommodation for Deputies.  Deputy Quill could say more about that because her party's offices are on the other side of Kildare Street and they have been trying for some time to get accommodation in the Leinster House complex. Accommodation and space are very scarce here and I have reservations about the logistics of retaining ballot papers for the European elections in Leinster House close to the office of the Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> I also have reservations, to which I will return on Committee Stage, about the alleged close working relationship between the Dáil and the European Parliament which the Minister said will allow for a smooth transfer.  I do not think there are any substantive links between the European Parliament and the Dáil which would lead to a smooth transfer.  I will elaborate on Committee Stage as to why that might not be a good idea.</P>
    <P>The European elections are not covered by our Constitution but Dáil and Seanad elections are. This Bill gives the Minister an opportunity to try an experiment in relation to electoral reform. There has been a great deal of talk over the last two or three months about the number of long serving senior Members who are retiring and there has been a fair amount of analysis of it in the newspapers.  I have often criticised newspapers and other media but most of the articles written about this matter have been fair and reasonably balanced.  Newspapers, in particular, have made a reasonable effort to look at the other side of the story in relation to the workload of TDs and Senators.  We are all familiar with the caricature which is dragged out <i>ad nauseam</i> that we only work for 30 weeks or have six months holidays.  However, the media have made a reasonable effort to understand the reasons so many Members are retiring from the House and to analyse the amount of work done by TDs.</P>
    <P>However, there has not been much focus on the electoral system and the huge burden which it places on Members of the House.  The electoral system has to be changed as we approach the 21st century.  All sides of the House talk at various times about the irrelevance of the House, although one talks more about that when one is in Opposition.  However, any group of TDs speaking in general terms about their role and that of Parliament, which is to scrutinise the actions of Government and to prepare and examine legislation, would say the electoral system mitigates against a good form of parliamentary democracy.  Our electoral system works against the best interests of Members of Parliament and the public who elect us to scrutinise the actions of Government and to ensure Government is representative of the people.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group has examined this matter but has fudged the issue to a certain extent.  It is time to change our electoral system. We should retain proportional representation, which is a very important element mentioned in the Constitution.  We should ask the people to endorse single seat constituencies, proportional representation and a list system element which would allow for an effective Parliament.  Under such a system not every Member would be elected from a list decided on by the party; the people would have to decide on a substantial proportion of Members.  However, a list system element would allow people with particular expertise to be Members, which would improve <Col N="495" /> standards in the House.  Our parliamentary assembly is based on the Westminster model which was based, in turn, on a colonial system with a mother Parliament and various colonies. In the 1920s we modelled ourselves on that system which should have been done away with in the last century.  We are almost into the next century and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>There has always been a fear that smaller parties would suffer under such a system. However, in the last seven or eight by-elections &mdash; which are, in effect, single seat PR elections &mdash; candidates from smaller parties and independent candidates were generally returned.  Given that 60 per cent of the electorate say they are not aligned to any party, smaller parties will not lose out under such a system.  People elect candidates on the basis of their policies and not because of what parties stood for in the 1920s or 1930s.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group looked at the systems in operation in Germany, France and New Zealand.  When it applied the list system or a combination of the list system plus direct elections it found that the results in terms of the number of seats for each of the parties, even the smaller ones, was almost the same as those in the elections held over the past 20 or 30 years.  We should give serious consideration to the adoption of one of these systems.  European Parliament and local elections provide an ideal opportunity to experiment with these systems to see whether they would work here.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given to the level of public interest in the role of the European Parliament.  The average turnout in European elections throughout Europe declined from 62.5 per cent in 1979 to 57 per cent in 1989.  The turnout in each country has varied considerably and it is heartening to note that there was an increase in the turnout in Ireland in the 1989 elections.  The European Parliament must do more to improve its image and ensure that more information is given to the public.  This needs to be done urgently as otherwise there will be an increasing lack of interest in the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the independent commission, for which provision is made in the Electoral Bill, 1994.  This Bill has got bogged down for one reason or another and if I was cynical I would say it is because Fine Gael wants to complete its fund-raising before it is implemented.  While the McKenna judgment has given rise to problems, it does not affect the provisions dealing with the independent commission.  There is absolutely no excuse for the delay in setting up the independent commission. Will the Minister bring the sections on the independent commission before the House so that they can be discussed and the commission can be set up without delay?  Changes are needed and it is important that the setting up of the independent commission is not delayed indefinitely because of the McKenna judgment or other reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> Under section 15 the Minister must take account of the independent commission.  It is important that the commission and its members are independent.  The commission must be allowed to make its report, which must be implemented.  There is no point in setting up independent commissions if Ministers can change them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I do not anticipate that there will be many Committee Stage amendments, but I put down a marker on the section dealing with the chief returning officer and his functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It proposes minor electoral reform and deserves to be supported.  The Bill seeks to harmonise electoral systems between member states and it is important that this is done.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the enactment of the legislation, but I confess I found it extremely difficult to be enthusiastic about its content.  The reality is that this House has no influence on the European Parliament.  The IFA has more influence in Europe than this sovereign elected Parliament, while county councils have more and better access to the Parliament and more clout in Brussels.  I very much wish we were debating major reforming legislation on the workings of the European Parliament, the relationships which should exist between the Parliament and national parliaments and the relationship between parliaments, the Commission and the Council of Ministers.  That is the type of debate about which I could be enthusiastic and it is a pity we are not having it today.</P>
      <P>This House does not have an input to the formulation of EU directives.  Draft directives are not considered by this House or any of its committees; rather they are presented to us in final form and we have to fit them into Irish law, regardless of whether they suit us.  This is a major element of the overall democratic deficit to which we frequently refer but which we do not seem to be able to confront or tackle.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to establish what is discussed by our representatives on the Council of Ministers as there is no consultation with this House either before or after meetings.  I am not exaggerating when I say that this House might as well not exist in so far as the European Parliament is concerned.  This is a great pity and it is a matter which should be addressed.</P>
      <P>There should be major structural reform of all institutions, including not only this Parliament but local government.  This issue will have to be confronted by a future Government because it will not be confronted by the Government at this stage of its lifetime when we are approaching an election.  The kind of reforms that cry out for implementation ought to be undertaken in the first year of a new Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elections in the USA this week had no meaning for almost 50 per cent of the electorate, who did not vote.  This should be a warning to us <Col N="497" /> because the attitude it reveals is beginning to occur in other western democracies, including ours.  Citizens are beginning to lose interest in and contact with their democratic institutions.  They are starting to believe such institutions do not represent them or their interests and, as such, have no meaning for them.</P>
    <P>We are less than four years away from the turn of the century.  This is the first century in which we had our own national institutions, our own Free State, our own Republic.  There was much enthusiasm and idealism in the early days of our freedom.  This is now beginning to give way to cynicism.  One of the consequences is that fewer people vote at elections.  An even greater number of people may stay away from the polls at the next election.</P>
    <P>We must confront this development.  However, we can only curb it if we make our institutions more responsive to people's needs and interests and more relevant and immediate to the issues of the day.  The older institutions have become big and bloated and are slow to respond.  The Government is one of the biggest since the foundation of the State.  In addition to the 15 Cabinet Ministers there are 17 Ministers of State, each with a programme manager, civil servants and other such staff who have crept into politics in recent times.</P>
    <P>These developments have not made Government more responsive to the needs of the people, as the evidence indicates.  For example, the tribunal of inquiry into the hepatitis C scandal, one of the biggest scandals of my lifetime in politics, would not have been established if Mrs. McCole had not died.  It only happened as a reaction to that event, not as a point of policy or principle.  Similarly, the bail referendum would not have been organised had Veronica Guerin not been murdered, and the food advisory board was only established because of the Government's reaction to events.  It is unlikely that the board would have been established if Russia had not put a partial ban on our beef.  My party argued for its establishment last March.</P>
    <P>Smaller, not bigger, Government is better Government.  There are a number of bloated institutions, both here and in the EU, which must be tackled in a systematic way.  We need to fit our institutions into the times in which we live. Deputy Dempsey correctly stated that we inherited a 19th century system from the British. However, we have failed to reform and adapt it to the conditions of the modern world of rapid communication, advanced technology and growing, and in many cases harrowing, social problems.</P>
    <P>Adapting our institutions to meet these challenges will only happen if we institute root and branch reform of each of them, including the relationship that exists between them at EU, national and local level.  Ultimately, their purpose is to serve our citizens and the best interests of <Col N="498" /> democracy.  They are not doing this satisfactorily at present.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament is far removed from the interests or concern of the normal citizen.  It can only be made more meaningful if the national Parliament can forge better and closer links with it.  This is the kind of reform we should debate this morning.  I was an enthusiastic European in the early days when I believed democracy would work upwards and downwards and that we would work towards a major root and branch reform of local government.  This has not happened.</P>
    <P>We have talked about local government reform.  All parties, including mine, have developed policy priorities but we have failed to introduce and implement them.  There is great potential here to create a genuine democracy.  We must start from the ground up and devolve real powers to local government.  In addition, we must give local government function and control of its finances.  The two must go side by side because it is pointless to have function if there is no finance. This will not be easy because any change in taxation brings electoral risks.  People grumble about the current system of taxation, yet often the public does not accept change.</P>
    <P>However, public acceptance could be obtained if we demonstrated that we were changing the taxation and funding base of local government in the context of genuine local government reform. We would get much more public support if we demonstrated that it would get value for the money and taxation it provides.  The longer we delay this type of comprehensive root and branch reform of our institutions, the more we run the risk of people being cynical about politicians and fewer people voting at election time.  We should not run that risk any longer.</P>
    <P>We are close to the turn of the century.  Local government will be 100 years old next year and it would be a suitable time to put in place a proper system of local government under which we would be willing to devolve some of our powers to locally elected representatives who function at local level.  Democracy has been starved in many ways.  City mayors should be elected by the people.  City and county managers should also be elected by the people with a fixed term of office. That would greatly reinforce democracy.</P>
    <P>The Government should proceed apace with the reform I have sought this morning.  Even if it cannot pursue it to finality in its time in office, it should at least try to get something off the ground and cease publishing reams of reports so that in a few years' time we will have nourished our starving democratic institutions and have put in place a workable system between members of the European Parliament, the national Parliament, of which I am proud to be a Member, and local authorities.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Dempsey's comments on our electoral system and the type of candidates who are prepared to put themselves forward for politics.  It is regrettable that <Col N="499" /> increasingly large numbers of young people do not consider politics an attractive option.  They see the lifestyles politicians lead and the return they get for their heavy workloads and decide it is not the type of life they want to lead.  When I was younger people regarded it a great privilege to serve their country as politicians.  That attitude has changed because young people believe there are better ways of serving their country.  This is true, in particular, of women involved in community and family support groups who do practical worthwhile work which makes a long-term difference to the families in their communities.  They find this type of work much more fulfilling and would not dream of offering themselves for election.  This is how democracy stands near the end of the century.  We should endeavour to get all-party support for remedying the matters I outlined.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage my party tabling a substantial number of amendments on Committee Stage because the Bill achieves what it set out to address.  It is vague, however, on the question of the dual mandate.  I believe it is accepted by all parties that those who are members of this House and the European Parliament should be required to relinquish one of those seats at the next election.  They should not continue to hold a dual mandate.  If a European election is held mid term they should be encouraged to make a choice one way or the other at the next general election.  No man can serve two masters.  It is not possible to serve both Parliaments in a satisfactory manner. This matter should have been dealt with more fully in the Bill and I may table an amendment in that regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and Deputy Dempsey referred to the machinery involved in holding elections.  I do not find fault with anything proposed under that heading in the Bill.  The counting system is cumbersome and proportional representation means it takes a long time to count votes.  I pay tribute to the staff who carry out that tedious job.  As recounts demonstrate, counting is always done in a painstaking manner.  When a recount takes place there is generally little difference between the first and second counts.  It is unacceptable that if we hold European elections mid week we must wait until the elections are held in other member states, two or three days later, before publishing the results. While I do not have a prescription for remedying the problem the Minister should examine how we could synchronise our polling day for European elections with that in other member states.  It is extremely frustrating to know the results, but not be able to announce them until the elections are held in other member states.</P>
    <P>We should find out if there is consensus for holding elections on a Sunday and if it would mean a higher poll, we should consider holding them on that day.  My party supports the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the question of why it was necessary to introduce the Bill.  It consolidates existing legislation, which Members on all sides support.  Members have made some thoughtful contributions.  I do not disagree with much of what Deputy Dempsey said, particularly in regard to examining the question of the dual mandate.  However, it was unfair of him to single out the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, in terms of the dual mandate.  He gave up his seat in the European Parliament when it was possible for him to continue to hold it, unlike some members of Fianna Fáil who continue to hold dual mandates. Deputy Quill also mentioned this matter.  When a member of her party resigned the dual mandate, the party lost a seat at the subsequent by-election.</P>
      <P>However, if we agree on one matter, it is that it is almost impossible to get elected to the European Parliament unless one has, in advance, an excellent forum to put one's name before the people.  This Parliament is probably one such institution.  I agree that once a person is elected to either body they should decide at the next available opportunity, probably the next election to either body, where their loyalty lies.  It is not possible to serve two masters properly and adequately.  It is inappropriate that salaries are paid for two positions when it is not possible to carry out both adequately at the same time.  We often criticise various systems in the United Kingdom but it decided it was inappropriate to pay double salaries to people who hold dual positions.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses some of the fundamental problems in terms of trying to bring together existing legislation.  It also addresses the position of people who may be eligible to contest elections.  It is appropriate that the legislation states that holding the office of the Attorney General will not preclude somebody from offering himself or herself for election.  The basic point in any democracy is that if one has a view, one should present oneself to the people for election and allow them to express an opinion.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the electoral process is not covered in the Bill.  Some of Deputy Dempsey's views in that regard are interesting and worthy of consideration but they would involve constitutional amendments.  Deputy Quill made an important point that she and many other Deputies feel there is a democratic deficit at national level between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament at national level and the European institutions, including the Commission and the Council of Ministers.  Many Members feel they are removed from these bodies and this creates a democratic deficit.  If Deputies hold this view, we should understand the frustration at times of ordinary citizens about how far they are removed except when a decision is made which affects their livelihood or future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> Deputy Quill and others should examine a report published by the Joint Committee on European Affairs which was laid before the House last June.  It identified this problem and suggested solutions to it.  Deputy Quill obviously has not read the report &mdash; I do not expect Members to read everything which is placed in their pigeon holes &mdash; but it identified some areas which the committee considered were of relevance to the Oireachtas in general.  For example, section 2 of the report mentions that the Joint Committee on European Affairs represents the Dáil and comprises members of all parties.  It states that Members of the European Parliament, elected from constituencies in Ireland, including the North of Ireland, and members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe may attend meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and its sub-committees.  It also states that MEPs from other countries may, at the invitation of the committee or any of its sub-committees, attend and participate in meetings.</P>
    <P>MEPs and members of the Council of Europe attend meetings of my committee and it is an important forum for them.  They were elected to serve in Europe and are members of a committee system there which does not always attract proper media coverage.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs provides a forum in which people can express views and report on their work in the European committees.  MEPs have taken this opportunity but their work in Europe means their diaries are full and it is not always possible for them to attend.  This confirms my opinion about a dual mandate.  However, the committee has tried to facilitate them by meeting on Fridays.  The attendance is sometimes disappointing but we try to ensure that MEPs have a forum in their country.</P>
    <P>The committee report also suggested many ways to improve a wide range of links between national parliaments, the European Parliament and European institutions.  For example, the report mentioned the declaration which is in place following the Maastricht Treaty.  We supported this in principle and I will deal with this matter in more detail later.  Section 8 of the report states that the committee is satisfied that the current scrutiny provisions in place are adequate if properly adhered to and that this allows the Oireachtas to examine proposed Community legislation.  However, the report also states that the committee believes that a more structured and expanded programme of scrutiny should be undertaken.  To this end, certain legislative texts should be examined by the committee in consultation with the Minister prior to consideration by the Council of Ministers.  The committee ensures that Ministers address it on important national issues.  Ministers have appeared before they attended important meetings and have reported the outcome of these to the committee.  However, this structure should be dramatically strengthened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> I am pleased with the Bill because it helps to consolidate legislation relating to elections to the European Parliament.  While it is important in that regard, other important work remains to be done in the Union in terms of consolidating treaties and legislation in order to rationalise and simplify the European Union for all its citizens.  It has been recognised in every member state, and particularly by national parliaments, that the EU is running a democratic deficit.  Citizens are sometimes confused about what the Union is doing on their behalf.  There is a remoteness about the system which sometimes creates barriers for citizens.  Action must be taken to break down these barriers and to humanise the Union to make it more accessible.  It is generally accepted now that measures must be taken to bring this about.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference, of which Ireland is the current President, is, among other matters, examining this issue.  The Minister referred to the Maastricht Treaty.  The European heads of government and the Commission have given Ireland the responsibility of preparing a draft treaty for consideration before the end of the Intergovernmental Conference under the Dutch Presidency.  The Intergovernmental Conference meets on a weekly basis and Ireland as the current EU President is always represented.  The conference has decided that making Europe more relevant to its citizens is a prime task of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference must suggest a way to make the Union more accountable and transparent to the citizens of Europe.  That may prove to be the most important area of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  Despite its responsibilities with regard to structural changes, the number of members of national parliaments and of the European Parliament, the number of Commissioners and so on we should not allow some of the institutions of benefit to small nations to be eroded by enlargement.  Enlargement is something to which we have aspired because it is the concept of Europe, but we must not by encouraging it concede some of the benefits gained.</P>
    <P>A major problem for the Union is that over the years it has not only grown away from the ordinary citizen but also from national parliaments.  It is incumbent on national parliaments, the initial representatives of citizens, to be informed on the activities of the Union and to scrutinise the legislation before it is enacted. This legislation will have to be observed by all member states.</P>
    <P>Among the issues being considered by the Intergovernmental Conference regarding transparency is that the role of national parliaments should be reinforced by amending the Treaty and-or adopting a code of conduct to ensure that the Commission and the Council of Ministers conduct their work to facilitate national <Col N="503" /> parliaments.  In that regard Declaration 13 of the Maastricht Treaty states:</P>
    <P>The Conference considers that it is important to encourage greater involvement of national parliaments in the activities of the European Union.</P>
    <P>To this end the exchange of information between national parliaments and the European Parliament should be stepped up.  In this context, the governments of the Member States will ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that national parliaments receive Commission proposals for legislation in good time for information or possible examination.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Conference considers that it is important for contacts between the national parliaments and the European Parliament to be stepped up, in particular through the granting of appropriate reciprocal facilities and regular meetings between members of Parliament....</P>
    <P>The number of such meetings on relevant issues should be increased.  That declaration is not included in the Maastricht Treaty but is attached to it as a type of Protocol.  Although it was a commendation to national parliaments to consult governments, in practice, since Maastricht &mdash; with some notable exceptions which does not include our Government &mdash; very little consultation has taken place.  There are some encouraging signs that member states have a consultation procedure, but because it was not a Treaty obligation some member states reneged on their commitment to consult the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Declaration 13 refers to the importance of encouraging greater involvement between the Parliament, the Union and national governments and say the Parliament should ensure that national parliaments not only receive the proposed legislation, but would receive it in good time, not less than four weeks in advance of its proposed debate by the Council of Ministers. Proposed legislation should be available in the languages of all member states to facilitate its proper examination.</P>
    <P>During our Presidency we chaired meetings of committees of European affairs on behalf of the Oireachtas and hosted the 15th international conference, COSAC, in Dublin Castle on 15-16 October last.  COSAC is a conference of the parliaments of Europe, specialising in European Affairs and involving the elected European Parliament.  I am proud our Presidency was the first to achieve a unanimous conclusion at that COSAC meeting which makes that body of some significance within the structures addressing the democratic deficit between the Parliament and governments of member states.</P>
    <P>I will quote some points of the conclusion because they are important.  In the European Union national parliaments have a role to play to strengthen democracy and improve the efficiency <Col N="504" /> of the Union.  It is appropriate that the flow of information from the Union institutions to the national parliaments be improved and national parliaments should have control over the decisions of their respective governments taking into account the constitutional restraints that may apply to some member states.</P>
    <P>To that end COSAC holds that Declaration 13 should be reinforced by the Intergovernmental Conference by including it in the Treaty to make it obligatory on the governments of member states to follow through on their commitments under it, so that national parliaments will have an appropriate time to examine legislative procedures.  In that regard there is a procedure in place.  I hope following the COSAC meeting, if the declaration is included in the Maastricht Treaty all member governments, including ours, will be obliged, as are the governments of Finland, Denmark, Sweden and many other countries, to consult the Parliament through their special committees of European affairs thereby providing an opportunity to discuss all proposed legislation.  Apart from our obligation under the Treaty to examine directives and their implications for Irish legislation, we need an opportunity, such as that provided for under the declaration, to participate fully in the preparation of legislation without having a veto on the Minister.  We should have an input on behalf of national institutions, the Dáil and Seanad, as our committee represents both Houses.  I hope the consensus achieved during our Presidency will help strengthen us to address the deficit between all our institutions and the European Parliament, the subject matter of this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Members, welcome the introduction of this Bill.  There have been approximately four elections in 20 years since our first European election.  This Bill is tidying up legislation in the electoral area.  Elections are difficult, particularly for Members of this House and their families.  We should try, therefore, to minimise the pain we have to endure during those difficult periods.</P>
      <P>The issue of Sunday voting has been raised by a number of speakers.  Many of us have had the opportunity to act as international observers at elections in various countries.  I have acted in this capacity on three occasions and found it extremely stimulating and interesting.  If I was told that voting would take place on a Thursday, that the votes would not be counted until the Sunday and that the ballot boxes would remain in a shed in the intervening period, I would have to raise the question in my written report of whether such a system would be open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we provide assistance to the new democracies and help them to run elections in a free and fair manner, we allow a situation to continue here where the results of an election are not known for many days afterwards.  From the point of view of the public but, more important, from the point of view of candidates, it is a <Col N="505" /> torture to have to sit around and wait for the results.  To make matters as simple as possible, people should be asked to vote on a Sunday, as happens in other European countries.</P>
    <P>As those who stayed up and watched the results of the American presidential election come in are aware, the results in Florida were known before people in California had finished voting.  That is ludicrous and an incredible abuse of the system.  If the result was close, people in California who had no intention of voting could be influenced to go out and do so.  This could result in a swing either way.  I find it fascinating that they allow the results in one part of the country to be made known before people on the other side of the country finish voting.  It is important that in the future people throughout Europe should vote on the same day with the votes being counted within a matter of hours so that candidates do not have a torturous wait for the results, as happened in one Dublin constituency in the last election.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill mentioned the expense of running for election to this House rather than the European Parliament &mdash; many people believe that Members of the European Parliament obtain a fair return.  This matter, which has been raised by the many Members who will retire from politics at the next election, needs to be looked at.  As all parties are aware, running for election to the Dáil has become an unattractive option for many people.  Members of this House are not well paid and have to put in a huge number of hours to do the job properly.  As Deputy Quill said, we will ignore this at our peril.  There is a need to attract people of quality, particularly young people, to politics.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Members who will retire from politics at the next election have raised this issue through the media.  Many people commented on the radio interview given by the leader of my party, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  They began to appreciate the work that we do for a poor return and the problems encountered in attracting people to the profession.  Those in public life have to expect criticism and abuse but at times people go over the top.  It has been mentioned in the media that all we do is sit around and take long holidays.  This is grossly unfair and far from the truth.  If one wants to be returned to Dáil Éireann and receive some satisfaction one has to put in a considerable number of hours each week.</P>
    <P>The relevance of MEPs and the problems encountered by them in getting their message across were mentioned by a number of speakers. MEPs have said that they find it difficult to get the media to cover items discussed at European Parliament level, in particular reports compiled by various committees.  Newspapers will not print articles about matters nobody wants to read about.  There is, therefore, an information deficit. Most people are grateful for the money we receive from the European Union but they see this as the result of the efforts of the <Col N="506" /> Government, not our MEPs.  Because of a lack of interest, problems are encountered at election time in attracting a good turn-out.</P>
    <P>MEPs of all parties work extremely hard and make a huge effort at committee level in Brussels and Strasbourg.  They find it very frustrating when this merits only one or two lines in a newspaper or a brief report on radio.  This contrasts with the time given for a discussion about the size of bottles in which whiskey may be sold, which is quite irrelevant.  There are much more important matters being discussed at European Parliament level but they do not receive much coverage. RTE provides regular coverage but it is important to ensure that people are made aware of the importance of MEPs' work and go out and vote in greater numbers in European Parliament elections.</P>
    <P>I note that the Attorney General will be eligible to stand for election to the European Parliament.  The Minister stressed however that the present Attorney General has no intention of running either now or in the future.</P>

      <P>I am sure the previous Attorney General has no interest in running for election to the European Parliament as he was badly treated. He is extremely well qualified and a man of the highest integrity.  The Minister said that under the Electoral Act, 1994, an independent commission must be set up as soon as possible after the last census to deal with the formation of Dáil and European constituencies.  The last time we debated this matter I said that I cannot understand the way in which constituencies are drawn up.  Two constituencies come to mind &mdash; I am sure Deputies could name others &mdash; which are badly drawn up, one of which is Mayo.  It is difficult to service rural constituencies and to provide that Mayo is one constituency is ludicrous.  The fact that Deputies must spend a great amount of time travelling throughout the constituency, particularly in dangerous conditions in winter, poses a threat to their safety.  The issue was referred to by Members in that constituency. Anybody who visits Mayo will be aware of the difficulties involved in travelling through the county.  Problems such as those should be taken on board when drawing up constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other constituency that is badly drawn up is in the city of Dublin, the constituency of my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  It is ludicrous that Dublin Central includes areas across the <Col N="507" /> Liffey such as Ballyfermot, which has no relevance whatsoever to the north side of the city. Members in that constituency cannot understand how it was drawn up.  Recently I spoke to Deputy Jim Mitchell who intends to retire from the Dáil after many good years of service to the House and the people of Dublin and he agreed that his constituency was very badly drawn up.  The argument may be put forward that if one constituency is changed it would have a knock-on effect throughout the country, but there must be some cohesion in drawing up constituencies. There is nothing wrong with giving the commission greater flexibility but it should ensure that constituencies such as Mayo and Dublin Central are better drawn up.  The present position is unfair to elected Members and to the people living in those areas because they are poorly serviced as a result of the lay-out of the constituencies.</P>
    <P>It is timely that we tidy up existing legislation in this area and that European elections are put on a similar footing to local and national elections.  The issue of Sunday voting should be considered.  I have never been convinced that there is a real reason for not voting on Sunday, as is done in other countries in Europe.  Candidates should not have to endure three days of torture over a weekend wondering whether they will be elected.  I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill which tidies up electoral law and consolidates many of the practices which are working well.  I agree with Deputy Ryan in regard to Sunday voting and it is desirable that we move in that direction.  I also agree it is unacceptable that candidates must wait from Thursday evening until perhaps Monday morning to find out whether they will be elected. A certain group of candidates will be sure of their seats while another group will know there is not a hope of them being elected, but voting on Thursday presents a particular difficulty for the few for whom the results may go either way.  It is undesirable that those people, their families and their supporters should have to endure the agony of waiting days for the results.  There is no reason we should not introduce Sunday voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my main criticisms of the Bill is the failure to experiment and consider new ideas in regard to the political system.  The European elections provide a unique opportunity to examine changes in politics.  The opportunity has been missed in the Bill to provide that names are listed on ballot papers by random selection rather than in alphabetical order.  I am sure Deputy Ryan will agree since his name is not far ahead of mine in terms of the alphabet.  The findings of numerous surveys indicate that there is a built-in advantage for people whose names start with a letter near the top of the alphabet.  There is a case to be made for changing the order in which people's names appear on the ballot paper and, without knowing very much about the law on <Col N="508" /> these matters, I suspect there might even be a case for constitutional action if a person was enthusiastic enough and could afford to take such action.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the amount of the deposit &mdash; £1,000 is relatively reasonable given that funding is made available if a candidate gets more than 25 per cent of the quota.  Considering the cost of contesting elections, if a person does not have the capacity to put up £1,000 he does not have much chance of winning.</P>
    <P>The opportunity has also been lost in terms of including a photograph of candidates on the ballot paper.  That proposal, which has been rejected time and again down the years, is well worth considering.  Even if photographs were included on a once off basis it would give us an opportunity to see what the effect would be.  It may be argued from a theoretical point of view that most people are literate, and that is true, but the reasons people vote for certain candidates vary.  The inclusion of a photograph might improve the precision with which people cast their vote and would be particularly relevant in the case of candidates with the same surname.</P>
    <P>The question of granting votes to emigrants has not been addressed to a great extent in the Bill and that is another opportunity lost.  This is one area in which we could have experimented.  The opportunity should have been taken to assess the extent to which emigrants wish to participate in the electoral process.</P>
    <P>I am unsure whether constitutionally or according to European law it would be possible for Irish emigrants residing outside the EU to vote in this country in European elections but an opportunity has been lost.  This should be examined and if it is not possible, then Irish citizens living in the EU opting to cast their votes in Ireland should be considered.  There has been much discussion, including my own contribution to my party's position, in relation to granting votes to emigrants.  Those on the other side of the argument mention the enormous numbers of emigrants who would then distort the Irish voting system by being included in it.  We had an opportunity to experiment with this election and it is a pity it has not been considered more seriously.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the size of the constituencies and the concept of Ireland as a fifteen-seat constituency rather than being broken up into four and five-seater constituencies.  Why is the constitutional provision for a maximum constituency size of seven members not adhered to any more?  That is worth re-examining as it would give fairer representation to smaller parties in particular.  I accept that since the drawing of constituencies has been given to independent commissions the proportionality between percentages of parties in the Dáil and the share of the general vote is quite close with the exception of the very small parties who are excluded to some degree by the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> I agree with Deputy Ryan's points on the difficulty of attracting capable candidates for election.  That is becoming particularly evident in relation to the Dáil.  Looking at the conditions of work and the general position of a Deputy as perceived by the public, there is constant criticism and harping on the awfulness of politicians.  The term &ldquo;politician&rdquo; is now a term of abuse.  Once it was a term of honour for someone who served their country and did their best.  Now the connotation is that of a duplicitous low-grade crook.  That is what is conjured up in the public mind by the term.  That is a pity and to some extent it has been contributed to by politicians' behaviour, but there is no group of people without their deficiencies in behaviour or who could not be portrayed as knaves or charlatans if someone sets about doing so.  There is a need to move away from this sustained criticism which often merges into gratuitous abuse.  It is not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It is telling to listen to the views of retiring Members, many of whom have served their constituents and country very well.  In particular I refer to some Members on the Opposition side. My views on some are well known but that does not take from my recognition that some of them have served constituencies and country very honourably.  In some cases they have done so in a very low-key way without going for the headlines but doing a solid, meticulous job over the years.  It is a pity some of them are now leaving politics because of how things are.</P>
    <P>To continue the theme of innovation, experimentation and modernisation, the effects of the PR system should be mentioned.  The European elections might have provided an opportunity to experiment and shift away from the single transferable vote system.  We should move towards the list system.  I am not in favour of the single non-transferable vote system as in the UK.  That is highly undesirable and leads to huge distortions the Irish public would not accept. However there is a strong case for moving from the PR multi-seat constituency to a list system or at least for beginning to move in that direction. The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, made an interesting proposal when he suggested a compromise of half the Dáil being elected on a list system and the remaining half being elected on the conventional system.</P>

      <P>There is a strong case for considering the German system.  The European elections were a missed opportunity for experiment.  The fine details would be a matter of contention but in the national interest we should review the effects of the PR system.  I held the view that this was the most desirable system but I have changed my mind.  It leads to excessive parochialism and useless competition, sometimes <Col N="510" /> within parties although my party does not suffer from that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It leads to excessive difficulties with clientelism and parochialism in the constituency. Is it in the national interest that a good Minister or Deputy is perceived in the constituency as one who gets more than the fair share of national resources for that constituency?  Is it good that a system exists whereby small self-centred minorities from the NIMBY sector can hold up development and change that is essential to the common good?</P>
      <P>Going back 30 or 40 years, that did not exist to the same degree.  There is now the concept of the political wise bird, a feathery creature who knows the ins and outs of politics and that if one does not do the right thing by one's constituency one will not be returned to the Dáil.  For some that is the be-all and end-all of political life and it is a pity that it has developed.  The system greatly facilitates that.</P>
      <P>My colleagues in Dublin city have not been nearly as effective as their rural counterparts in tweaking the system to get more for their constituencies.  That is not in Dublin's or the national interest.  Some of the difficulties we are experiencing in Dublin are related to that.  If anyone doubts that they should read the remarks of Peter Howick on <i>The Late Late Show</i> or get a list of constituencies and work out the grants received per head of population.  One may be sure that Dublin comes at the bottom of the league.  An example would be the latest national lottery funding figures.  Some calculator work will find Dublin at the bottom of that and other constituencies doing very well.  The Acting Chairman will be delighted to hear that Westmeath is doing very well indeed.</P>

      <P>If one looked at this globally, one should get a pattern that is similar or a pattern which would accord with the national needs and development.</P>
      <P>The PR system also facilitates and encourages the holding of clinics.  I am not opposed to that but when one third of a constituency has been to a clinic it is time to ask why they are necessary.  It is time people asked why this is necessary.  There is something fundamentally wrong with a system where a large proportion of the population believes that if it is to get its entitlements &mdash; presumably that is all it is looking for &mdash; it is necessary for it to visit a politician's clinic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties attached to that type of politics is that it concentrates the mind of the politician on what is truly parochial.  The successful politician is somebody who has mastered the art of fixing potholes.  This type of <Col N="511" /> politics encourages and facilitates the wizard of pothole works, which is undesirable.  Individuals who are better at fixing potholes, repairing lights and perhaps getting the odd roundabout built do not have time to consider the national interest &mdash; the big picture which affects everybody.  The difficulty is that somebody must consider the big picture which is inevitably controlled by people who are not elected or answerable to the public. It is time we moved away from that system.  There is no point saying politicians should not attend clinics &mdash; life is not like that.  Anyone from the business world will be familiar with the concept of competitive advertising.</P>
    <P>It is important to move away from this system which did not exist in the early days of the State. I remember people telling me about a member of my party who represented Laoighis-Offaly and who would only visit the constituency twice a year.  Perhaps the story has been dramatised and it is unfair to the person to whom I refer. However, the fact that it was told indicates the degree to which politics has changed and the clinic system has developed.</P>
    <P>I return to the fundamental question of why, in the dying days of the 20th century, one third of the population believes it is in its interest to visit a politician's clinic.  People do not go to advice centres to discuss the national question, which is one of the great fallacies of political folklore. People often write about politicians being in touch because men and women come in off the street to give them their views on the economy, economic and monetary union, Zaire or the development of Europe.  That is nonsense.  They visit clinics to seek something from the system to which they may be entitled.  If they are entitled to something, the system should be such that it can be administered without political intervention.  If political intervention is necessary to get people their entitlements, that is a serious question which needs to be addressed.  Nobody would want a system to develop where it would be possible to get people what they are not entitled to through political intervention.</P>

      <P>It is stupid that we vote on a Thursday but cannot begin the count until polling stations in Europe have closed on the Sunday night.

      <P>I looked at the results of the American Presidential election on television on Wednesday night.  I am not suggesting that we should be as efficient as the Americans but waves of results came in every hour when voting in each time zone concluded.  Perhaps it is due to the electronic way they vote.  People on the west coast in Los Angles, California, knew the results in states on the east when they went to vote.  The Americans have no problem announcing results before voting concludes in all states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should experiment and hold elections on a Sunday.  Some of the minority churches are reluctant to go down that road.  We seem overconscious about not offending the sensitivities of some of the minority churches, yet it is very fashionable to criticise the majority church which is fair game for politicians, journalists and others.  Although we have experimented on which day to hold an election, it is being used as a tool and a political device by Governments.  I refer specifically to the divorce referendum.  We usually hold elections on a Wednesday or Thursday but last year the Government decided to experiment with the choice of polling day and held the referendum on a Friday.  I believe that was partly politically motivated, the notion being that older people will vote regardless of the day of the week but that young people must be encouraged to do so.  Many young people are students who do not live at home.  The Government wanted them on its side <Col N="513" /> in the referendum and facilitated them in terms of the choice of polling day.  The referendum was carried by a small majority and I was on the losing side.</P>
    <P>Polling in the referendum to be held at the end of this month will take place on a Thursday.  Does that mean that the Friday experiment was a failure or was it used simply to encourage young people to vote?  Does the Government feel it does not have to care about the young people any more?  The principle of facilitating them while they were home at the weekend was appropriate for last year's campaign but it has now been forgotten; old habits die slowly.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of this referendum, lest anybody think otherwise, and I do not object to experimenting with the choice of polling day but the decision should not be made to support the Government's objective in holding the referendum.  That is the wrong signal to send out.</P>
    <P>I am not the first to raise this matter; it has been referred to outside the House.  I understand Government sources and others are of the view that having polling day on a Friday was a success in that it facilitated many people.  Why is the Government going back on that?  Perhaps the Minister might give his views on this when replying.</P>
    <P>I would like the Government to go further and consider Fridays or Sundays as possible polling days.  I understand the reason the Government did not hold the divorce referendum on a Sunday; it would not be good tactics for people to leave church wound up and proceed straight to the polling stations.</P>
    <P>The next elections to the European Parliament will be held in 1999.  As of now, the next local authority elections are due to be held in 1998. Perhaps the Government has not yet addressed this matter but at the time of the last general election some people were of the view that the local elections should have been held on the same day and that the five year pattern should be adhered to.  Local authority elections used to coincide with European elections and it is rumoured that will be the case again in 1999 and every five years thereafter.  There is logic in that because seven years will have passed by the time the next local authority elections are held.  It is unfair to ask people who are part-time local representatives to commit themselves to that job for seven years.  Previous speakers referred to the fact that some Members will retire at the end of this Dáil term but we are full-time politicians.  It is a totally different ball game for part-time public representatives to commit themselves for seven years.  The Government might consider this matter and inform the House whether the local elections will be held in 1998 or put back to 1999 when they will coincide thereafter with the European elections.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the electoral system and this morning the Minister of State said there was provision in the Maastricht Treaty for a <Col N="514" /> similar system of election to the European Parliament in all member states.  That has not happened yet but rather than wait to be told we must have a list system for the European election we should debate the matter, decide what we want to do in future elections and proceed at our own pace.</P>
    <P>Some Members mentioned the need for multi-seat constituencies to represent the minority view, be it right or left.  I doubt whether such a system would work because we are often told we are all being pushed into the centre and that there is little ideological difference between one side of the House and the other.  If the current system was devised to represent every minority view and to support small parties, regardless of the niche they represent, it has failed because the argument that we are all being pushed into the centre, which may have arisen because of the make-up of coalition Governments, does not stand up.  I agree with others who said we should examine the whole electoral system because that is the root of all our problems.</P>
    <P>The single seat transferable system we operate in by-elections is fair.  I realise there are certain variations of the list system but I would not support it if it resulted in people being labelled as either sloggers or intellectuals.  I hope that will never happen.  Depending on the type of constituency Members represent they can be excellent parliamentarians.  They are in a position to deal with lofty matters because they do not have much constituency work whereas with others, that is often not the case.  This is probably reflected more in Dublin than in the rural constituencies where there is a cross section of society in every town.  There are middle or upper class areas in some constituencies while in others there are areas in which the excluded classes live. We need a debate on this whole issue but I would not support a list system.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that some Members intend to retire at the next general election. Watching the US elections on television the other night I was interested to hear about a 93 year old man who had been elected for another six year term of office; I do not know if that was to the Senate or the House of Representatives.  I thought such elderly people were only elected in countries like Russia or China, not the USA. Some of the Members retiring from this House, who are only 59 or 60, might reflect on this and reconsider their intentions.  Obviously their workload is different from what others have to put up with.  Since the first European election, Europe has become much more relevant to the ordinary voter.  It must be difficult to be an MEP. Because an MEP is away much of the time and his constituency is large, he needs different means of communicating.</P>
    <P>The general public are becoming wiser and more up to date on the relevance of Europe. However, much is happening from which the public representative is excluded.  For more than two years, detailed talks have been taking place <Col N="515" /> behind the scenes on the question of urban funding which has brought a great deal of funding to the Ballymun part of my constituency.  A programme is all but agreed, and we wonder how the money will be spent.  At Question Time yesterday I tried to find out.  I am afraid I went away none the wiser.  Local activists seem to know all about how European money is being spent but I, as an elected public representative, have no formal input.  I do not think my MEP has either.  The elected politician has been squeezed out.  It is all very well to have a bottom-up system and participation by local activists, but public representatives should also be consulted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton spoke about the drudgery of running clinics.  I would not pretend it is the most exciting part of our work.  At the same time I would not agree with the label he put on people who call to the clinics.  Not everyone who comes to a Deputy's clinic is looking for something to which he is not entitled.  It is possible they are killing two birds with the one stone, looking for advice or information but giving the Deputy their views as well.  What Deputy Upton said made interesting listening &mdash; sometimes I think his party colleagues feel the same.  The frustrations and limitations of office seem to have got to him and perhaps he is exasperated by the limitations on what he can do.  Perhaps it is a reflection of the way people come through the bigger parties that they have to serve time, perhaps too much time in some cases; by the time they are elected here they know the job in detail.  Members of some of the smaller parties get elected to this House very quickly and, after a few years, become frustrated and frantic because, with an election in the offing, they have not set the world on fire as they hoped to do.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the last few years the practice of MEPs resigning their seats and handing them over to a substitute candidate has become less frequent.  This practice gave the impression that members were going to Europe for a junket.  The commitment in more recent years of career MEPs creates a better image and, being more committed, they deliver more to us in the long-term.</P>

Is í an aidhm atá leis an mBille ná na píosaí reachtaíochta go léir a thabhairt le chéile agus iad a chur i láthair ar bhonn chomh simplí agus is féidir maidir le cúrsaí toghcháin.  Anuas ar sin tá an chuid rudaí gur mhaith le daoine a phlé maidir le Parlaimint na hEorpa, maidir le Teachtaí na Parlaiminte agus an tslí a bhaineann siad leis an Parlaimint seo agus leis an tír.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that the opportunity has been taken to speak generally about this Bill and about relevant matters which are not contained in it but which will inform us when we come to amend it. For me it is particularly interesting given that, <Col N="516" /> unlike any other party in the Dáil, there are more parliamentarians from the Irish Green Party in the European Parliament than there are in the national parliament &mdash; there are two, one representing Dublin and one representing Leinster.  Coincidentally, and more interesting still, the Green group of the European Parliament is visiting Dublin and hosting meetings half a mile down the road in the Conrad Hotel.  To that extent there is a certain appropriateness about this debate which is particularly poignant for members of the Green group.</P>
    <P>What I am about to say may not be directly applicable to this Bill but it is something others might care to consider.  It is worth reflecting on the ground rules that govern party-political broadcasts which are an essential part of an election campaign.  There is a huge constituency to be considered when one is standing for election to the European Parliament.  That makes it all the more relevant that publicity in the media, particularly the television media, is fairly and equally apportioned to all the candidates. Although the Green group was the fourth largest group in the European Parliament at the last election, the breakdown of party political broadcast time was based on Dáil representation. There is a certain amount of double thinking.  We speak about the importance of the European Parliament and European institutions, but when it comes to the European election we forget about that and deal on the basis of Dáil representation.  That is an area where we need to be consistent.  Similarly, if I may speak on behalf of some of the candidates who stood as independents during that election, they warranted no consideration when it came to party political broadcasts.  One could argue about the word &ldquo;party&rdquo;.  Certainly the late Deputy Neil Blaney suffered injustice in that context, as did Deputy Pat Cox who stood in Munster. Streamlining is necessary.  It is hypocritical to say the European Parliament is important and at the same time ignore the facts of representation there.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the deposit for a candidate standing for election remains at £1,000 and proposes some change in respect of retaining the deposit for unsuccessful candidates.  What message are we sending out when we ask people to come up with £1,000 if they are to stand for the European election?  A number of groups with whom I have spoken say a more democratic and genuine way of vetting candidates would be to require them to collect a certain number of signatures.  In that way people could indicate they have a certain level of support, are sincere and are competent to stand for election.  Under the present system, whereby a deposit of £1,000 is required, the chances are that people who are wealthy and insincere, including jokers, will stand simply because they have the money to throw around.  That system should not be encouraged. It is not the best way of securing a list of people to stand as candidates.  That issue ought to be <Col N="517" /> debated more fully.  I do not think it has been mentioned but I hope the Minister will give us the Government's views on that area.  Other countries require people to collect a certain number of signatures if they wish to stand as candidates.  I support that system.</P>
    <P>It has been said people involved in political life work hard.  All of us in the House could testify to that.  There is also the perception, one could say it is a tabloid representation, that politicians accumulate salaries and thereby the political system is discredited in the eyes of many.  It is time we looked at the dual mandate.  This has already been dealt with to the extent that members of the European Parliament cannot be members of a local authority, but members of a national parliament and the European Parliament can still continue to collect salaries from both.  It is interesting to note that MEPs north of the Border have a different system.  They collect the one salary, if they are members, from the national parliament and half the salary from the European Parliament.  In trying to harmonise the system and rules and regulations we have overlooked that hoary chestnut.  It is time we faced up to it because inconsistencies of that magnitude will not do the political process any favour.  The matter could be dealt with in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The wider problem of the dual mandate or the triple mandate has not gone away.  It is a difficult issue for the Government to grasp.  Although many people aspire to the ideal of doing away with it nobody is prepared to do anything about it.  I have tabled questions to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on several occasions, the latest of which has been transferred to the Minister for the Environment.  A shift is taking place and the goalposts are being moved from time to time.  Outside of politics the dual mandate is taken seriously, especially in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, published in 1993, which has been before the Government since that time.  It recommends that if women are to increase their participation in politics the dual mandate must be done away with.  What is happening is that a largely male dominated representative body is holding on to local authority positions.  That undermines not only the position of women in politics but also the position of local authorities.  This job is held on to by Deputies who are unable to attend meetings which clash with the Dáil.  In effect difficult choices have to be made because one has to be bi-locational to do both jobs.</P>
    <P>Dáil committees should be looked at in the context of attendance by MEPs.  MEPs are entitled to attend the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  That is understandable in light of their membership of the European Parliament. I do not know why there is a limit on MEPs simply attending those committees.  MEPs are as involved in the affairs of Ireland as any Deputy. They should have the option for much wider attendance at committees.  It has become the <Col N="518" /> practice that MEPs are able to use the facilities of this House.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about drawing salaries.  We have to distinguish between personal gain and doing our job to the greatest effect. What I am talking about is the obvious input which MEPs are required to make.  In spite of what Deputy Ferris said I do not believe the co-ordination of the timetable in the European Parliament and in Dáil Éireann is sufficiently developed to allow for the role they are expected to play.</P>
      <P>I have in mind particularly the time when MEPs are in Strasbourg.  Often MEPs are unable to attend the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which may be dealing with a matter of importance in the European Parliament, irrespective of the day of the week because it so happens that that week is a particularly difficult one for them.  This matter needs to be examined in consultation with the MEPs.</P>
      <P>Despite all the debate about this Bill, considerably less power rests with the European Parliament and with this Parliament than has been the case heretofore.  Strange as it may seem, we have voted to reduce the autonomy of this Parliament, not simply to give power to the European Parliament but to unelected bodies, asking them to make decisions.  Perhaps that reflects a distrust of the Parliament and a lack of knowledge about the implication of the decision.  That is difficult to analyse but we must take cognisance of it.  I am not simply talking about the European Commission but the greater commercial transnational corporation type of decision-making which is completely unaccountable, regardless of what Bill, electoral strategy or legislation is in place.  That should be borne in mind because it is not often referred to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dempsey mentioned that the turnout for European Parliament elections between 1979 and 1989 decreased throughout Europe from 62.5 per cent to 57 per cent.  It was also mentioned that the result of the American presidential election was announced very quickly after the votes were cast.  However, the turnout was remarkably low given the size of that country. That should not be overlooked.  A low turnout indicates a certain level of indifference and a belief that the work of Parliament is increasingly less relevant to the lives of the electorate.  That is a cause of worry and legislators should make the legislation, and the institutions to which that legislation refers, as relevant as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned by Deputy Ahern, the local authority elections would have been held last July if the five-year term of office had been complied with.  However, they were postponed and we are not sure if they will be held in 1998 or 1999 &mdash; it depends to which political analyst one speaks. The message is being sent out that local <Col N="519" /> authorities may continue as they are because they have very little power and will do no harm, one way or the other.  I dispute that, particularly in light of some of the rezoning decisions, which is one element of power the local authorities retain and guard jealously.  It is one of the few remaining powers they have.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and the Government as a whole have a serious responsibility to review the operation of local government.  I said &ldquo;local government&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; because we do not, in effect, have local government.  We have local administrations which are not governments.  For example, taxation is centrally collected.  It goes through the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment and a greatly diminished amount which is left over is given to the local authorities.  There is an urgent need to review the process of local government funding so that local authorities can collect their funds.  National Government will have to reduce its taxation to allow that to happen.  That is not happening and people are disaffected and disenchanted with local government.  The Government must take on board that national responsibility.</P>
    <P>The electoral system has been debated and reference has been made to single seat constituencies, multi seat constituencies, list systems and so on.  There is undoubtedly a need to examine our voting system.  In 1989 the Green Party in the UK got 15 per cent of the vote in the European elections but did not win any seats, which shows there is considerable room for improvement.  It is important to have a list system element.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I owe a great deal to Europe, in the same way Pádraig Flynn owes a great deal to this Government.  He would not be in Europe and I would not be in the Dáil if it had not all happened together.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong of me as a Mayoman, a west of Ireland man and an Irishman not to refer to the scurrilous attack last week on our EU Commissioner by Mr. Bruce Anderson, a <i>Daily Mail</i> journalist.  I call on Mr. Anderson, and the editor of that newspaper to withdraw those scurrilous remarks.  It was an insult to our EU Commissioner, Ireland and Mayo.  It was Paddybashing at its worst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to Mr. Anderson that we are very proud of our representatives, whether they are members of this Government or of Fianna Fáil.  The EU Commissioners we have sent to Europe have done this country proud, as Pádraig Flynn is <Col N="520" /> doing now.  We will not accept those remarks and the least the editor of the <i>Daily Mail</i> should do is to withdraw them.  I hope Commissioner Flynn takes this case to court and that the <i>Daily Mail</i> pays the penalty it deserves.</P>
    <P>I will not have anybody say anything about an Irishman abroad, just as I would not have anybody in this country say anything about a Mayoman.  Mr. Anderson's remarks on the west of Ireland and Mr. Flynn were scandalous.  The <i>Daily Mail</i> should, at least, publish an apology to the people of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am working on that.  Elections to the European Parliament are held every five years.  A number of speakers referred to the dual mandate.  I do not believe anybody can represent a Dáil constituency and a large European constituency such as Connacht-Ulster at the same time.  An amendment should be made to the Bill that any Member of the Dáil elected to the European Parliament should have to resign his Dáil seat the next day.  One cannot be in Brussels and Dublin at the same time.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament is remote from the people of this country.  Our MEPs should have to come to the Dáil once a year to outline what is happening in Europe and what they are doing. When we are canvassing during elections we are often told by constituents they do not see us from election to election.  That is not true and every Member of this House knows how hard TDs work in terms of running clinics and meeting deputations.  It might be true, however, of our MEPs.  It is time they were more answerable to the people.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament is a grand place to be and I intend to stand for it some time in the next 20 years.  However, I intend to have a long stint in this House first.  I am looking forward to perhaps being a Minister in the next Government after we are returned to office.  I do not intend to leave this House for a long time, although there might be a shortage of candidates for Europe. There are six TDs in Mayo but only five will be returned to this House after the next election, so the surplus might wonder if there is anything for them in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason I am speaking on this Bill is that I would love to see a provision in all election Bills in relation to poll clerks.  I tabled questions to the Taoiseach requesting that unemployed people be employed during the census and elections.  There are approximately 300,000 unemployed people and many of them would be able to do this job.  Why is the job given to retired people, county council workers and people earning good salaries who take holidays from their permanent jobs?  This job should be given to the people who need it, the unemployed and social welfare recipients.  The same happened during the census where some of the people <Col N="521" /> employed were on holidays from their permanent jobs.  It is not popular to say so, but this is wrong. It is little wonder people are critical of politicians when they cannot direct that the unemployed should be given first preference for this job.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why we cannot hold elections on a Sunday, as happens in other European countries.  The next European elections should be held on a Sunday so that everyone has an opportunity to vote.</P>
    <P>Following my election, I had to wait 15 months to get back my deposit.  If a civil servant was owed £1 on 1 September and it was not paid on that date a union representative would ask on 2 September why it had not been paid.  This deposit of £300 was a lot of money to me in 1994 and I was glad to get it back.  County registrars should be able to return deposits to candidates seven days after an election.  Politicians think about everyone else and maybe it is time they thought about themselves.  It may be possible to amend the Bill by including a provision under which deposits would have to be returned to candidates seven days after an election.</P>
    <P>The best proposal I have heard in a long time is that county managers should be elected by the public.  This would give them an understanding of what is involved in dealing with the general public.</P>
    <P>Elections to the European Parliament are held every five years.  I was glad an election was not held after the collapse of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government and that it was possible for the elected Members to form another Government. Regardless of the issue, if a Government collapses within the five year fixed period an alternative Government should be formed without holding another election.  The public elect us for five years and we should be able to form a Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope there will be positive amendments to it.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, has returned to the Chamber.  He is a busy Minister but I take exception to the practice which has developed in recent years whereby a Minister from the relevant Department is not present for the entire debate. I made the same point during the debate on social welfare legislation.  If the relevant Minister is not present to hear our contributions then we are wasting our time.  There are three Ministers in the Department of the Environment and at least one of them should be present for the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who has responsibilities in other Departments and is one of the hardest working Ministers.  Neither is it a reflection on the Minister of State who sat in for him.  However, it shows scant respect for Parliament if none of the <Col N="522" /> three Ministers in the Department of the Environment is present for the debate.  This is not acceptable and it is about time Parliament put down its foot on this matter.  Our job is to hold Ministers to account and it is not good enough that none of the three relevant Ministers is present for long periods of this debate.  I will continue to make this point if this practice is not changed.</P>
      <P>It is very important for local elections to be held on the same day as European elections.  The present large number of elections is not in the interests of the country as it diverts the attention of politicians from their national duties.  The next general election, which will be held at some stage during the next 12 months, will be the eighth general election in 20 years.  General elections are held, on average, every two and a half years. During the same period there will be four European elections and three or four local elections, not to mention Presidential elections and the host of by-elections.  This focuses the attention of Deputies on elections rather than on the task of vetting expenditure and legislation. When Parliament is not doing its job properly we end up with costly scandals such as those in relation to beef and hepatitis C.  Similar scandals will continue to occur unless we properly vet expenditure and legislation and call Ministers to account.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ring that if a Government collapses within the five year fixed term we should be able to form a new Government without holding another election.  Elections to the Dáil should be held in the middle of the fixed term for the European elections so that we go before the people once every two and a half years instead of once every year as at present.  The decision to postpone the local elections some years ago was a mistake as it resulted in extra costs for politicians, a need for additional fund-raising and diverted politicians' interest from their duties.</P>
      <P>The Act states that the local elections will be held in 1998 but also gives the Minister for the Environment the power to postpone them for a further year.  A decision should be taken now that the next local elections will be held on the same day as the European elections.  Following this, the power granted to the Minister to defer local elections should be repealed.  This power was probably given initially to deal with an emergency where it was difficult to hold local elections.  However, it is now being used frequently to defer local elections, which is undemocratic.  It does not make sense that we have no choice but to hold European elections every five years.  This would save money and the time of politicians, which would enable them to give more attention to considering legislation and vetting expenditure.  It would also enable them to engage in double fund-raising activities for both types of election.  We must get these elections back in kilter and keep them synchronised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> On the issue of the role of the European Parliament and national Parliaments in the future governance of the EU, as chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, and in common with the chairmen of the national finance committees in each of the member states, I am usually invited to Brussels approximately twice a year to meet the European Parliament economic and budgetary committee.  This is a good thing, although it is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement. As part of the next Intergovernmental Conference, we should seek to institutionalise the relationship between national Parliaments and their committees and the European Parliament and its committees.  It should be a standing requirement that the chairperson of the relevant parliamentary committees would be <i>ex officio</i> members of the corresponding committees of the European Parliament and that such committees would be required to meet at least twice a year, once in Brussels and once in one of the national capitals, to consider issues of joint interest.  It is important that a connection be made between the proximate bodies of the national and European Parliaments, otherwise national Parliaments can get out of touch with what is going on in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>As the EU develops, there is a compelling case for a Second House of the European Parliament which would not be directly elected but would represent the national Parliaments.  There is such a body in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  All 15 member states of the EU are members of the parliamentary assembly, as are all applicant members.  It and the European Parliament meet in the same building at Strasbourg.  If we agreed that the membership from the member states would constitute a Second House &mdash; a Senate &mdash; of the European Parliament this would be one way of ensuring that national Parliaments are directly represented at the centre.  It would also enable parliamentarians from the non member states to at least know what is going on in the EU and to be <i>au fait</i> with requirements should they wish to become member states.  It would provide for greater cohesion and understanding across Europe.</P>
    <P>On the question of weekend elections, a recent election was held on a Friday, which was very satisfactory.  Elections on Fridays, with the polls open until 10 p.m., would ensure that many commercial travellers, students and others who work away from home could vote, whereas elections held on days during the middle of the week makes it difficult for many people.  I favour holding elections at weekends, preferably on Fridays or even on Saturdays or Sundays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey's comments on our voting system should be carefully considered by the Minister.  Many Members on all sides of the House, including me, support, and have supported for years, a move away from multi-seat constituencies, which cause more division within <Col N="524" /> parties than between them.  They also cause competition at constituency level which diverts people from national affairs.  We should adopt an electoral system based on the German model, with refinements to suit our circumstances.  The forthcoming European and local elections would be an apt time to try this on a project basis.</P>
    <P>The rules should be changed so that members of national Parliaments cannot also be Members of the European Parliament.  This exemption should not be enshrined in law and we should seek union wide agreement on this.</P>
    <P>There is much controversy about the expenses to which Members of the European Parliament are entitled.  There should be mechanisms to better scrutinise this so that Members are well compensated for their work while ensuring that taxpayers of the union are not ripped off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider the way in which constituencies for elections to the European Parliament are drawn up.  Changes have been made which have especially affected the Munster and Leinster constituencies. However, if we confine the criteria to population considerations there will be serious repercussions for the western region.  Figures compiled by the Western Development Partnership Board show that approximately 9 per cent of the population now lives in the north-west of Ireland, while 41 per cent live in the five eastern counties extending from Counties Louth to Wexford.  In persistently drawing attention to this regional imbalance, the board expresses concern about depopulation and emigration from the north-west.</P>
      <P>Legislation providing for the redrawing of constituencies should make provision for regions which have not only lost population through emigration, but which have experienced internal migration.  For example, cities and towns such as Galway, Castlebar and Letterkenny have grown while rural areas have declined.</P>
      <P>If some of the Department's proposals are implemented there will be a difficulty in providing polling stations, especially if the proposal that there should be 1,000 voters per polling station &mdash; it is approximately 400 to 500 at present &mdash; is implemented.  Such a move would close down many stations, creating problems for voters especially if they have to travel long distances.  The Minister addressed these issues when we previously considered legislation on electoral reform.  However, it must be addressed again, especially in the context of elections to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will act quickly on the question of voting facilities for the disabled. While the special list compiled for disabled voters is welcome, many of them cannot gain access to polling stations.  This matter must be addressed urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about voting at weekends.  It is amazing that we have held elections on almost every day of the week except <Col N="525" /> Saturday or Sunday.  The by-election in Donegal last April was held on a Tuesday, the divorce referendum was held on a Friday and the referendum on bail will be held on a Thursday. Since the divorce referendum, it is generally agreed that it is easier for people to get to polling stations on Fridays.  Students argue that the bail referendum should also be held on a Friday, when many of them would be returning to their constituencies for the weekend.  As we have tried almost every other day of the week, we should now find out if there would be consensus on holding elections on a Saturday or Sunday.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that we cannot announce the result of European elections until the elections are held in other member states.  In the last European elections people here voted on a Thursday, but had to wait until Sunday or Monday to know the result.  That does not make sense.  Voting in European elections should be streamlined throughout the European Union. There has been much talk about having a similar voting system in all EU countries, but I do not believe that will happen.  It might not be even desirable.  However, we should examine the possibility of holding European elections on the same day in all EU countries.</P>
    <P>I support the comments of Deputy Mitchell and others regarding the list system in Germany. I favour the concept of a single seat constituency based on the Norton amendment.  We are told that if that amendment had been put to the people, it would have been carried.  I support a move towards smaller constituencies.  Members may say this would suit Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, but not smaller parties.  I have been a Deputy in a three and four seat constituency and, failing the introduction of a single seat constituency, I favour the concept of a three seat constituency.  In referring to the German system, I am not trying to eliminate small parties who might find it difficult to contest three seat constituencies.  The list system would favour small parties.</P>
    <P>I have been an observer at a number of elections in Europe, particularly when east European countries moved to democracies. During those observation missions I noted that only those parties which got 5 per cent of the vote were represented in parliament.  This indicated the way power would be shared in the new democracies.  I was an observer at elections in Lesotho in Africa where elections had not been held for 20 years.  It is only when one is denied the vote that one cherishes a democracy.  In the case of South Africa and other African countries, people had to queue for hours to vote and then dip their fingers in indelible ink.  The hardship many people endure in order to vote demonstrates its importance.</P>
    <P>Under our proportional representation system, there are between 20,000 and 30,000 head of the population per representative.  For that reason we should consider the concept of a single seat constituency, particularly for European elections. The Connacht-Ulster constituency stretches from <Col N="526" /> the Clare border to Donegal and incorporates other counties in Ulster.  It is difficult for any MEP to cover such a vast constituency.  MEPs get a bad press, most of which relates to expenses. The president of the European Parliament is considering a European rate of pay for all MEPs. Our MEPs get paid less than any other members of the European Parliament.  Therefore, a common European rate of pay would benefit our MEPs.</P>
    <P>We should have the same type of office and research facilities as MEPs.  Our research facilities and staffing levels do not compare with any other parliament in the European Union.  We know from the American students who have come here that members of Congress have large staffing numbers.  In discussing the Bill, and the role of the MEP, we should also seek better facilities for members of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>The issue of voting rights for emigrants was discussed when the Minister of State introduced the Bill on electoral reform.  At that time I said emigrants should have voting rights.  They seek voting rights in European, Dáil and presidential elections and referenda but not in local elections. This is correct because local elections are a matter for people in the various local authority areas.  I propose that recent emigrants could remain on the register of electors in their local constituencies for a certain number of years to enable them to vote for candidates in that constituency.</P>
    <P>The proposal to give three Seanad seats to emigrants' representatives was unacceptable to emigrants' organisations.  It was not regarded as practical and the Government has correctly decided to abandon the idea.  Emigrants do not want Seanad seats, they want voting rights.  One of the arguments against giving emigrants voting rights is that it would be difficult to organise at election time.  However, the European Parliament has a set five year term and if such a term was set for this House, many of the matters which are considered impractical could be overcome.  This reform, and a change to single seat constituencies, should be considered.  It would solve the question raised by many people about the arrangements for ensuring emigrants' votes reach the returning officers in the various constituencies.</P>
    <P>Experts in the field tell me it is possible to use international fax facilities and special identity cards, perhaps detailing the passport numbers of emigrants.  These matters should be considered to ensure the practical problems of emigrants' voting rights are overcome.  The European Union includes 15 countries at present and others wish to join.  It is unfair that emigrants can vote in other countries but not in Ireland.  I do not understand how emigrants' votes could have a disproportionate effect in marginal constituencies.  The same could be said of the postal votes of gardaí, Army personnel and diplomatic staff.  We must accept the principle that emigrants are entitled to vote and not assume they will vote for the Opposition or <Col N="527" /> Government.  It is up to them to choose, in common with all electors, the candidates they wish to support.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on the Bill which consolidates and amends domestic law.  Local elections are due to be held in 1998 while the European elections will be held in 1999.  Will the Minister state whether both elections will be held in 1999?  It has been the practice to hold local elections on the same day as the European elections and perhaps the Minister of State should announce now rather than later that this will be the case in 1999.  However, if the local elections will be held in 1998, Deputies should be told that also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with many of the issues raised by Deputies.  I appreciate this useful and constructive debate.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to consolidate the detailed rules for the conduct of European elections and harmonise them as far as is practicable with the rules relating to Dáil elections which have been revised and consolidated.  Many points were raised, including the dual mandate, the electoral system, improvements in procedures, Sunday voting, speedy counting, photographs on ballot papers, holding European and local elections on the same day, deposits for nominations and the 1994 electoral Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies Kitt and Ahern raised the possibility of holding the European and local elections on the same day.  This is possible and has occurred in the past.  However, the year for the European Parliament elections is fixed throughout the European Union and postponing local elections for a year will be criticised because some councillors will have served eight years without re-election.  A change in the year for the next local elections would require legislation as 1998 is presented in the Local Government Act, 1994, as the year for the elections.</P>
      <P>Other issues raised related to the possibility of including candidates' photographs on ballot papers.  Apart from the principle, the inclusion of photographs would give rise to serious practical difficulties because little time is available during elections for preparing, printing and issuing ballot papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Sunday voting, for direct elections to the European Parliament the Bill provides that European elections must take place between Thursday and Sunday.  Sunday voting would have advantages; it would facilitate people, such as travellers, who are normally away from home on week days, reduce or eliminate school closures, facilitate voters by giving them a wide choice in terms of the time of day at which they could vote and it could increase the percentage poll. However, there are disadvantages and there would be objections on religious grounds from some denominations.  The issue of Sunday voting was raised some years ago with the church leaders <Col N="528" /> and the minority churches indicated that they would be opposed to it on religious and moral grounds while the Catholic Church had no objection.  Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath and some arrangements would be necessary for that community.  In addition, the poll could be reduced because people go away at weekends and because of sporting and other events.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and I will attempt to deal on Committee Stage with the many diverse issues which were raised.</P>

      <Quest>in relation to the EU Parental Leave Directive adopted in March 1996, which requires the Government to make provision for a minimum of three months parental leave on the birth or adoption of a child, the factors which are causing the Government to delay the implementation of this important measure designed to help both men and women to reconcile work and family life; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Directive on the Framework Agreement on Parental Leave was formally adopted, with my support, at the Social Affairs Council I attended in Luxembourg on 3 June 1996.</P>
      <P>Implementation of a provision for parental leave for mothers and fathers is a logical development for my Department at this stage, representing as it does the next in a series of statutory measures I have sponsored aimed at supporting the reconciliation of family life and work commitments.  The Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 which I introduced were important legislative steps in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant aspect of this directive has been the fact that it is based on a framework agreement devised and agreed by employer and worker interests at EU level.  Both IBEC and <Col N="529" /> ICTU, representing Irish employers and workers. participated fully in the development of the framework agreement.  I am sure this involvement will greatly facilitate the preparation and progress of Irish legislation to give effect to this directive.</P>
    <P>I expect the legislation will be enacted within the timeframe provided in the framework agreement appended to the directive.  This timeframe allows two years from 3 June 1996 for implementation of parental leave and an additional one year is provided, if necessary, to take account of particular difficulties or implementation by collective agreement.</P>
    <P>I have no intention to delay implementation of this commitment in the timeframe allowed and contacts for consultation with the social partners on the legislation have already been established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>How many consultations on this proposal have been held to date?  Is it being discussed by the social partners in the context of the new programme for economic and social development under consideration at present? Why can the proposal not be implemented on a phased basis?  Over the years we have seen time and again the various parties involved in such proposals discuss them at length and such proposals end up not being implemented until near the end of the time limit set for their implementation by the European Union.  In the case of the directive on equality payments in 1984, the required proposal was not introduced during the time limit set and that led to large costs being borne.  This proposal providing for a minimum of three months' parental leave involves a relatively simple change.  It could be introduced on a phased basis by granting one month's parental leave in year one, two months in the following year and three months the year after.  Why can the proposal not be implemented on a phased basis rather than waiting until it can be fully implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some consultation has taken place with the social partners.  This matter affects them and consultations with them regarding the details are necessary.  A number of factors must be discussed and resolved with them.</P>
      <P>The directive provides a framework arrangement.  It is left to the discretion of member states to deal with a number of aspects of the implementation of the agreement.  The position on pay and whether a social welfare provision will apply and, if so, to what extent, is left open.  There is no question of any delay on this matter.  It is envisaged by the European Union that up to a two year period is required for its implementation.  The arrangements were only finalised in June this year and work is ongoing in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods's suggestion of a phased introduction of parental leave is interesting and we can consider it.  It may be a possibility.  We must also consider questions as to whether the <Col N="530" /> leave might be sanctioned in several tranches, whether the three months period would have to be taken in the one tranche or could be split and taken at different times during the period of applicability, up to the age of eight.  There is also the question of whether it might be taken on a part-time basis.  A number of aspects of the matter require ongoing consideration and that is being addressed in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good and necessary measure.  In many instances both parents work. They must make arrangements for child care and would very much welcome the provisions in the proposal.  It follows from the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first item to be brought before the Union under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, it is very desirable.  Its purpose is to reconcile work and family life.  We all support it and would welcome its early introduction because of the problems in this area.  I ask the Minister to do what he can to facilitate the early implementation of at least part of the proposal, which would require its implementation on a phased basis.  I cannot understand why there should be a three year delay in its implementation.  A two year delay seems quite extreme.  I envisage that in six or twelve months the Minister will have to have consultations.  I accept that some people will be opposed to the granting of this type of facility to workers, but both sides of the House are committed to reconciling work and family life.  In that context I appeal to the Minister to proceed with the implementation of this important proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods this is a good and desirable measure and one I have been supportive of during my time as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  It is interesting to note that the issue was discussed at Social Affairs Council meetings as far back as 1983 and it was only in June 1996, as a result of the efforts of a number of countries including Ireland, that we succeeded in progressing it to the extent to which it has been implemented.</P>
      <P>The agreement provides that the provision can be implemented in two ways, by way of legislation or collective agreement.  That issue must be discussed with the social partners.  I agree that in Ireland's case the probability is that the provision would need to be implemented by way of legislation rather than collective agreement. Nevertheless, that is an option under the framework agreement which must be discussed and considered by my Department, the social partners and me.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has found a solution which will reconcile the legitimate interests of licensed vintners, hoteliers, shopowners and restaurateurs and the essential objective in the Equal Status Bill of outlawing discrimination on grounds of race, religion, class or ethnic origin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The enactment of equal status legislation is necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965.</P>
      <P>In preparing this Bill I have had a series of meetings with vintners and other service providers, including IBEC and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, and have invited proposals for safeguards to be included in the Bill which would meet their concerns.  A number of constructive proposals have been made and these have been carefully considered in my Department.  Discussions with the draftsman are ongoing.  However, I intend to ensure that the Equal Status Bill, while meeting its essential objective of outlawing discrimination on specified grounds, will not harm the legitimate interests of vintners, hoteliers, shopowners and restaurateurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there is great concern about the way in which the Bill will be implemented.  This was heightened when in the Circuit Court in New Ross, County Wexford &mdash; this set a precedent &mdash; an award of £10,820 plus costs was made in favour of a person assaulted in a pub.  To add insult to injury for the publican, the two people who carried out the assault were convicted and fined in the District Court.  The pub owner stood accused and was told that he had a duty and a responsibility to break up the fracas and ensure that the people involved were removed.  This frightened a great number of publicans in relation to the proposed legislation. They are worried about what might happen, especially in the lead-up to Christmas.</P>
      <P>When does the Minister expect to be in a position to introduce the Bill?  He mentioned that discussions are ongoing with the Attorney General's Office.  This does not surprise me.  I appreciate his difficulty in introducing anti-discrimination measures and, at the same time, maintaining the right of publicans, restaurateurs and those who run supermarkets to keep a good house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach informed the House recently, I hope to introduce the legislation before Christmas.  I share the Deputy's concerns.  We are dealing with two sets of equally important rights and both have validity.  There are the rights of publicans and business owners as far as their premises are concerned and the rights of disadvantaged groups not to be discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said many times that it is essential for Ireland to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <Col N="532" /> Discrimination which has been ratified by over 140 countries worldwide, including all the other member states of the European Union.  It cannot be ratified unless and until the equal status legislation is in place.</P>
    <P>A number of helpful and constructive suggestions have been put to me by the two main vintners' associations.  They are being looked at carefully and were furnished in a co-operative and constructive manner.  I cannot say what the final format of the legislation will be, it is still in the course of finalisation.  I look forward to a good discussion when it is introduced and I hope Deputies will agree I have struck a reasonable balance between the two sets of conflicting rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that pub owners will be able to set the standards that they want to achieve when the legislation is in place? There is a variety of pubs, many of which maintain exceptional standards.  Will the Minister ensure when the legislation is finalised by the draftsman that managers will be able to run a good public house, restaurant and supermarket?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation will not interfere with anybody's rights to maintain the standards that he or she thinks are appropriate in his or her premises.  We are talking about discrimination against a person on the grounds that he or she belongs to one of the categories of people who will be protected by the legislation as required by the UN Convention.  We are talking about racism and its offshoots, not the rights of the owners of premises to set standards.  This is acceptable as long as they are enforced on an equal basis across the board.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>whether an agreement has been reached by the Government to trade-off the attainment of equality for women in employment against the need to provide employment for young males or any other socially disadvantaged groups.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20705/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of the Government trading off the objective of attainment of equality for women in employment against the need to provide employment for young males or any other socially disadvantaged group.  I have already presented to this House in recent weeks an Employment Equality Bill which maintains a strong focus on prohibiting discrimination in employment based on sex.  While the Bill also <Col N="533" /> seeks to prohibit discrimination in employment on grounds of age and other non gender characteristics. it does not provide exclusions from the commitment to prohibit discrimination based on sex to provide employment for young males, or any other socially disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>The Bill prohibits discrimination in employment against young males on equal terms with its protection of young females.  Existing employment equality legislation in Ireland and Europe has already been successfully applied to protect men from discrimination in employment as well as women.</P>
    <P>The particular phenomenon of young, unqualified males failing to gain access to the labour force to an extent reflects the higher achievement of young women in education.  The 1995 ESRI annual survey of school leavers shows that some 64 per cent of school leavers with no qualifications or minimum qualifications were boys.  Both the Department of Education and the Department of Enterprise and Employment are tackling this problem through the Government's Youthreach programme.  I understand the Department of Education has increased its capacity under this programme from 600 places in 1989 to 2,000 places today and a further 450 places are planned.  FÁS also provides 1,800 places on Youthreach and in addition provides other developmental training places geared to the needs of young unqualified persons.</P>
    <P>I endorse these necessary actions aimed at improving both the educational qualifications and labour market potential of young people.  The initiatives do not, however, dissipate the thrust of actions aimed at the broader sex inequalities of the market place which the Employment Equality Bill is intended to address and which continue to receive attention by the education and training authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Concern was expressed about remarks made in this House about the position of young men and there must be an understanding of their position. Despite the fact that the performance of girls in examinations and so on is better than that of boys, many women are in low paid, low status occupations.  What is the Minister's view of the fact that there is 50 per cent more unemployment among young men than young women?  How was that figure arrived at and what is his understanding of the reasons for that?  Since the performance of girls is better than that of boys, why are so many women in low paid, low status occupations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach recently answered questions on this matter.  I am responsible for equality in the broad sense as between men and women, boys and girls and disadvantaged groups in society.  The Employment Equality Bill, Second Stage of which has been passed in this House, is a broadly based measure which seeks <Col N="534" /> to address access to employment and promotion in employment as between men and women.  That is the objective of my Department and will continue to be so.  There are reports on these matters and Deputies may raise questions with the appropriate Departments.  I indicated the important steps being taken, particularly by the Departments of Education and Enterprise and Employment, to secure greater balance and to open up training and educational opportunities for young males and young females.  Efforts in that regard have substantially increased and will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister whether an agreement has been reached by the Government to trade off the attainment of equality for women in employment against the need to provide employment for young males or any other socially disadvantaged groups.  Women's organisations expressed concern about a statement by the Taoiseach during a meeting with the social partners at the end of October that gender equality requires continued advances for women.  I welcome that statement and the fact that the issue is on the table for discussion by the social partners.  The Taoiseach however went on to say: &ldquo;...but it also involves major changes in job prospects and the social role of men, an issue that has not yet been addressed in any serious way&rdquo;.  The problem arose because of the &ldquo;but&rdquo;, if the Taoiseach had left out that word people would not have been upset.  There is major discrimination against women which must be addressed and there are separate problems for young men.  Is the Minister in favour of including on the live register women in the home who are anxious to return to work?  This is a fundamental issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's view on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter question is a separate matter which is appropriate to a different Minister.  Numerous questions were put to the Taoiseach about his statement and he dealt with them at some length in the House on 30 October last &mdash; I refer Deputies to his clarification and explanations on that statement.  On whether the Government has agreed to trade off the attainment of equality for women, I do not know whether that question is seriously put.  I assure Deputy Woods that there is no agreement for any such trade off.  The Government's policy in this regard is as enunciated in the Employment Equality Bill which is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that even with legislation in place old attitudes die hard?  Is he aware that women's organisations in particular understood the Taoiseach &mdash; it is unfortunate that <Col N="535" /> this message may have been received by them &mdash; to mean that as a result of an increasing number of women in the workplace there is less work for young men, in other words that gender equity has resulted in fewer places for young men?  I would like reassurance from the Minister in that regard. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding, but that is the message received by women's organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach clarified his position when questioned about this matter in the House on 30 October.  If Deputies want further clarification on the Taoiseach's statement in the context of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work they may put questions to him.  As far as Government policy is concerned, that is reflected in the Employment Equality Bill in which equal opportunities for the sexes is spelt out in great detail.  That is not just equality for women but also for men, people with disabilities and anti-discrimination for employment on the grounds of race, colour, age and membership of the travelling community as given in great detail in the Bill.  That is the legislative measure but I agree with Deputy Keogh that old attitudes die hard.  They are still there and more than legislation is required.  We must all address those old attitudes in our own way.  They die hard but they are dying.  It is up to the Government of the day to give a lead and this Government is doing that by bringing in the Employment Equality Bill and providing protection for the first time in the employment context for disadvantaged groups who had never been given that legislative protection in the history of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that when the Employment Equality Bill is enacted women in the home who want to avail of training and community employment schemes and to be included on the register of the unemployed will have the right to do so without being regarded as dependants of their husbands and being excluded on those grounds?  At present they are allowed into pubs, restaurants and supermarkets but they are not allowed into this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of adequate facilities to assist in alleviating the difficulties and traumas of couples who are experiencing difficulties in their marriage, has always been a concern of mine.  On my appointment as Minister for Equality and Law Reform I was determined to give practical effect to that concern.  Accordingly, I accorded permanent status to the family mediation service which, since its establishment in 1986, had operated on a pilot basis with no certainty of permanence.  Also, I instituted a scheme of grants for voluntary organisations which provide counselling to couples who are experiencing difficulties in their marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department commenced funding marriage counselling organisations in 1994.  Prior to then grants to these organisations were administered by the Department of Health and from time to time supplementary grants were paid by the Department of Social Welfare.  In 1993, for example, approximately £300,000 was allocated by these Departments to voluntary counselling groups.  In 1994 and again in 1995 my Department <Col N="537" /> paid out £750,000 in grants to such groups and £900,000 is available for distribution in 1996. Also, the scheme has been extended this year to include the provision of assistance to organisations providing counselling to children of parents who had separated.</P>
    <P>Significant tangible benefits have accrued from the scheme of grants to counselling organisations. Premises and facilities have been improved as has training for counsellors and supervisors.  The total number of counselling hours provided by grantaided organisations has increased from 44,166 hours in 1993 to 69,703 hours in 1995.  There has also been a very significant increase in pre-marriage courses over the years.  The provision of significant and regular funding will facilitate further improvements in the provision of counselling services to couples and children.</P>
    <P>The family mediation service operated by my Department is a professional confidential service which enables couples, who have decided to separate or who have already separated, to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a trained mediator, without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  All issues are included in the negotiations, such as ongoing parenting of the children, the family home, family finances. pensions property and any other relevant issues relevant to the separation.</P>
    <P>As part of a programme for development and expansion of the family mediation service, two new posts of area mediation co-ordinator have been created, one for the existing family mediation service centre at the Irish Life Mall, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin and one for the new centre at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick. Competitions to select suitable people for these positions have been held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission and appointments are imminent.  The persons appointed will be responsible for the delivery of a quality mediation service, with the assistance of a team of mediators. each for his or her own geographical areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The appointment of area mediation co-ordinators will facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice, who have the necessary training and experience and otherwise meet the standards set by the family mediation service, to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre or to relieve the pressure on the centres at Dublin and Limerick.  The allocation of cases to private mediators would be done through the family mediation service.</P>
    <P>Deputies can rest assured that I will continue in my endeavours to ensure that quality counselling and mediation services are available for the future and that adequate funding is made available to this end.</P>

      <P>I agree that adequate funding should be made available for mediation and counselling services.  What is the position regarding the centre in Limerick?  Are there any <Col N="538" /> projections on needs over the coming 12 months in relation to the number of cases or is this being done on an affordability basis rather than on the basis of presentation of cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to assess the number of cases.  We are expanding the service.  New staff have been taken on and the Limerick centre is new.  Regrettably, the number of marriage breakdowns is increasing substantially so there is a need for this service.  One anticipates it will be an increasing phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Mediation is a very important service as it enables many couples to avoid having recourse to the courts with the trauma, expense and delay that involves.  Research also shows this is desirable in that when a separation arrangement is negotiated voluntarily between the parties through mediation, it has greater chance of being respected in all its aspects than one imposed by a court.  I have always regarded the provision of a mediation service as important.  That is the reason I secured the necessary finance for the second centre in Limerick.  I will complete the arrangements as soon as possible to avail of the services of private mediators in other locations. Unfortunately, there are not too many.  Those who are available and suitably qualified and who are prepared to participate in this arrangement through the family mediation service will be placed on its books and their services will be availed of.</P>

      <P>The Minister said there was an increase of more than 50 per cent in the hours of counselling between 1993 and 1995.  Has the Minister estimated the increase for next year? The Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996, comes back to the House from the Seanad next week. Presumably, it will go to the President for signature.  Within a short time its provisions will be implemented.  Has the Minister estimated the level of counselling which will need to be provided after the Bill is passed when there will be an expected increase in the number seeking counselling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always difficult to forecast the level of marriage breakdown and the requirement for counselling services.  There has been a substantial improvement in facilities available due to the increase in grants.  The number of hours I mentioned were for 1995.  I imagine the number of hours that will be availed of will be even greater in 1996.  This is something which my Department will have to monitor carefully as time goes by.  We are in close consultation with the marriage counselling organisations which do remarkable work, mainly voluntary.  We will review the situation from time to time and make whatever arrangements are reasonably possible and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marriage counselling arose in the context of marriage breakdown rather than divorce which will add a new dimension to the situation.  The <Col N="539" /> unavailability of a divorce jurisdiction, did not stop marriages breaking down in increasing numbers in the years for which we have statistics. The marriage counselling organisations have been addressing that.  By and large, they are reasonably content with the level of funding and assistance we have given them in the past couple of years.  That is not to say we provide enough. No matter how much one provides in such a situation, more can always be used.</P>
    <P>We have a good relationship with these organisations and they appreciate the funding we have made available to them.  It has enabled them to make sea changes in the service they provide not only in the hours of service delivered but also in the quality and calibre of service.  They have used part of the grant money to improve the level of training and expertise of counsellors, which is important.  Not only has the volume of the service increased, but so too has the quality.  The organisations are anxious to provide the most professional counsellors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the increased allocation to marriage counselling and mediation services.  We must acknowledge that funding increased from £300,000 to £900,000 between 1993 to 1996.  We are talking, to a large extent, about marriage breakdown and what happens after that.  Will the Minister outline what grants are available to improve pre-marriage counselling and advice services to ensure those getting married know what they face?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the organisations provide pre-marriage counselling as well as counselling to couples whose marriages are in difficulty or have broken down.  Another factor which has been introduced following consultation is the question of counselling for children.  That is something which Deputy Woods, in particular, will welcome as it is an issue on which he has focused.  It is nice to be able to tell the House that it is an increasingly important aspect of the work of counselling organisations.</P>
      <P>As regards the money available, £900,000 is available for distribution in 1996 to the marriage counselling organisations.  I cannot say what the figure will be in 1997 as it has not been determined.  A large number of counselling organisations have been grant aided, the largest being ACCORD which is a nationwide organisations.  ACCORD provides an excellent professional service at various locations.  Other organisations are locally based in Cork and elsewhere.  There is a long list of organisations and we do the best we can for them in recognition of the remarkable service which so many who work in them provide voluntarily.  They deserve our thanks and appreciation for that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase in funding for marriage counselling.  Do we place too much emphasis on family mediation rather <Col N="540" /> than on marriage counselling?  Most or all the funding for marriage counselling goes to voluntary bodies.  However, the Government is setting up family mediation agencies.  More emphasis should be placed on trying to keep marriages together.  As Deputy Woods said, there was an increase of more than 50 per cent in hours between 1993 and 1995.  I notice that in the same period funding increased by 150 per cent.  Why has there not been a corresponding increase in the number of hours?</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the improved quality of the service.  How does his Department monitor that and ensure a quality service?  The Minister said one of the problems in the family mediation area is the lack of qualified professionals.  Are there any plans in place to provide additional training so that we will have more professional mediators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no immediate plans for a further family mediation centre.  The centre in Limerick is the first to be opened since the original formation of the family mediation service with its initial centre in Dublin.  My concern is to get the Limerick centre operating and also the scheme involving the private mediators.  When that operation is in place and working well we can reassess the situation.  By that time the divorce jurisdiction will be operational and we can see if any further expansion is required, appropriate or possible in the context of the availability of the trained mediators without whom none of this could operate.</P>
      <P>The question of training of mediators is not a matter for my Department but the national organisation is doing its best in this regard.  The main advantage of having the additional centre in Limerick is that it and the Dublin centre will be a source of training and practical experience for new mediators because the people working there will have the opportunity to gain the necessary practice and experience.  One can have all the education one likes but without the practical experience on the ground of dealing with these cases, the full benefit cannot be achieved from it.</P>
      <P>For the information of Members who are obviously interested in the whole mediation concept, I thought I knew something about this but I was taken aback when I visited the Family Mediation Centre in Dublin at the remarkable way in which the system operates.  One would think that a couple goes in for an hour or two but it is not at all like that.  for each couple it is an extraordinarily extensive process involving six hours or more.  Every aspect of the family is examined &mdash; children, pensions, income, property division and so on.  Every detail of the marriage is gone through in a relaxed manner and with great care.  That is a time consuming operation and one can imagine the great skill that is required on the part of the mediators.  It is an excellent State service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally wanted to know the reason the number of hours available has not increased <Col N="541" /> pro rata with the additional grant aid.  That is not an easy question to answer and there may be various explanations for it.  The range and type of counselling is expanding.  Pre-marriage counselling and counselling for children is on the increase and the quality of the service is improving.  Greater effort is being applied, and they are right in this regard, by the marriage counselling organisations to additional training for counsellors because great skill is required on their part, not quite to the same level as applies to mediators, but it is nonetheless of importance in the critical work they do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us he cannot say how much the Government will allocate to this service next year, and I appreciate that is a matter for the forthcoming Estimate, but I asked him to indicate the estimated requirement for next year. His Department must have done some calculation on this.  We have told the public we are concerned about this matter and that we will try to anticipate their needs and meet them accordingly.  Has the Minister's Department done any work on estimating the needs in mediation for next year?  I assume that has been done and that there is an estimate of the demand because the new legislation will be enacted next year and it is therefore a critical issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The marriage counselling organisations carry out their own assessments of requirements and submit their applications to my Department for grant aid to enable them meet those requirements.  As far as I know the demands on the voluntary marriage counselling organisations are met and any person who requires counselling can have reasonably ready access to that service by one or other of the counselling organisations.  That is something they keep under review and we are in consultation with them on it.  The counselling requirement is reasonably met by the voluntary organisations with the assistance of the grant aid we provide.  I do not have a particular calculation of the estimated number of marriage breakdowns in the years ahead but it is substantial and that is the reason substantially increased funding has been provided by my Department for that purpose. That position will be kept under ongoing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that not only should there be an examination of the numbers of people who might approach counselling services but his Department should have a role in calculating the current waiting period for those services.  I was on the executive of a marriage counselling service and we were of the view that the quicker people availed of a counselling service, the better chance they had of some type of reconciliation.  The earlier the intervention, the better are the prospects for the future.  Is it proposed, either by the Minister's Department or the Department of Health, to have a register of mediators and to have some <Col N="542" /> acknowledgment of the level of training required in this area?  Is that currently monitored and, if not, will it be monitored in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it there is currently no statutory base for the professional mediator but the national organisation operates some system in that regard on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to which its own members are affiliated.  I do not know the standards it applies; that possibly comes under the ambit of another Minister.  I do not have a particular role although I accepted an amendment in the Seanad yesterday that will enable me to make regulations in that regard. That is something which may arise at a later stage but it does not arise now.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The most commonly quoted figures on the male/female wage differential are for production workers in manufacturing industry where women's hourly earnings are almost three quarters of the earnings of their male counterparts.  This group represents less than the one in five of all female employees and the statistics may not, therefore, be representative of female employment as a whole.</P>
      <P>For this reason a special study on male/female wage differentials across the economy was commissioned from the Economic and Social Research Institute by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency.  The aim of the study was to provide a better measure of the average gap between men's and women's hourly earnings generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This study, published in February 1994, found that, taking all sectors into account, women's hourly earnings were 80 per cent of men's.  Half of the 20 per cent wage gap found in the 1994 study is explained in the ESRI study by differences in productivity-related factors, such as length of labour market experience.  The unexplained gap of 10 per cent reflects a lack of knowledge on the impact of wage determination <Col N="543" /> processes and, probably, to some extent, the residual effect of past discrimination.</P>
    <P>The results of the ESRI study clearly indicates a lesser wage gap between men's and women's earnings in employment generally than in the more limited manufacturing sector where earnings trends are the subject of regular publication by the Central Statistics Office. Nevertheless, it must be said that there is no exaggeration of the wage gap within the manufacturing sector and whatever the wage gap generally or by reference to the manufacturing sector, efforts must continue to further reduce any gaps.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Employment Equality Bill can make a contribution to this process.  In addition, I await with interest the conclusions of the forthcoming Seminar on Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value being held later this month by the Employment Equality Agency which operates under the aegis of my Department.  This event will bring together national and international expertise in the equal pay area and will consider the recent Code of Practice on Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value published by the European Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Notwithstanding the fact that we have had slightly better information since 1994, would the Minister accept that the information gap on trends in women's pay hampers the discussion of the position of women at work?  In the European Union, women earn on average between 30 and 40 per cent less than men for non-manual jobs and between 15 and 35 per cent less for manual work in manufacturing.  These findings are a salutary lesson.  It must be of concern that women are locked into low-paid low status occupations. Does the Minister consider that there might be other ways of arriving at more accurate figures relating to women's pay in the workforce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Keogh.  A new ESRI report would be helpful and desirable.  The findings of the 1994 report on pay differentials were largely based on data collected by the ESRI in their 1987 survey of income distribution.  I understand from the ESRI that this information has been updated to 1994 and would be available for a follow-up report.  They may be able to tackle that task next year.  This is a complex area and the differential is due to quite a number of factors. Different figures appear on the manufacturing side and in women's employment generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress is being made in some areas.  There has been an improvement in the hourly rates over recent years but much remains to be done.  The weekly rates in manufacturing industry as reported for men were 58.5 per cent in 1985.  It increased to 60 per cent in 1987.  The greater disparity between weekly rates and hourly rates arose from the greater impact on earnings of longer working hours for men on the weekly data. <Col N="544" /> In December 1995, the average hours worked per week by females in industry was 37.6 or 89 per cent of the male average of 42.4.  In regard to hourly rates, there has been a gradual improvement.  The 1992 figure was 70 per cent. That rose to 73 per cent by 1995.  Much remains to be done.  The Employment Equality Bill will have some impact, but further research is necessary.  Perhaps the seminar organised by the Employment Equality Agency which will look at the position from a Europe-based perspective will be helpful also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that the Employment Equality Bill will resolve some of these matters, but unless we have some form of comparator within the Bill, we will end up as we were.  Would the Minister agree that it is necessary to have some form of comparator, especially for those industries in which there is not already an agreement about pay and conditions?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister also agree that women are discriminated against mainly in relation to part-time employment because the vast majority of part-time employees are women, and the terms and conditions which apply in part time employment can be particularly restrictive?  One of the conditions is that part-time workers do not have even pro rata occupational pensions.  Part-time employment is more and more a feature of the marketplace.  Women working in such jobs are excluded from pension cover, and this is an indirect way of discriminating against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of direct or indirect discrimination against women in employment is addressed in the Employment Equality Bill. Equality reviews and action plans may well be appropriate, and the Bill gives the Equality Authority power to look into various aspects of employment equality and the issue of wage differentials between men and women.  I agree with Deputy Woods that a comparator is necessary, and on equal pay claims the question of a comparator arises.  However, the question of an hypothetical comparator, that is a notional comparator, is a different matter.  That is not provided for in the Bill for good reasons which I will be happy to go into, if necessary, on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it expected that the equality authority will be extremely busy because we are talking about 83 per cent of women involved in the workforce for whom we do not have a proper comparator mechanism?  We are still depending on outdated figures.  This suggests we are totally over representing the level of pay of women in the workforce.  The urgency of a male comparator is underlined by that fact.  Unless we have such a comparator we will not have equality regarding pay in the workplace.</P>

I do not mind discussing the hypothetical comparator now but it may be more appropriate to our Committee Stage discussions on the Employment Equality Bill.</P>

      <P>The working group on child care facilities for working parents which reported in February 1994 made 16 recommendations covering a wide range of issues in the child care area.  Progress continues to be made in responding to the recommendations of this report which are targeted at a wide range of community, public service and private sector interests.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, will introduce before the end of the year regulations to give effect to Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, which provides for the supervision and inspection of pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, published a booklet earlier this year entitled Introducing Family Friendly Initiatives in the Workplace.  This publication, in identifying a number of initiatives and options available to employers which facilitate equal opportunities in employment and promote family friendly policies, will assist the social partners in pursuing those recommendations relevant to them.</P>
      <P>Support and assistance for the provision of local child care initiatives and increased child care places has been the aim of a scheme of funding in my Department to assist in the development of a number of pilot child care projects in disadvantaged areas.  Grant aid under the scheme, which is being administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management (ADM) Limited, is available in respect of startup capital costs.  To date, a total of £1,250,000 has been issued to 73 approved projects.  An evaluation of the scheme is currently under way. A further £600,000 has been provided in my Department's Estimate this year for new projects under the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the National Development Plan, the Human Resources Operational Programme of the Community Support Framework has set aside a total of nearly £8 million to support equal opportunities measures, including child care initiatives, over the period of the programme. As part of this, FÁS in its contribution over the next few years has committed £1.5 million to child <Col N="546" /> care training measures and will supplement this with support for child care facilities for its trainees.  In addition, from 1997 to the end of the Operational Programme, the Department of Education will devote £900,000 each year to support child care provision for participants on the vocational opportunities scheme and Youthreach programme.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has brought the question of the need for child care facilities to the attention of the relevant planning authorities as a point for consideration by them in the examination and granting of planning applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response. Will the Minister agree to communicate with me in respect of each of the 16 recommendations and the progress being made on each to date?  In relation to inspection and supervision of pre-school child care facilities will the Minister indicate the criteria laid down for such facilities? Most Members will agree that much money is being spent on the provision of child care.  To send a child to any crèche facility for part or duration of a day the minimum expenditure would probably be in excess of £50 per week.  For somebody working and earning £150, after tax, levies, PRSI etc., a £50 plus expenditure is relatively high.  Will the Minister agree that such expenditure should be embroidered into the tax allowance system?</P>

      <P>It is obvious that anything involving tax is a matter for the Minister for Finance, not for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister for Health will introduce before the end of the year regulations to give effect to Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, which provides for the supervision and inspection of pre-school services.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to ask the Minister for Health, he is available for questions. There is no point in asking me on what criteria he will work.  It is contained in the Child Care Act and the Deputy may question him about it. The cost of leaving a child in a crèche or in a child care facility varies.  I am aware that at least some of the crèche facilities which were set up as <Col N="547" /> a result of grant aid from my Department operate a scheme under which people or parents who cannot afford to pay what may be the standard rate are allowed to leave their children at the facility on a reduced fee basis or, in some cases, on a no fee basis.  Some 73 projects have been approved under the scheme, many of which I have visited.  They are working extremely well and provide an excellent facility in disadvantaged areas.  If any Deputy is aware of a group which wishes to set up a facility in a disadvantaged area I urge him or her to communicate with my Department as we are anxious to assist in getting such a child care facility under way under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should listen to the answer to his question.  When I took office I found that no previous Government had done anything about setting up any child care projects. I initiated that operation as a result of which 73 approved child care projects are up and running. That scheme is ongoing and I invite any group interested in such a facility in a disadvantaged area to communicate with my Department where it will receive a sympathetic hearing.  I am sure Deputy McDowell will agree that is a very welcome development.  It is new and was not initiated by any Government prior to the Labour-Fianna Fáil Government of 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter on which I am about to make a statement to the House is one of great seriousness.  As soon as I was informed of the Attorney General's advice yesterday evening that some recent decisions taken in the Special Criminal Court were unsound I ordered that the relevant prisoners be released.  I instructed the Secretary of the Department of Justice to immediately investigate the circumstances around the problem.</P>
      <P>I will give as accurately as I can all of the information I have at this time, as the investigation in my Department is still continuing. I will come back to the House to expand on the information I am giving today when the inquiry is completed.  Either way, I will inform the House of the outcome of the inquiry.</P>
      <P>The facts, in so far as they can be established at this stage, are as follows.  On 2 July 1996 Judge Dominic Lynch wrote to me reiterating an earlier request to be relieved of his duties in the Special Criminal Court.  I decided to accede to Judge Lynch's request and directed the courts division of my Department to prepare a memorandum for Government.  This was submitted to the Government on 1 August and the Government decided on that day to relieve Judge Lynch from the Special Criminal Court and to appoint Judge Kevin Haugh to that court.  A copy of the Government decision was forwarded to my Department by the Government secretariat in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision was photocopied and circulated by my office to various officials, including officials in the courts division.  This is in accordance with standard practice for all Government decisions, and the standard practice is for the division dealing with the particular issue which is the subject of a Government decision to take the necessary steps to implement it.</P>
      <P>The precise circumstances relating to the handling of the Government decision to relieve Judge Lynch by my Department are now the subject of a detailed inquiry and all those who had any responsibility are in the process of making a statement.  I am aware at this stage of some of the facts.  I have been advised that disclosure of partial information could be misleading to the House and possibly leave the propriety of the inquiry procedures open to challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The decision was transmitted to the courts section of my Department.  The warrant of appointment for the replacement judge was received by my Department and transmitted to the courts.  What is clear is, for whatever reason, Judge Lynch was not informed of his removal and continued to serve on the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>On 3 October I received a letter written to me by the Attorney General on 2 October, 1996 indicating he had been in conversation with Judge Harvey Kenny who stated there was an impression among the Judiciary that Judge Lynch was still a member of the Special Criminal Court. The Attorney requested me to establish whether the Government decision had been notified to Judge Lynch and the President of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>That letter was received in my private office and referred directly to the relevant section for attention without being brought to my attention. I have ascertained that draft letters were prepared by the courts division informing Judge Lynch and the President of the Special Criminal Court of the Government decision.  These letters, however, had not been finalised up to yesterday. This aspect of the matter is also the subject of the inquiry now under way.</P>
    <P>I received a letter on 5 November from the Attorney General stating he had noted that Judge Lynch still appeared to be functioning as a judge of the Special Criminal Court.  That letter was received in my office on 5 November and I saw it that afternoon on my way to a meeting in Dublin Castle.  I immediately phoned the principal officer in the courts division of my Department and asked him to clarify the situation.  I attended the talks in Belfast yesterday and did not have further contact on the matter until I spoke to the Secretary of the Department later yesterday evening.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>I am advised by my Department that shortly before 5 p.m. on 6 November an assistant secretary in the Department, who is not in the courts division, became aware that a serious problem had arisen in that division regarding cases in the Special Criminal Court heard since 1 August by a court that included Judge Dominic Lynch.  The assistant secretary, who was unable to contact the Secretary of the Department and me at that time as we were both returning from Northern Ireland, consulted the Attorney General's office immediately to get advice on the course of action to be taken.  The assistant secretary was advised by that office that as the cases affected appeared to relate to prosecutions that were in being, it should be left to the DPP's office initially to determine the appropriate course of action.  On that basis my office contacted the DPP's office.  The Secretary of my Department, who was returning with my private secretary by car from Baldonnel, having attended the talks in Belfast yesterday, received a call on his mobile phone at about 6.50 p.m. from the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána <Col N="551" /> who informed him of the problems which had arisen.  The Deputy Commissioner also indicated that, following consultation with the DPP he was making arrangements to have gardaí in place in case it became necessary to bring prisoners to a court or another location.  My private secretary then informed the Secretary that correspondence had been received from the Attorney General who had queried the circumstances in which Judge Lynch still appeared to be hearing cases in the Special Criminal Court despite the Government decision of 1 August.  The letter to which he referred was the one received by me on 5 November.</P>
    <P>The Secretary has informed me that this was the first he had heard of any problem in relation to this matter.  He had no knowledge that the Department had failed to issue notice of the Government decision to Judge Lynch and had no knowledge of the correspondence received from the Attorney General to which I have referred earlier.  The Secretary immediately phoned the principal officer in the courts division of the Department for information.  He was informed that notice had not issued to Judge Lynch, that the judge had continued to sit in the Special Criminal Court and that an issue arose about the validity of decisions made by the court in cases heard by Judge Lynch.</P>
    <P>When he reached the Department at about 7 p.m., the Secretary immediately phoned the DPP in his office.  The phone was busy but, when he spoke to him at about 7.20 p.m., the DPP, who said he had consulted counsel at length, confirmed the basic facts and said it appeared that the validity of the decisions made in the cases in question was open to doubt.  He emphasised, however, that, as the issues raised did not involve a flaw in the criminal proceedings themselves but related to the capacity of the court to make valid decisions in the circumstances described, he could not purport to give formal legal advice on the matter.  This would, properly speaking, be a matter for the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The DPP also said that if proceedings were instituted by the prisoners, they would need to be brought to court.  He indicated that he was in contact with the Garda on this matter.  The DPP finally said he intended to contact the senior legal assistant in the Attorney General's office to suggest that formal legal advice on the matter was a question for the Attorney General.  The Secretary asked the DPP to ask the senior legal assistant to phone him either at his own office or the office of the Taoiseach, where he was due to attend an official-level meeting about an unrelated matter, immediately following the conversation between the DPP and the senior legal assistant.</P>
    <P>The senior legal assistant phoned the Secretary at about 7.50 p.m. and said he believed that the advice he would be giving to the Attorney General would be to the effect that the court decisions already referred to were unsound for <Col N="552" /> legal reasons.  He hoped to be in contact shortly with the Attorney General who would probably take his own advice from counsel.</P>
    <P>Following his meeting in the Taoiseach's office at about 9.30 p.m. the Secretary advised an assistant secretary in my Department, by phone, that the principal officer responsible for prison operations should be advised of what was taking place and of the possibility that prisoners whose cases had been heard by Judge Lynch, as a member of the Special Criminal Court, might be released very soon either to attend court or travel elsewhere.</P>
    <P>At 9.44 p.m. the Secretary received, on his mobile phone, from the senior legal assistant in the Attorney General's office the formal advice of the Attorney General that the prisoners in question should be released as soon as possible. The senior legal assistant said that he was to be phoned with confirmation of the action taken when it was taken.  The Secretary decided that the Attorney General's advice should be conveyed to the Minister and that the Deputy Garda Commissioner and the principal officer in the prisons division should be advised of the developments.  The Deputy Commissioner indicated that, on the advice of the DPP, the prisoners, if released, would be rearrested and brought before the Special Criminal Court today. The Secretary, who knew from earlier in the day that I would be attending the &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; film at that time, contacted my private secretary from his home and said that he needed to speak to me immediately.  I spoke to the Secretary at about 10.20/10.30 p.m. and, having heard the legal advice and the Secretary's recommendation, I ordered that the prisoners be released.  I also directed the Secretary to conduct an immediate investigation into all the circumstances and to report to me at the earliest opportunity.  That investigation is now under way and all staff believed to have had an involvement in this matter have been asked by the Secretary to make written statements.</P>
    <P>The Secretary has recommended &mdash; and I am accepting his recommendation &mdash; that in the particular circumstances which have arisen here, and in order to avoid any suggestion of a lack of objectivity, it would be right to have a person or persons outside the Department involved in this investigation.  I have asked the Secretary to discuss this aspect of the matter with the public service division of the Department of Finance today.  I also asked the Secretary to inform the Taoiseach's office of the situation.  He contacted the Taoiseach's private secretary at about 11.50 p.m. and I am advised that the Taoiseach became aware of the situation at about 12.25 a.m.  I spoke to the Taoiseach at 12.30 a.m.  Following my conversation with him at about 10.45 p.m., the Secretary phoned the principal officer in the prisons division and conveyed my instruction to release the prisoners.  He also advised the Deputy Garda Commissioner of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> The principal officer in the prisons division informed the Secretary that, on the basis of his earlier phone calls, the prison governors had initiated the steps necessary to release the prisoners.  In the case of Portlaoise Prison, extra prison staff needed to be on duty given the numbers involved and the need to ensure that proper order prevailed.  This involved the recall of staff who were off duty.  The Secretary asked both the principal officer in the prisons division and the Deputy Garda Commissioner to let him know when the prisoners were released and whether they had been rearrested.  I was in touch with the Secretary by phone on several occasions during the night and asked him to inform me immediately the releases had taken place.  The Secretary was advised at around 2 a.m. that all the prisoners had been released and rearrested and he conveyed that message to me.  At 11.35 a.m. this morning the Secretary was informed by an assistant Garda Commissioner that on the advice of the DPP a further prisoner should be released from Portlaoise Prison as it had been confirmed that his case had also been dealt with by Judge Lynch subsequent to 1 August.  That person has also been released on my instructions and has been rearrested by the Garda.  About half an hour ago I was advised that five other persons who appeared before Judge Lynch in special courts since 1 August were granted bail.  I have asked the Attorney General to advise me on this matter.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts as I have them now.  As I said at the beginning of my statement, this is a matter of great seriousness and it is right that the House should be given the facts.  On behalf of my Department, I convey regret to all those who have been discommoded in any way because of its failure to follow standard procedures in this matter.  There should be a full, speedy and impartial inquiry into all the circumstances of this case and the House should be informed of the outcome of the inquiry.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech contained a tremendous amount of obfuscation. It was an attempt to construct a smokescreen around this sorry saga and a blatant effort to ensure that the Minister for Justice would escape accountability and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government decision was made on 1 August last, the Minister having been informed around the beginning of July that the judge in question wished to be delisted from the Special Criminal Court.  Between 1 August and now a judge has been sitting on the Special Criminal Court, the most sensitive court in the land, and nobody in the Department of Justice or the Government, not even the Minister for Justice, noticed it.  This is an extraordinary case.  It means that the Minister for Justice has no interest in the most important court under her remit.  The Special Criminal Court deals with the most sensitive <Col N="554" /> cases and one would have thought that the Minister charged with responsibility would at the very least know from public soundings, the public press, radio or television that there was a judge sitting on the court whom the Government had decided should not be there following his request for delisting.</P>
    <P>The Minister has blamed the officials in her Department and has said there will be an investigation.  Who will investigate her role, the most abysmal of all, in this matter?  She was at the Government meeting at which the decision about Mr. Justice Lynch was made.  She was a party to that decision and it was her political responsibility to the public to implement it.  She failed to implement it.  This gives her little alternative but to resign.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, unusually for him in the context of his presence in this shambles of an administration, pointed in the direction of the Minister and described the situation as &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo;.  We have been used to furtive whisperings from the Tánaiste but on this occasion he decided to state publicly that he has lost confidence in the Minister.</P>

      <P>Who in this Government of so-called openness, transparency and accountability will accept responsibility and accountability for this disgrace?  It appears that the Government will investigate every official in the Minister's Department who knew anything about the matter, find out where they went wrong and abdicate its responsibility.  However, neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach, nor any member of the Cabinet, is entitled to escape responsibility. The Minister must carry the major responsibility for the matter because of its grave seriousness, because she is charged with the administration of her Department and because it is her duty to ensure that serious decisions are implemented.</P>
      <P>The previous administration fell because a civil servant did not bring the existence of a file in the Office of the Attorney General to the attention of his then boss, the Attorney General.  Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs insist on the same level of accountability, openness and transparency that he insisted on then?  Will the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, who trumpeted high standards from the Opposition benches over a protracted period, attempt to escape his responsibility in this matter?  Will he tolerate the presence in Government of the Minister who presided over this débâcle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have held the laws up to public ridicule.  The public's confidence in the criminal justice system has been undermined.  While this has been ongoing for some time, when it happens with regard to a court which is of such pivotal importance and sensitivity, then somebody somewhere must <Col N="555" /> accept responsibility, do the honourable thing and go.  No amount of obfuscation and smokescreens can hide the truth, which is the failure of the Government to implement its decision because of the dereliction of duty by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Government allowed a judge to sit on one of the most important, if not the most important, courts in the country for a protracted period after it had decided he should not do so following his request to be delisted.  The Government and the Minister did nothing about it.  This would be a joke in a banana republic.  It is a joke in this Republic.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech left many of us none the wiser because we did not have the text.  The decision to delist the judge was taken on 1 August.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>On 3 October I received a letter written to me by the Attorney General on 2 October 1996 indicating he had been in conversation with Judge Harvey Kenny who stated there was an impression among the Judiciary that Judge Lynch was still a member of the Special Criminal Court.

I have ascertained that draft letters were prepared by the courts division informing Judge Lynch and the President of the Special Criminal Court of the Government decision. These letters, however, had not been finalised up to yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is reminiscent of the correspondence in the Brendan Smyth case.  Officials in the Minister's Department confiscated or took her post and dealt with it without bringing serious matters to her attention.  This is where the crux of the inquiry must lie.  The Minister's officials kept her in the dark about this correspondence from the Attorney General and did not take the <Col N="556" /> appropriate action to inform the courts about this fiasco.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  It was difficult to follow the Minister's speech because we did not have the text.  It served to confuse rather than to enlighten.  It is a measure of her incompetence that the text of her speech was delivered only when she had almost finished reading it.</P>
      <P>The figure of Justice is usually portrayed as blindfolded to indicate and to symbolise impartiality.  However, it may more accurately explain the way in which the Minister blunders, unseeing, from one crisis to the next.  She is flying blind, oblivious to disasters and unaware of matters for which she has political responsibility. She has failed to see trouble coming, and not for the first time.  However, when it arrives on her desk she is incapable of dealing with it and all we get is minimal accountability.  In the past, for example, the Minister has failed to recognise the public demand for tough action against crime. She failed to see that the rash of unsolved contract killings would create a situation where criminals believed that they could shoot whoever got in their way, be they gardaí or journalists.  Her Department also failed to see the implications of deporting an unfortunate Algerian in contempt of a court order.  In this, her latest blunder, she failed to notice the law pertaining to judges of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>Section 41 (2) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, is not a difficult provision of law to understand.  It provides that when the Special Criminal Court is exercising its jurisdiction it must consist of an uneven number of judges, not fewer than three.  It now transpires that since mid-summer, the Special Criminal Court has been operating with a judge who was no longer validly a member of the court so that all its actions are tained with illegality.  This is an extraordinary state of affairs, verging on GUBU, for any Government Minister to preside over.</P>
      <P>It is all the more extraordinary because the provisions of the 1939 Act dealing with the appointment of judges are straightforward. Judges can be appointed and removed at will by the Government.  There are no complicated procedures involved.  The validity of the resignation of a judge of the Special Criminal Court was comprehensively analysed by the High Court and the Supreme Court less than ten years ago in a case involving Dominic McGlinchey. Everybody in the Department of Justice appears to have forgotten about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of this latest blunder means that 15 prisoners were released from their cells into the prison yard, rearrested and, at considerable public expense and Government embarrassment, brought under heavy guard to Dublin, in an attempt to validate their detention.  It is ironic that one of the prisoners was charged with the crime of false imprisonment.  This would be funny <Col N="557" /> if it were not so serious.  Among the other prisoners in the latest fiasco were those arrested in connection with the recent arms finds in Donegal and Laois and the shooting of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  These were serious crimes. I note the Tánaiste has accepted this is an extremely serious and embarrassing matter for the Government.  When crimes of this nature are not treated with vigilance and due competence, it sends out all the wrong signals to the people in Northern Ireland and in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution courts such as the Special Criminal Court may be established where ordinary courts &ldquo;are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice&rdquo;.  If that test were applied to this Minister she would fail hands down.  Her record in the Department of Justice reads like a roll of shame.  Shortly after the Minister took office we had the Brink's-Allied robbery.  The Minister denied that there had been prior intelligence about the raid, yet a newspaper correspondent had details of a confidential Garda memorandum that confirmed there was prior intelligence about the matter.  We had the botched Duncan extradition case.  There were ten escapes from closed institutions and 197 abscondings from open prisons this year and we also had the Urlingford sting.  We then had the illegal deportation of the unfortunate Algerian in contempt of a court order and there is ongoing unabated use of the temporary release system because we do not have enough prison spaces. Tickets were sold through retail outlets for a theatrical event in Mountjoy Prison.  The list reads like a roll of shame.</P>
    <P>The Government recently published a document entitled Delivering Better Government.  This glossy document refers to a brave new world where civil servants, and structures within the Civil Service, will be more accountable.  The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, states that if a grievous error is made by a civil servant or an official in a Minister's Department, the Minister is responsible irrespective of whether he or she knew about the matter.  We are in limbo land in terms of ministerial accountability from this Government. We have the worst of all worlds.  Ministers are not being accountable to the Dáil.  Ministerial accountability means nothing to the Government. Any one of the catalogue of errors I outlined should have been enough for the Minister to resign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but she blunders on.  We have had minimum responsibility, blame and accountability from the Government, with serious implications for democratic accountability.  If the Minister does not accept responsibility, it has a trickle down effect through the Civil Service and State boards, such as the BTSB.  There is always an inconclusive end to stories.  At the end of her <Col N="558" /> speech the Minister said there would be a full investigation and maybe a tribunal of inquiry.</P>

It came into the public domain because of an astute defence lawyer.  If it were up to the Department it would have gone on <i>ad infinitum</i> or until Deputy O'Donoghue or I tabled a question on the matter. One can imagine the route it would have taken. The litany of phone calls is a disgrace.  It is like an advertisement for Telecom Éireann.  The Minister's speech was a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is asking us to believe an unbelievable saga.  On 2 July a judge asked to be delisted and the Government agreed on 1 August.  The matter went through the system and around the end of September the Attorney General copped on that something was wrong. He sits at the Cabinet table on a weekly basis and I am sure meets the Minister on a daily basis.  He is involved in the Northern Ireland talks and travels regularly with the delegation.  He never raised or spoke about the issue.  Last Friday he decided to raise it and last night the matter became a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister asking us to believe that nobody in the Government, in the Department of Justice or in the courts section copped on to this?  Is she asking us to believe that nobody in the Attorney <Col N="559" /> General's office mentioned the matter?  The Minister stated that the warrant of appointment for the replacement judge, which was obviously cleared at the Cabinet meeting on 1 August, was transmitted to the courts.  The courts were informed that Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh was taking over the position and he was then informed.  How could so many mistakes have happened in respect of one issue?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister ever speak to the Attorney General?  Does he only communicate with her by letter?  The same issue of a lack of communication arose in the case some months ago regarding the shredding of an important warrant.</P>
    <P>The Minister's private office is busy but nobody dealt with an important letter regarding a judge acting in the Special Criminal Court dealing with IRA people and serious offences.  The Minister's private secretary was busy and sent that letter to the courts section, but nobody there believed it was important and did not inform the Minister until today.  How can anybody with any commonsense believe that story?  I cannot believe it; it is unbelievable.  Does the Attorney General ever speak to the Minister about anything?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General often speaks to me.  This matter is serious and I am deeply concerned about it.  If the Tánaiste used the word &ldquo;embarrassed&rdquo;, I will also use it in case the Deputies think there is any difference.  It is a matter of more than just embarrassment to me that a decision of the Government was not transmitted to the relevant judge in the Special Criminal Court.  The purpose of the investigation is to find the reason for this.  I do not know the details of what happened between 1 August and last night when I was informed.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, when I received notice from the Office of the Attorney General, I immediately rang my office for clarification.  This is why the investigation was carried out by the courts section in my Department.  I have given the House the information I have now.  Most of it refers to what happened in the past few days.  I am awaiting further information.  Members would not wish me to come to the House, and perhaps give information which was subsequently proved inaccurate.</P>

Deputy McDowell recently raised another case regarding the eligibility of a judge for appointment by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977.  His eligibility was questioned subsequently but nobody said the person who appointed that judge, although it was a decision of the Government, should resign because he did not make absolutely sure an official in the Department had correctly checked the date of birth and the other matters which were in dispute.

If he knew there was a problem there, why is there no explanation from the Taoiseach of why he did nothing for a month and continued to allow this man to preside in the Special Criminal Court?  Why was it that in the Minister's Department a letter addressed to her was confiscated by one of her officials and sat on for another month?</P>
      <P>Why did the Attorney General sit on this matter for more than a month without contacting the Minister to find out what happened to his letter?  Why does the Minister not have a system whereby letters addressed to her on serious matters come to her attention?

In that context, I ask the Minister for Justice to explain her litany of failures in this matter.  It appears she failed to act on the original letter of Mr. Justice Lynch, on a letter received from the Attorney General dated 2 October 1996, and to act immediately on a letter dated 1 November 1996 from the Attorney General's office.  All the while she and the Attorney General should have known there were people in unlawful custody in a jail here.  Those people were unlawfully remanded in custody or were in custody for another reason and charged with extremely serious offences.  Will the Minister for Justice &mdash; if we can believe her &mdash; explain to the House why there were not procedures in her Department to ensure that correspondence received from members of the Judiciary and the Attorney General was acted upon?

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hazardous Waste Disposal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of spending the summer of 1995, with other Members, refining the Waste Management Act, the position regarding lax legislative control of the hazardous waste sector becomes increasingly worrying.  Apparently the Department of the Environment is concentrating on developing measures to control packaging waste.  Departmental staff are fully stretched in their efforts to bring this about, which is admirable.  However, given the omissions, one cannot help worrying about the final outcome of their labours.</P>
      <P>Some of this concern stems from knowledge of what has gone on since the Waste Management Act, 1996, was passed.  The Act was introduced to enable us to come closer to European ideals on environmental protection.  However, our strategy excludes decentralised solutions, even where technology exists.  That is in clear defiance of the proximity principle in waste management given that, in many cases, technology exists to treat waste at source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections of the Act have yet to be enacted. They control the transfer of waste to unauthorised persons and empower the High Court on the imposition of penalties and remedies in the event of a breach of the <Col N="566" /> provisions of the Act.  Furthermore, it is a framework document requiring local authority activity before it can be implemented.  According to industry experts, local authorities have not yet taken steps to ensure the Act is enforceable.  The inactive sections of the Act mean that a High Court does not appear to be possible in the event of a serious contravention of any of its requirements.</P>
    <P>At present local authorities control the disposal of waste, including hazardous waste, in line with the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979 (S.I. No. 390 of 1979) and the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 33 of 1992).  They exclude animal, hospital, radioactive, sludge, mining waste and so forth.</P>
    <P>Those regulations are many years out of date. Exclusion of various categories of waste from their provisions means that seriously dangerous substances can be sent for storage at landfill sites with impunity.</P>
    <P>Hospital waste is specifically excluded from the provisions of the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1992. Industry sources confirm that it is possible for institutions to have hospital waste, potentially laden with even resistant bacteria or dangerous viruses, sent to landfill sites throughout the State. The recent crisis in the disposal of infected hospital waste has been an added incentive to those who seek to dispose of clinical waste in the most economical manner.  Local authorities which knowingly accept waste from hospitals and nursing homes are accepting into ordinary landfill sites material which could place staff and the public at extreme risk now and into the future.</P>
    <P>Municipal refuse workers are at greater risk of contracting hepatitis A and B infection than other members of the general public.  With such loose control of infected waste disposal one wonders when more serious infections will become obvious.  What kind of tribunal will be needed to apportion responsibility in relation to risk which could easily have been avoided?</P>
    <P>It is not as though the quantities involved are limited.  The Department of Health estimates chemical waste production as being around 4,000 tonnes.  However, since the same Department has admitted that it is unaware of any waste audits having been carried out, one must rely on figures sourced elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Industry experts, basing their information on the Price Waterhouse report produced for a Dublin waste disposal company and on their own activities in this area, place the quantity at anywhere between 9,000 and 13,000 tonnes per annum.  Since the DHSS in Northern Ireland estimates its own production at about 4,500 tonnes per annum, it is unlikely that we would produce less than they would given that we have twice the population.</P>
    <P>Lack of control of the disposal of hospital waste means that our clinical waste production is almost the same as that in the Netherlands, even <Col N="567" /> though they have almost four times the population.  Based on EU surveys in recent years, clinical waste disposal is at least 15 to 20 times more expensive than ordinary waste disposal. One wonders how we could be so lax in our controls as to produce so much at such a high cost.</P>
    <P>There are, possibly, over 10,000 tonnes of infected materials being transported haphazardly, perhaps in unmarked vehicles, throughout the State.  There are, possibly, hundreds of tonnes of infected materials being stored for collection, some of it in refrigerated food containers.</P>
    <P>The Minister should welcome a debate on this issue and, at the very least, accede to a request for a meeting with the several experts who have remedies and the technology but who are excluded from the tendering process because of the centralised strategy being promoted by the Department in dealing with hazardous clinical waste.  This needs to be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  I am glad to reassure the House that the legislative provisions and controls in place in relation to waste management are comprehensive and stringent and based on a high level of environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the enactment in May of the Waste Management Act, 1996 the Minister made a commencement order to bring its major provisions into operation with effect from 1 July. As a result stringent legislative provisions came into operation in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste.  There is a general duty on all persons holding waste to do so in a manner which avoids environmental pollution; the penalties for causing environmental pollution or for other offences under the Act can be a fine of up to £10 million and ten years imprisonment; local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency have strengthened powers as to the monitoring and inspection of waste activities and the procurement of information regarding waste production and management; local authorities can exercise wide-ranging powers to take measures, or to require others to do so, to prevent or limit environmental pollution from waste; and local authorities are required to adopt modern and systematic local waste management plans.</P>
      <P>Working from this strong new legislative base, a range of measures and instruments is being developed to promote a more progressive and sustainable approach to waste management.  This involves not only the preparation of secondary legislation within the Department, which is well advanced in a number of areas, but includes ongoing work on the part of the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has expressed concern about the management of hazardous wastes.  One of the <Col N="568" /> most significant provisions of the Waste Management Act is the requirement it imposes on the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare a national plan in relation to hazardous waste.  The agency has moved rapidly to fulfil this obligation and within the past two weeks has invited tenders for the preparation of a strategy study to assist in the development of a national hazardous waste management plan.  Tenders for the study are due with the agency on 16 December and preparation of the study will commence early in the new year.  The proposed strategy study will be co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-9 and will complement the non-hazardous waste management strategy studies being carried out by local authorities which are also being co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated on a number of occasions, work on the development of secondary legislation is being advanced and I expect to publish or make regulations before the end of the year dealing with the licensing of waste disposal facilities, with the initial focus on landfills; the recovery of packaging waste, in support of the REPAK initiative; the detailed content of local authority waste management plans, and the establishment of a local authority permit system in respect of commercial waste collection.</P>
    <P>In support of the REPAK initiative, onerous packaging waste recovery obligations will be prescribed in regulations to be published shortly. These regulations are advanced because such measures which, potentially at least, might have implications for the workings of the EU internal market are subject to a formal consultation procedure under EU legislation.  The European Commission and other member states will have at least three months to consider any such proposals.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Waste Management Act, including those on hazardous waste, are being activated in a planned and timely way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Burren is an area of unique beauty and ecological and archaeological importance.  The sensitive natural environment requires a high degree of protection.  While the indigenous population is relatively static, the area attracts increasingly large visitor numbers.  A sustainable tourism industry is of importance to its future economic well-being.  This is dependent on the preservation of the Burren's unique qualities.  This, in turn, requires management of development within the area.  Adequate infrastructure is required within the existing population centres where water and waste water facilities are grossly inadequate.  Clare County Council has submitted a plan to the Department of the Environment and is seeking Cohesion Funding from the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> The population of the area is approximately 10,000.  The necklace of towns includes Ballyvaughan, Belharbour, Corofin, Doolin, Ennistymon, Kilfenora, Lahinch, Liscannor and Lisdoonvarna.  Of most importance however is tourist numbers.  The nine towns mentioned can provide accommodation for 10,340 visitors which is fully utilised on many occasions during the summer.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of adequate infrastructure, pressure is being placed on rural areas in relation to development with more and more people applying to the county council for permission to build and to provide their own septic tank and water supply.  This is an undesirable development and would not constitute good planning in an area such as the Burren.</P>
    <P>There is a huge number of day trippers from outlying areas to various attractions within the Burren.  There are no certain figures but the Cliffs of Moher attracted 680,000 visitors in 1993.  The number has increased substantially since then. This would appear to indicate that the total number of visitors to the Burren is well in excess of one million.  On any given day, therefore, the population of the towns mentioned would be in excess of 20,000.  The area is visited by greater numbers each year.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council sets out in its plan what is required and points out that there are inadequacies in eight of the nine settlements mentioned.  There is only one reliable source of fresh water in north west Clare, Lickeen Lake, the source of water for Ennistymon, Lahinch, Liscannor and Kilfenora.  It is proposed that a new regional water supply scheme, described in the application as the Lisdoonvarna water supply scheme, should be constructed based on the existing Ennistymon water treatment plant which treats raw water abstracted from Lickeen Lake and has some spare capacity.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties for the county council is that a huge number of the wells drilled have proved unsuccessful.  The majority are saline wells while others have substantial traces of iron and magnesium which cannot be treated.  In Doolin there is a proliferation of septic tanks and bored wells on half acre sites.  This has health implications.  In Lisdoonvarna, the country's busiest spa town, enormous difficulties are encountered, particularly in the month of September.  An application was made for a new hotel in Ballyvaughan, which will have to be turned down.  An extremely important development for the area, together with the prospects for jobs that would involve, will be lost.</P>
    <P>Costings for the schemes have been set out in the proposal by the county council.  The county engineer and his staff are to be complimented on putting this proposal to the Government.  I understand that the application was forwarded to Brussels in November 1994 and that it has lain dormant since then.  Matters have been raised on the Adjournment relating to other Cohesion <Col N="570" /> Fund applications and difficulties have also arisen with them.  There is funding available from the Cohesion Fund and I urge the Minister to act on the great interest in the Burren shown by many people, which thus far has had the effect of preventing development.</P>
    <P>There was great interest in proposals for a national park and people urged that development be focused on the villages.  That is however impossible in view of the current position.  The Minister should pursue the matter vigorously with the European Commission to ensure that the Burren package is approved and development in an orderly fashion can proceed.  Normally I would complain that the Minister is not in the House but I have raised this matter with him, directly and in the House, on about 50 occasions and I look forward to the response by the Minister of State, which I hope will be positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to inform the House of the up-to-date position on the Burren and north Clare water services plan.  As was explained to the House on 2 May last in another debate on projects included in the Burren and north Clare services plan, this is an integrated water supply and sewerage proposal which will address the urgent water supply and sewerage needs of the main population centres in the Burren region.  Its principal objective is to protect the delicate Burren ecosystem by providing essential environmental infrastructure for the necklace of towns along the Burren periphery.  I had the opportunity to tour some of those towns with Deputy Killeen two weeks ago and enjoyed the day.</P>
      <P>In November 1994 my Department submitted an application to the European Commission for Cohesion Fund assistance for stage one of the Burren scheme.  This stage involves the planning and construction of two projects: first, the Lisdoonvarna water supply scheme costing an estimated £6.2 million.  That scheme will provide new water treatment facilities and trunk and distribution mains to extend a quality water supply to the town of Lisdoonvarna and adjacent rural areas.  It is also intended that growing tourism centres including the villages of Ballyvaughan and Doolin will be served by the scheme; second, the Lisdoonvarna sewerage scheme costing an estimated £3.5 million which will provide a modern waste water treatment plant for this expanding tourism centre and make a major contribution to safeguarding the exceptionally sensitive environment of the Burren district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further stages of the Burren scheme involve the extension of the water supply scheme to Belharbour, Kilfenora and Corofin as well as new and improved waste water collection and treatment systems planned for Ennistymon, Liscannor, Corofin, Ballyvaughan, Belharbour, Doolin and Lahinch.  Lahinch is one of the seaside towns included in the pilot tax relief <Col N="571" /> scheme for certain resort areas under the Finance Act, 1995.  Only last week tenders were approved by the Department for the upgrading of the sewage collection and treatment facilities there at a cost of more than £700,000.  This will have significant local environmental benefits and will facilitate the early development of approved tourism projects at Lahinch.</P>
    <P>The Department is taking full advantage of the valuable financial assistance being provided by the Cohesion Fund.  Overall 46 applications involving projects with a combined value of more than £450 million have been approved to date. There has been no decision by the Commission on the Burren application.  Pending that decision it is not possible to progress the individual schemes concerned.  In June the Department wrote to the Commission and provided up-to-date financial data together with further environmental and economic justification for the Burren scheme.  Within the past fortnight the Department received a letter from the Commission seeking additional information on certain aspects of the proposal.  This is being attended to urgently and a reply will issue as soon as possible.  I reassure the House that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will continue to co-operate in every way with the Commission in an effort to secure Cohesion Funds for this important scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for facilitating me in raising this issue and I thank the Minister for coming in to reply.  I urge the Minister for Education to respond urgently to the plea from the Irish Traveller Movement to fill the 23 visiting teacher posts for children of the travelling community.  These posts were advertised in June 1995 but fell victim to a Government embargo. Since the service started in 1980 in Galway visiting teachers have proved to be of enormous value to the education of traveller children.  The Department of Education described the service as one of the few initiatives in the area of traveller education that has been a success. Visiting teachers liaise between travelling families, schools and agencies active in the welfare of travellers.  It is disgraceful that the Minister reneged on her commitment to appoint these teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that in the cutbacks of June 1995 the Minister hit the travelling community first, a community that is perhaps the most educationally disadvantaged.  Many pleas were made in terms of cutbacks and the Minister lifted the embargo in other areas of education, but the embargo still applies to the visiting teacher service for the travelling community.  The Minister's policy illustrates an extraordinary degree of political hypocrisy.  She claims that she cares about the disadvantaged, but that is not so. For example, despite numerous requests, she has <Col N="572" /> failed to meet the Irish Traveller Movement in the past three years.  Why will she not meet that organisation?  The Minister is the least accessible Minister for Education since the foundation of the State.  I am inundated with correspondence from groups, bodies and movements which find it impossible to meet the Minister.  Today at the Select Committee on Social Affairs IFUT, the organisation representing university teachers, stated that despite many requests the Minister for Education has refused to meet it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party talks <i>ad nauseam</i> about the need to be all-inclusive, to do everything possible to improve the quality of life and the education service for the travelling community, yet the Minister refuses to meet the Irish Traveller Movement.  That organisation was forced to organise a protest outside the gates of Leinster House last Tuesday, to which it invited a number of politicians.  The education spokespeople from the Opposition parties had no difficulty in meeting and sympathising with the group, but the Minister was not present.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that a traveller education unit has not been established in the Department of Education, as recommended in the task force report on traveller education.  The Government has failed to implement most if not all of the recommendations in that report, which is gathering dust on the shelves.  Once again Labour Party rhetoric has failed to match reality.</P>
    <P>This is the third occasion in two weeks I have raised education matters on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the Minister pays so little regard to the House by not taking Adjournment matters of national and local importance.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, who has always made himself available on these issues but it is indicative of the Minister's respect for the House that she has ignored the Adjournment debates and treated them with contempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 23 posts to which the Deputy refers were comprised of three posts relating to vacancies which existed in the visiting teacher service for travellers at that time.  The remaining 20 posts related to a newly proposed allocation of extra teachers to the service.</P>
      <P>The three posts relating to existing vacancies were in fact filled in the normal course.  The 20 additional appointments which had been proposed were unable to proceed because of the intervention of the Government's embargo on public sector recruitment at that time.</P>
      <P>The capacity of the Minister for Education to allocate additional teacher posts to special needs areas, including the visiting teacher service for travellers, is dependent on the availability of such posts in any given year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education must consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs and must determine priorities in the light of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> In the current year, the Minister adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, the Minister recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.  Traveller children attending the selected schools will of course benefit from the inclusion of their schools in this initiative.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a number of concerns have been raised regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community.  However, I assure the House of the continuing commitment of the Minister for Education to meeting the education needs of travellers.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force contained over 160 separate recommendations in relation to the education and training of travellers.  One such recommendation related to the provision of additional teachers to the visiting teacher service for travellers.</P>
    <P>As indicated to the House on 10 October 1996, the Minister for Education has decided to allocate a further three teacher posts to the visiting teacher service for travellers in the current school year.  These extra posts, which will be advertised shortly, will bring the number of teachers in the service to 15.</P>
    <P>Also, as indicated to the House on 10 October, 1996, an interdepartmental working group reported to Government on the feasibility of implementing the task force recommendations. One of the conclusions of the interdepartmental group was that the co-ordinated delivery of education services for travellers could best be achieved by creating a special committee in my Department which would be representative of the various areas of the Department involved in the delivery of education services to travellers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that arrangements for this committee are now being completed and the committee will hold its first meeting on 21 November.</P>
    <P>An important element of the committee's remit will be to consult relevant interest groups, including traveller organisations.  I expect the Irish Traveller Movement will have adequate opportunity to convey its views as part of this process.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Minister for Education to the future development of education services for travelling people is set out clearly in the White Paper on Education &mdash;<i>Charting our Education Future.</i> The aim, as set out in the White Paper, is to promote the full and inclusive participation of travellers at all levels of the education system.  It is the intention of the Minister for Education to continue to work towards this goal.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  I pay tribute to Séamus Doyle, principal of Scoil Fhursa, Carmel Clifford, Scoil Íde and all the teaching staff.  I include the parents' representatives, Charlie Robinson, Benny Johnson and others.  They are all concerned at the continued provision of education in these schools mainly because they have informed the Department of Education over a prolonged period of time that there is a serious problem with their heating system which is obsolete and no remedial works can be done. Total renovation of the system &mdash; or installation of a new system &mdash; is necessary.  There are approximately 500 pupils in these national schools, the teaching staff and the parents.  They are from a socially disadvantaged area and the parents do not have funds available to them to pour into the school.</P>
      <P>I want one answer from the Minister of State: that the Minister will intervene directly to ensure the necessary works are carried out to both schools so that the principals will not have to decide to shut them.  Does the Minister want to preside over the closing of a school in Kilmore West?</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that when I contacted the Tullamore section of the Department of Education, I was informed they had been told not to give information to Deputies.  I was looking for the results of the recent inspection of both schools and the recommendations of the accompanying report to the Department.  I will not beat about the bush as this is a simple matter. Will provision be made for the necessary works to be carried out?  It may be costly but the Department has non-established and established personnel costing hundreds of thousands of pounds annually.  Millions are being spent on consultancy fees for various reports.  This is a simple matter concerning a school of 500 pupils plus teachers requiring a heating system.  We have been blessed so far with good weather that has meant the principals have not had to close the schools but we know that cold weather is coming. It is a matter of days before these principals have to make a decision they do not wish to make.  The necessary works should be carried out without delay and I ask the Minister for a favourable response.</P>

      <P>The accommodation at each of these schools consists of 16 permanent classrooms plus ancillary accommodation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Waiting periods for legal aid and advice in each of the 27 full-time law centres as at 30 September, 1996 are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report. In seven centres the waiting time was one month or less, in four centres the time was between one and two months, in ten centres the time was between two and four months, in four centres the time was between four and six months, and in two centres the time was more than eight months. Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rapid and nationwide expansion which the Legal Aid Board has undergone since 1992 has been undertaken in order to ensure that an effective civil legal aid and advice structure is in place to provide, among other matters, legal aid and advice to couples whose marriages have broken down.  This expansion can now be seen as necessary and timely having regard to an anticipated increase in applications to the board for legal services on the introduction of divorce. Funding to the Legal Aid Board has increased from just under £2.7 million in 1992 to £6.5 million in 1996, an increase of almost two and a half over the 1992 figure.  Over the same period staff numbers increased by two and a quarter, from 99 to 224.  I am determined to continue my efforts to ensure that sufficient resources are made available to the Legal Aid Board to enable it to provide an adequate response to all challenges which it may face in the future and, in particular, the challenge which will be posed by the introduction of divorce legislation, subject of course to budgetary considerations.  In this regard, I am advised by the Legal Aid Board that it plans to bring a further three full-time law <Col N="578" /> centres into its nationwide network of law centres by the end of 1996.  The addition of these new law centres at Cavan, Newbridge and Tullamore, which will bring the total of full-time law centres to 30 as compared to 16 in 1993, should also lead to reductions in waiting times in those and adjacent catchment areas and provide further assistance to the board in meeting the challenge of divorce.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to quantify the projected caseload of the Legal Aid Board in 1997 arising from the imminent enactment of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996.  It is reasonable, however, to assume that a proportion of the approximately 4,000 judicial separation cases legally aided by the board to date will revert to the board for services in respect of divorce as well as an unknown number of first time requests for legal aid for divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions in this House on 3 October 1996 &mdash; as contained in volume 469 of the Official Report, at columns 1355 to 1358 &mdash; I said that the reduction in waiting times for appointments with solicitors and the expansion of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, which has since been put on a statutory footing, have been among my priorities since taking office.  I have ensured, and will continue to ensure, that the board has the resources to expand and develop its services, consistent with its requirement to provide legal aid and advice as widely and as quickly as possible throughout the country.  The extra resources which I have provided over the past four years is evidence of my resolve in this regard.  I am satisfied that, as a result of my actions to date in providing additional resources to the Legal Aid Board, the board will be able to respond effectively to the challenges that lie ahead and, accordingly, I do not feel any further special arrangements are required to be put in place at present.  I will of course be continually monitoring the situation.</P>
    <P>In so far as children are concerned the Deputy will appreciate that the amendment of the Constitution that is now Article 41.3.2º and the Family Law (Divorce) Bill at present before the House with Seanad amendments, are designed in such a way as to facilitate best the welfare of children.  Our divorce laws will protect and support children to the fullest extent possible. Where legal aid is concerned it will apply as necessary as it has in other cases affecting children such as maintenance, guardianship or separation proceedings.  I have previously pointed out to the Deputy in reply to Question No. 1 of 3 October 1996 that it is my hope that parents will more than ever before try to ensure that their separation or divorce is managed in a way which impacts with minimum trauma upon any children who may be involved and that the children do not become a weapon in the emotional battles which regrettably can be a feature of marriage breakdown worldwide.  It is for those reasons that my Department has been particularly active in promoting the wider use of mediation and <Col N="579" /> counselling as an alternative to court resolution of marital disputes.  Our separation laws are designed so as to direct couples towards the possibilities for a mediated settlement and the Divorce Bill does likewise.</P>
    <P>This year I secured additional funding for the scheme of grants to marriage counselling organisations, from £750,000 per annum to £900,000 per annum.  The scheme was also extended to provide for the first time funding to voluntary organisations providing counselling to children whose parents have separated.  This would include, of course, children of divorced parents.</P>

In the course of that reply I set out in detail the context in which the present law on custody and access orders operates and I indicated that it was one of the matters being reviewed by my Department in the context of preparation of a Bill to update the law on guardianship of children and the giving of evidence by, or on behalf of, <Col N="580" /> children.  I have nothing further to add to that reply other than to say that drafting of the Bill is in progress and that it will be published as soon as possible, taking into account the submissions made by Parental Equality and any other submissions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent publicity in the media about a submission made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights that an information pack should be made available to members of the public and organisations who wish to know more about the subject of child abduction.</P>
      <P>There are some initiatives which are already under way in my Department in this area.  First, information on the services which are available under the aegis of my Department or services which are funded by my Department is being reviewed with a view to being updated and broadened, as necessary.  Information on the Central Authority for Child Abduction is part of that review.  Second, I should like to mention that operation of the Hague Convention is due to be reviewed in the early part of 1997 under the aegis of the Hague Conference on Private International Law.  By way of preparation for that review, I arranged some few weeks ago for the views of various interest groups to be sought on their experience of the operation of the Convention to date.  In considering what further can and needs to be done in relation to the subject of child abduction I shall be taking into account the experience in other jurisdictions as well as representations which are made to me as Minister with responsibility for the civil law in this area.</P>

      <P>The report of the Working Party on the Legal and Judicial Process for Victims of Sexual and Other Crimes of Violence against Women and Children, launched by the National Women's Council of Ireland on 1 November, 1996, contains 84 recommendations, about six of which relate to issues which are within the area of responsibility of my Department.  The vast majority of the recommendations are the responsibility of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the council in establishing the working party.  The many recommendation in the report must now be the subject of detailed examination by relevant Government Departments and agencies.  In so far as certain of the recommendations are concerned, I should like to make the following points.</P>
      <P>Certain Government initiatives have already been taken which, to some extent, overtake recommendations in the report.  These include establishment on 15 October 1996 of an inter agency committee by the Tánaiste to develop a co-ordinated response and strategy on violence against women.  Details were supplied to the House by the Tánaiste in reply to Question No. 98 of 25 September 1996; provision has been made in the Family Law Act, 1995 and Family Law (Divorce) Bill for supply to the courts on certain family law cases of social reports by the Probation and Welfare service and health boards; and provision has been made in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 for granting by the courts of emergency orders to protect victims of domestic violence.  That provision took into account recommendations in the Kilkenny incest report.</P>
      <P>The recommendation in the working party's report regarding the relaxation, to a considerable degree, of the <i>in camera</i> rule needs to be assessed in the light of conclusions reached by the Law Reform Commission in its report on Family Courts about preserving the privacy of parties in family law proceedings.  Their conclusion about the need for privacy was reached after a consulation paper had dealt in detail with the subject.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to ensure that State vocational training programmes are geared to train women for traditionally male jobs and vice versa, by encouraging flexibility in relation to all course timetables in order to facilitate participants with home commitments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility of my Department in relation to vocational training programmes relates mainly to the provision of statutory protection against discrimination.  Accordingly the Employment Equality Bill which I published recently includes specific protection against discrimination in the terms on which vocational training courses are offered, where access to such courses is refused or in the manner in which such courses are provided.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of state vocational training programmes rests primarily with FÁS, the education authorities, CERT and Teagasc under the aegis of the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment, Education, Tourism and Trade and Agriculture, Food and Forestry respectively.  Accordingly, the gearing of such programmes to train women for traditionally male jobs by encouraging flexibility in course timetables to facilitate participants with home commitments is a matter in the first instance for those training and education authorities.</P>
      <P>At the same time my Department has sought to facilitate progress in this area through its involvement in the preparation of the National Development Plan and its subsequent participation on the monitoring committee to oversee the EU Human Resources Operational Programme.  It has also sought to stimulate child care provision through pilot projects in areas of disadvantage with a view in particular to support women wishing to access employment, education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition in recent months the Employment Equality Agency which operates under the aegis of my Department issued a publication on introducing family friendly initiatives in the workplace.  This highlights some of the best national and international practice in this area. Furthermore the agency has just published a report on access to the live register and employment and training schemes which refers to travel and timing of courses as a potential barrier to women's participation.  I have written to my colleagues the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment, Education, Tourism and Trade and Agriculture, Food and Forestry drawing their <Col N="583" /> attention to this report and to the need to facilitate greater participation of women in the labour market including by means of better access to vocational training programmes.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has finalised its report and presented me with a copy.  I will bring a memorandum to Government shortly to allow for the publication of the report.  It is my intention to launch the report at an EU Presidency Conference on equal opportunities for people with disabilities due to take place in Cork on 18 and 19 November 1996.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any aspect of the report in advance of its publication.  He can rest assured, however, that I will be giving its recommendations very careful consideration with a view to seeing what measures may be required of me and of my colleagues in Government to improve the position of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The precise amounts spent are shown in the Appropriation Accounts for the years in question, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  These may vary slightly from the figures mentioned above.</P>
      <P>Because of changes over the years in Departmental responsibilities and in the tabulation of national lottery-funded expenditure, it would be difficult to establsh exact comparisions in every case between the position in 1989 and in 1995 but the Deputy will note that the total spending increased from £47,685 million to £83.342 million or by 74.6 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of orthodontic services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. Persons requiring orthodontic treatment are assessed by the appropriate board in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists according to the severity of their treatment need.</P>
      <P>In some areas there are large numbers of children on the waiting lists and there can be long waiting periods for orthodontic treatment.  I accept that such waiting periods are undesirable.</P>
      <P>The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  Most health boards now have a consultant in place and are consolidating and extending their orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where health boards have been successful in recruiting consultant orthodontists the services provided by these boards have been considerably improved.  This demonstrates, very clearly, the success of my Department's strategy of consultant led teams for the provision of orthodontic services.  It is not envisaged under the dental health action plan that health boards <Col N="592" /> should make arrangements with private orthodontists for clearing existing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I will, in conjunction with the health boards, continue to develop the consultant led orthodontic services over the course of the dental health action plan.  The ultimate objective is to bring the level of service provision in line with the level of treatment need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am very much aware of the current difficulties being experienced in the food industry as a result of the ongoing &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo;. IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, withdrew from negotiations which were being pursued under Clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and pursued industrial action in the form of a &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo; with effect from 15 January 1996.</P>
      <P>A meeting was held on 25 June 1996 between management and union, under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board.  On Wednesday, 26 June 1996 I personally met with IMPACT and a delegation of environmental health officers to explore whether or not the provisions of the joint Government/ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the current impasse in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>On 5 July 1996, with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission, an informal meeting took place between management and the union.  This meeting was of considerable assistance to both sides and as a result negotiations are continuing.</P>
      <P>In view of the complexity of these negotiations it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this point, other than to say that I am very hopeful of a mutually satisfactory outcome in the very near future which will ease the current difficulties being experienced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a requirement of the Chinese adoption authorities that applications for the adoption of Chinese children be transmitted by a relevant governmental organisation or by a recognised non-governmental organisation.  The Adoption Board, which has statutory responsibility under the Adoption Act, 1991, for the regulation and recognition of adoptions effected outside the State by Irish residents, has agreed to undertake the task of transmitting documents on behalf of prospective adopters to the China Centre for Adoption Affairs in Beijing.  The relevant Chinese authorities have been informed accordingly through the diplomatic channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this development, the need for the recognition of a non-governmental organisation for this purpose does not arise. <Col N="594" /> Having said that, I do of course acknowledge that International Orphan Aid has built up a level of expertise in relation to the adoption of children from the People's Republic of China and that it provides important support to prospective adopters.  It seems to me that it could have a valuable role to play in assisting the Adoption Board in the work that the Board has agreed to undertake.  I would therefore suggest that the organisation might make contact with the board to explore this possibility.</P>

      <P>Given that equality issues impact throughout each area in my Department, I propose to approach the reply by identifying work currently being pursued by my Department in relation to equality and equal status.</P>
      <P>Three pieces of legislation which will promote equality are currently being progressed.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill currently before the Dáil will seek to outlaw discrimination in employment on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  It makes explicit provision with regard to indirect discrimination and harrassment and sets out redress procedures, including the creation of a new Office of Director of Equality Investigations, for persons who seek to complain of unequal treatment.  Provision is also made for the establishment of an Equality Authority whose powers will include preparation of codes of practice and equality reviews and action plans.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill will seek to outlaw discrimination on the nine discriminatory grounds already stated.  It will apply to non-workplace areas, including education, provision of goods and services and disposal of property and accommodation and will also contain measures to deal with discrimination by registered clubs. Services will be defined broadly to include access to public places, banking and insurance services, entertainment, facilities for refreshment and transport.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births (Amendment) Bill will amend the form of the birth certificate in order to remove gender inequalities in the particulars registered.</P>
      <P>In addition, the work of my Department includes preparation of legislation on parental leave and the progress of EU Commission proposals for directives on burden of proof and positive action in an employment equality context.</P>
      <P>Equality issues also arise for my Department with regard to commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> child care developments and promotion of equal opportunities in employment generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the following ongoing activities concerning equal status are currently being pursued: the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action; the preparation of Ireland's reports under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); the follow-up to the report of the Commission on the Status of Women; membership of the Council of Europe Steering <Col N="596" /> Committee on Equality; monitoring of membership of State Boards; administration of the grant to the National Women's Council; Action for Equality Awards; work in connection with combating race discrimination at EU and Council of Europe level.</P>
    <P>I have recently been presented with the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  It is my intention to launch the report at the EU Presidency Conference on equal opportunities for people with disabilities which will take place in Cork on 18 and 19 November.</P>

      <P>There are 44 law centres operated by the board, 27 full-time and 17 part-time, which provide legal aid and advice to applicants who meet the eligibility criteria contained in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, and the regulations made under that Act.  In 1995 a total of 7,306 persons were provided with legal advice and 4,060 provided with advice and aid by the board.  On 30 September 1996, a total of 2,010 persons &mdash; an average of 77 persons per centre &mdash; were waiting for appointments with law centre solicitors.  A breakdown of applicants by gender is not available at present because the Legal Aid Board does not maintain these records in a format that would facilitate the extrapolation of such information.  The board, however, is looking at ways of improving its information base.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the First Motor Insurance Directive (72/166/EEC) of 24 April 1972, as amended by Directive (72/430/EEC) of 19 December 1972 and a subsequent Commission Decision of 6 February 1974, member states of the European Community are obliged to &ldquo;refrain from making checks on insurance against civil liability in respect of vehicles which are normally based in the European territory of another Member State&rdquo;.  This provision is linked to the fact that the national insurers' bureaux of the member states have concluded an agreement between one another under the terms of which each national bureau guarantees settlement, in accordance with the provisions of national law on compulsory insurance, of claims in respect of accidents occurring in its territory, caused by vehicles normally based in the territory, caused by another member state, whether or not such vehicles are insured.  The Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland is a party to this agreement.</P>

      <P>An application in respect of the funding of an extension to and the acquisition of additional lands at the Regional Technical College, Tallaght has been received by my Department.</P>
      <P>The proposed extension comprises lecture theatres, laboratories and staff accommodation.  It is estimated to cost £14.5 million inclusive of fees, fittings, furniture and equipment.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my press release of 13 January 1994, a sum of £3.5 million was allocated under the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund Programme for capital developments at the college.  This sum remains available to the college and will allow construction work to commence on a phased basis on the project in early 1997.  The implementation programme is on target and continues to accord with the approved expenditure profile of the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund Programme.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing between officials of my Department, the college authorities and the Valuation Office in respect of the need for and the cost of additional lands for the college.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the exceptional growth and the excellent contribution that the Regional Technical College, Tallaght is making to the third level sector.  However a decision in respect of further capital funding for the college will have to be taken in the context of other priorities and overall resource constraints.</P>

      <P>Under the Rules for National Schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>At second level the managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  My Department, through its guidelines on school discipline, lays considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>In cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child readmitted to the mainstream school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the intervention of its inspectorate.  In addition, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils with special needs in order that the most appropriate provision can be made.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy may be aware that I have introduced a pilot scheme of teacher-counsellors which is intended to offer special targeted support to selected primary schools encountering particular difficulty in coping with disruptive and disturbed pupils.</P>
      <P>The key role of the teacher-counsellor is: (a) to co-ordinate a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies which will help prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour; and (b) to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behaviour difficulties in the classroom.</P>
      <P>The pilot scheme has been introduced in the Tallaght-Clondalkin area and in the north inner city of Dublin.  A total of 27 teacher-counsellors have been deployed to date and the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
      <P>Where more severe behavioural difficulties are identified as a result of an assessed emotional disturbance on the part of a child, placement can be arranged in one of 14 special schools dedicated to the needs of such children.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also wish to note that the health authorities have recently developed a number of special residential facilities to cater for children with serious emotional and behavioural difficulties.  Each such unit is designated as a special school by my Department and attracts favourable staffing and funding allocations.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the school in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Convention, the two States involved in processing a transfer request are required to exchange information about the sentenced person.  This information includes a copy of the judgment and the law on which it is based, sentence administration particulars and medical/social reports.  These must be obtained from a number of different sources.  Owing to the complexity of the documentation required, this processing of some cases can take some considerable time.  For this reason and the fact that every case is considered on its own particular and individual merits, it is not open to me to give any exact timescale on the transfer to Ireland of any person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say, however, that every effort is made to process each application as speedily as possible, assuming, of course, that the application is formally transmitted, the three way consent is forthcoming and the necessary documentation is available.  I should also point out that experience to date &mdash; limited though it is &mdash; indicates that the time scale for completing a transfer can vary <Col N="605" /> significantly from case to case.  Consequently, I am not in a position to give the Deputy a definite timescale in respect of the case to which he refers but I assure him there will be no undue delay on my part.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the garda permanently attached to Carrickbyrne Station was temporarily transferred to Border duty from 9 September to 5 November 1996, and has been reassigned to Carrickbyrne.

The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that the policing arrangements in place for the Carrickbyrne sub-district are adequate to meet current policing needs.</P>

      <P>I understand that painting of the premises in question was sanctioned last year but was not proceeded with as it was ascertained that certain repairs and refurbishment would first be needed.  The Office of Public Works has since examined the building and reported on the work which needs to be done.  This report is now being examined with a view to deciding what action should be taken.</P>

      <P>In recent years my Department has introduced a facility for the payment of a range of social welfare entitlements by electronic funds transfer to personal accounts at banks and other financial institutions, including An Post.  At present, over 102,000 customers avail of this option.  The main social welfare payment schemes involved are old age contributory and non-contributory, survivor's-orphan's, retirement and invalidity pensions; long-term disability, death and child benefits and back-to-work and disability allowances.  All new claimants to these schemes are given the option of payment by electronic fund transfer.</P>
      <P>My intention is to ensure that a wide range of modern payment methods are available to social welfare customers.  New technologies and &ldquo;cashless&rdquo; money transmission facilities which are coming on stream are being examined by my Department.  The aim is to expand the range of facilities from which customers may choose according to their personal needs and preferences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The annual ewe premium paid to sheep producers is calculated by adjusting the average income loss of sheep producers by a co-efficient, known as the stabiliser, which is designed to reflect the increase of EU sheep numbers above target size set in 1988.  The current stabiliser co-efficient is a compromise figure agreed by the Council of Ministers in 1992 as part of the package which set the EU ewe premium quota levels each member state.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a proposal from the European Commission to amend the relevant EU Council regulation, there is no scope within the Irish Presidency to redirect a percentage of the stabiliser into an increase in the ewe premium.  In any event, Irish sheep prices in 1996 are 17 per cent above 1995 levels, with monthly increases in the April to September period being in the 23 per cent to 33 per cent range.  Furthermore, the buoyant demand for breeding stock indicates a confident sector.  In these circumstances it would not be possible to get acceptance for any further special measures for Ireland this year.</P>

I proposed to the Commission earlier this year that preparation of the report should be availed of to examine the wider aspects of the sheepmeat regime.  The report, which is now available, is confined to the issue of the operation of the quota regime.</P>

      <P>An EU Council Regulation, published on 6 August 1996, authorised the payment of a special premium for ewes in lowland flocks which had qualified for a premium payment in 1995 but had not qualified for the rural world premium.  Payment to producers of £5.39 per eligible ewe commenced on 9 August 1996 and all payments, amounting to £5.73 million, have now been completed.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission also approved the payment of a top-up in headage payments amounting to £1 per mountain ewe and £2 per hogget.  This payment, which is expected to amount to £2.6 million, will be made in the course of this month.</P>

      <P>The level of premium payable under the 1995 ewe premium scheme to applicants in disadvantaged areas was £26.10 which included £5.51 rural world premium.  The level payable to applicants in non-disadvantaged areas was £25.98 which included the £5.39 special once-off top-up paid in August 1996 to non-disadvantaged areas applicants.

      <P>The total amount paid out to sheep farmers in 1995 in respect of 1994 and 1995 ewe premium and sheep headage schemes was £128.168 million. In 1996, some £101 million has already been paid to sheep farmers to date under the 1995 and 1996 sheep schemes and it is estimated that a further £33 million will be paid out by the year's end. This sum includes the £2.5 million special once-off top-up in respect of 1996 sheep headage applications.</P>

      <P>These basic principles and criteria to be considered in a decision to introduce countermeasures in Ireland in the event of a nuclear accident, are set out in the national nuclear emergency plan.  I have forwarded a copy of the plan to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The basic principles are regularly kept under review.  The latest guidelines for intervention levels and action levels in emergency exposure situations are those recently published by the International Atomic Energy Agency in the publication <i>International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the safety of Radiation Sources.</i></P>
      <P>Emergency preparedness is underpinned by a constant monitoring programme carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. This programme includes measurements of radioactivity levels in air, on the ground, in live sheep, foodstuffs and in a range of samples from the seas around Ireland.  During 1995 over 3,390 samples were processed and analysed in the institute's laboratory.</P>
      <P>Funding for the monitoring programme is contained within the annual Exchequer grant made available to the institute.  Should additional resources for the programme be required these would be identified and reviewed by my Department and the Department of Finance in the context of the annual Estimates.  I have received no submissions on the issue of resources apart from the normal annual application by the RPII in respect of Exchequer grant to cover all activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of our monitoring must be scrutinisd constantly to ensure that it complies with internationally accepted standards.  I am <Col N="616" /> advised by the RPII that its current monitoring programme enables a healthy state of readiness to be maintained so that a rapid and effective response can be provided in the event of a nuclear emergency.</P>
