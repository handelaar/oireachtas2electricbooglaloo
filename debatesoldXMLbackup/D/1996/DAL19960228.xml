      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 6 &mdash; Motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; 13 &mdash; commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995 [Seanad], Report and Final Stages; 14 &mdash; Trade Marks Bill, 1995, Report and Final Stages; 15 &mdash; Refugee Bill, 1995, Report and Final Stages; 16 &mdash; Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, Second Stage (resumed) and 2 &mdash; Metrology Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 6 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <P>Before we agree the Order of Business, I understand from contacts with an official of the Taoiseach's office that we will have a debate on the Summit in the afternoon. Although not mentioned in the Order of Business, since it was communicated <Col N="618" /> to me, I assume it has been agreed.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware of it.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House &mdash; as we always would in the event of any important meeting &mdash; wish the Government well and I hope more progress can be made today than over recent months. It is ironic that it is 18 months to the day since the announcement of the IRA ceasefire.  We hope that whatever conclusion is reached or whatever communiqué is issued after today's meeting will specify definite dates to which we can adhere in the future.  We wish the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their officials well in their endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the constructive comments just made by the Leader of the Opposition.  On the precise matter he raised with me, he is correct, there have been discussions with the Government Whip but a time has not been fixed, as a timetable for the conclusion of the Summit meeting is not available.  However, as soon as we have definite information in that respect, there will be a meeting with the Whips and arrangements made for statements in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Ahern in wishing the Government well today.  I am delighted that the Summit is taking place.  It is clear from this morning's opinion poll &mdash; not that an opinion poll is needed to confirm it &mdash; the vast majority of people North and South and in Great Britain want to see peace restored with a political settlement, that they have an open mind and are flexible on the way forward, which is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there will be a debate on the Summit later today.  Since it is my party's Private Members' time this week, we are prepared to allow time for that debate because it is important that it take place today.  If we lose time or must move our Private Members' time to next week, we are prepared to do that. I understand and welcome the fact that the Government is prepared to brief the <Col N="619" /> Opposition parties early in the afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Harney for her supportive comments and generosity with her party's Private Members' time.  If it is necessary to arrange for statements during that time, the Whips will consult her party's Whip. I can also confirm that the Opposition parties will be briefed as soon as we are in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I had been endeavouring to obtain some information from the Taoiseach on the third banking force.  Since we are lucky in having the Minister for Finance to announce the Order of Business, perhaps he would inform the House of his position in relation to it.</P>

The last time that report was mentioned in a Sunday newspaper the Garda were sent to my office to ascertain whether I had leaked it.  I am afraid to do anything until the Minister gives me the all clear on it.</P>

Will the Minister confirm that the Trustee Savings Bank has been told officially there will be no change in the lifetime of this Government?  If that is the case the Minister should put on the public record that the <i>status quo</i> will obtain for the lifetime of this Government because of its inability to take such a decision.</P>

Yesterday I tabled <Col N="621" /> a question seeking to have this report published and made available to me but the reply was in the negative.  Reports of that type should be made available to Members.  What is the reason for secrecy?

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, line 27, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;<Col N="623" /> to insert &ldquo;or the Government of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister assure the House that this Bill will have the full force of law when enacted?  I listened to the Minister's Second Stage speeches and the reasons he put forward for accepting or rejecting the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage and I see a conflict between the reasons for bringing the legislation forward and the reasons given when certain amendments were not accepted.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider this amendment seriously?  Since the Committee Stage debate I have spent time researching the background to the legislation. The Fine Gael and Labour Party Coalition Government under Dr. Garret FitzGerald took a number of serious decisions in the middle of 1986 on arterial drainage.  First, the order of work on the arterial drainage of rivers priority list was changed.  That was parochial politics being played by national government, and, more important, the functions for arterial drainage were transferred to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  That order was given effect in a Statutory Instrument of 23 December 1986 and was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 6 January 1987.  In this Bill we are vesting the powers in the Commissioners of Public Works and the Minister for Finance, acting on behalf of the Government. This is where the conflicts will arise.  If this Bill is to deal with flooding under the arterial drainage Acts and the powers are being conferred on the Minister for Finance and the Commissioners of Public Works and the Statutory Instrument has conferred the functions and powers for arterial drainage on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forrestry unless this amendment is accepted there will be a serious real conflict. It may be pointed out in a month or two that the Minister has not the power to proceed and we will then need further emergency legislation.  In the interest of flood victims and the best <Col N="624" /> possible laws that this House can enact will the Minister accept amendment No. 1?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice available to me is to the effect that when the Bill is passed it will have the full force of law.  The parliamentary draftsman has advised that the standard practice in drafting legislation is to assign powers to a Minister and only in the most extreme cases will provision be made for the exercise of power by Government order.  There is a well established principle that as the Commissioners of Public Works are responsible to the Minister for Finance, who is a member of the Government, the commissioners therefore act on behalf of the Government.  The parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General consider this amendment unnecessary and unacceptable and on that basis I do not porpose to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no references in the Bill to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I do not wish to waste time by reading Statutory Instrument 448/86 into the Official Report but there is nothing in the Bill revoking it.  As far as I am concerned the law includes this Statutory Instrument which is an interpretation of the law pertaining to arterial drainage, and the last page of which states: &ldquo;This order transfers to the Minister for Agriculture with effect from the operative date of this order ministerial functions in relation to arterial drainage.&rdquo;  If we are to have expenditure on arterial drainage and the functions rest with another Minister, how can we have the legal power to proceed to do remedial works whether piecemeal, medium or major?  I am extremely worried.  Based on the statement made in the House, on the advice of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman, the reasons for introducing the Bill were such that there must have been some problem even though I accepted that the commissioners had the power.  If this <Col N="625" /> is so, and the amendments have been rejected on the basis that they are unnecessary, I submit that based on decisions taken by a Government in 1986 this Bill conflicts with those decisions.  The powers are with another Minister.  We have an opportunity today to copperfasten this by ensuring that decisions which refer to the mechanisms proposed in this Bill for relieving flooding and assisting the victims are effective.</P>
      <P>I do not want to find in the next few months when a query is raised or if a lawyer, acting on behalf of a victim or group of victims, makes a case, that we have a legal problem and that we are back in the Dáil again.  I have no desire to delay the House.  I have no desire to obstruct the Minister or to impede the passage of this Bill.  I want to ensure it is the most positive legislation we can pass, that it will have the full force of law and that there will be no loophole that will affect the speedy payment of grants to the victims of flooding who have waited so long in frustration and also that where alleviating works are required the Minister and the commissioners will be able to proceed rapidly. Inclusion of this amendment would resolve many of the difficulties.  If it is included <i>de facto</i> in the Bill no one can say there was any doubt about it.</P>

      <P>In deference to Deputy Treacy &mdash; I completely accept the spirit in which he has tabled his amendment &mdash; this is primary legislation which overrides any statutory instruments.  The Bill gives clear functions and powers to the commissioners.  Nevertheless, I am having the matter raised by the Deputy checked.  With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I suggest we deal with the other amendments and come back to this at the end of Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 41, after &ldquo;kind&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided such buildings, structures, works or other property have been in use heretofore&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment.  A number of victims of flooding have serious reservations about the fact that buildings or structures may have to be demolished. I have no difficulty in certain situations once the State is recompensing people for losses incurred as a result of a natural disaster, such as flooding.  No matter what laws are passed, there will be exceptions to every rule.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment because unless a property had been in use prior to the flooding there is no justification for demolishing it.  I was not convinced by what I heard on Committee Stage that the State would have power to demolish buildings.  Unless they were in use they should not be demolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate on section 3 I asked whether this section gave powers to the commissioners to carry out emergency <Col N="627" /> works in the absence of a scheme being prepared.  I also requested the commissioners' definition of the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo;.  I would be pleased to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never the intention, contrary to the fears expressed by Deputy Treacy, that the relocation scheme would involve us in demolishing structures which were not lived in or used for domestic purposes.  However, I cannot accept the amendment because it would effectively impose restrictions on the commissioners in the exercise of their functions generally.  The section as it stands simply empowers the commissioners to demolish buildings.  The commissioners are still bound by the planning laws and do not have a free hand in any sense to demolish structures in an indiscriminate way.  They are placed on an equal footing with a private developer or any individual.  The proposed amendment would place an unacceptable limitation on the commissioners' powers to demolish buildings generally.  That is a power the commissioners need to have in relation to a whole range of buildings, Garda barracks and so on.  The Deputy also indicated on Committee Stage that he was concerned that the power to demolish was being sought in the context of the unfinished visitors' centres.  I can assure him that is not the case.  The provision was included in the Bill at the request of the Chief State Solicitor and in the context of the home relocation scheme. It is there to copperfasten a general power and not for any other purpose. We have no plans whatsoever to demolish buildings under the relocation scheme, except in the context of their being used previously in the form referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage last week Deputy Ahern referred to the debate on the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, which took place last summer and referred specifically to the carrying out of works without the preparation of a scheme.  It is necessary to differentiate <Col N="628" /> between schemes carried out under that legislation and schemes for humanitarian assistance proposed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>A drainage scheme, whether on a catchment basis or purely for the relief of localised flooding, must take account of a number of matters, such as the effect of the works elsewhere and their impact on the environment.  Careful attention must be paid to these matters in the preparation and execution of works.  A scheme for humanitarian assistance, whether in the form of money or home relocation under this legislation, cannot be compared with a drainage or flood relief scheme.  The same criteria do not apply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern raised another matter, which I promised to consider, regarding whether there should be a time limit in section 2 (4) within which the commissioners should give effect to a determination by the Minister for Finance, that is, where the Minister receives representations from anyone to whom the commissioners have refused assistance. No time limit is specified.  The section states the commissioners shall give effect to the determination and it can be taken that, once a determination is made, immediate effect will be given to it.  A determination could also be in the negative.  The chairman of the Select Committee, Deputy Jim Mitchell, also asked that I consider the matter for Report Stage and bring forward an amendment if necessary.  I considered the matter and I do not propose to introduce an amendment.  It would be impossible to impose a time limit on implementation of a scheme as there could be many variable factors in any scheme.  It is not necessary to provide a time limit for notifying people of a determination.  This should be done immediately and that is normally the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the provision regarding the demolition of buildings or structures related to the relocation of farm buildings?  Deputy Treacy stated it <Col N="629" /> involves moving buildings or structures, but I favour moving the problem rather than the building.  If the problem of flooding was removed, there would be no need to worry about the relocation of buildings or houses.</P>
      <P>I seek further clarification on the point raised by Deputy Ahern regarding unplanned schemes for emergency works.  If my house was threatened and water was rising at the rate of a couple of feet a day, I would do emergency work in co-operation with my neighbours and others to alleviate the problem. Provision must be made for such cases in the legislation.  People should not be held liable for carrying out emergency work which would save their houses, but which would not affect others or the environment.</P>
      <P>In the narrow debate on the right of a householder to save his home and the rights of the environment, I would uphold the householder's right.  People who live in an area pose no danger to the environment when their families may have lived for generations and would not do anything which would cause long-term damage to it.  There seems to be an idea that farmers or householders have no regard for the environment.  However, this is not true; they have as much regard for it as others because they live there and must continue to do so when the floods abate or are alleviated.  Much relief work can be done without affecting the environment. In emergency works it is not necessary to remove all the water from the area, but to provide a way for the excess flood water to drain away.  Will the Minister clarify what emergency works can be carried out in those situations?  I support householders who, provided they are not affecting others downstream, carry out emergency works to save their homes during flooding.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4. &mdash;The Commissioners of Public Works and/or the Minister for Finance acting on behalf of the Government of Ireland, may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  vary the offers made to any persons, bodies, or companies whose properties deserve special consideration in exceptional circumstances;</P>
      <P>(b)  allow only pro-rata insurance compensation allowances against any offers being made by the State to any person, bodies, companies or otherwise;</P>
      <P>(c)  waive all or any taxes, fees, etc., of any type, or part thereof, which would be payable by any person, body, company or otherwise, in any subsequent transaction, in either the restoration or replacement of an existing property, or in the acquisition of a new or other property, deemed necessary as a result of any disaster;</P>
      <P>(d)  allow any person, body, company or otherwise to salvage parts, pieces, sections or otherwise, of any property affected by any type of disaster and remove same, including personal belongings, etc.;</P>
      <P>(e)  allow all of these personal removals, free from inclusion or absolute deduction, from any subsequent financial entitlements under any compensation scheme;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(f)  allow any compensation payable to any person or body, company or otherwise, to be inclusive <Col N="631" /> of all or part of any other similar public grant for the acquisition or development of a similar property, in any compensation being paid by the State, or any of its Agencies, or Departments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am making a special appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment.  I stated on Committee Stage that there are advantages and disadvantages for people in whatever law is proposed.  No matter how a situation is judged, there will always be exceptions.  For one reason or another some people will not qualify for or gain from what is proposed to the same extent as others.</P>
    <P>There are exceptions involving flooding victims in my county and I am sure this is the position elsewhere.  In certain cases people, who are still young and raising families, used their life savings to build beautiful homes.  They now find themselves out of work and their homes face a constant threat of flooding.  If they are compensated as proposed, they will not be able to replace their houses. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment which will give him the power to vary offers.  He can take account of the information available to him and the visual aspect of the situation where it is obvious that the value of the house prior to the flooding was much greater.</P>
    <P>Many people have been put out of business as a result of flooding, but the Bill does not propose to compensate them or assist them to set up new businesses or restart operations.  It is vital the Minister has flexibility under law to consider this aspect and make offers to people to ensure their rights as self-employed people in traditional businesses are protected and retained.  We have a duty to ensure people are assisted to remain in business and are not driven from the area.  It would be a disaster for the west and many other parts of the country if that happened.  I appeal to the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>Where insurance companies have <Col N="632" /> compensated people at the rate of a percentage of £40,000 and the Minister proposes to compensate them at the rate of a percentage of £60,000 and subtract deductions from that amount, the percentage deduction should be equal to the percentage of the £40,000 they received in compensation on the insurance claim.  In other words, the deduction would be <i>pro rata</i> and would not place an unfair burden on people.  If the total deduction from a greater figure is taken into account, people will have less money to replace their homes and ensure they can secure the best option away from future flooding.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to take into account that people may have already paid stamp duty for previous purchases in addition to Land Registry fees.  The amendment seeks to ensure the Minister has the right, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, to either waive all or part of fees and so on in view of the fact that people, as a result of flooding, will have to pay fees and taxes which they would not otherwise have to pay.  The amendment also seeks to ensure people will not be penalised for salvaging personal belongings and other items of value to them.  In terms of demolition, it would be of assistance to the State if these people were allowed to remove anything which is useful and personal without being penalised for doing so.  People who are forced to build a new house because of flooding are ineligible for a new house grant or any other type of subsidy.  The Minister should take that into account in his overall package of compensation and provide an allowance or a percentage of any offer being made.</P>
    <P>This is a composite amendment which gives the Minister the flexibility to take everything into account in making a fair and humane decision and ensuring that the victims of flooding receive some compensation, not only for their personal losses but also for the terrible trauma they have suffered over the past year and a half.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputy Treacy and I have sympathy for the proposal regarding storm and fire damage which was ruled out of order because of the expenditure it would involve.  The difficulty is that the Minister has a relatively small amount of funding available to him this year and the more demands that are made on him the more he will move away from his original objective, namely, draining the rivers that are constantly flooding.  People who suffer as a result of flash flooding have to be compensated but the problem is far more serious for those who have suffered the effects of flooding for the past 20, 30 or 40 years.  The Owenmore and Arrow rivers in my constituency were at the top of the priority list for arterial drainage but, for cost benefit reasons, there will not now be any further arterial drainage. I accept that but all arterial drainage has been suspended and that is unfortunate for the other rivers on the original list.  I am sure the Minister, who follows a logical theme in all his activities, will ensure these rivers are placed at the top of the new list which I believe is to be drawn up in the next six weeks. While I sympathise with Deputy Treacy I cannot support any expansion which would place additional demands on the limited funds available to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon for supporting my proposal to solve this problem.  I know he feels as passionately about the Owenmore and Arrow rivers as I do about solving the problem in my own county.  In relation to the amendment before us, I understood householders were allowed to salvage personal belongings from the abandoned house so that proposal in the amendment is unnecessary.  I have sympathy for people who have to leave their flooded houses.  In my county, I am aware of four or five cases where the people involved had to abandon what were originally modern homes.  Those <Col N="634" /> people did not relocate by choice; they could not return to their houses because of flood damage and the fear that the flooding may recur.  Nobody would return to a house that had been flooded with three or four feet of water without the original problem being resolved.</P>
      <P>There should be more co-operation between Departments in solving this problem which is not only the responsibility of the Office of Public Works but of the Department of the Environment and other Departments.  People who are forced to leave their homes and buy new ones because of flooding should be treated as first time buyers because they do not have any choice in taking that action.  The Department of the Environment should consider allowing those people to avail of the grant for first time buyers.  A case might also be made with regard to stamp duty or other similar expenses which are necessitated by people being forced to abandon their flooded homes.</P>

Despite the fact there has been a major drawdown of taxpayers' money, including EU funding, and given the fact that a number of householders have been waiting for their cheques for quite some time, I hope those cheques wil be issued by the Department as early as next week.  We have talked about this problem <i>ad nauseam</i> but I will simply say that there are ten or 12 people in my area who do not have a house and who cannot return to their homes because they were ruined by flooding.  We must ensure that the cheques go out to those people.  I realise the Minister put much work into solving this problem but I appeal to him to ensure that these cheques are issued so that people can make arrangements during the summer months to build new houses.  We can then put our minds to ensuring that the problem does not recur and that can be done by draining the area over the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the proposed <Col N="636" /> amendment, I said last week &mdash; and I repeat now &mdash; that all the items in the amendment are being considered in the context of the individual scheme for humanitarian aid resulting from the floods of 1995.  There is a problem with including in enabling legislation the details of a specific scheme in the sense that a similar occurrence in the future would almost certainly require a different detailed response.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate to include the details of a specific scheme in response to a single event.  Furthermore, the parliamentary draftsman has advised against accepting the amendment which he considers unnecessary and says there is a danger that a court might at some stage in the future interpret the provisions as defining limits to the commissioners' powers, rather than conferring extra powers as intended.  Judging from his comments on other amendments, the last thing Deputy Treacy would want to do is limit their powers to deal with similar, but not identical, situations in the future.  For this reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to debate the individual items in detail as they have been discussed previously.  There is a scheme in place which can be availed of by those who require assistance.  A response has been received from the two organisations which represent their interests. They have asked us to meet them to discuss some of the points raised and I am willing to do so without opening up the possibility of substantially changing the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton made the comment that cheques should be sent out tonight.  I want to resolve the matter as quickly as I possibly can.  After this legislation is passed we will agree to a meeting with the South Galway Flood Victims' Group and the local branch of the IFA and write to each individual with a firm proposal which they can either accept or reject.  We can then arrange for the completion of the arrangements and the payment of cheques.  I would not, however, like the <Col N="637" /> message to go out from this House that we will be writing to them this afternoon, much as I would like to do so.  I do not intend to spend any more time than is essential to bring the matter to an early conclusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon mentioned the Owenmore and Arrow rivers.  This matter has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions by him and Deputy Mattie Brennan.  As Deputies are aware, there are eight schemes at various stages of design and which will proceed to construction this year, the most advanced of which is the scheme for Six-milebridge. I am approaching with urgency the task of producing a short list of priority projects to be completed in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <P>Deputy McCormack made a number of points.  There is an overwhelming temptation to do something urgently when flood waters are rising in a person's home to relieve their difficulties and pain.  I hope a balance has been struck in providing funding through the Office of Public Works for the scheme with which the Deputy is especially identified.  While I accept that people are intensely concerned about their local environment there are conflicts about environmental issues whenever there is a need to do something urgently when a person's home is under threat.  There is the possibility that this could ultimately lead to environmental <Col N="638" /> damage.  It will always be difficult to strike a balance.  I have great sympathy for what the Deputy said about the need for emergency works.  There is nothing in this Bill which would preclude us from doing so in the future.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for irritating the Deputy.  I spoke to the Minister of State last week about the Oranmore and Arrow rivers as the local committee was disappointed with the reply I had received to a parliamentary question.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that what it is looking for is £200,000 for drainage works on the Owenmore river and £100,000 for the Arrow river.  If money is scarce, it would be prepared to accept half these amounts.  A survey has already been carried out.  This scheme should be included as one of the eight priority projects, this is not too much to ask.  For many years the people of the area have suffered the consequences of flooding.</P>
      <P>While we accept that something must be done to alleviate the pain and trauma of the people of Tipperary and south Galway whose homes have been flooded, the land, houses and roads adjacent to the Owenmore and Arrow rivers, have been flooded for several years in succession and the position continues to deteriorate.  The people affected are not asking for major works to be carried out, but for the rivers to be cleaned.  I am sure the small amounts of money required can be found.</P>

      <P>Not to have all the emphasis on flooding in the west, it is important to stress the extent of the flooding in south County Tipperary.  I am delighted with the Minister's response to date and we await further good news from him.</P>
      <P>The causes of flooding and the means of compensating those who have suffered immeasurably from it must be addressed.  The most important issue is to locate the cause and resolve the problem. In south Tipperary it was not so much land but housing and living accommodation that was enormously affected.  While those involved are pleased that the Minister has responded positively to calls for compensation, it must be asked if money is well spent in redecorating and refurbishing houses that continue to be liable to flooding. We had enormous flooding last October which was repeated last month.  Three weeks ago, on another very wet weekend, all the residents of the areas likely to be flooded remained up all Saturday night waiting in trepidation as the waters rose.  Thankfully the waters only came as far as the doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look seriously at the possibility of providing different accommodation or enabling those involved to move.  This is the reality that faces us in south Tipperary.  The properties of those involved have been devalued. Many of them have been resident in the area throughout their lives, like their forebears, and never intended to move. There should be some means whereby they can be helped to relocate.  This is the final solution to the problem.  It is important they should not bear the loss involved unaided.  It is not their fault they have been flooded.  Many of the houses involved were built in the past five to ten years after planning permission was granted.  Part of the responsibility should be assumed by the planning authority.  These people cannot <Col N="640" /> afford to move house unless they get some kind of financial support from the State.  I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister is in charge of rivers and waterways I ask him to keep in constant contact with the local authorities concerned.  I was very disappointed and annoyed when, in response to a request by me to Clonmel Corporation to investigate the causes of the extreme flooding in Clonmel, indicating that the recently installed sewerage system may have been a contributing factor, the corporation got the consultants who designed and installed the system to examine their own work with a view to ascertaining if it contributed to the flooding disaster.  To invite the team that undertook the work to examine its own work was a waste of public funds. Naturally they concluded that their work did not contribute to the flooding. I ask the Minister to arrange for an independent investigation of the recent works on the banks and on the river bed within south County Tipperary and to advise if they have contributed to the problem.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the forthcoming visit by the Minister to Clonmel.  We are grateful for the convincing and successful case he put on our behalf in Brussels. However, we must never forget that, while the flooding is over and the water has receded, people continue to live in their residences in undesirable circumstances. Many of them are still confined to their upstairs quarters.  The sooner we put in place the compensation level the more it will be appreciated by the residents.  We do not want to see them facing the summer with their houses in their present condition.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted the amendment.  Under section 2 of the Bill the Minister and the commissioners will be empowered to make schemes or other arrangements for the provision of assistance and so on.  Most Bills which give such powers to Ministers, commissioners, bodies etc.  include an appendix listing what may or may not <Col N="641" /> be done.  Why is this not possible here? The Minister said that a court may determine that it could be the definitive list of what may or may not be done. Would it not be possible to include these provisions in addition to a clause empowering the Minister to add or delete from it, rather than leaving it to the Minister of the day to make a decision as to what is or is not allowed?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 38, after &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;save where the Commissioners of Public Works provide the necessary moneys to do so&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would allow the Commissioners of Public Works to make funding available for emergency accommodation, either through purchase or construction, in the case of a disaster or crisis, thereby preventing any delays which may arise if it had to be provided by the local authority, Department of the Environment or some other State agency.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is proposed in the Bill that any arrangements between the Commissioners of Public Works and the local authority for the provision of living accommodation would be agreed on a voluntary basis.  The amendment would place a statutory obligation on the authority concerned to provide such accommodation whenever the commissioners provided it with the necessary funds. Where the authority, for whatever reason, is not in a position to provide living accommodation at the commissioners' request, the commissioners would have to make other arrangements, and would do so.  The commissioners are being given the facility under section 2 to make moneys available and no additional provision is necessary.  I assure the House that there is no question of housing authorities being required by the Bill to provide living accommodation from their own resources as part of a humanitarian assistance scheme.  I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal in amendment No. 1 to insert the words &ldquo;or the Government of Ireland&rdquo; in this section.  I do so because for many years arguments have arisen between the Departments of the Environment, Marine and Defence about responsibility for works to be carried out in coastal and harbour areas, with the result that works have not been carried out swiftly. If one Department had responsibility for these works they would be carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage (Transfer of Ministerial Functions) Order, 1986, transferred responsibility for arterial drainage to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Will the Department and the Commissioners of Public Works need to have discussions on every problem which arises, thereby causing further delays and possibly giving rise to more damage?  It is important to sort out this matter now so that it will not be necessary in six to eight months' time to make further changes.  The argument that this is the way it was always done does not hold water.  If this was the case we would not be able to introduce any changes.  As a businessman the Minister knows it is not good enough to say that because something was done such a way ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ago it can only be done that way today.  If <Col N="646" /> something has to be done then one should do it.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Deputies raised the issue of a Statutory Instrument of which I had not been aware.  I have a complete answer and they are entitled to have it.  Statutory Instrument No. 128 of 1987 under the Arterial Drainage (Transfer of Ministerial Functions) Order, 1986, states that the functions vested by virtue of that order in the Minister for Agriculture and Food under the Arterial Drainage Act are transferred back to the Minister for Finance.  That answers the point.  This Statutory Instrument was implemented during Deputy Treacy's tenure as Minister of State at the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for that too.  He saw the necessity for dealing with this matter urgently.  I am pleased that something which only came to my attention before Christmas is now dealt with in legislation.  This legislation copperfastens the Government's powers in this respect and allows the Government to do the things that everybody in this House, particularly the Deputies from the west, wish it to do in relation to humanitarian aid.  In particular, it allows the Government to get behind the causes of flooding and to come up with some solutions.</P>
      <P>I am anxious during my tenure as Minister of State to receive the conclusions from the major consultancy work in south Galway, which I regard as almost the most important work in progress in the Office of Public Works. I hope to have a debate about those conclusions in this House during my tenure so we can look forward to dealing with the problem rather than the consequences of the problem, although dealing with these is also important.  I thank all the Deputies who took part in the debate for their co-operation and support.</P>

This is important legislation.  I wish the Minister success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my sincere thanks on behalf of my party to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and to his predecessors, Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Hogan for their caring approach to this difficult problem.  I congratulate the Government on the initiative it took in bringing forward this Bill.  These floods were not a once off phenomenon. <Col N="648" /> They have occurred every year for several years.  I have raised that matter as a public representative for that constituency while in Opposition, requesting the Government of the day to take some positive action to relieve these people of the possibility of serious flooding year after year.  No action was taken by the previous Government in that matter.</P>
      <P>It is proper that the record should show my thanks to the present Government for the action it has taken.  At all times the Minister has proved himself most understanding and considerate in the way in which he has met and dealt with this issue.  I hope the Government will not sit back now that this Bill has been passed and feel that it has made its contribution.  Consultants have been asked to make recommendations on the major works that will be required to alleviate flooding so as to ensure that this phenomenon does not recur.  These recommendations will be the subject of much debate in this House.</P>
      <P>To date the Government has acted in the best way it could in providing humanitarian aid and, through this Bill, providing for the housing of people whose homes are irretrievably damaged. The people of south Galway have suffered enormously.  I congratulate those who organised themselves to fight the battle which has resulted in the Government's taking this action, particularly the south Galway flood victims action committee, which has done phenomenal work on behalf of its neighbours.  The leaders in that group did a great service to their community.  The south Galway IFA played a major role in organising meetings locally and nationally and in drawing up reports on the effect of the damage.  Those two groups have had to work extremely hard and very long time in order to achieve some of the action that has been taken to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the steps to be taken for the long-term solutions to this problem are seen, the Government will not be found wanting.  It would be very remiss of me not to express my sincere thanks to the Minister, Deputy <Col N="649" /> Coveney, and to the Government for the action taken today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of the previous speaker in paying tribute to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his predecessors for the very positive way they have dealt with all those involved in this serious situation.  I also pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for its professional expertise and for the way it has dealt with the people not alone in this situation but over the decades in serving their country.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government to stop destroying the Office of Public Works. Last month the Government took a serious decision pertaining to the Office of Public Works.  It is now proposed to establish another quango, an inland waterways authority.  This kind of expertise is already available.  The Office of Public Works has served this country with great distinction and the government now proposes to destroy the tremendous expertise, commitment and staff morale within the Office of Public Works which has served this country so well for so long.  I hope the Taoiseach will listen to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and ensure that the Office of Public Works is allowed to continue to serve this country.  It has a tremendous record of service and a great ability to serve our nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the south Galway flood victims action group.  I was exceedingly disappointed that the Minister for Social Welfare did not see fit to give them a grant to underwrite their huge administration expenses.  Perhaps he might reconsider.  I also pay tribute to the south Galway IFA and the Kilternan flood action group.  Those people, working together, took initiatives to assist their own communities and flood victims.  They received State support through the Office of Public Works.  I pay tribute to Galway County Council and the Western Health Board for the tremendous work they did.  Only £50,000 extra was made available to the council to carry out a huge amount of <Col N="650" /> work in our country.  Perhaps further moneys could be made available to assist them in upgrading the roads.</P>
    <P>I also want to remember the tremendous work being done by the community in north Galway particularly in the Williamstown, Glenamaddy and Dunmore areas which were also victims of serious flooding.  I am confident that once this Bill is passed, the Commissioners, guided by the Minister, will ensure that offers are made rapidly to the victims of flooding and, more particularly, vital remedial works will be commenced as quickly as possible so that we will not have to go through this trauma again in the future.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the refusal by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks of an application to register a trade mark which includes the harp or shamrock, the national flag or emblems of public authorities.  The effect of the amendment to subsection (3) is that the controller's discretion in deciding whether a badge, device or emblem is that of a public authority is removed.  It will need to be clear that the trade mark contains a badge, device or emblem of a public authority before <Col N="651" /> the controller may refuse the application. Such refusal will not arise if the public authority consents to the use of its badge, device or emblem.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage as amendment No. 5. As indicated to the House I was disposed to accept the amendment as an imporovement to the text.</P>
      <P>Section 10 sets out the relative grounds for the refusal of a trade mark application.  Relative grounds involve conflict with other marks as opposed to the absolute grounds in section 8, which relate to the nature of the mark itself.</P>
      <P>Subsection 10 (4), paragraph (a) implements Article 4 (4) (b) of the directive which provides that a mark shall not be registrable if it conflicts with earlier rights protecting unregistered marks.  Those rights are set out in subsection (4) and the amended text brings out more clearly the point that it is these earlier rights which prevent acceptance of a trade mark rather than subsection (4) itself.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;(1) This section applies where on an application for the registration of a trade mark, it appears to the Controller&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) that there is an earlier trade mark in relation to which any of the <Col N="652" /> conditions set out in subsections (1) to (3) of section 10 obtains, or</P>
    <P>(b) that there is an earlier right in relation to which the condition set out in section 10 (4) is satisfied,</P>
    <P>but the applicant shows to the satisfaction of the Controller that there has been honest concurrent use of the trade mark for which registration is sought.</P>
    <P>(2) In a case to which this section applies, the Controller shall not refuse the application by reason of the earlier trade mark or other earlier right unless objection on that ground is raised in opposition proceedings by the proprietor of that earlier trade mark or other earlier right.</P>
    <P>(3) For the purposes of this section &lsquo;honest concurrent use&rsquo; means such use in the State, by the applicant or with his consent, as would formerly have amounted to honest concurrent use for the purposes of section 20 (2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>(4) Nothing in this section affects&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the refusal of registration on the grounds mentioned in <i>section 8</i>; or</P>
    <P>(b) the making of an application for a declaration of invalidity under section 50 (2).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I withdrew this amendment on Committee Stage to review the text.  I am now satisfied with the text which follows section 7 of the UK Trade Marks Act, 1994.  The controller is obliged to refuse an application on the relative grounds as set out in section 10, where the application conflicts with an earlier mark.</P>
    <P>This amendment introduces a new provision by way of exception to section 10.  It allows for the applicants to demonstrate that there has been honest concurrent use of the mark applied for with an earlier mark or other right.  The controller will proceed to publication of the mark upon being satisfied of honest <Col N="653" /> concurrent use and, if there is no opposition, the mark will be registered in due course.  If, on the other hand, there is opposition, the controller will decide whether the ground for refusal is made out.</P>
    <P>While Article 5 of the directive requires a trade mark to be excluded from the register if it conflicts with an earlier mark or other right, the fifth recital to the directive gives member states latitude as to the stage at which relative grounds are to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  If on an application for the registration of a trade mark, it appears to the Controller that any particular element of the trade mark is not distinctive and the inclusion of the element in the trade mark could give rise to doubts as to the scope of protection of the trade mark, he may refuse to accept the application unless the applicant agrees to make a disclaimer in respect of that element under subsection (1) (a) within such period as the Controller may specify.</P>
      <P>(3)  Particulars of any disclaimer or limitation shall be entered in the register.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 16 allows for the disclaiming of a particular element of a mark or the imposition of a limitation as to its effects.  Up to now this Bill only provided for voluntary disclaimers and limitations. These would generally arise where applicants offered a disclaimer or limitation to overcome potential opposition to a trade mark application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputies O'Keeffe and McDowell tabled amendments to allow for compulsory disclaimers of elements of trade marks by the controller.  I indicated then that I <Col N="654" /> would accept the principle of compulsory disclaimers and undertook to amend this section accordingly.</P>

      <P>Section 20 is an important provision which defines infringing goods, material and articles.  The amendment now proposed makes clear that an infringement arises if the packaging of goods bears a sign which infringes a registered trade mark.

      <P>In page 18, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;24. (1) If the District Court is satisfied by evidence that there is reasonable ground for believing that infringing goods, material or <Col N="655" /> articles are in the possession, custody or control of any person in the course of business or otherwise for the purpose of dealing in any way (including offering or exposing for sale), the District Court may by order authorise a member of the Garda Síochána to seize the goods, material or articles without warrant and to bring them before the court.</P>
    <P>(2)  If a judge of the District Court is satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that infringing goods, material or articles are on any premises in the course of business or otherwise for the purpose of dealing in any way, the judge may grant a search warrant authorising a named member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector, accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána as may be necessary, to enter on the premises, if need be by force, and to seize any such goods, material or articles and bring them before the court.</P>
    <P>(3) On proof to the District Court that any goods, material or articles brought before the court under subsection (1) or (2) are infringing goods, material or articles, the court may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) order them to be delivered up to the proprietor of the registered trade mark concerned;</P>
    <P>(b) order them to be destroyed or forfeited to such person as the court thinks fit; or</P>
    <P>(c) order them to be dealt with in such other way as the court thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(4) The powers of the District Court under this section shall be exercisable by the judge of the District Court for the district in which the goods, material or articles are for the time being or, as the case <Col N="656" /> may be, where the premises concerned are situated.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the debate on Committee Stage there was general support for section 90 dealing with counterfeiting, and the need to facilitate trade mark proprietors in the protection of their brands.  Following consideration of the views expressed by a number of Deputies, including in particular Deputies O'Keeffe and McDowell, I undertook to reflect on whether section 90 was adequate to deal with trade mark offences.</P>
    <P>The example of large-scale production of glassware to deliberately feed off the reputation of our most famous producer of hand crafted glassware was cited.  In such a situation the remedy of delivery up provided for in section 19, may not be sufficiently effective.  I, therefore, propose a new provision to allow for seizure of infringing goods, materials or articles, as defined in section 20.  The parliamentary draftsman has advised that this provision is best included as a free-standing provision after section 22, rather than as part of section 90.  Deputy Kitt asked me to consider the involvement of the District Court in protecting the rights of trade mark proprietors due to the nature and manner in which Circuit Court vacations arise.  This provision allows for the District Court to authorise seizure of infringing goods, material or articles by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) allows for the District Court to authorise seizure of goods, material or articles.  This would enable a member of the Garda Síochána to seize items and to bring them before the court.  This subsection follows subsection 27 (4) of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1987, and will provide one remedy for trade mark proprietors whose mark is being infringed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) mirrors subsection 27 (5) of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1987 and allows for a judge of the District Court to grant a search warrant to the Garda Síochána and to authorise seizure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Subsection (3) provides that the District Court may order that goods, material or articles, seized under subsections (1) or (2), be delivered up, destroyed, forfeited or dealt with in such other way as the court thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states that the powers of the District Court shall be exercisable for the district in which the goods, material or articles are situated.</P>
    <P>This provision will facilitate trade marks proprietors in taking effective action against infringement.  It extends the remedies available to owners of copyright under section 27 of the Copyright (Amendment) Act to owners of trade marks.  Subsection (2) should be particularly helpful in tackling large-scale operations which make illegal use of trade marks.</P>

      <P>I notice that the warrant is to bring the material before the court.  The Minister might consider amending this to state that the material does not have to be brought before the court.  The section could be amended by providing that the material be detained by order of the court or brought before the court.  It would be unrealistic to require, for example, a crane or £500,000 worth of crystal to be brought before the court.  What purpose would be served by bringing such goods before the court?</P>

As regards amendment No. 19, I kept in mind the views expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe when constructing my amendment. In the opinion of the parliamentary draftsman &mdash; and in our opinion &mdash; his purpose is met within amendment <Col N="658" /> No. 6 which is a draconian measure compared to the present position.

    <P>&ldquo;(5)  The registration procedure shall be regarded as completed on the date of publication under subsection (4); and that date shall be entered in the register.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides for registration of a trade mark when any objections to the application have been overcome.  On Committee Stage Deputy McDowell tabled as amendment No. 3 an additional definition in section 2 which defined the date of the publication of the registration to be the date of completion of the registration procedure.  I undertook to consider the amendment further.  While the term &ldquo;date of completion of the registration procedure&rdquo; is used in article 10 of the directive we have substituted the term &ldquo;date of publication of the registration&rdquo; for convenience as it is an easily ascertainable date.  The definition suggested by Deputy McDowell was acceptable.  The parliamentary draftsman has suggested that the most appropriate place to incorporate the point that the two terms referred to shall be treated as one and the same under this legislation is in the new subsection (5) of section 43.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also moved amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage to provide that the date of publication of the registration shall appear on the register and certificate of registration.  I indicated that I was disposed towards providing for the date of publication of the registration to appear on the register only. The wording now proposed covers that point.</P>

    <P>This amendment is slightly different from the one I tabled on Committee Stage.  The original amendment did not provide for the controller to notify parties who might be affected by the correction of an error in the register.  The corresponding provision in section 110 (3) of the Patents Act, 1992, provides for such notification.  I move this amendment in the interests of informing concerned parties who may have been misled by an error in the register and for the sake of uniformity with the patents legislation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;unless all the partners are either or both a registered Trade Mark or Patent Agent or the partnership satisfies such conditions as may be prescribed for the purposes of this section.  A partnership of one or more registered Trade Mark Agents and one or more registered Patent Agents shall be deemed not to contravene section 106 or section 125 of the Patents Act, 1992.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to create some flexibility in and jurisdiction over the rules dealing with partnership.  The purpose is to allow trade mark and patent agents to be partners in firms which conduct business under the patents jurisdiction and the trade mark jurisdiction and not to require, as appears to be the case at present, that one is either a trade mark agent exclusively or a patent agent exclusively when conducting business in either case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some large firms in Dublin function as patent and trade mark agents.  It seem absurd that they are required to form <Col N="661" /> separate partnerships to carry out different functions.  The rules should recognise that patent and trade mark agents form partnerships and that firms established generally for the purpose of the intellectual property law in terms of patents and trade marks should be permitted to function in either area regardless of whether the firm in question has among its partners practitioners of the other art.  In terms of practicality, there is nothing to be lost but a great deal to be gained from this amendment.  The Bill in its present form can be relatively easily circumvented by establishing two partnerships working together as partners in owning property and running companies.  The reality is that companies are functioning as trade mark agents and patent agents and that should be recognised in law for the purpose of the Trade Marks Act and the Patents Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the UK is that partnerships and bodies corporate can use the title &ldquo;patent agent&rdquo; provided all partners or directors are registered agents for patent or trade mark work and at least one-quarter of them are registered patent agents.  To use the title &ldquo;registered trade mark agents&rdquo; all partners or directors must be registered agents of one type or the other and at least one-quarter must be registered trade mark agents.  Patent agents must indicate their qualification on all correspondence for mixed partnerships.  I am not convinced of the need or justification for such arrangements here.  The association has indicated that practically every patent agent is also qualified as a registered trade mark agent, although the converse position is less frequently encountered.  Thus persons with dual qualifications can represent themselves as registered patent and trade mark agents.  To extend this facility to partnerships where individual partners do not possess dual qualification is an unnecessary dilution of the principle enshrined in legislation that partnerships should not hold themselves out to be qualified in a discipline unless all the partnerships are so qualified.  On my <Col N="662" /> advice that is the nub of the case made against Deputy McDowell's amendment.</P>
      <P>The argument has been made that the principal occupation of both patent agents and registered trade mark agents is dealing with the Irish patents office and mixed partnerships should be allowed.  Increasingly, patents work has been moving to the European patents office and a similar trend whereby trade marks will be registered at the Community trade mark office in Spain seems likely.  That would indicate a need for specialisation in each field rather than a dilution of the principle that partnerships should describe themselves as qualified only in matters where all the partners are so qualified.  Given the powers agents have in terms of legal privilege and the preparation of deeds, it is essential the public is in no doubt about the qualifications of the individual partners in a firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks the facility to use the term &ldquo;Community Trade Mark Attorney&rdquo; and to enshrine it in the legislation.  I indicated on Committee Stage that the term &ldquo;Trade Mark Attorney&rdquo; is permitted under section 86 of the UK Trade Mark Act, 1994, and extends the use of the term &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; given in the UK Copyright Designs and Patents Act, 1988, to patent agents into the area of trade marks.  Patent agents may act before a patents county court in the UK.  At the time of the Patents Act, 1992, the use of the term &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; was considered for patent agents here.  It was decided to permit the use of the restricted term &ldquo;European patent attorney&rdquo; in section 126 of that Act.  As trade mark agents do not have a right of audience before a court in this jurisdiction the title &ldquo;Trade Mark Attorney&rdquo; should not be incorporated in legislation.</P>
      <P>On Deputy McDowell's amendment to the amendment, I am well disposed towards the new proposal to permit the use of the term &ldquo;Community Trade Mark Attorney&rdquo;.  The title indicates the qualification of trade marks agents who are registered to act before the Community trade mark office in Spain.  That title should assist the profession in securing international business and generating employment opportunities.  Consequently I am prepared to accept the amended amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes that it be an offence to be in possession of machinery and other equipment with the intention of using it for counterfeiting.  The amendment allows for a procedure whereby any such goods being used or intended to be used for counterfeiting should be forfeited.

      <P>When Deputy O'Keeffe put down these amendments he was not aware of the contents of my amendment No. 6.  I refer him and Deputy McDowell to the definition of the term &ldquo;articles&rdquo; in section 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 90 provides for the unauthorised use or application of a registered trade mark to be an offence.  Section 13 defines the acts which constitute infringement.  Infringement occurs when a person uses a sign which is identical or similar to a registered trade mark in connection with goods or services which <Col N="665" /> are identical or similar to those for which the mark is registered.  Where the trade mark is well known infringement extends to use in connection with non-similar goods or services.</P>
    <P>I refer Deputies O'Keeffe and McDowell to section 20 which defines infringing goods, material or articles.  As defined in section 20 (5), &ldquo;infringing articles&rdquo; include articles which are used to produce counterfeit goods.  The seizure provisions included in the Bill, following the carrying of amendment No. 6, will allow infringing articles to be brought before the court and dealt with as the court sees fit.  The amendment tabled as a new subparagraph (e) in section 90 (1) relies heavily on proof of intent to commit an offence.  The seizure provision should be more effective in that infringing articles, as well as goods and materials, may be seized and brought before the court to be dealt with as the court see fit.</P>
    <P>I am of the view, therefore, that the purpose of Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment is met by the rigorous new sections inserted.  I am not disposed to accepting amendments Nos. 13 or 14 as I am advised it would be extremely difficult to prove that machinery or tools were to be used to commit an offence under section 90.  The definition of &ldquo;articles&rdquo; under section 20 and the provision to allow &ldquo;infringing articles&rdquo; to be brought before the court and dealt with as the court sees fit deals very severely with the phenomenon Deputy O'Keeffe is trying to address.</P>

      <P>(a)  which are specifically designed or adapted for making copies of a sign identical or similar to that mark, and</P>

      <P>If I established a backstreet factory using glass cutting machinery, unless Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment is accepted it would not be an offence for me to have such machinery with the intent of carrying out counterfeiting operations.  If it became abundantly clear to the court that I had that machinery for the purpose of a counterfeiting operation, it would not fall within the category of an infringing article under section 20 (5) because it is not especially adapted for that purpose; it is merely glass cutting machinery and I could have it for a variety of purposes. It is not especially adapted for making copies of a sign identical to, say, the Waterford mark.  Deputy O'Keeffe is right to seek to extend the penal provisions for possessing equipment for the purpose of a counterfeiting operation and making such equipment liable to confiscation where there is a conviction.

I have no objection to taking further advice on the matter before the Bill goes back to the Seanad, but my advice is that that amendment goes as far as possible.

      <P>There is nothing to stop counterfeiters reoffending if they are allowed retain their equipment.  The goods may be confiscated but a Counterfeiter may continue to operate using counterfeiting machinery.  Counterfeiting may be a very lucrative business involving millions of pounds, as is the case in other parts of the world.  Such businesses may be operating here.  If counterfeiters are allowed retain counterfeiting machinery, they may reoffend.  The only way to put them out of business is to confiscate counterfeiting machinery.  There is merit in my amendment.  I will not press it because it will not be carried, but I ask the Minister to accept the spirit of it.</P>

      <P>In page 47, line 11, to delete &ldquo;ten years or to a fine not exceeding £200,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five years or to a fine not exceeding £100,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Resulting from acceptance of my amendment No. 6, I propose to reduce the penalties provided for in section 90 (4) (b) from ten years to five years and from £200,000 to £100,000.  Deputies Byrne and Crawford asked me to review the level of penalties provided for in this subsection.</P>
      <P>The new provisions on seizure I have introduced today allow the court to order counterfeit goods, material or articles, to be delivered up, destroyed, forfeited or otherwise as it thinks fit. This will entail a severe financial penalty in direct proportion to the scale of the counterfeiting involved.  Given the sanctions now provided under the seizure provision in amendment No. 6, the penalties in this subsection need not be as severe.</P>

      <P>We had much discussion on this matter on Committee Stage when, to be fair, Deputy Byrne was confused between criminal law and business law.  It goes without saying that greater irregularities and fraudulent methods can arise in the later case than in criminal law.  In the course of our Committee Stage discussions great play was made of the penalties being imposed in section 90.  I note that the Minister has halved the penalties to be imposed whenever a person is found guilty on indictment under this section.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to withdraw his amendment in favour of mine.  Bearing in mind that £200,000 in business is a small amount of money such a penalty is merited.  It is a pity we became so confused between criminal and business law.</P>

      <P>Yet again I find <Col N="671" /> myself in agreement with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe on this matter.  In reducing the maximum penalty the Minister fails to have regard to the fact that the maximum penalty for many offences has nothing to do with what a court will apply in most cases.  The maximum penalty is what a court can impose in a very serious case involving a repeat offender. For instance, the maximum penalty for many offences under the Larceny Act is ten years.  Very few are ever meted out that sentence, yet there are certain people for whom it would be appropriate. Under the Minister's amendment a penalty of five years is being provided. There should be a power of arrest for members of the Garda Síochána because, as the Bill now stands, somebody who is caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> can skip the jurisdiction since there is no power of arrest.  For example, whenever somebody is caught in circumstances in which it is likely they will flee the jurisdiction, say, somebody engaging in a counterfeiting operation in a Border region or something of that nature, there should be a power of arrest.  If there were a power of arrest, section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 would come into effect and there would be a power of detention for the purpose of questioning.  That should be available here and it is a mistake not to provide it.  If a garda comes across a group of people standing around in a factory producing a load of cut glass, with Waterford boxes beside them, and they give their names and addresses to the garda, the garda has to walk away while they walk out the back door of the factory, out of the jurisdiction.  It makes a mockery of our law.  There should be power of arrest to ensure that cannot occur. Subsection (5) &mdash; contained in Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment &mdash; should be inserted in the Seanad to prevent people literally walking away from the scene of a crime, never to be heard of again.</P>

      <P>Whenever a person is convicted, on indictment, of a second or subsequent offence, those large quantities of counterfeit goods should be forfeited. The criminals of the counterfeiting world, in which there is much activity, are different from the criminals to whom Deputy Byrne referred.  It is my belief that activities in the counterfeiting world are increasing to the extent that we must examine it overall, particularly in the interests of those who engage in legitimate business.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 18 proposes the insertion of an additional subsection.  As drafted, section 90 specifies that where a person is found in possession of counterfeit goods, he is not deemed to have committed an offence in respect of each particular article or material. Therefore, it is not possible to issue a summons or to charge a person in respect of each and every individual counterfeit article or material or even in respect of each and every trade mark infringed.  If thousands of counterfeit items are found in a warehouse, there may be only one summons issued in respect of all those items.  While the Minister may not consider it feasible to issue a summons in respect of each item, at least there should be a provision whereby a summons can be issued for each trade mark infringed.  If a warehouse is found to contain counterfeits of several different brands, a summons should be issued in respect of each brand so that each individual mark is protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same would apply in the case of a casual trading stall.  If a trader is found to be in possession of, say, 1,000 <Col N="673" /> counterfeit goods or material, he is not deemed to have committed 1,000 offences under the Bill.  In practice, only one summons will be issued.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept my amendment, thereby ensuring that a summons is issued in respect of each mark applicable to goods or material referred to in section 90 (1) and (2).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 18, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe proposes that where different marks are infringed, six separate offences are committed.  This approach is flawed as it would result in a retailer being fined six times the amount which a wholesaler dealing in much larger quantities of a single mark would face. The search and seizure powers being given to the Garda Síochána will facilitate trade mark proprietors in combating larger scale counterfeiting operations. Such operations may concentrate on a single brand &mdash; an example given on Committee Stage was that of a counterfeiter who might label, glass with a well known brand lable, costing the owners of the trade mark millions of <Col N="674" /> pounds in lost sales.  Contrast this with the market stallholder who peddles cheap clothing with six labels which are not genuine; the buyers of such garments will be less inclined to think the goods are genuine and the seller will make an illegal gain on the sale of those goods.  However, the profiteering of the racketeer in counterfeit glass will be far more than that of the stall holder but the Deputy's amendment will provide a potential penalty for the stall holder six times higher than the potential penalty for the glass racketeer.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, and leaving out the question of the possibility of skipping the jurisdiction amendment No. 6 goes a long way towards stamping out this activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 49, after line 49, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;101. &mdash;Stamp duty shall not be chargeable on any instrument relating to the assignment or other transmission of a Trade Mark either registered, un-registered or the subject of an application for registration and regardless of whether such assignment or transmission is in connection with the goodwill of a business or separately.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, instruments relating to the assignment or other transmission of a trade mark are not <Col N="676" /> subject to stamp duty in the United Kingdom and that should also be incorporated in Irish Statute.  Will the Minister take into account the good reasons that stamp duty should not be payable on instruments of assignment or transmission of trade marks which are in respect of either Irish marks or foreign marks executed in this country?  An instrument purporting to transfer a trade mark or other property is chargeable to stamp duty in the following circumstances: (1) if it is executed in the State; (2) if it relates wherever it is executed to property situated in the State; or (3) it relates to any matter or thing to be done in the State.  This is all provided for in the relatively recent restatement of the law relating to stamp duties in section 94 of the Finance Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The most immediate difficulty will arise in relation to the proposed Community trade marks and international registrations under the Madrid Protocol designating Ireland.  Such trade marks will not be properly situated in the State and so will only be chargeable to duty under grounds (1) or (3), that it was executed in the State or related to anything to be done in the State.  Accordingly, a French company transferring its Community trade mark agency to an Italian company by instrument executed in Paris necessitates the French company paying Irish stamp duty within 30 days of such execution, otherwise the document will be unenforceable in Ireland and the company would be liable to severe penalties in certain circumstances. A Community trade mark is unitary in its character and by definition covers the entire Community. Stamp duty provisions such as those in Ireland would require anyone transferring a Community trade mark to take legal and tax advice in relation to all 15 member states, which is an absurd notion and defeats the purpose of a Community trade mark and the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Section 61 of the UK Trade Mark Act provides that stamp duty shall not be chargeable on an instrument relating to <Col N="677" /> a Community trade mark or international trade mark or on an application for any such mark by reason only of the fact that such a mark has legal effect in the United Kingdom.  It would appear the effect of that provision is that it negates the third ground that it relates to any matter or thing to be done in the relevant jurisdiction.  It appears that it is a general policy in the United Kingdom to remove stamp duty from the financial sector.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we could have a measure which restricts the rule against stamp duty to Community or international trade marks.  There is a clear problem for us arising from the present state of affairs, that if the provision is not adopted persons conducting business in the State would be at an unfair disadvantage with respect to their colleagues elsewhere in the European Union.  Since the Community trade mark is part of a harmonisation measure designed to give further effect to the Single Market throughout the European Union, currency stamp duty provisions in this country, unless changed, will give rise to a distortion of the Single Market in breach of the State's obligation as a member of the European Union.  Not only are Irish businesses affected, it can effect trade between companies situated in other member states.  I believe the Irish Legislature should match the English Legislature and should go further to the extent set out in amendment No. 20.</P>
    <P>One of the other by-products of the present law is that activities will take place in relation to trade marks outside this jurisdiction rather than inside it and that will involve retention by trade mark proprietors and proposed assignees of trade mark agents other than Irish trade mark agents to do some of this work for them.  I strongly suggest that the national interest lies in excluding all these documents from stamp duty. Working out the value of a trade mark can be very difficult.  If the stamp duty branch of the Revenue Commissioners is confronted with a purported assignment of a &ldquo;Waterford&rdquo; or &ldquo;Coca Cola&rdquo;<Col N="678" /> trade mark for £1,000 or £10,000 how are they to work out the real value of the instrument?  It is almost impossible to work out the value of such a trade mark.  In a recent High Court case involving infringement, the High Court judge ruled that for compensation purposes the value of the trade mark was the cost of registering it.  This will create a situation where Irish trade mark agents carrying on their business have to deal with another nuisance, more bureaucracy.  This will not generate large sums for the Exchequer.  If large sums were involved the relevant assignments would take place outside the jurisdiction and people would probably take the risk of avoiding any duty here. One is dealing with intangible things whose value is difficult to ascertain.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated this was not a matter for his Department but it is a matter for the department in England which sponsored the trade mark Bill there.  They provided in their Bill, on which this Bill is closely modelled, that stamp duty would not be payable.  It is about time we took a pro-enterprise, practical, realistic approach to making sure that, in so far as possible, assignments of trade marks take place within this jurisdiction.  That brings in money to Irish trade mark agents and income to the country and does not send it abroad artificially.  This generates profits, VAT, employment and corporation tax.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons the State should match the UK in respect of Community trade marks and international marks and deal with all assignments of trade marks.  Putting stamp duty on them is a waste of time and is not a significant earner from the point of view of the Exchequer.  While I am all in favour of broadening the tax base, we could impose stamp duty on a number of things if we wished, for example, on hotel receipts &mdash; as some European countries do.  There is much to be said for being practical and trying to make Irish trade mark law modern, efficient, pro-enterprise and pro-employment and for giving trade mark agents, and <Col N="679" /> Ireland as a commercial base, exactly the same advantages as other parliaments within the European Union are giving their countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything that has been said by Deputy McDowell. On Committee Stage we had a long discussion on stamp duty on which I tabled an amendment.  I do not want to repeat what I said on that occasion because it is already on the record.  It is very difficult to value a trade mark.  The high level of stamp duty imposed will prohibit people from registering here. Much lower rates of stamp duty can be found in other European Union countries such as Spain.  The registration head office is in Alicante.  It will be more attractive to register in countries where the rates are lower.  This takes work away from our trade marks people and those involved in the legal and registering sides.</P>
      <P>It is important to create a pro-enterprise society rather than to adopt a negative approach.  One of our problems is that we are not a pro-enterprise economy because of a number of obstacles that have been put in the way.  Some mechanism should be put in place for the purpose of valuing a trade mark and assessing the stamp duty thereon.  When the stamp duty value is put on it, it is unattractive to register here.  People will go to the countries to which I have referred, especially Spain, which has a much lower rate than ours.</P>
      <P>I found it impossible to extract from the Minister for Finance, through the Revenue Commissioners, the amount of money paid in stamp duty on trade marks.  I do not know whether the amount is small or great.  Much effort must be put in by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in compiling the register and chasing those who register for moneys. I urge the Minister to consider a standard low rate of stamp duty which would encourage registration here from countries within the European Union.</P>

      <P>I am open to being corrected but I do not know that Deputy McDowell's assertion that no stamp duty is payable in the United Kingdom is correct.  My understanding is that stamp duty is still payable, but my information may well be out of date.  The guide prepared to the UK Trade Marks Act, 1994, may be out of date but the section on stamp duty states:</P>
      <P>For the time being it continues to be necessary to pay stamp duty on assignment documents.  No change is made by the new Act in this respect though documents relating solely to Community trade marks or to the Madrid Protocol International Registrations or to applications for them are exempted from stamp duty by section 61 of the Act.  It is anticipated that stamp duty will be abolished for intellectual property assignments in the near future, as part of a general removal of stamp duty in the financial sector.  In the meantime documents on which duty is payable should be presented for stamping within one month of execution or of receipt in this country, if executed abroad.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell and Deputy O'Keeffe are essentially making the argument that this is a bureaucratic obstruction.  If we go down the road, as in Britain, where it is envisaged that stamp duty will be abolished for intellectual property assignments and there will be a general removal of stamp duty in the financial sector, it seems to me &mdash; I am not speaking for the Minister for Finance &mdash; that that has revenue raising implications.  It would have to be seriously considered what impediment in a measurable way is constituted by the fact that stamp duty is payable here on the assignment of trade marks.  That would have to be measured in a practical way in the light of the potential loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat the point I made on Committee Stage that this is a matter for the Minister for Finance, not for me.  The concerns expressed by the profession, which both Deputies have repeated, centre on the treatment of Community <Col N="681" /> trade marks and international trade marks under the Madrid Protocol.  I note the points that have been made.  I wish to inform Deputy McDowell that officials in my Department facilitated a meeting between the Association of Patent and Trade Mark Agents and the Department of Finance on 22 February. At this meeting the association sought clarification on the liability to stamp duty on transfers of ownership of such trade marks.  The Department of Finance is considering the case put by the association and the matter rests there.</P>
    <P>In regard to whether the structural arrangements in place in the UK should apply here, or whether my Department, as distinct from the Department of Finance, should be responsible for this issue, I understand Deputy McDowell is saying that regardless of whether we are responsible technically we should make an input in terms of the implications for enterprise.  I take that point.  We have facilitated this meeting with the Department of Finance.  The association has had an opportunity to make its case.  My understanding is that the Department of Finance will consider it sympathetically and for that reason I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 61, to delete lines 2 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.  For the purposes of proceedings under section 50 (grounds for invalidity of registration) as it applies in relation to an existing registered mark, the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to have been in force at all material times:</P>
      <P>Provided that no objection to the validity of the registration of an existing registered mark may be taken on the grounds specified in subsection (3) of section 10 of this Act (relative grounds for refusal of registration: conflict with earlier mark registered for different goods or services).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to alter the transitional provisions of the Bill so that it will apply to existing registered trade marks on the basis that the new Act shall be deemed always to have been in force for one purpose, the grounds for invalidity of registration.  I will not make a song and dance about it, but the Minister has a straightforward choice.  He can opt to allow the grounds for invalidity in the 1963 Act to govern <Col N="684" /> trade marks indefinitely or he can decide that the grounds on which invalidity may be argued will be as set out in the new Bill and will apply to all trade marks as if the Bill had always applied to them.</P>
    <P>I understand there has been some talk about constitutional property rights in this regard.  However, the Constitution does not state that one's property rights cannot be changed against one's wishes. It guarantees that property rights, in common with citizens' other rights, should be protected from unjust attack. There is a good and valid reason for changing the grounds of invalidity retrospectively and this is to have one code applying to all such cases from now on and not to have people indefinitely considering the applicability of the 1963 Act.  There are good reasons for introducing uniformity in terms of the grounds for invalidity of registration and to apply the new rules.</P>
    <P>It might be that a person will be prejudiced, but so what?  Trade mark rights are not incapable of being altered by Statute.  There is no constitutional law which states, when one has acquired a property right under the Trade Marks Act, that the right cannot be qualified, varied, reduced, affected or prejudiced if the State considers it has a good reason to do so.  There is every good reason to introduce a single law of invalidity in respect of existing and future marks.  They should all be decided by reference to the same canons of validity.</P>
    <P>The association argued this point strongly with the Minister's office and counter arguments have been addressed to it based on alleged similarities between what is contained in the Bill and what is in the Patents Act. However, there are different grounds for approaching different matters. Trade marks continue in perpetuity, provided they are renewed, while patents do not.  They are a one off property right which eventually dies.  The argument based on paragraph (12) of the Schedule to the Patents Act is not coercive.</P>
    <P>If the existing paragraph (13) was <Col N="685" /> retained, one must ask what validity means.  Is it intended to relate only to matters which would be a ground for invalidity under section 50 of the Bill, but not to matters which could provide a ground for revocation under section 49?  I strongly urge that the old Act should cease to have effect.  The intelligent thing to do is to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The question at issue is what should be the basis on which the validity of registered marks can be challenged after the commencement of the new legislation.  &ldquo;Existing registered marks&rdquo; is the expression used in the Bill to refer to those marks which are already registered on commencement and which will be deemed to be transferred to the register.  This is established by the provisions of section 64 of the Bill.  Paragraph (13) of the Third Schedule to the Bill provides that, in the case of these marks, the validity of their registration could only be challenged on the basis of the old law, the law applying immediately before commencement.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment proposes instead that a challenge to the validity of such a mark would, with one exception, be based on the grounds set out in section 50 of the Bill.  This section sets up a mechanism for having a trade mark registration declared invalid and specified the grounds on which this can be done.  I accept there are certain attractions in the proposal put forward in the amendment.  For example, on administrative grounds, it is obviously a more attractive proposition that any future challenge to the validity of a trade mark registration should be on the basis of the new legislation.  The scenario where some of the marks could be challenged under one law while others could only be challenged under a different law is not desirable.  In addition, it is my wish that, as far as possible, the 1963 Act would cease to operate on the commencement of the new Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (13) of the Third Schedule, as it stands, will have the effect of continuing certain provisions of the Act in <Col N="686" /> force for the foreseeable future.  Nonetheless, on the basis of the advice available to me from the Office of the Attorney General, the course proposed in the current text of paragraph (13) is proper.  The issue revolves around the question of the rights which are conferred on a trade mark owner when his mark is registered.  There are personal property rights and any provision which could be regarded as an attack on these rights would be open to constitutional challenge.</P>

      <P>Existing registered marks are currently afforded under certain rights and protections.  If we are now to provide that these registrations may be challenged on what may be regarded as a completely new set of grounds, and in doing so making them more vulnerable to challenge, there is a danger that we may be diminishing the rights of the owners of those marks.</P>
      <P>The amendment acknowledges the potential danger which exists.  In the proviso, it proposes to exclude section 10 (3) from the grounds on which a challenge could be mounted under section 50.  If section 10 (3) had not been excluded, section 50 would have widended considerably the scope for challenge to an existing trade mark.  As a further example of the dangers, I mention the provisions of section 21 of the 1963 Act.  Under that section, the validity of a mark registered in Part A of the register is generally incontestable after a period of seven years.  There is no corresponding provision in the Bill and so an existing Part A registration would lose the protection of section 21 if its validity could now be challenged on the grounds set out in section 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of existing registrations are in Part A of the register. Uncertainty surrounds the extent to which a provision, as proposed in the amendment, would in one way or another diminish the protection given to a mark owner by existing law and, for that reason, it leaves the provision open <Col N="687" /> to challenge.  For these reasons, I am advised the safest course to adopt is to allow the current paragraph (13) to stand.  I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons outlined.  I will examine the matter again before the Bill is taken in the Seanad as it is a complicated issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 61, after line 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16. Section 38 of this Act (claim to priority of Convention application) applies to an application for registration under the Act made or deemed to be made at or after commencement notwithstanding that the Convention application was made before commencement; provided that an application in respect of a trade mark which would not have complied with the definition of a &lsquo;trade mark&rsquo; in section 2 of the Act of 1963, shall not be accorded a date for the purposes of section 38 (2) earlier than the date of commencement.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a failure in current transitional provisions to deal with the issue of convention priority.  Under the Paris Convention, to which most countries, including Ireland, adhere, an application for registration may claim the date of a foreign application as the date from which to claim rights in Ireland, provided the Irish application is filed within six months of the first application abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, such a right should not be allowed if it results in rights arising prior <Col N="688" /> to the new law and in circumstances where those rights do not exist under the new law.  For example, under paragraph (15) of the transitional provisions, all applications in respect of service marks made before commencement are to have effect as if the date of filing were the date of the commencement of the new law.  Without the amendment, all service mark applications will not be treated equally.  A foreign applicant who had the good fortune to claim priority within six months of the commencement date will have rights earlier than applicants who had the misfortune to file in 1993, 1994 and 1995.  It also prejudices Irish industry because such a priority claim could not be possible.  The proposal is the same as what was done in the UK when service marks were introduced in 1984.  The purpose is to make provision for convention priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the argument but other factors must be taken into account in formulating our approach to this matter. In the first place, the right of a trade mark owner to claim the priority of an earlier application in another jurisdiction is an important principle in the registration of trade marks internationally. It arises from the provision of the Paris Convention and is designed to allow a trade mark owner who has applied to register his mark in one jurisdiction to prevent a competitor who may seek to pre-empt him in another jurisdiction by filing for registration of a similar mark.  I am not convinced it would be appropriate to depart from this principle in the cases to which the amendment relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I point to the Community trade mark regime, due to come into operation from 1 April 1996.  The filing of applications for Community trade marks has been permitted since 1 January 1996.  The Deputy will be aware that all applications filed before 1 April will receive a filing date of 1 April. Thus, the situation on that date with regard to the Community trade marks will be similar to that in Ireland on the <Col N="689" /> commencement of the new Act.  There will be several thousand applications, all with the same filing date.  I will take the opportunity of the Seanad debate to outline a more detailed response to the amendment which, regrettably, I cannot accept.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his co-operation and help.  However, I am disappointed he did not accept my amendments.  Section 19 is an important part of the Bill in countering the huge problem of counterfeiting.  Huge profits are being made by criminals at the expense of Irish companies which provide legitimate employment in the manufacture of clothing and other products under licence for particular brands. We should be seen to provide every protection to companies under threat from counterfeiting and we must do everything in our power to combat it.  As pointed out previously, there is no difference between this type of crime and stealing directly from a company.  It should be stamped out completely to ensure that legitimate traders, who are trying to provide jobs for Irish people, are not affected by this trade on the black market.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this huge area which is open to exploitation in the future.</P>

      <P>The recent report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development clearly identifies and addresses the long-term issues affecting the communities on our offshore islands.  The report, for the first time, establishes a coherent and comprehensive basis for Government policy in relation to the islands.  It sets out a strategic framework within which future actions in relation to the economic and social development of island communities will be considered and pursued.</P>
      <P>The report highlights the difficulties that offshore island communities face every day when going about their normal business.  Geographical isolation, particularly during the winter months, inadequate transport infrastructure and the seasonal irregularity of ferry services are all barriers to developing island economies and the competitiveness of their produce.</P>
      <P>The report identifies access transport as one of the key issues vital to the development and long-term viability of the islands.  It recognises that, in order to overcome the barriers hindering the development of island economies, a regular, reliable and safe transport service is needed to transport people and goods between island communities and the mainland.  This priority is fully supported by the islanders and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has agreed to the reorganisation of the administration of island access services which, until now, was spread over a number of Government Departments.  Expenditure on island access, currently being made by <Col N="692" /> these Departments, is being consolidated in a single financial envelope which I will co-ordinate as chairman of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee.</P>
    <P>I know, from my consultations with island communities and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, that this new approach will greatly simplify the administrative difficulties which islanders have had to face in the past.  Furthermore, the Government has agreed to an additional provision this year of £1 million to this financial envelope.</P>
    <P>In addition to the issue of access, the report recommends that each of the relevant local authorities carry out a survey of the islands within their jurisdiction to draw up a programme of priority and costed works required to ensure a minimum standard of infrastructure on each island.  In this context, the report recommends that the issue of transporting livestock, which is an important part of the agricultural economy of islands, be given full consideration.</P>
    <P>These local authority programmes will form the basis of a strategic programme of priority works which will have a significant impact on the development of island economies.  I am meeting all the local authorities involved to get this work under way.</P>
    <P>In addition to access services, the report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee makes recommendations on other major issues which impact on the economic and social development of islands.  These include areas such as education, health, agriculture, fishing and tourism development, the islands Leader II programme and local and community development initiatives.  The interdepartmental co-ordinating committee will continue to look at all issues affecting islands including the competitiveness of island produce.  I also hope islands will be included in the new extremely disadvantaged category for agricultural subsidy purposes.  This will help to offset the additional transport costs for island farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> I will co-ordinate the Government's response to the recommendations in the report.  However, individual Ministers will continue to retain responsibility for their respective areas of policy.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  As a native of the constituency this is my first opportunity of congratulating him on launching the long awaited report on the islands.  I may not be particularly complimentary in my comments but the Minister of State understands the purpose of Opposition.  Will the Minister of State give his personal view on the present position which allows for a subsidised system of transport to Gaeltacht islands and the fact that such a system is not available to ferry owners operating to and from non-Gaeltacht islands?  Does the Minister of State agree that such a subsidy should be available to all islanders, regardless of their ability to speak the native language?</P>

      <P>All of the 22 inhabited islands are now covered by the financial envelope being provided by the Government this year.  In that work they will be assisted by the local authority island committees which are made up of members of local authorities and representatives from each of the islands off the Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork coasts.  Each committee will draw up a programme of which the question of access to both Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands will form part.  When completed the promise made by the Government to recognise the difficulties experienced by islanders will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister of State's reply that the recommendations of local authorities responsible for non-Gaeltacht islands which will seek equality of treatment will receive his support when it comes to the question of subsidies.  In relation to island produce export costs are a factor. Is the Minister of State satisfied that the reduction in populations on our islands <Col N="694" /> along the western seaboard is much greater because of the difficulties associated with island life?  In order to stabilise these populations something will have to be done to reduce costs.  A survery carried out in 1994 showed that the average cost of transporting building materials to the islands is 56 per cent higher than on the mainland.  As the Minister of State will appreciate, there is two way traffic.  The average cost of transporting foodstuffs is 16 per cent higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since transport will be the major focus of attention in the work to be undertaken by island committees I expect that those islands which have not enjoyed any assistance up to now will have greater scope for importing necessary goods and exporting produce.  Aid will be provided to those groups seeking improved access links to the islands. That is the reason the programme has been devised.  There is a framework in place under which all the difficulties outlined by the Deputy can be raised. It should be possible for the difficulties experienced by the inhabitants of Clare Island and Inishturk to be examined by the Mayo island committee to see how best the transport system can be improved to reduce costs.</P>
      <P>When the revised list of severely handicapped areas is published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in conjunction with the Commission in Brussels, the full agricultural subsidies will be payable.  This should assist islanders to take advantage of opportunities to export cattle and other produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed takeover of Conoco by Statoil was notified to me on 9 November 1995 as required by the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts.  Having given careful consideration to the proposal I decided, on 22 December 1995, to refer the matter to the Competition Authority for investigation and report in accordance with section 7(b) of the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987 as amended by the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>I received the report of the Competition Authority on Friday, 9 February. The Authority concluded and unanimously recommended that the proposal should not be allowed to proceed.  In making this recommendation the Authority was of the opinion that the proposal would be likely to restrict competition and thus operate against the common good and that it would not be possible to overcome this potential threat by imposing conditions.</P>
      <P>The following are the main reasons given by the Authority for recommending prohibition: first, the proposal would be likely to reduce competition and choice in the market for motor fuels within the State and this would adversely affect consumers and thus operate against the common good.</P>
      <P>Second, the motor fuel market is already highly concentrated.  The market share of the top four firms in 1995 was around 70 per cent.  The proposal would result in a reduction in the number of significant suppliers from six to five and would increase market concentration resulting in a four firm concentration ratio of between 83 per cent and 86 per cent.</P>
      <P>Third, Conoco has a reputation of being a low price operator while Statoil is seen as a high price operator.  In the Authority's opinion the probability is that Statoil would not alter its strategy and that the strong price competition which in the past was offered by Conoco would simply disappear, lessening the competitive pressures on the remaining suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Fourth, the proposal would lead to some reduction in employment although the total is unlikely to be high, approximately 35 plus.</P>
    <P>Having given careful consideration to the unanimous recommendation of the Authority, I decided to accept its recommendation.  Accordingly, on Friday, 16 February, I made an order under section 9 of the Act which prohibits the proposal absolutely.  I met with the parties to the proposals, with their legal advisers, that morning and informed them of my decision.  The order was laid before the House of the Oireachtas on Friday, 16 February and copies of the Competition Authority's report were placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I am satisfied that the interests of the consumer and the common good are best served by prohibiting the proposed takeover.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (1) of the Act provides that where the Minister makes an order under section 9 (1) an appeal on a point of law may be made to the High Court against the order within one month of the coming into effect of the order by any enterprise referred to in the order.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I understood from his press announcement on the figures &mdash; a subsequent reading of the Competition Authority report confirmed this &mdash; that the study embraced 200 garages.  I have been informed that this list was flawed in that at least 82 of the garages surveyed were then offering petrol at a reduced price.  It was, in effect, what one would describe as an askewed study.</P>

      <P>What is now the accepted norm for the number of players in the market? Business people must know whether they are operating satisfactorily within the rules of the Competition Authority. For instance, if they control 24 per cent of the market will they be deemed to be operating in contravention of these rules?  Is there a capricious percentage?</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the need for justice for the consumer on whose side I am on, but there is also the matter of natural justice for the person who does not know who made the complaint against him.  For example, a person who makes a planning application to the county council, can study the letters on file from the person who lodged the objection.  It seems that one cannot do this in the case of the Competition Authority, its report is full of blanks.  I understand the need to delete sensitive business material, but in common justice the name of the person who makes a complaint against a company should be known.</P>

      <P>With regard to the sample, the data was provided by Conoco; it was included in details provided by one of the parties to the submission. I have no reason to believe it was a skewed sample.</P>
      <P>On the issue of delay, from the time a merger is first notified to when I will be in a position to decide whether to refer it, there will be a necessity &mdash; and there was in this case &mdash; for further submissions of material from the representatives of the proposed merging parties. This information was assembled in the period between November and December.  We would, therefore, have been in a position to take a considered view as to whether there might be a risk to competition in the proposal.  It was at this stage I decided, on balance, there was a concern that should be referred to the Competition Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked if this had created a precedent.  There is some misunderstanding in this area.  It is clear we are <Col N="698" /> dealing with a merger and it is not to be confused with, for example, the issue of dominance in a market, which is specifically dealt with in competition law and concerns the ability of one player in the market to act independently of others. This is not what is at issue in the case of a merger.  What is at issue here is the decision by two companies, one to take over the other or to merge.  The issues raised will depend on the specific conditions of the marketplace.  The Deputy will know from having read the report that the authority looks at the overall concentration in the market generally and the impact of this merger, for example, in relation to pricing, where it had a specific concern that the takeover of a company that was a low price player in the market would damage competition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of natural justice in making public various submissions, the position is that the Competition Authority draws its conclusions, not on the basis of submissions but on the basis of its assessment of a range of information submitted by any party affected.  It would go beyond the scope of this question to consider whether, in future law, changes should require the publication of every such submission. This would be unlikely to be possible because of the confidential nature of many of the issues likely to be raised. However, the overall direction of change in competition law is an issue for another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the need for confidentiality, but not with regard to who made the complaint.  In ordinary concerns, for example about planning permission, the aggrieved person writes to the local authority and the person seeking the permission has the right to see the letter or submission.  It is an open process, which is not the case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are blanks on every page of the report.  Some of these are justified, but natural justice is not served when the complainants are not referred to by name, company or whatever.  This is just <Col N="699" /> as capricious for the consumer as the decision the Minister reached in this matter.</P>
    <P>During the recent debate on the amendment to the Competition Act, 1991, I put forward an amendment, subsequently moved by my colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to the effect that the Minister would ensure that redress could be sought through an appeals system. For example, if one does not wish to pay water rates, one may appeal against the full rating of service or water charges to the county manager or county secretary.  Similarly, if one is refused a medical card one can appeal to the county medical officer.  There is a right of appeal in all matters where it is feared injustice might occur.  It appears that the Competition Authority operates in a secretive fashion with regard to disbursing information or ensuring that justice is done.</P>

      <P>The names of persons who make submission are only deleted on grounds of confidentiality.  The Deputy is aware that a number of those who made submissions were named, but in some instances confidentiality was required.  However, the ultimate report and findings of the Competition Authority are based on the impact on the consumer and the common good.  It is the authority that makes the recommendations and sets out the reasons, which are concerned entirely with the market for petrol and motor diesel.</P>
      <P>The important point made by the authority, which I have accepted, was that if the merger proceeded consumers would have to pay more for petrol and products on which they already spend £750 million.  This was the primary concern motivating this decision.  I am sure the Deputy supports me in that we could not allow petrol consumers to face the threat of rising costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 26 together.  There are essentially two parts to Deputy O'Rourke's question.  The first concerns the recruitment subsidy scheme, Jobstart, and my attention has not been drawn to any such comments.</P>
      <P>As regards the local employment service, my plans for 1996 are that the service should be consolidated in the 14 key areas.  I regard the LES as an important initiative by the Government to address unemployment, and particularly long-term unemployment in these areas.  The local nature of the service is especially significant, with all the relevant players in the area coming together to draw up their responses to local needs.  I have been impressed with the care with which the plans have been and are being drawn up.  It is important to ensure that worthwhile, effective plans, fully agreed at local levels, are in place.  This cannot be done from Kildare Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> I am concerned that the detailed rules and procedures for Jobstart, currently being developed in consultation with IBEC and ICTU, will contain effective anti-abuse provisions.  I know the social partners are similarly concerned.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be effective anti-abuse provisions in place by the time the scheme becomes operational in July of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 13 February, the chairperson of the forum warned that the long-term unemployed could only hope to get the jobs if adequate resources were given to the local employment service.  In her view, this appears not to be the case. Adequate resources have not been apportioned to the LES.  It is clear from the Minister's answer that they will operate in 14 partnership areas this year.  This is far from the forum's first recommendation that they be nationwide.</P>
      <P>Why was there a decision to wait until July to give the £80 per week subsidy to employers for taking on long-term employed people when, according to the Minister for Finance, it will operate immediately and 5,000 long-term unemployed people will come off the live register?  Will 5,000 people come off the register this year in consequence of this subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In her reference to the newspaper report, the Deputy appeared to refer to adequate funds for the LES, whereas in her parliamentary question she referred to adequate funds for a specific scheme.  This perhaps is the basis of the misunderstanding with regard to the reference.  We will ensure that the local employment service is effective and delivers quality results to the clients taken on.  For that reason, we are determined to consolidate it properly in the 14 areas.  A great deal of preplanning work has been done with local groups and we have a basis to proceed with an effective service that will provide good guidance and counselling and design pathways for the long-term <Col N="702" /> unemployed to get back into employment. I am optimistic that the scheme will be seen as a significant development and expand nationwide when its effectiveness is proven in the 14 areas outlined.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked why it will not be introduced until July.  From the outset the intention was to introduce it in July.  We have to plan details of its operation, some of which are referred to in Deputy McCreevy's question.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy on a previous occasion, we envisage that the scheme will develop on a phased basis. We are introducing an innovative scheme targeted at those who are three or more years unemployed, for whom the chances of placement are very low. We accept it will take some time to build up employers' support, that it must go through a growth phase and that we will not achieve the target of 5,000 jobs during 1996.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his honesty because in the blurb accompanying the budget it was announced that 5,000 long-term unemployed people would get jobs.  I warn consumers to read the small print on any Government announcement.</P>
      <P>The Minister said time was needed to ensure that the right people would benefit.  Some ten months ago he stated that he had £6 million for local employment services and that he would work with partnership boards and so on to develop proper schemes, counselling and guidance.  He is still seeking proper schemes, people and approaches.  What has happened since he told me he was embarking on a £6 million scheme for local employment services?  Why are projects not up and running?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Satisfactory projects are up and running.  The plans in respect of ten of the groups have been approved and are going into operation.  The other four are at an advanced stage and will prove to be effective services.  They are <Col N="703" /> introducing new concepts, such as counselling, establishing contact points in local areas and providing the long-term unemployed with access to a new service. They are also developing more effective co-ordination with local agencies, such as FÁS, which are providing support services.  The benefit of the scheme will be obvious.  It will ensure that, based on proper guidance and counselling, interventions are tailormade to the needs of the unemployed and result in effective placement of the long-term unemployed.  I am confident that what is in place will be not only effective for the long-term unemployed, but will represent excellent use of taxpayers' money.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the wide differential between the performance and relative profitability of Irish and foreign owned companies as measured by Forfás surveys.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4625/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The differences in profitability between the Irish-owned and foreign-owned manufacturing sectors is significant and average profitability of Irish-owned companies is comparatively low.</P>
      <P>The Forfás Irish economy expenditure survey collects data on the profitability of Irish-owned companies and this indicates profitability as a percentage of sales averaging about 4 per cent in recent years.  By contrast, the return on investment in US owned companies in Ireland is estimated at about 25 per cent by the US Department of Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> There should, however, be no <i>a priori</i> assumption that the performance of indigenous and foreign direct investment firms should be comparable.  Foreign direct investment firms of their nature have self selected themselves as among the top performers in their home nations &mdash; that is why they wish to engage in foreign direct investment.  We are successful in attracting many such companies to Ireland, which score highly on expected returns to the Exchequer, high levels of graduate employment and good growth prospects.</P>
    <P>The appropriate question is not are we concerned with the apparent disparity, but rather, is the performance of indigenous industry good enough, and, if not, why not?  In that context, in the aggregate the performance of indigenous industry is not as good as it should be.</P>
    <P>The principal reason for this has to be sectoral positioning.  Too many Irish firms are still operating in sectors, or more accurately segments &mdash; parts of sectors, which are involved with low technology, low value added commodity products which are subject to more and more competition in a globalised market place.  Unless these companies can reposition themselves, their future continues to look bleak.  It is also worth noting that in commodity sectors like paper, steel, clothing etc., the average profitability of the industry globally will tend to be low.  The problem for Irish firms is that they lack the scale and the low input costs required to fund investment in industries with low average profitability.</P>
    <P>Thus, many Irish firms, because of their historic positioning in low growth sectors, are disadvantaged.  The profits they earn are often insufficient to allow them to make new investments or attract additional capital for this purpose. Accordingly, they cannot upgrade their products, processes, skills and technological processes.  This means that the rate at which they introduce new products or processes is low, they tend to have low levels of technology, they <Col N="705" /> devote insufficient attention to training and development and so find it difficult to sustain competitiveness.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the picture is not all black.  A number of relatively successful Irish companies have been and continue to be established in growth sectors, for example, electronics, software and prepared consumer foods. However, most of these companies are relatively young and it is a well researched fact that young growing companies will tend to have low if not negative levels of profitability.  This is where State supports, opening up of the private equity market etc. comes in.</P>
    <P>This positive aspect should also be seen in the context of the record jobs and sales performance by Irish industry in 1995 recently announced by Forbairt. Among the key factors giving rise to this achievement, which saw new jobs created at the highest level in five years and job losses at the lowest level in ten years, was profitable sales growth.</P>
    <P>It is precisely with a view to exploiting and capitalising on this turnaround that my Department is currently working with Forbairt on the development of a new strategy for indigenous industry which will have a particular focus on the profitability of indigenous industry in the context of company development, identify sources and type of funding needed to facilitate profitable development, and emphasise the importance of research and development to product and process development with a view to raising the general performance of indigenous industry on the innovation front.  Overall, the objective will be to achieve a doubling in the rate of profitability of Irish industry from 4 per cent to 8 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The larger goals for Ireland's progress and growth will be realised only if the enterprise sector of the economy can compete successfully and profitably on local and export markets and for this to be achieved we have to replace the &ldquo;industry&rdquo; focus of policy by an emphasis on a wider &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; policy, one <Col N="706" /> that embraces all sectors of the economy.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given the full picture.  Will he accept that a 10 per cent profitability margin is considered high by international standards? Will he also accept that the profit margin of companies with subsidiaries here is also about 10 per cent? Furthermore, will he accept the reason profit is maximised through Ireland is that the CPT rate is low and that the wide disparity between Irish and foreign owned companies is purely because of transfer pricing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidence shows that the profitability of companies is higher than the 10 per cent she suggested.  Foreign companies here are making considerably more profit than that.  I do not have available to me data which would confirm the extent to which transfer pricing adds to profits.  This has always been an issue of some concern but there is no hard data from which one could conclude that we do not have very successful and high margin businesses.  The evidence is that some of the sectors attracted to Ireland enjoy high profitability wherever they locate and they have been very successful here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood what I said.  I did not say foreign companies had a 10 per cent profitability margin, I said they had a 25 per cent margin and that the group of <Col N="707" /> companies with which they are associated had a 10 per cent profitability margin. Profit is maximised through Ireland to avail of our low tax rates.  It is because of transfer pricing that there is this disparity.  Will the Minister accept that we are engaging in the economics of self-delusion if we do not understand that the gap between GNP and GDP at £5 billion per year is caused by transfer pricing by transnational companies to maximise the effect of our low tax rates?  That is why there is such a discrepancy between Irish and transnational companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is some element of transfer pricing but there is no evidence to back up the Deputy's contention.  The evidence is that these companies are enjoying very strong sales and employment growth and making significant contributions to the Irish economy through the PAYE, PRSI and VAT elements of their activities as well as through corporation tax.  The foreign sector, which employs approximately 100,000 people, is very important to the economy and it has opened up huge opportunities for linkage purchases from smaller Irish companies.  There is a very successful niche of Irish operators trading with these companies and it is misleading for the Deputy to suggest that in some way there is false development in the foreign industrial sector. This sector has built on the quality human resources available.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the investigation, announced by me in the House on 15 February last and referred to by the Deputy, are to undertake a survey of the retail prices of UK magazines in Ireland, to ascertain the movement of these prices in the period since 1 January 1994 in the light of the appreciation of the punt <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling and to determine the components of these prices by reference to such elements as cost from the producer, applicable value added taxes, importers-distributors and retailers profit margins. The survey is currently in progress and its findings shall be available to me by the end of March.  It is my intention to publish the findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two firms which control distribution apply a formula for the pricing of foreign magazines.  In the past the Competition Authority took the view that arrangements put in place by the distributors &ldquo;constituted the fixing of prices, a practice which is specifically mentioned as being prohibited under section 4(1)&rdquo;&mdash; Competition Authority Report 1993, Annex 5, page 156 refers. One distributor subsequently withdrew <Col N="709" /> the request for a Competition Authority decision.</P>

      <P>When the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs on this matter becomes available I will, as necessary, refer it to the Competition Authority.  I also wish to warn the distributors against perpetuating any anti-competitive practices which result in higher prices to the consumer and to advise that if any such practices are in place I expect them to cease forthwith and to see a benefit to consumers in terms of lower magazine prices.  If the investigation by the Director of Consumer Affairs finds that consumers are in effect being overcharged I assure the House I will take whatever steps are open to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his frank reply.  The reason I put down the question was to ascertain the terms of reference of and timeframe for the investigation.  Is the Minister concerned that the intent of the survey could be circumvented by an immediate reduction in prices?  I am glad the survey will cover the period from January 1994 but I would like to know what system will be used to ascertain the prices of magazines at that time.</P>

      <P>On the efforts of the main distributors to circumvent the survey by bringing prices more into line with the present exchange rate, I would welcome such a move.  Both sides of the House are concerned to ensure that the consumer gets a fair deal and if prices are reduced as a result of the initiation of the survey then I welcome such a move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of how one ascertains what has happened since 1 January <Col N="710" /> 1994, I presume the inspector or inspectors appointed by the Director of Consumer Affairs to carry out the survey have a well established methodology for finding out the price of magazines over the period.  It is on these written available records that they will make a judgment about whether the respective movement of the punt and sterling has been reflected in the prices charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have been as interested as I was in the immediate reaction of one of the two distributors as reported in the newspapers the following day.  I welcome the concern expressed about consumers but this brings me back to an earlier question I put to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the number of random happenings in this area over which the consumer has no control.  One cannot adopt a centralised approach but is there any way the Director of Consumer Affairs can be alerted about what is happening?  The problem has existed since January 1994 and this survey has only been initiated following certain inquiries.  Over the past 15 months many consumers have not benefited from the strength of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.  Is there any way to prevent the random happenings in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Competition in the marketplace is meant to provide the best deal for the consumer.  The difficulty in this case is that there are two operators involved in the marketplace. The view of the Competition Authority is that they should apply a formula.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the view of the Authority the arrangements between Easons and Newspread which involved agreement on purchase prices for foreign <Col N="711" /> exchange, an agreed addition for wholesaler margins and the same standard selling price to newsagents for each magazine, notwithstanding the fact that a small minority of newsagents could negotiate lower purchase prices, constituted the fixing of prices, a practice which is specifically mentioned as being prohibited under section 4(1).</P>
    <P>Unfortunately that was no more than <i>obiter dicta</i> by the Competition Authority, as its attempt to make a finding was obstructed successfully at the time. However, this formula exists and if the Director of Consumer Affairs concludes as a result of the survey that it is leading to higher prices to consumers than ought to be the case then I will take whatever action is open to me and is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in what he is trying to do.  It was clear that when Deputy Bruton made a decision in relation to Statoil, he was free to make a decision to stop something happening.  He rightly made the decision from the competition point of view.  What powers has the Minister, <Col N="712" /> Deputy Rabbitte, in a situation like this to intervene to stop something happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Once the competition legislation is through the House, enforcement procedures will be available and we will be capable of dealing with situations such as this.  Under existing pricing legislation, I have power to introduce a price display order as is the case, for example, in relation to petrol products to which the Minister, Deputy Bruton, referred.  I have power to introduce a notification order, requiring persons engaged in selling publications to notify the Minister of any increases they propose to make in the prices at which they will sell magazines.  I can require the notification to be given to the Minister within a specified time prior to the increase becoming effective.  Finally, I have power to fix the maximum price of magazines.  The legislation under which I have this power limits it to situations in which the Government is satisfied that the condition of the national economy is such that it is necessary to maintain stability of prices generally.  The power is somewhat circumscribed, but it is there, nonetheless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I am not in favour of price control; I like to think competition in the market provides adequate price control.  However, the Minister should give very serious consideration to using one or other of those powers because it is clear that a cartel is operating in relation to magazines and short of a ministerial decision to use powers, the matter will not be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the purpose of the survey was to do precisely that.  With regard to the pricing formula, which Deputy O'Rourke asked me about, both firms in this case apply a formula for pricing foreign magazines which was recommended by the National Prices Commission in 1983. That formula is the sterling cover price at the rate of exchange of purchased currency plus 5 per cent uplift, plus <Col N="713" /> VAT.  That is how the Irish selling price is calculated.</P>

      <P>The liquidation of the Irish Press newspapers, as decided by the directors, has had a serious consequence in regard to plurality and diversity in the newspaper media in that a major daily, an evening and a Sunday newspaper left the market. The readers who supported the titles have not had newspapers with a similar ethos to replace them.  A gap was left in the market which, in the interests of diversity and plurality I would like to see filled.</P>
      <P>The launch of any new paper or a relaunch of press titles is a matter to be decided on respectively by either the investors or the owners of the Irish Press titles.</P>
      <P>I supported the workers in obtaining an examinership to Irish Press newspapers and Irish Press Publications, which unfortunately failed &mdash; the prospect of a long legal wrangle over the titles put off what appeared to be a potentially viable project at that time. The closure has been devastating for the people who used to work in the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the failed examinership I had extensive discussions with all newspaper interests following the publication of the Competition Authority's report.  At all <Col N="714" /> stages, I have had the objectives of securing revitalised Irish Press titles in the market, and upholding competition law. These have been my central concerns in this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the newspapers could be relaunched to provide for diversity of views in the newspaper media. However, the sale or otherwise of the Irish Press titles is a matter for the owners of those titles and as Minister I have no function in this regard.  I have had no recent contact with either Independent Newspapers or Irish Press management on the release for sale of the Irish Press titles.  I would be happy if the newspapers were back on the streets to encourage vibrant competition and to provide for diversity and plurality.</P>
    <P>I attach considerable importance to the work of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry under the chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay.  The issues before the Commission are complex and it has received a significant number of submissions. It will take longer than at first envisaged to complete the report.  The commission is aware of the need to produce its report at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have seen the reports of increased readership of all of the newspapers, who obviously picked up the lost readership of the <i>Irish Press</i>.  I know the Minister does not wish to intervene in the matter but there is such a thing as active ministerial interest and involvement.  In a matter of such importance &mdash; the Minister himself stresses plurality and diversity &mdash; he should combine open encouragement with meetings of the relevant groups mentioned in my question to see if there is any way forward for another group of interested people to take over the titles and the <i>Irish Press</i>.  Will the Minister give active encouragement to a BES tailored to such a group of individuals who wish to come together for that purpose?</P>

That action should be taken by those who own the titles and who envisage investing in this sector. It would not be realistic to expect the Minister to take a more proactive approach to the sector.  I recognise, as the Deputy said, that the loss of the <i>Irish Press</i> has created a major gap and others have gained from that.  I hope the existence of that gap in the market is a spur to those who would consider investing in this sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A review of the operation of county enterprise boards will commence in 1996 as part of the brief of the external evaluator appointed under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99, under which the CEBs receive Structural Fund support.  This review work will be undertaken at two levels, assessing the progress achieved at the overall level of the Local Enterprise Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme, and it will be complemented by review activity undertaken by each county enterprise board.  The review will examine the success of the boards <Col N="716" /> in achieving the aggregate quantitative and qualitative targets set out in the operational programme and in the enterprise plans prepared by each board.  This review will also contribute to the mid-term review to be carried out under the Community Support Framework.</P>
      <P>In addition, the current OECD County Review of Local Development in Ireland should serve as a valuable guide to possible improvements to facilitate greater effectiveness, accountability and subsidiarity in the operation of the various local development strategies.</P>
      <P>Over £18 million was provided in grants by the 35 CEBs during 1994 and 1995 resulting in the creation of over 4,000 full-time and 1,000 part-time jobs, according to figures supplied by the boards.  The cost per job created up to the end of 1995 was £3,558.  In addition, a sum of over £1.4 million was provided to the boards in 1995 to facilitate their soft support activities.</P>
      <P>Differentials in the rate of job creation as between various boards can arise for a variety of reasons relating to the nature of the projects, the rate at which they approve these projects and the long-term viability of the projects, to name but a few.  These are the same factors that inevitably give rise to disparities in cost per job figures for different boards.</P>
      <P>While these job creation and cost per job figures are encouraging, it has to be borne in mind that the boards have only had two full years of operation.  The key issue, namely the sustainability of the jobs created, which will determine the success or failure of the county enterprise initiative will, by definition, take some time to determine.  This is the area of the boards' operations which will be most carefully assessed and monitored.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his in-depth reply.  I very much welcome the offer to review the implementation of the county enterprise plans in the <Col N="717" /> course of this year.  As a TD representing an urban constituency, and not begrudging Kerry, Laois, Mayo and even Wicklow their relative successes under the schemes, would the Minister agree that rural Ireland seems to have done far better than urban areas which have the highest concentration of disadvantage? Kerry which has fewer than 125,000 inhabitants created 140 full-time jobs in 1995 whereas Dublin city, with 0.5 million people, created only 134 jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern at the apparent inability of urban areas to use these schemes to maximum advantage? County Wicklow created 113 full-time jobs plus 81 part-time jobs while the capital city did not achieve one part-time job.  Why the anomaly?  Is it that rural Ireland is more entrepreneurial? Are the rural county enterprise boards freer in issuing funding to their schemes than those in urban areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of factors underlying the position of urban areas, in particular Dublin city.  One factor is the flat sum of approvals to each board which is the same for every area regardless of size or need.  I am actively looking at some way of introducing differentiation in the allocations that would take into account other factors such as need and size.  That might go part of the way towards meeting the Deputy's concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other factors that have to be borne in mind in looking at different counties and the extent to which they have created employment to date.  For example, some have decided to establish enterprise centres which in themselves may not be job-creating projects in the initial phase but may involve considerable expenditure.  That might fit into their strategy of creating enterprise <Col N="718" /> in their area and we would see the effects not immediately but in the longer term.  It is difficult at this early stage, after only two years of operation, to compare the impact in different areas.  Many of the counties are genuinely adding value by their approach and that is not always to be seen in simply counting the number of job approvals that have gone out across their counter.  It is very often in the other approaches they take to building networks, enterprise centres, etc. that will support employment creation in their area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and support everything the Minister has said. Perhaps he should direct the enterprise boards in the city to work in closer liaison with the voluntary sector which is trying to create some form of employment in its communities.  Often the formality of making applications to an agency where the personnel are not known to them is a disincentive. Greater bonding of the county enterprise boards with local community activists and communities struggling against unemployment and trying to create jobs could be fostered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support enterprise boards forging good strong links with the voluntary sector.  We have endeavoured, in the structure of the boards, to ensure that sort of link in that on the board there are local councillors, representatives of trade unions, representatives of employers in the area and representatives of the State agencies. There is an attempt within the board structure to ensure that it has good roots in the community.  I certainly would commend any board for working with the voluntary sector.  Some have built very successful partnerships with different voluntary groups in helping to prime the pump of activities in their county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he <Col N="719" /> intended to look at the criteria for allocating grants to the different county enterprise boards.  Has he any plans to rationalise the number of agencies in the area of job creation?  We have Forbairt, county enterprise boards, area partnership boards, Leader.  I understand in the Cork-Kerry region there are 38 different bodies one can go to for assistance or finance.  It would be helpful if the Minister would at least bring them all together in one location if he is not going to rationalise the number of agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to rationalise Forbairt with the county enterprise boards.  The county enterprise boards are essentially addressing the issue of micro-enterprise, new start-up companies.  They are explicitly mandated to try to tap into the strength of local enterprise by embracing employers, the community and the trade union movement as well as State agencies.  The idea behind it is not to have a centralised system with one agency.  It was deliberately devolved power, and in the case of Dublin power is devolved to four different areas.  Dublin city, Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown have developed their own county enterprise plans which are adding value.  They are genuinely tapping into an enterprise approach within their own areas which is valuable and supportive of the emergence of new small start-ups.  While it might not be neat to have several agencies, if they are creating added value, they are to be welcomed. If it becomes established that they are not giving value for money we will have to look at them carefully, but on the basis of the plans submitted and the achievements to date, they are generally adding a diversity to our approach to stimulating enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much for stimulating enterprise, but I agree with Deputy Harney on the complexity of agencies, an issue I have raised publicly and in regard to which the Government <Col N="720" /> of which I was a member and previous Governments were at fault.  If a young person approaches me in my clinic on a Saturday with an idea and wants to know whom to approach, I have to tell that person that he will have to go to every agency because otherwise he might miss out on the one agency that would be of help to him.  He therefore goes to Forbairt, the IDA, FÁS, the county enterprise board, the area partnership board, Údarás, if he is in an Údarás area, or to SFADCo if he is in a SFADCo area.  Time and money are wasted.  People are afraid they will miss out if they visit one agency and not another.  The Leader programme is valuable but many of these schemes were set up to draw down EU funding and as this will not be ongoing it is time to begin a programme of rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is need for closer co-operation with agencies.  In many counties there is a commitment to a one stop shop approach so that the public are aware whether to seek support from Leader, partnership companies, enterprise boards and so on.  The Department of the Taoiseach has taken initiatives in that area.  There is a strong commitment at EU level to local development projects as they are worthwhile. While the existence of bodies such as Leader, partnership companies and county enterprise boards is confusing, if they can help to develop enterprise they deserve to be given a chance.  The county enterprise system, established by Fianna Fáil, has not been long in existence.  If it transpires that it does not add value we should review its role.  We must ensure that wastage does not occur while at the same time giving such bodies scope to develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister did not link his reply to Question No. 30 which relates to county enterprise boards.  When does he anticipate that the review will be completed? Will outside consultants assist in carrying out the review?  A flat rate of grant aid is given to each county irrespective <Col N="721" /> of its size, economic activity or tradition in creating an enterprise society and is the Minister aware that in counties such as Mayo approvals were held up when county boards ran out of money?  Will the review be carried out as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>External evaluators will carry out the review this year.  It would be hard to have a final view on a full scale evaluation as this is its second year of operation.  They must prioritise their work within their financial allocation and I would regard that as a test of the efficiency with which they conduct their business.  However, there is a case for reviewing the flat rate and examining more coherent ways of deciding the amount for each board.</P>

      <P>I secured moneys in my Department's Estimate for 1996 to enable the Director of Consumer Affairs to open an office in Cork city.</P>
      <P>Fitting out the proposed premises on the South Mall is due to commence shortly and the Office of Public Works has assured me it will be completed by April.  Arrangements are now being made to procure the necessary staff.  I, therefore, expect the office to be open to the public during the coming months.</P>
      <P>The office will give the citizens of Cork greater access to the expanding work programme of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The expansion results mainly from the enactment of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which I intend to implement by 1 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Consumer Credit Act reforms and consolidates existing consumer credit law.  Up to 1995, legislation in this <Col N="722" /> area was designed to regulate particular forms of credit or, more recently, specific aspects of credit.  The main legislation is: the Moneylenders Acts, 1900 and 1933; the Hire-Purchase Acts, 1946 to 1980; the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964; the Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) Order, 1987 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. Controls on some providers of credit are also contained in other legislation, for example, Central Bank Acts, Building Societies Act, Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The 1995 Act also addresses problems in specific areas of the credit market, such as moneylending and leasing.  Furthermore, the Act will contribute towards the establishment of the EU Common Market in consumer credit.</P>
    <P>The main functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs under the Act are, <i>inter alia</i>, (a) licensing of moneylenders by end July 1996; (b) authorising all credit/mortgage intermediaries; (c) producing information material for public, money advisers and others involved in this area and (d) handling applications from banks and financial institutions for new/increased bank charges.</P>
    <P>Booklets are being prepared by the Director of Consumer Affairs for general circulation.  Other measures to inform those who will benefit from specific provisions of the Act of their rights are being considered.  Discussions have also taken place with the institutions supplying credit in order to allow for the better implementation of the Act.</P>

The Director of Consumer Affairs is compiling an awareness programme and a series of leaflets on different aspects of the services provided. I did not raise the issue of advertising with him but I am sure, as night follows day, when the office is open and staffed he will advertise the fact.

      <P>This amendment is aimed at ensuring interpreters are used where necessary rather than where possible, as is stated in the Bill.  Section 8 (1) (a) (i) provides that the interview with the person shall take place as soon as practicable.  Surely it is not practicable to interview a person in a language they do not understand. Unless a person claims to be deaf, dumb or illiterate it should not be very difficult to prove that they speak or understand some language.  They must be able to communicate through a interpreter to make their needs known. This matter was discussed earlier and I welcome the Minister's statement that interpretation or translation facilities will be provided as a matter of course and that the obligation will be on the authorities to provide such facilities, which will be of the very highest level.  I do not see the need for the words &ldquo;where possible&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy O'Donnell's remarks.  There is very little point trying to communicate with a person if they do not understand what is being said.  The words &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; are superfluous.  If an asylum seeker is informed in a language he does not understand, he may continue to be unaware of his right to apply for a declaration of refugee status.  When the asylum seeker first arrives in the State he is at his most vulnerable and most requires the services of a suitable interpreter.  He would not have the benefit or support of independent advice.  Section 16 (11) (d) states that the appeal board is entitled to use its utmost endeavours to procure the attendance of an interpreter at an <Col N="829" /> appeal hearing.  At that stage of the process applicants are likely to have received independent advice and would be less vulnerable than when they arrived in the country.  The interpretation requirement at the time of interview by an immigration officer should be no less stringent than that provided in section 16.</P>
      <P>I noted the Minister's statement on Committee Stage that every effort would be made to provide the necessary translation or interpretation facilities. That is welcome, but it does not obviate the necessity to delete the words &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; from the Bill.  It is extremely difficult to envisage a position where an applicant would refuse to co-operate and pretend not to speak any known language.  It is equally difficult to envisage that a person would be able to travel here without being able to communicate in a known language or without being accompanied by a person who could communicate in one.  On Committee Stage the Minister said that in the past five years asylum applications have been received from 52 countries, but she said application forms have been prepared in only six languages.  That appears to indicate all the applicants to date speak a known language or, alternatively, their interpretation needs are not being met.  Whichever is the case, the importance attaching to this matter would be demonstrated by the deletion of the words &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; in relation to the provision of interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue in these amendments is the provision of interpretation and translation services to asylum seekers.  Throughout the Bill the obligation imposed on the authorities is to provide such services where necessary and possible or where possible as appropriate.  As Deputy O'Donoghue recalled, I indicated on Committee Stage that I would be prepared to consider any alternative wordings Deputies might wish to put to me, but I have not received any suggested wordings in the interim.  Since Committee Stage I have <Col N="830" /> discussed the matter with the parliamentary draftswoman.  The intention is that interpretation or translation facilities will be provided as a matter of course.  The obligation on authorities to provide such facilities should be pitched in the Bill at the highest possible level.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that the corresponding wording in the 1994 Refugee Bill is &ldquo;where necessary and practicable&rdquo;, a much more restrictive form of wording.  When that Bill was discussed by a select committee last year, amendments were tabled because Deputies were unhappy with the wording &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;.  They rightly wanted to ensure that there would be no doubt that such essential facilities would be provided.  The wording of the provision sought to put a high, but not an absolute, onus on the authorities to provide interpretation facilities on the basis that it was possible a person could refuse to co-operate and pretend not to speak any known language.  I consulted the parliamentary draftswoman on the matter and asked her to ensure a form of wording that would put the highest possible onus on the authorities to provide interpretation facilities, but would allow for rare and exceptional cases where applicants refused to co-operate with them.  I was advised that the words &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; put the highest possible onus on the authorities in this respect.</P>
      <P>I hope the House recognises that some qualification is necessary to ensure against the possibility that unscrupulous applicants could abuse the system by pretending to speak obscure dialects for which no interpreter could be found.  I hope the House will accept the advice of the parliamentary draftswoman and my assurance that all possible efforts will be made to ensure that interpretation facilities are available and that the practice will be to provide interpreters as a matter of routine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputy O'Donoghue that the system works very well in Shannon, with the Irish Refugee Council and so on. We are considering exceptional circumstances of potential abuse.  The parliamentary draftswoman advised that the <Col N="831" /> appropriate wording &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; is far in advance of the wording &ldquo;where necessary and practicable&rdquo; in the 1994 Bill, which has a more restrictive connotation.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 7, after &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and that he or she is entitled to consult a solicitor and the High Commissioner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 12 are designed to meet a point raised by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage regarding notice to the person seeking asylum of the entitlement to consult a solicitor and a representative of the UNHCR.  That was the context of an amendment tabled by Deputy O'Donnell in identical terms to amendment No. 9 before us.</P>
      <P>The effect of the three Government amendments is to ensure that asylum seekers at a port or airport will be informed by the immigration officer conducting the initial on the spot interview of their rights to consultation. Similarly, notice arranging the initial interview with asylum seekers already in the State must include this information. I understand that was the critical point made by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments fulfil the undertaking I gave on Committee Stage to take account of the Deputy's amendment. As I mentioned at that time they do not implement one aspect of the Deputy's amendment which refers to a person or body within the State nominated by the High Commissioner.  As I <Col N="832" /> explained then, the term &ldquo;High Commissioner&rdquo; is defined as including the High Commissioner's representative to Ireland.  I understand from the UNHCR that it is not its practice to operate by means of a nominated agency and, accordingly, it would not be appropriate to go beyond the wording used in the Government's amendments.  On that basis I ask the Deputy to consider not moving her amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I tabled amendments to provide that an individual would be entitled to free legal aid and I am extremely disappointed that provision is not included in the Bill or in the Minister's amendments.  It is most desirable and necessary that legal aid should be provided to applicants to assist them complete declarations.  The individual concerned may speak in a foreign language and be fearful and vulnerable. In those circumstances he or she might not be able to fully grasp the intricacies of the Refugee Bill.  In those circumstances the individual should be entitled to free legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, the matter of legal aid does not arise at this point.  I might on Committee Stage familiarise the Deputy somewhat further with my references to the legal aid framework &mdash; a critical element of the provision of services for refugees.  I reported to Members that I had drawn up a scheme which had been submitted to the offices of the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General's for examination. I have requested the Chief State Solicitor to let me have his comments thereon.  He has raised a number of legal issues arising from the proposed framework.  In turn, he has been in correspondence with the Attorney General <Col N="833" /> on the matter.  Within the past week the Attorney General has directed that Counsel's opinion be sought on certain issues in relation to the framework.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious to devise a scheme which will have the confidence of asylum seekers, will provide a high quality service, value for Government money and which will meet the requirements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees who I am anxious should have a role in overseeing the operations. In this context I am also conscious of the role of the non-governmental organisations.</P>
      <P>The difficult task of teasing out the legal issues means that getting the scheme up and running has not been as fast as I would like.  However, it is more important to get matters right from the beginning than put something in place hastily which will give rise to problems later.</P>
      <P>In the absence of details I can only repeat my commitment to ensure that an effective system is put in place in time for enforcement of these provisions. I assure the House I will make detailed information on the system of legal aid known as soon as I receive the report of the Attorney General and am in a position to do so.  We have been apprised of the urgency of the matter.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 36, after &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or without the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My purpose in tabling this amendment is to address the possibility of the Minister having discretion to allow persons to work while awaiting determination of their refugee status.  Under the current wording, applicants for refugee status are not allowed to work pending the outcome of their applications.  The Irish Refugee Council recommended that applicants be allowed to work if their applications have not been determined within six months.  A prohibition on work might be reasonable if processing of such applications did not take so long, but because such procedures are quite slow people are forced into dependence on the State by way of supplementary welfare allowance.  In some instances applicants are quite happy to be so dependent but others, capable of taking up work, should be allowed do so at the discretion of the Minister, say, after a period of six months.</P>
      <P>A similar provision applies in the case of the United Kingdom where an applicant may apply for permission to work after six months.  The argument in favour of allowing applicants to work in their chosen field is that it enhances their self-respect and dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am not sure whether the Minister has such discretion, it appears from the Bill that asylum seekers are <Col N="835" /> not allowed to work until their applications have been processed and a determination made</P>
    <P>In replying, perhaps the Minister will state why it is considered preferable for asylum seekers to depend on the State and receive supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; some applicants might be doctors, teachers or others with a particular skill &mdash; rather than be allowed work, make a contribution to our economy and at the same time be helped to integrate with our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell's sentiment, that there should not be a reason not to allow the creativity, talents and, in many instances, expertise of asylum seekers to benefit our economy.  I understand that international studies have shown that asylum seekers who integrate into the workplace have a higher rate of return to their native countries, when circumstances improve there, than others.  For those reasons I support Deputy O'Donnell's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating Deputy O'Donnell's purpose in tabling this amendment, I consider it neither appropriate nor necessary.  It must be borne in mind that asylum seekers are allowed to remain in the State temporarily pending determination of their applications.  Where their applications are successful they will be allowed remain in the State and work without restriction.  That is as it should be and this Bill copperfastens that principle. However, where applications are unsuccessful, if not permitted to remain for humanitarian reasons, they will have to leave the State.  I do not consider it would be appropriate to allow people, with temporary permission only to remain in the State, to work and put down roots here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell said, one of the reasons advanced for allowing asylum seekers to work is the length of time it takes to process their applications.  I hope one of the positive aspects of this <Col N="836" /> Bill will be that processing of applications will be considerably speeded up, after which a successful applicant will have the right to work without restriction.</P>
    <P>Another concern I have about allowing asylum seekers to work is that such a facility could be abused too easily. For example, an unscrupulous employer could arrange for the transfer here of a group of workers from a low-wage country, get them to seek asylum, even though their applications could be unfounded, when they would be allowed to work without complying with the normal statutory requirements.  Such workers could be paid extremely low wages while their applications are being processed and the appeals process spun out but, once the asylum process was exhausted, they would be sent home at State expense, and that employer could recruit another group of people.  That would be most unfair to all persons entitled to work here.  It would deprive them of jobs and lead to employers losing contracts by being undercut by unscrupulous competitors.</P>
    <P>While some countries allow asylum seekers to work after a certain length of time, the reality is that, due to other constraints &mdash; for example language difficulties, labour market conditions or cultural difference &mdash; they do not find employment.  The initial period of asylum seekers' stay here is spent on acquiring language training and education so that, if and when their applications are successful, they can remain. I have observed that it has taken most programme refugees some time to adapt before entering the labour market.  If the procedures in the Bill provide for the speedy processing of applications, the problem raised by Deputy O'Donnell should be largely a thing of the past. Undue delay is at the heart of the difficulty with the present procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily accept the Minister's hypothesis that the provision could be abused by unscrupulous employers who would coax people to seek bogus refugee status to avail of <Col N="837" /> cheap labour.  I do not think this is a realistic threat.  The Minister accepts my point that long delays in processing applications lead to very lengthy periods during which the person is deprived of the right to contribute to the economy or participate in work.  Will she indicate whether delays of six months to one year will arise when the new procedures are in place?  I am aware there is a backlog but is the Minister convinced that asylum seekers will not have to put up with long delays resulting in their unnecessary dependence on the State? What timeframe does she envisage for processing applications when the new procedures are in place and the backlog has been eliminated?</P>

It seems reasonable to allow people who are willing and able to work to do so after six months if the State has not managed to get its act together and process their applications.  If people are talented and have a willingness and ability to contribute to the economy they should be allowed to do so until such time as the final determination of their status has been made.</P>

This is quite unreasonable.  It appears that this provision would allow the detention of such persons for no other reason than that they had intended to enter another <Col N="838" /> State without lawful authority.  I do not understand why such people should be singled out for detention by this State. Surely it is a matter for the other State, or the State to which the asylum seeker intends to go to deal with the application on its merits.  I cannot understand why this State should interfere with the individual in question.  I understand that people fleeing from certain countries who arrived in Ireland were refused permission by US immigration at Shannon to continue their journey to the United States.

      <P>This amendment would remove from the grounds for detention of an asylum seeker a reference to a suspected intention to leave the State and enter another State without lawful authority.</P>
      <P>The purpose of having this provision in the Bill is to safeguard the integrity of the common travel area arrangements that exist between this country and the United Kingdom and has nothing to do with travel or entry to the United States.  These arrangements enable people to pass through the two jurisdictions without being subject to systematic passport controls or other immigration checks at the ports or borders. This is of enormous significance in the context of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>This common travel area is of vital importance to the smooth operation of trade on all parts of this island and between the two islands.  It is an important feature of tourism and other social interchanges on this island.  The importance of safeguarding this arrangement as a matter of public policy has indeed been recognised by the High Court and I cannot overemphasise how essential it is for us to remain committed to its preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important element in these arrangements is that each country operates controls on people coming from outside either State, to ensure that not only do they meet the requirements of domestic immigration law but the other <Col N="839" /> State's requirements.  Thus, immigration officers at Heathrow, for instance, will ensure that a person landing there from outside these islands who wishes to continue to Ireland can do so legally. Similarly, our legislation contains provisions to deal with potential illegal immigrants to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Without the provision which amendment No. 16 proposes to delete, it would be a simple matter for unscrupulous people to use this country as a back door for easy illegal access to the United Kingdom by telling the immigration officer here that they are seeking asylum and travelling on the next boat to Holyhead.  Such a loophole would make a nonsense of the common travel area arrangements and it can be assumed that our partners in these arrangements would not be slow to pull out.  Whereas the majority of asylum seekers are genuine, illegal immigration is a growing business and there is evidence that organised crime is taking a more active part in it.  The information networks are such that news of a loophole would not be long in gaining wide circulation.  There are major difficulties in some countries with this matter.  I recommend that the House does not support amendment No. 16.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister is correct that the primary intention of the provision is to ensure that people do not enter the United Kingdom by the back door.  It is of paramount importance that travel arrangements between the United Kingdom and this country are maintained. However, the Minister cannot be correct in saying that it has nothing to do with the United States of America. This is a catchall provision which affects every single asylum seeker coming into the country, whether that person is considering going to the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Mexico, Brazil or wherever.  Let us take the case of an individual coming to the country who has an invalid visa for the United States.  The individual is then refused <Col N="840" /> permission by the US immigration authorities at Shannon to travel on to the US and then goes on to apply to the Irish Government for refugee status.  Under the provisions of the Bill, even though he may be a genuine applicant for asylum he can be detained.  The provision as drafted is not achieving just its sole stated purpose as set out by the Minister but is achieving much more and some of the excesses to which it goes are undesirable.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(e)  has destroyed his or her identity or travel documents or is in possession of forged identity documents, and such destruction or possession was not, in the applicant's particular circumstances, reasonable,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 (8) deals with the power of an immigration officer or garda to entertain a person who arrives at the frontier of the State seeking asylum or protection. Paragraph (e) permits detention of a person travelling without identity or travel documents or a person travelling with forged documents.  Under the current wording the immigration officer or garda in deciding whether to detain the person has to consider whether the destruction of travel or identity documents was done with &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; and if there was reasonable cause, in other words, that such destruction was necessary for the applicant to escape, then the immigration officer cannot detain him.  However, the &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; proviso does not <Col N="841" /> seem to apply to forged identity documents. In other words, the possession of forged identity documents would justify detention regardless of the circumstances in which the applicant claimed to be in possession of them.  My amendment seeks to extend the &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; proviso to the possession of forged identity documents.</P>

      <P>This point was well debated on Committee Stage but it is worth repeating.  There is no need to add to what Deputy O'Donnell has had to say other than that there is well documented evidence in cases throughout the world that many people who flee persecution will be in possession of forged identity documents as they are unlikely to approach the authorities in the State from which they are fleeing, for obvious reasons.  It is true that people may be afraid to go to the capital city or wherever a visa can be obtained for this country or whatever is their ultimate destination.  They may well resort to forging documents.  A genuine applicant may destroy identity or travel documents on the advice of a well meaning third party who might be unfamiliar with the requirements of Irish law.  I recommend the deletion of this provision.</P>

      <P>My amendment meets a point arising out of the terms of Deputy O'Donnell's amendment No. 17 when it was discussed on Committee Stage.  I undertook then to come back with an amendment to deal with the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present wording of the Bill is such that the qualification &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo; in paragraph (e) of section 9 (8) applies only to the destruction of identity papers but not to the possession of forged documents.  There is clearly no distinction that can sensibly be drawn between the two.  It would not make sense, for instance, that if a family of asylum seekers presented themselves at a port having had to engage in subterfuge regarding their documents in order to leave their home country, some members would be liable to detention <Col N="842" /> because they had forged documents whereas others would not be liable to detention because they had destroyed theirs.  The amendment corrects that by ensuring that the reasonability test applies both to possession of forged documents and to destruction of documents.</P>
    <P>The formula of words used in Deputy O'Donnell's amendment relating to the applicant's particular circumstances is one which I have discussed with the draftswoman.  She assures me that the expression &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; used in the Bill encompasses the element of subjectivity and particularity to the individual circumstances which the Deputy seeks.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment No. 18 would delete the paragraph completely. I could not accept this as being a correct course of action, as the question of identity is one which is crucial to immigration generally and to asylum applicants in particular.  I am keenly aware &mdash; we had a long discussion on this matter on Committee Stage &mdash; that there are many instances where the applicant for asylum must of necessity for their protection resort to subterfuge in order to evade persecution and make a way to the country of intended asylum. That is accepted and understood. Our immigration officers are also aware of this.  The intention is not to penalise someone for having had to do this. Where no reasonable cause is apparent for the destruction of ID papers or for having forged papers, the immigration officer must, in the interests of the protection of our society, have the power to detain the person until satisfactory evidence of identity becomes available and the officer can be satisfied that the person in question is not a security risk or otherwise a treat to the public.  That is a reasonable balance between understanding the circumstances in which a person either uses forged documents or destroys documents in an attempt to escape persecution.  We have to consider the proper balance for the protection of society.  I believe the section now does that.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 26, after &ldquo;paragraph (c),&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and if satisfied that one or more of the paragraphs of subsection (8) applies in relation to the person,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government amendments Nos. 21, 23, 26, 28 and 30 are all of a piece.  Their aim is twofold.  First, they make clear that the role of the court is not simply to rubberstamp the action taken by the immigration officer.  The phrase &ldquo;if satisfied...&rdquo; in amendments Nos. 21 and 30, and &ldquo;if he or she considers it appropriate to do so...&rdquo; in amendment No. 26, spell out the fact that the court has an active role in ensuring that a detention, a release subject to conditions or a variation of those conditions is the proper course in the circumstances. While I am satisfied that this is what was intended and would be <Col N="844" /> implicit in the existing wording, I have consulted with the draftswoman, who advises that the amendments now proposed meet the aim expressed by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage of greater clarity on the point.</P>
    <P>Second, the amendments meet another point raised by Deputy O'Donnell on Committee Stage, and again in amendments Nos. 27 and 29 in her name today.  That point is the specific provision of a right for the pension in question, as well as for the immigration officer or garda, to apply for a variation or removal of a condition on which the person has been released from detention. I have been happy to meet that point and on that basis I would ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing her amendments in favour of those prepared by the draftswoman.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that point, I wish to advert to another effect of the amendments now drafted.  The Bill as it stands confines to the original immigration officer or garda the function of taking any subsequent steps in relation to a detention.  In extending to the person concerned the right to apply for a variation of conditions of release it occurred to us that limiting this to the original immigration officer or garda would lead to complications if that officer was transferred to other duties, or was indisposed or otherwise unavailable or off duty.  Accordingly, Government amendments Nos. 23 and 26 generalise this to &ldquo;an immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 28, to delete &ldquo;10&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;8&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to substitute the period of detention of ten days with a period of eight days.  As I said on Committee Stage, the period provided for in the Bill is longer than that allowed in criminal law legislation for the detention of prisoners remanded in custody and in child care legislation for the removal of children from the custody of their parents without a full hearing.  Natural justice demands that the law is consistent regarding the period of detention.  The detention of an asylum seeker should not be any longer than that of an alleged criminal.</P>
      <P>In a related provision, a person should not be detained without reasonable cause for longer than two periods. Subsection (14) appears to allow for repeated detention of an asylum seeker for further periods of up to ten days each pending the determination of the person's application for refugee status. No limit whatsoever is prescribed for the number of periods of detention.  The grounds for detention must be taken into account.  Under subsection (8) these grounds include that the individual concerned fails to make reasonable efforts to establish his true identity; intends to leave the State and enter another state without lawful authority; destruction without reasonable cause of identity or travel documents; and possession of forged identity documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A genuine asylum seeker could be detained without reasonable cause for the entire period until the application is determined.  This is of particular concern for obvious reasons.  In a country which values civil liberties, we should indicate in the Bill and in every other possible way how much we value the freedom of the individual.  There is a real danger that a genuine asylum seeker could be detained for a considerable period, perhaps up to a decision on the application which may go all the way to an appeal.  Having considered it <Col N="846" /> again since Committee Stage, this measure should be re-examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to my earlier comments about the balance between the asylum seeker's rights and the legitimate need to protect Irish society in terms of an unscrupulous application or where there is a danger or risk to the public, the essential phrase in this matter is &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 31 seek to reduce from ten to eight days the maximum period for which a court may at any one time commit a person to be detained.  I wish to make it clear that detention of asylum seekers is likely to occur very rarely.  I am sure Deputy O'Donoghue will be relieved to note this point, given the pressure on prison places of which he is so aware. However, the provision is necessary so that detention can be resorted to in certain limited circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that, in the 1994 Bill, the detention period provided for was 21 days.  Some misgivings were expressed about the length of this period and accordingly the 1995 Bill provides for a detention period of ten days. This period of time is the minimum required to allow the authorities, who must in the first place have reasonable cause to detain the person, check out details such as identity, criminal record, etc.  Such inquiries take time because it may be necessary to check information through international channels.  A reasonable period must be provided to allow for the time required for such inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such circumstances ten days is a maximum practicable time limit.  Section 9 (10) (c) imposes an absolute obligation on the immigration officer or garda to bring the person before the court to arrange his or her release at any stage, which could be before the expiry of the ten day period if the circumstances warranting detention no longer exist.  The detention provided for by the section is not the same concept as detention of persons on criminal charges in <Col N="847" /> that subsection (14) (b) provides a procedure to ensure that the person is free to leave at any stage if he or she wishes to leave the State.  Accordingly, I am not disposed to accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 seeks to ensure that the courts do not impose an indefinite period of detention, which is the point raised by the Deputy.  This is not, in principle, at odds with my intention or that of the section just amended which provides for the supervision of detention by the courts.  In exercising their functions under this or any Act, the courts must have regard as appropriate to the Constitution and to established principles of law, such as the principles of natural justice.  Accordingly, they will not tolerate the deprivation of the liberty of any individual for longer than is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, implicit in assigning the supervision of detention to the courts that they will only agree to the continued detention of a person where there is reasonable cause in accordance with the provisions of subsections (8) or (13).  However, I have taken on board Deputy O'Donoghue's concern that the Bill should make this clear.  Amendment No. 30 puts beyond doubt that a District Court judge can only continue to permit detention if he or she is satisfied that the conditions warranting the detention continue to exist.  In the circumstances I hope Deputy O'Donoghue will withdraw his amendment.</P>

However, the tone of part of the Minister's reply was, if unintentionally, almost Cromwellian &mdash; it was a case of &ldquo;to Hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  The Minister said individuals who are detained could decide to leave the State.  The person could choose to leave the place of detention and the State but in all probability they would go back to the place from where he or she fled for fear of <Col N="848" /> persecution.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to Deputies on Committee Stage, the UNHCR has raised certain issues with me regarding section 9 <Col N="850" /> (15).  This provision deals with circumstances in which persons can be excluded from the State and from the opportunity to make an asylum claim. While the provisions as drafted were based on provisions of the UN convention, I have re-examined our wording and I am proposing some amendments.</P>
    <P>The concerns expressed by the UNHCR in the main related to the fact that subsection (15) (b) (i) and (ii) were an application of the exclusion clauses of the convention.  It pointed out that the recommended and generally accepted practice was that these clauses should not be used to exclude persons in the first instance from the asylum process but rather that the person should be admitted to the examination process which would allow their case for refugee status to be weighed against any case for exclusion on the basis of the exclusion clauses.  Because I am anxious that the Bill should honour the spirit as well as the letter of the UN convention relating to the status of refugees, I have agreed to amend this provision in accordance with UNHCR wishes. Accordingly, I am proposing to delete subsection (15) (b) (i) and (ii).</P>
    <P>Subsections (1) and (2) of section 9 effectively give every non-national who claims asylum the right to enter and remain in Ireland until his or her application has been finally determined.  As a safeguard to such an open provision, subsection (15), as drafted, provides for those exceptional cases where it has proved necessary in the public interest to refuse entry to a specific person or to remove from the State a specific person without delay.</P>
    <P>If, for example, an ex-dictator or drug baron from South America or a notorious war criminal from Bosnia were to avail themselves of the right to seek refuge in Ireland, it could be seriously damaging for Ireland's image abroad. Therefore, in exceptional circumstances, the Minister can prevent the entry of a named person.  While I believe that the presence of such an individual in the country would not be in the public interest, I have been persuaded that I <Col N="851" /> should amend this provision.  I no longer propose that where such an individual is already in the State he or she should be deported without admission to the asylum process.  The most likely scenario is that such a person could be dealt with under the manifestly unfounded procedure. However, the State retains the sovereign power to exclude persons whose admittance represents a national security threat or whose admittance is contrary to the interest of the State.  As regards such an individual who is outside the State, I do not propose to amend the provisions as already drafted.</P>
    <P>I should point out that subsection (15) does not provide for the exclusion of a person.  Its only effect is to make it clear that a person who is the subject of an exclusion or prohibition order made under section 5 (1) of the Aliens Act, 1935 cannot rely on the provisions of this Bill to circumvent the effect of such orders.</P>
    <P>The following points regarding the revised paragraphs (a) and (b) should be noted.  The order has to be made by the Minister in respect of a specific person. Orders made under section 5 (1) (a) of the Aliens Act, 1935 (Prohibition Orders) are Statutory Instruments and have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by a resolution passed by either House within 21 sitting days.  Thus the making of the order will be public knowledge and will be subject to Dáil and Seanad supervision.</P>
    <P>Orders prohibiting a person from landing in or entering the State are only made in exceptional circumstances.  As I pointed out to Deputies on Committee Stage, only two were made in the period from 1975 to date.  One was in respect of a convicted Nazi war criminal &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 77 of 1985 &mdash; and the other in respect of a former colonel of the South African police whose unit was implicated in violence aimed at the destabilisation of South Africa.  The order must state that the <Col N="852" /> Minister considers the exclusion necessary in the interests of national security or public policy.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR recommendations and practice would suggest that before refusing such consent the Minister would have to balance the strength of the applicant's claim against the significance of the threat presented for the reasons specified in subsection (15) (b). In any event the Minister's exercise of power in this respect would be reviewable by the courts and, in exercising this power, she would be obliged to do so judicially and in accordance with the principle of proportionality.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is that where the Minister has, after consideration of all the facts available, made an order prohibiting an individual outside the State from entering the State for reasons of national security or public policy, that person will not be able to use the asylum process to enter the State.  Persons already in the State who might for such reasons otherwise be deported will be able to avail of the asylum process.  Of course, depending on the outcome of their claim, this could still result in the making of a deportation order against them.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 to subsection (16) is a consequential amendment to amendments Nos. 33 to 36.  I ask Deputies to support my amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 49, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is that subsection (4) enables the commissioner to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs or other persons to make certain inquiries and to furnish him or her with information but does not oblige the Commissioner to make such a request.  While I am sure the commissioner will have every good intent, the loophole that exists should be closed whereby a genuine applicant could be refused by a Commissioner who was not obliged and did not make sufficient inquiries or seek sufficient information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of subsection (4) enable the commissioner to request the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Foreign Affairs or some other person to make inquiries or furnish information.  That implies assistance or information cannot be unreasonably withheld.  In this, as in all <Col N="854" /> such activity, Ministers are subject to the supervision of the courts.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by the Deputy would oblige the commissioner to ask the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or some other person to make inquiries or furnish information.  Apart from the technical impossibility of obliging the commissioner to make a request to an unspecified person, the proposal would impose an unnecessary burden on the commissioner to make inquiries which may not be necessary and serve no useful purpose.</P>
      <P>There has been widespread approval of the independent role this Bill gives to the commissioner.  One of the reasons for such approval was that it was considered better to have applications for asylum examined by a body independent of Government Departments which have functions in relation to immigration controls and foreign relations etc.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UNHCR may have sources of information which could be useful to the commissioner. Subsection (4) seeks to ensure that the commissioner can call for assistance from these sources.  However, to oblige the commissioner to do so is to imply that the commissioner cannot assess when such assistance is required or might willfully ignore potential sources of information.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment would also give the two Departments concerned a mandatory role in asylum applications, which would fly in the face of the concept of an independent commissioner, one of the central thrusts of the Bill.  In the light of what I have said the Deputy might reconsider his amendment as I am convinced the result would not be what he would wish.  I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 24 to 49 and in page 15, to delete lines 1 to 17.</P>
      <P>It is clear to everybody at this stage that the inclusion of the concept of manifestly unfounded applications is aimed at eliminating fraudulent claims.  Everybody will agree that such claims should not be countenanced.  The section goes on to define what precisely the words &ldquo;a manifestly unfounded application&rdquo; mean.  However, the words speak for themselves and do not require a definition beyond what has already been developed through international case law and UNHCR recommendations.</P>
      <P>To the best of my recollection, the Minister defended this procedure on Committee Stage by stating there will be a right of appeal.  He should be the last person to justify what is a bad procedure by stating there is a right of appeal.  If the purpose is to remove manifestly unfounded applications from the system as quickly as possible, this would only be hampered, as anyone who is familiar with legal procedure will be aware, by an inappropriate definition of that term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me and others who are experts in this field that a huge number of genuine applications could be <Col N="856" /> deemed manifestly unfounded under the definition proposed and this is likely to result in an enormous number of appeals which would clog up the system thereby defeating the stated intention to have a fast track procedure.  If we follow the United Kingdom example and abolish the right of appellants to any State assistance while awaiting the outcome of an appeal, it is not difficult to envisage the hardship likely to result.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that a reason for including subsection (4) (c) which provides that &ldquo;a manifestly unfounded application&rdquo; means an application in relation to which the commissioner is satisfied that the applicant's reason for leaving or not returning to his or her country of nationality does not relate to a fear of persecution, is that an investigation might show that someone has only made an application to gain access to another country.  People find it difficult to understand what is meant by this. It is clear to everybody at this stage that an applicant will forfeit asylum if he or she leaves the State.  A refugee who has received a declaration here is unlikely to have an application for asylum accepted in a third state while he or she has refugee status here.  In addition, it is clear to everybody that an applicant without a visa will not gain access to a third state for which he or she requires a visa.  In what circumstances would someone make an application in this State with the purpose of gaining access to another state?  It is clear that somebody who has reason for leaving and not returning to his or her country of nationality which does not relate to a fear of persecution is not a convention refugee and his or her claim is manifestly unfounded without the inclusion of paragraph (c).</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) contains a further definition of &ldquo;a manifestly unfounded application&rdquo;.  It states that it means an application in relation to which the applicant did not reveal, following the making of an application under section 8, that he or she was travelling under a false identity or was in possession of false or forged identity documents and <Col N="857" /> did not have reasonable cause for not so revealing.  An individual may not, however, have obtained legal advice, although the Minister is now well on the way to providing for this.  That is most welcome.  In addition, interpretation facilities to which I referred earlier are to be improved.  If these were not available it would exacerbate what is already a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>In short, I cannot see the reason a definition of &ldquo;a manifestly unfounded application&rdquo; has to be included.  A manifestly unfounded application means, as stated in paragraph (a), an application which does not show any grounds for the contention that the applicant is a refugee.  There appears to be no reason to list several different occasions when an application is manifestly unfounded.  No interpretation in Statute law of the words &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; could be entirely exhaustive. One could go so far as to say that there are few words in the English language with regard to which one could give a fully descriptive and exhaustive interpretation.</P>
    <P>Montesquieu once said that one should never give reasons for laws in laws.  This subsection appears to go dangerously close to breaching his dictum. As a great admirer of Montesquieu, I urge that the various interpretations be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Montesquieu is not here the Deputy must make do with my comment, which I am sure would not be at the same level.  The words &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; are essentially broad, loose and sweeping if left with no explanation. We spoke at length on Committee Stage about the sense of fear, fear of the unknown and the fleeing from persecution in which genuine applicants find themselves.  It is helpful to them and their legal advisers to be able to indicate to them what the words &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; constitute rather than leave it as a sweeping, unspecified power, where an unknown state to which they have fled may decide their context and meaning, without any <Col N="858" /> ground rules laid down or explanation offered, despite what Montesquieu said. To spell out in detail what is meant by the words will, I hope, be helpful to applicants, their lawyers and advisers.</P>
      <P>During our discussion on this section I undertook to discuss the proposed amendments with a parliamentary draftswoman.  She has advised me she is satisfied that the subsections, as currently worded, cater for the concerns of Deputy O'Donnell and I do not propose to make any changes in this regard.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy O'Donoghue's concerns regarding subsection (4) (c), the parliamentary draftswoman is of the opinion that the Deputy's suggestion on Committee Stage that the commissioner be reasonably satisfied would not impose such a strong onus on him as the requirement that he be satisfied, and would weaken the burden on the commissioners.  Accordingly, I do not propose to change this provision.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I referred to the definition of &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo;, abuse of applications and the comments by both UNHCR and the Executive Committee.  I will not revisit this but I hope the Deputies accept the point I made in that, in spelling out the conditions of the words &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo;, the intention is to offer clear indications to applicants for the basis for the words.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that, where there is a manifestly unfounded application, the applicant will be able to avail of the full rigours of the appeal system.  We are dealing with both genuine applicants and applicants who are not genuine.  We must strike a balance between being fair to the genuine applicants while at the same time offering some protection to ourselves.  I suggest we have struck the balance in the appropriate way.</P>

      <P>Deputies on Committee Stage will recall that the question of the Minister's consent to publicity for an asylum seeker was discussed at considerable length.  I then indicated my willingness to consider the matter in the light of the discussion and to come back on Report Stage with whatever amendments I considered necessary in the light of that consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 60 in the names of Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue would remove entirely from the Minister the power of consent.  I find this unacceptable and could not agree to a situation where an asyum applicant was without protection of any kind from the kind of pressures I described on Committee Stage.  These would be pressures from people who might be more interested in running a good story than in the effect that the story might have on the applicant or on his or her connections or family.  Such pressures may <Col N="861" /> arise for naked commercial reasons, or selling in the case of tabloid newspaper, or for political reasons bound up with the causes of the applicant's original flight from the home country.</P>
    <P>In addition, I could not agree to a situation where an applicant would be free to draw up publicity to his or her case by, for example, protesting outside the embassy of the home country in an attempt to bolster a weak case for refugee status or for humanitarian leave to remain here.  I am aware from the debate on Committee Stage that the principle of a second line of defence for an asylum seeker under pressure to forgo privacy was fairly widely accepted. Some alternatives to the Minister's consent were canvassed.  In particular, some Members suggested that it might be a matter for the Refugee Appeals Board being set up under the Bill.  I have given that suggestion serious consideration, but I am satisfied that because of the structure of the appeals board it would be inappropriate to assign this additional matter to it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the consent of the Minister, which may be reviewed by means of a judicial review, is the most suitable protection for the asylum seeker.  In amendment No. 59, I propose to put beyond doubt that the Minister's consent cannot be unreasonably withheld. That is as far as I can go in meeting the points raised on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook to re-examine this subsection in the light of the views expressed by the Deputies on Committee Stage.  Subsection (3) makes it an offence for a person to destroy or conceal identity documents of an applicant with intent to deceive.  These subsections are not intended to cover circumstances where a person has no choice but to mislead, destroy or conceal identity documents to escape persecution. The offence must be committed in the State, and very importantly, the applicant must have the necessary intent to deceive.  Emigration officers and departmental staff understand that it may be necessary for people to use false documentation in order to escape. That is not in question.  We are concerned that such deception could continue and that the applicant would not give his or her true story.  While it may have been necessary for them to use <Col N="863" /> false documentation to escape from their country of origin, if their applications are to be successful applicants must give us their true identity.  We are talking about intent to deceive.</P>
      <P>The commissioner cannot fulfil his or her role if deception is condoned.  I sympathise with the spirit of the amendments. Deputies are concerned about people who may act out of the best motives and not out of malice but could commit an offence.  Having considered the matter carefully I cannot accept the amendments because they will give too wide an immunity to deception.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 deals with the revocation of a declaration.  Many of the grounds on which a declaration can be revoked require some act by the person to whom the declaration is given to justify the revocation of the declaration.  However, subsection (1) (e) and (f) of subsection (1)  permit the revocation of a declaration if circumstances under which the person is recognised as a refugee cease to exist, in other words, if the regime <Col N="864" /> from which the person fled no longer exists.  The Refugee Council stated that a material change of circumstances may make it difficult to uproot a person who has settled here with refugee status. Such material change of circumstances could include an intended marriage to an Irish citizen, the birth of a child, the passage of a substantial period of time, the development of a career, trade or practice or ill health.  On a more general note, it would be unfair to withdraw the rights conferred in circumstances where a refugee has not done anything wrong. My amendment proposes that a material change of circumstances should be included in this section.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that there is need for an express provision to the effect that nothing in the Bill or the Dublin Convention would authorise the transfer of an applicant for asylum to a Dublin Convention country from which there is reasonable cause to believe he might be returned, whether directly or indirectly, to the country from which he fled persecution and that prior to any such transfer the Minister should be required to make sufficient inquiries and obtain sufficient assurances from any Dublin Convention country to which it is proposed to return an asylum seeker so that there is no breach of such provision.  My amendments Nos. 67 and 68 achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister suggested that these amendments could be interpreted as suggesting that Ireland could not trust its fellow EU member states to fulfil their obligations under the UN Convention.  While I reject any such suggestion, it is important to point out to the Minister that many of these countries entered into agreements with other third countries on the question of asylum seekers and the granting of refugee status without any consultation with this country.  They were entitled to do that; these sovereign governments were acting on behalf of their sovereign people.  In the same way, this State is perfectly free to implement legislation for its sovereign people which would <Col N="866" /> prevent the very real danger of people being returned to the country from which they had originally fled persecution.</P>
    <P>As a result of agreements entered into by other countries some applicants for refugee status have been sent from country to country, with each country disclaiming responsibility for dealing with the applications on the grounds of these agreements.  Ultimately the individual ends up in the state from which he or she originally fled.  Apparently the European consultation on refugees and exiles has documented individual cases where this has happened.  It is extremely important to point out that this has happened in the case of states which are a party to the Dublin Convention.  When I say it is possible for an individual who seeks asylum in Ireland to be sent back to the country from which he fled I am not speaking in any fanciful way.  This happened, is happening and will happen under the legislation if the loophole is not closed off.  In seeking to fulfil our obligations under the Dublin Convention we should not, unwittingly or otherwise, send an individual back to the country from which he or she fled persecution. I do not accept the argument put forward by the Minister on Committee Stage that this would display a lack of trust in, or co-operation with, our EU partners or cast aspersions on their bona fide commitment to uphold the UN Convention.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Dublin Convention into domestic legislation without the provision of separate safeguards will undoubtedly mean an applicant for asylum will be returned to another European Union state and, ultimately, to the state from which he or she fled persecution.  Earlier we discussed the freedom of travel between the United Kingdom and this country and it is this freedom which will increase the risk to which I have referred.  For example, countries have a so-called list of white countries and the United Kingdom proposes to include Nigeria and Sri Lanka on its list.  To give a practical example, <Col N="867" /> a Nigerian national who flees persecution in that country for one reason or another &mdash; I am not casting aspersions on any country &mdash; and seeks asylum in the United Kingdom could have his application refused on the grounds that Nigeria is on that country's white list.  He will then travel to Ireland where he will seek asylum but under the Dublin Convention he could be returned to the United Kingdom where his application for asylum is dead.  As a result of the United Kingdom's policy towards Nigeria, he could end up back in the country from which he fled persecution.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister or any other Member seriously believes that this loophole should not be closed off now.  I was given no reason on Committee Stage to believe other than what I am saying.  In seeking to meet our obligations under the Dublin Convention, ironically and extraordinarily enough the most important provisions of the legislation could be circumvented because the loophole is not closed off. This view is buttressed by the argument and enforced by the fact that separate legislation inserting additional safeguards on the ratification by this State of the Dublin Convention will not be brought before the House.  In those circumstances my humble opinion is that the opportunity for change is now and that this opportunity may not arise again.  My amendments, or any variation thereof which would meet the same objective, should be accepted by the Minister.  If the amendments are not accepted then the possibility or probability exists of a person being returned unwittingly by this State to the country from which he fled.  This extremely important matter requires attention and considerable thought.  In the absence of a convincing argument to the contrary by the Minister, my amendments should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long debate on this issue on Committee Stage during <Col N="868" /> which many Members expressed concern about the Dublin Convention and section 22.  These concerns mainly related to the lack of opportunity to debate matters in the House.  My fears in this regard were assuaged by the Minister's statement that the Dáil would have an input by way of a motion which would be brought before it.  However there still remains the difficulty about procedures surrounding the return to a convention country and safeguards to ensure the applicant's entry to proper refugee status in a country which is safe in his or her particular case.  This has been referred to as a suspensive appeal against a determination to return an applicant under the Dublin Convention. If returned to another state the application would be examined substantively and the applicant not refused a return to a third state on procedural grounds.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Donoghue said, those who work at the coalface with refugees are still concerned.  Although I am glad to know that there will be some accountability in terms of the Dáil reviewing such matters before the Dublin Convention is signed into law, I remain wholly unconvinced about these two outstanding matters.  There is a danger that persons might be sent back to a country which would not be safe for them.  I support Deputy O'Donoghue's expressed concerns in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reiterate three points which I made on the earlier Stages of the Bill.  When the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, was party to the Dublin Convention on behalf of the Republic, it was in the context of stopping the phenomenon of refugees in orbit to which Deputy O'Donoghue referred.  People could go from one country to another without any country dealing properly with their application and would therefore find themselves back in the country from which they had fled.  The Dublin Convention was entered into precisely to put a stop to that phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell says, for the Dublin Convention to be fully ratified a <Col N="869" /> motion must be put before the House. This will give an opportunity for a full debate on the convention.  We are not required to repatriate people under the Dublin Convention.  We have the opportunity to do so if we so choose.  It is not a requirement, it is an option.  Clearly in such cases one would examine the likely outcome of repatriation.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some general points about the concern that member states may send an applicant for asylum to a third state.  Intergovernmental co-operation in asylum matters between the member states of the European Union began in the mid-1980s.  It was not based on any treaties and was outside the scope of the institutions and common policy of the European Communities. However, during that period, the political and social importance of the right to asylum increased steadily in the Community and in the member states in general. One of the first results of co-operation was the Dublin Convention.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the convention is broadly to lay down criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application.  It is important to understand that the Dublin Convention is essentially a set of procedural or technical rules as opposed to being a development in the area of asylum philosophy or thinking.  It has a limited objective and is not intended, for example, to expand on the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>In regard to co-operating with other member states concerning asylum, the starting point for each member state is the fundamental legal instrument, the 1951 Geneva Convention.  All member states have the same conception of constitutional democracy and the fundamental rule of law.  An important point is that in acceding to the Geneva Convention each member state entered into basic humanitarian commitments arising from this conception aimed at affording protection to vulnerable persons who have good reason to fear persecution.</P>
    <P>Many of our fellow European Union members have been faced with the reality of expressing far more practical <Col N="870" /> humanitarian concern in relation to the hundreds of thousands of refugees with whom they have had to deal than has Ireland.  We should remember the numbers of refugees with whom so many European countries have dealt and attempted to deal in a fair and honourable way.  There may be philosophical disagreements about the approaches of certain European countries, but it is unfair to imply that somehow or other those European countries are lesser than we are, particularly in the context of the hundreds of thousands of people who have been given asylum in some of the countries which are subject to most criticism compared with the relatively small numbers of people &mdash; amounting to a couple of thousand people &mdash; in this country.</P>
    <P>Starting from a common legal base, the member states have implemented national laws and practices which have removed the possibility of refusing in a discretionary manner the admission of an asylum seeker into their territory. The only important criterion for each member state is whether or not the individual concerned satisfies the definition of refugee laid down in the Geneva Convention.  In addition, each member state takes the view that no policy or measures at a national or international level will detract in any way from those humanitarian commitments.  I wish to emphasise that this is true for any harmonisation measure taken by member states.  There is common agreement that any programme of harmonisation being developed by member states cannot be used in any way to reduce our common humanitarian commitments and obligations which we have all willingly entered into under the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>An underlying philosophy of the Dublin Convention is a basic confidence on the part of the member states in each other's procedures in relation to asylum law.  Although of limited scope, the establishment of responsibility for examining applications for asylum implicitly presupposes that member states have mutual confidence in each <Col N="871" /> other, with one member state's consent to an application for asylum lodged with it being processed by another member state in accordance with the latter's national legislation.  The convention's starting point, as I have said, is that it guarantees the member states' commitment to honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention, which specifically provides that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
    <P>The European Union is currently engaged in the development of a programme of harmonisation of basic asylum policy.  This is an area of work which is of great importance to the whole question of mutual confidence. Harmonisation is seen as a further logical step towards giving the confidence of which I have spoken more substance. It may be of particular interest to the House which may wish to be reassured in the context of the Dublin Convention to note that the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted a resolution last year on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures.</P>
    <P>That resolution, which expressed the political resolve of the member states, centres on reaffirming that the important principle of <i>non refoulement</i> is applied.  That is, an applicant for asylum cannot be removed to a state where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened for the reasons set out in the Geneva Convention.  It also reinforces the right of every asylum applicant to a fair hearing at every stage of the process.  It guarantees an examination in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Geneva Convention. These guarantees serve as an important factor in the context of the Dublin Convention.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR in 1989 noted that the phenomenon of refugees or asylum seekers moving in an irregular manner <Col N="872" /> from countries in which they had already found protection in order to seek asylum elsewhere was a matter of growing concern arising from the destabilising effect which irregular movements of this kind have on structured international efforts to provide appropriate solutions for refugees.  This is a real worry for some of our European members.  I am thinking particularly of countries like Holland, which has a marvellous history and tradition in relation to the rights of asylum seekers and has taken asylum seekers in their hundreds of thousands but which faces very severe difficulties.  It would be unfortunate if we were not to acknowledge what countries like Holland and Sweden have done.  However, it is also important to recognise it is necessary to protect the core definition of a refugee in order to protect the Geneva Convention.  It is one of the concerns of the UNHCR to uphold the core concept of refugees in the Geneva Convention as opposed to, for instance, immigrants moving for other reasons which may be legitimate but which are not to do essentially with persecution.  There may be many people who want to move for legitimate reasons of betterment but in this Bill we are concerned to protect those people who have to move for fear of persecution.</P>
    <P>It is right that the UNHCR seeks to make that distinction.  In much of the discussion on asylum policy and asylum development in Europe there is an essential confusion for reasons I understand and sympathise with, because it is a humanitarian concern that everybody be allowed to move.  That may be so, but not everybody is a refugee.  The Dublin Convention, in seeking to uphold the Geneva Convention, is essentially seeking to protect the concept of refugee status from being impinged on by other movements which may have a very good basis and for which we may have the most profound humanitarian sympathies.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention was signed by my predecessor, Deputy Burke, when he was Minister for Justice.  I am <Col N="873" /> sure, in the context in which I am addressing the matter, that the amendments tabled are inappropriate.  I understand the concerns the Deputies have expressed.  However, I believe they are not well founded.</P>
    <P>For the Dublin Convention to be effectively implemented following ratification by the Twelve, a number of measures will have to be adopted.  As a general rule for implementation of the convention, member states have agreed that action should be pragmatic and taken on the basis of the principle of good will.  For example, a network of contacts needs to be built up which can speed up the allocation of responsibility and make it possible to continue practical co-operation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the possibility cannot be ruled out that certain concepts might be amenable to a more precise definition. That would have to be done in the light of a specific need once the Dublin Convention has come into force.  In this respect, the Dublin Convention provides for the establishment of a committee made up of representatives of the member states to examine any question of a general nature concerning the application and interpretation of the Convention.  It is my intention to avail of this provision in the event of any particular difficulties or problems which come to light after the entry into force of the convention.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter with the officials in my Department and with the UNHCR.  We do not have the power to change the convention because we entered into it during our last Presidency, but regarding the arrangements under the convention certain matters should be addressed.  I propose that during our Presidency we should address those matters because there are areas where procedures can be improved.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the record of countries such a Sweden and Holland in relation to asylum and the burdens they have undertaken, and ask ourselves whether we are saying that somehow or other in relation to asylum matters we are greater than they.  I hope that we <Col N="874" /> would be their equal after the enactment of this Bill, but it will be a long time before we can say we are their superior.  I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the final analysis there is no substitute for certainty.  I am not arguing the merits or demerits of any country's humanitarian concerns.  I accept that there have been instances of tremendous humanitarian concern by other countries greater than our Government has shown at times.  I also accept that there have been instances where, to put it mildly, the humanitarian concerns were less than magnanimous.</P>
      <P>I have tabled amendments to provide that none of the provisions of this Bill or the Dublin Convention will authorise the transfer of an applicant for asylum to a Dublin Convention country from where there is reasonable cause to believe that he or she may be returned whether directly or indirectly to the country from which he or she has fled persecution.  I have not criticised the Dublin Convention; I know how necessary it was.  I have not gone into the humanitarian question because I understand all of that.  We should close off the loophole whereby a person could end up in the country from which he or she has fled persecution in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there would be inquiries anyway, but there is nothing in the Bill which says so.  Therefore, I have put forward an amendment stating that prior to the making of any order under section 22 (1), that order being that the Minister may make such orders as appears to him or her to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the Dublin Convention, the Minister shall make sufficient inquiries and obtain sufficient assurances from any Dublin Convention country to which it is proposed to return an asylum seeker to ensure that there should be no breach of section 22 (1).  This is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying it is necessary I am not criticising the integrity of any other country in this respect.  Nor am I making any <Col N="875" /> argument as to how certain countries may feel about refugees.  What I am saying as a certain fact is that some states have entered into agreements with other states which, in turn, have agreements with yet other states not to accept applications for asylum from the nationals of particular countries.</P>
    <P>The convention provides that the second country shall not transfer an individual to a place where it is likely that he will be persecuted.  However, country X, to whom we transfer an individual under the convention, may have an agreement with country Y not to tolerate an application for asylum from that country, and there may be no question of persecution in that country but if the individual is sent to country Y, that country, in turn, may have a transfer agreement with country W where there is a possibility of persecution.  It is obvious that the country to whom the individual has been transferred under the Dublin Convention did not transfer the individual to a place where the person might be persecuted but that the country to which the person was transferred may in fact transfer the person to a place where the person could be persecuted.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we would be in any way insulting or sending out the wrong signal by passing these amendments which would close off the loophole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> The Minister said there would be a motion before the House on the passing of the Dublin Convention, but she knows as well as I that any such motion is no substitute for legislation and that there will be no opportunity in this House to seek in statutory form the safeguards which are required.  That is why I say these amendments are necessary.  I accept the Minister's good intentions but there is no substitute for expressing them in legislation.  This is the time and place to implement it as the opportunity may not present itself again.  The international experience is that some applicants for refugee status have been bounced like pin balls from one State to another, each country disclaiming responsibility for dealing with the applications on the grounds of white list agreements and eventually the applicants are returned to the states from which they fled.  The European Consultation on Refugees and Exiles has documented individual cases where this happened. Some of these states are party to the convention.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances we not only have a right but a duty to insert these amendments into the legislation.  If we do not do so we will lose a golden opportunity to close a loophole in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment put.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank all Members for their contributions. This Bill has had a very long passage, having been first brought before the House by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. A number of Members made very detailed observations and suggestions on Committee Stage which have been incorporated in the Bill, as amended in select committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be broad acceptance of the need to address legislatively the rights and needs of asylum seekers and refugees and the provisions of this Bill, <Col N="883" /> when implemented, will provide a fair basis for that.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the provision of free legal aid which, as many Members said, is indicative of our fundamental attitude to and treatment of refugees and asylum seekers who should have such free legal aid available to them.  The framework of the proposed scheme was submitted to the Chief State Solicitor and referred to the Attorney General who, in turn, directed that counsel's opinion be sought, which is being done.  When we receive his report I hope we will be in a position to implement a legal aid scheme which will meet all the conditions and aspirations enunciated by various organisations in this field.  I want to thank particularly the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the non-governmental organisations who have been of enormous assistance to me and other Members on this matter. I hope we shall have a good legal aid scheme in place in time for the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enlightened Bill and its provisions will be of considerable assistance to unfortunate asylum seekers and refugees.  I am very happy that we now statutorily recognise the plight of these persons who are extremely vulnerable and fearful and who, at times, require our assistance.</P>
      <P>It is a humanitarian Bill and, while I did not succeed in having as many amendments accepted as I would have liked, the Minister of State dealt with them and our various proposals with great courtesy.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the contribution of the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to this Bill on which I compliment her.  I should also compliment the Minister of State and her officials on their tremendous work in the course of its passage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also warmly thank the various interest groups, such as Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council and <Col N="884" /> others for their invaluable help in ensuring that the provisions of this Bill are as good as possible despite the constraints on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, her officials and the non-governmental organisations &mdash; experts in this area &mdash; who have helped in our deliberations.  The Bill generated quite an unusual degree of interest by way of correspondence from members of the public, particularly those committed to this general issue of human rights. When the legislation comes into force, the standard of procedures for dealing with asylum seekers will be very high. The procedures have been well scrutinised. I was involved also in the previous Refugee Bill and this is our second opportunity to scrutinise the proposals.  The Bill is all the better for having been scrutinised a second time.  I wish it God speed.  The proof of the Bill will be in how officers implement the strict procedures and achieve the high standard of practice in international human rights when dealing with people at the point of entry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the wide ranging debate yesterday afternoon.  A number of health issues not directly related to the Bill were brought under scrutiny.  I hope we will be able, in due course, to pick up the points raised.  In particular, I thank Deputies Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and Liz O'Donnell who made the main speeches on behalf of the Opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Many women contracted hepatitis C as a result of infected anti-D product administered in 1977-78, but we should remember that anti-D has given life to many as well.  Since it first came into use in the early 1970s approximately 2,000 young people are alive and in full health who would either not be alive or would be suffering from disability but for the anti-D product.  The infected anti-D product saved lives.  Even though mothers were infected with hepatitis C, the administration of the infected product saved the lives of their children.  We should keep that in mind, because it is an intervention necessary in our maternity hospitals.  The product now being used is imported and we have absolute guarantees of its safety.  We do not want to scare people about the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a better idea of the number involved.  We have identified the number of women affected which is approximately 900.  More than 58,000 people were screened of whom 900 tested positive, about half have antibodies and the others full hepatitis C. The link is established for that cohort. There are approximately another 500 people who have been infected by infected blood.  Colleagues are aware that some of the women infected by the anti-D product subsequently became blood donors resulting in infected blood getting into the blood supply.  We had a <Col N="886" /> look back system followed by an optional national screening programme to identify other cases.  All the people in this category have not been identified but we think it will be approximately 500.  There are 150 haemophiliacs, comprising the third group and members of the Irish Kidney Association who because of their disability are high blood users and have been infected as well.  The total number is somewhere in excess of 1,600, but part of that total is an estimated figure.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C was not identified as a specific medical condition until 1989. Tests were not available for it until 1991 and accurate testing was as late as 1991-92. It is important to realise when commenting on those who ran the Blood Transfusion Service Board in the late 1970s that although procedures were not followed &mdash; as outlined in the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report &mdash; and that was a factor in the infection of anti-D product at the time, it is also true that the results were unforeseeable because the disease was not identified until 1989, some 12 years later.  My colleagues who have a legal background should toss that notion around in their heads before they talk in terms of the Director of Public Prosecutions taking action.  I understand the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report has been referred by Positive Action to the Director of Public Prosecutions and he will examine it in the normal way.  It is not for us to tell him that because of political concern he should act in one way rather than another.</P>
    <P>My attitude was that the chief executive officer and the chief medical officer should resign and they both retired ahead of time.  My interest was to get new people to carry out certain reforms in the Blood Transfusion Service Board and ensure that confidence was restored in the service.  Thankfully that has been achieved because there would be no hospital system without it.</P>
    <P>There are two distinct issues for the men and women who have contracted hepatitis C.  First, their concerns about their health and whether their future health needs will be looked after by the <Col N="887" /> State.  Second, the method to be used to pay compensation to the victims of hepatitis C who contracted it from either infected blood product or infected blood.  This was one of the first items I was briefed on when I was appointed Minister for Health just over 12 months ago.  The policy positions I laid down at that time have not varied and it is not a question of making it up as we go along or the Minister being forced by the very effective Opposition into doing things he did not intend to do.  During the first time I was questioned on this issue, I stated clearly there were two elements, first, we had to ensure that the health care needs of those infected were taken into account and that I would bring forward a health care package and second we would provide a system of compensation which was different from the courts system.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that in consultation with Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, The Irish Haemophiliac Association and the Irish Kidney Association the individuals concerned and their representative groups are satisfied with the health package we are putting forward. We have had recent consultations with all groups and this Bill together with the amendments to take into account the needs of Transfusion Positive, have been agreed and there is no contention on the health care side.  I know my successors will fulfil the commitments because the health care we are providing is statutorily based and comes either directly under the health Acts, from the health Acts by way of regulation, or is in the primary legislation we are discussing this evening.</P>
    <P>The second issue is the question of compensation.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has tied the two together which I presume is simply a debating device rather than a statement of principle, because it is unreasonable to say we should not look after people's health care needs until compensation has been agreed.  That is the effect of the amendment. I appreciate the Opposition frequently puts down amendments for the <Col N="888" /> purposes of debate but that is not a tenable position.  Obviously we should continue to make progress in providing life long health care and, in this case, life long general practitioner services free of charge.  It is worthwhile doing that even though Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and others are still unhappy about the final position on the tribunal and even the fine print.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has nothing to do with health care in spite of the arguments of some Deputies.  The health package is separate.  The issue that runs from the tribunal and which gave rise to its formation is simple: how could people be compensated?  Some Members said the tribunal is not about money.  Of course it is about money.  With the health package agreed the part that remains in contention is solely about money, about how compensation would be paid.  It is down to whether it should be paid through the High Court, in the normal way that a claim for damages would be met or paid in a more effective way through a compensation tribunal.  We always said we would set up an alternative to the courts system.  If people want a statutory system they have it in the High Court.  The alternative was supposed to be informal &mdash; non statutory &mdash; with many advantages which I outlined.</P>
    <P>We had fruitful negotiations with Positive Action and other groups up to Christmas.  Just before Christmas I was in a position to go back to Government and suggest serious amendments after consultation, in particular, with Positive Action.  I tabled a number of amendments and announced that the tribunal would go ahead.  The outstanding items which Positive Action was pressing before Christmas are not being pressed now, instead it is pressing different requirements.  Many of these requirements are matters of procedure for the tribunal.  I am anxious to reconcile the differences between myself and those in Positive Action who have represented the women.  If we can meet the points now being raised I would not be reluctant to do so.  I do not want a situation to develop where I may be given <Col N="889" /> another list in two months' time.  I want the matter concluded.  The tribunal is scheduling work from March onwards. As soon as it begins to process the applicants before it, I will still have power to change the tribunal but it is more difficult when it is up and running.</P>
    <P>The position with the tribunal is that applications are coming in every day. The format is a little complicated but that is necessary because the tribunal needs information to put it in a better position to assess compensation.  Certain documents have to be attached to the application form and some 85 full applications are to hand at the tribunal.  The tribunal has scheduled work from March and April.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has also been notified by a solicitior that 100 further applications will be lodged in the next two weeks. We are already looking at a module of business of 185 applicants.  It is clear what will happen.  As it processes its work and as the fears which have been expressed are proved to be unfounded people will gain confidence in the tribunal. Their legal representatives before the tribunal will say it is working well and confidence will be established. That confidence will run through the legal profession.  I have no doubt an extensive number of applicants will come forward.</P>
    <P>I do not want to leave unfinished business.  The people have concerns about the procedures within the tribunal and I would like to see what further we can do.  It is like all processes.  I will not be able to do everything that is being requested but if something else has to be done to build up the confidence of the individual applicant I will do it.  This is one of the more difficult issues that has faced the health services in living memory.  The health care pakage is in place.  What is out of place &mdash; and it is only by a matter of detail &mdash; is the tribunal. I would like that those who have worked so well in bringing it this far would be happy at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> I wish to deal with one or two points which arose and, in particular, to respond to Deputy McDaid who raised a point, which he also raised on Question Time.  Clause 4 (c) of the compensation scheme provides that where any of the persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion has died as a result of having contracted hepatitis C, any dependent of such persons will have access to the tribunal in their own right. Clause 4 (b) of the scheme provides that any person responsible for the maintenance of any of the persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or a blood transfusion and who has incurred financial loss and-or financial loss, as a direct result of providing such maintenance arising from the hepatitis C condition, will also have access to the tribunal.  It is a matter for the tribunal to determine the level of compensation in all cases in accordance with the law of tort which is exactly the same conditions as apply in the Surpreme Court.</P>
    <P>I have quite an amount of information in my briefing notes about individual points raised but it is not crucial-information and Deputies have probably got much of it in the course of Question Time, in respect of the funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for affording me the opportunity to make this statement.  I also wish to express my thanks to all those who made it possible &mdash; The Tánaiste, who has been working with tenacity and effectiveness on the twin track initiative which commenced last November, the members of the Cabinet sub-committee on Northern Ireland, the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General and all our officials.  Today's agreement would not have been possible without the agreement of 28 November which commenced the twin track initiative, established a firm aim of launching all-party talks and gave us the immensely valuable and cogently written Mitchell report.</P>
      <P>The agreement reached in London today between Prime Minister Major and myself provides an historic opening for peace and reconciliation.  It provides, for the first time, a fixed date for all-party negotiations where all the parties in Northern Ireland, Nationalist and republican, Unionist and loyalist, get around the table with the two Governments and negotiate a way out of the difficulties that have divided us and brought us into conflict for generations.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, now no vestige of argument for the continuation of IRA violence, just as there has never been any moral or political justification for it. I call on the IRA to accept the will of the people of both of these islands, as so clearly expressed in recent days, to end the bombings and the shootings once and for all.</P>
      <P>Today's agreement gives everyone a chance to resolve their political differences by political means.  We have an opportunity, in the intensive period of consultations which the Tánaiste will be starting on Monday, to receive an input from all Northern Ireland political parties as to how they think an elective process should work; how negotiations should be conducted; whether there is advantage in a referendum to win popular endorsement for what we are doing, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Unionist parties to respond generously to this process.  For our part we offer them generosity, in a way in which it has perhaps never been previously offered.  There can be no agreement without them.  Any agreement to come into effect must be approved in referendum by a majority <Col N="895" /> in Northern Ireland.  The majority community in Northern Ireland has the least to fear, and potentially the most to gain, from all-party negotiations.  The Unionist community should not allow any artifical obstacle or sophisticated argument to stand in the way of its full hearted involvement in determining its own future.</P>
    <P>This Government's primary objective since taking office has been to achieve a comprehensive political agreement which would allow the peoples of these islands to live and work together in peace and harmony.  We have been working intensively, in close co-operation with the British Government, to this end.  We have worked, willingly and with due acknowledgement, on the achievements of our predecessors in Government.</P>
    <P>In the period up to 9 February, when the IRA revoked its cessation of violence, a great deal of progress had been made.  The two Governments had for the first time ever provided, in the Joint Framework Document, an outline of what a comprehensive political agreement might involve, in order to give impetus, focus and direction to all-party negotiations.  We had also come a long way to making these negotiations a reality.</P>
    <P>Last November, the two Governments agreed a joint firm aim of launching all-party negotiations by the end of this month.  We also put in place a process &mdash; the twin track process &mdash; to achieve this end.  It involved the beginning of intensive preparatory talks between the two Governments and the political parties to prepare the ground for negotiations.  It also involved, in parallel, the setting up of an international body, chaired by Senator George Mitchell, to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue. That body completed its work last month within the time frame allotted and its report, containing a number of principles and recommendations, dealt <Col N="896" /> in a very balanced way with the complexities surrounding the decommissioning issue.</P>
    <P>Very considerable progress was also made in the discussions in the political track, involving an unprecedented degree of contact between the two Governments, separately and together, and the political parties in Northern Ireland.  With a view to concluding the preparations for negotiations, the Irish Government has on 7 February made a proposal for proximity talks, which we were pursuing with the British Government with, we believed, a real prospect of success.  In short, it seemed at that time as if all-party negotiations were within a hand's grasp.</P>
    <P>The IRA's resumption of violence on 9 February, with all its terrible consequences in terms of loss of life and grevious injury and suffering, some permanent, was a major blow to our hopes for real progress towards a political settlement.  However, the two Governments continued to work towards our shared objective of all-party negotiations. We recognised that we had a duty to act in the interests of all those &mdash; the vast majority of the peoples of these islands &mdash; who put their trust and confidence in us and who look to us for political leadership.  The place of political progress can never be dictated by those who, against all morality and logic, seek to set the political agenda by violence.</P>
    <P>The priority of the Government in the past two weeks has been the restoration of the IRA ceasefire and the establishment of a specific date for all-party negotiations on a settlement.  We have regarded the latter objective as desirable and necessary in its own right, and also as helpful to the reinstatement of peace.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué which Prime Minister Major and I agreed in Downing Street today represents a further milestone in this ongoing work and provides, as I have already said, an historic opening for the peace and reconciliation we all seek.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> First, it reaffirms the commitment of the two Governments to work for a lasting peace and comprehensive settlement based on the principles set out in the Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.  Second, it underlines the fundamental priority we attach to securing the earliest possible inclusive negotiations to address all the relevant relationships and issues in an interlocking three-stranded process. Third, it confirms that such negotiations should include all relevant parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and have shown that they abide by the democratic process. There are no other qualifications for participation.  Fourth, it confirms that an elective process would have to be broadly acceptable and lead immediately and without further pre-conditions to the convening of all-party negotiations with a comprehensive agenda.</P>
    <P>The communiqué agreed between the British Prime Minister and myself is designed to move the entire peace process forward decisively.  It creates a priceless opportunity to recapture the peace and anchor it politically.</P>
    <P>For Sinn Féin and the IRA, this is a moment in time which may not be available to them again soon &mdash; if ever.  All that has to happen, for Sinn Féin to become a full participant in the negotiations, is a restoration of the IRA ceasefire of August 1994.  I know that every Member of this House will join in the demand that the IRA should make Sinn Féin's political participation possible and that they should make that decision now.</P>
    <P>I say to them openly and frankly: &ldquo;Do not close this space for hope.  Build on the opportunity inherent in it.  Take the next vital step in building a lasting peaceful settlement by restoring the ceasefire of August 1994.  That will then enable the two Governments to resume full ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin and make possible that party's full engagement in the process of negotiations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In paragraph 6 of the communiqué, <Col N="898" /> the Irish and British Governments have committed themselves irrevocably to the commencement of all-party negotiations on 10 June.  It is made equally clear in paragraph 12 that, even in the absence of the cessation of violence, both Governments will continue to work in partnership with those parties exclusively committed to peaceful methods to secure a comprehensive negotiated settlement and start negotiations with them on 10 June.</P>
    <P>The intensive consultations and elective process, now provided for, will be undertaken in the period between now and 10 June.  Inclusive negotiations will then be convened to address comprehensively the agreed agenda in an interlocking three-stranded process.</P>
    <P>During the ten day period beginning on Monday next, the two Governments will conduct intensive multilateral consultations with the relevant Northern Ireland parties.  The purpose of these consultations will be first, to reach widespread agreement on proposals for a broadly acceptable elective process leading directly and without preconditions to the commencement of all-party negotiations on 10 June.  While this is a matter primarily for the parties in Northern Ireland to determine by agreement with the British Government, the Irish Government would support a proposal of that kind which, to our satisfaction, met the three tests set out in the Mitchell report.</P>
    <P>The test of broad acceptability requires political acceptance.  The test of an appropriate mandate demands that it offers a direct and speedy route, without preconditions, to all-party negotiations. The test of being within the three stranded structure requires that the integrity of the three core relationships as set out in both the Joint Declaration and Joint Framework Document must be respected.  In this morning's communiqué, full and appropriate account has been taken of these three conditions in paragraph 7 where it is stated that:</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach agreed that an elective process <Col N="899" /> would have to be broadly acceptable and lead immediately and without further preconditions to the convening of all-party negotiations with a comprehensive agenda.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the intensive consultations with the parties which will commence on Monday next is to reach widespread agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of substantive all-party negotiations.  On the basis for negotiations, it is made clear in paragraph 4 that neither violence nor the threat of violence would be allowed to influence the course of negotiations or preparations for them.  Furthermore, in paragraph 6, the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed our commitment to work for a lasting peace and comprehensive settlement on the basis of the fundamental principles shared by our two Governments and set out in the Downing Street Declaration and Joint Framework Document.</P>
    <P>Regarding participation in all-party negotiations, both Governments are agreed in paragraph 5 that Sinn Féin participation is dependent only on a restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  I regard it as being in all our interests that parties close to the loyalist paramilitaries, which have shown such discipline and courage in recent weeks, should be able to join with us in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>On the question of how talks will be structured, much work remains to be done.  While the practical considerations of this remain to be agreed, there is much to build upon.  The lessons of the 1991-92 talks and the issues identified in the Joint Framework Document offer signposts for the way forward.  The structure for negotiations must be within the three-stranded framework where all the key relationships are accorded equal integrity.</P>
    <P>The format for negotiations is a matter on which each party will, undoubtedly, have its own view.  The overriding objective should be viability in order <Col N="900" /> that the prospects for reaching a comprehensive agreement would be maximised within the shortest period possible.</P>
    <P>On the question of the agenda for all-party negotiations, the British Prime Minister and I agree that it should be comprehensive.  In that regard, the issues identified in the Joint Framework Document will be able to provide the necessary focus and direction for deliberations in this area, without being exclusive.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of the intensive multilateral consultations with the Northern Ireland parties relates to the question of the holding of parallel referendums, in Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction.  The objective of such referendums would be &ldquo;to mandate support for a process to create lasting stability, based on the repudiation of violence for any political purpose&rdquo;.  Mr. John Hume first proposed this as a means of solidly underpinning the search for, and outcome of, political negotiations by purely peaceful and democratic means.  The idea has much to commend it because the people of Ireland, North and South, would, in effect, be asked to say that the invocation of violence can have no place in the resolution of differences on this island.  These can only be resolved by peaceful and democratic methods, where violence or its threat will have no part.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister and I are confident that the consultations on all these matters, which will begin on Monday next, will offer a fair and acceptable basis for the launch of all-party negotiations which will go ahead on 10 June. The Governments will review the outcome in just over a fortnight's time and decisions will then be made to guarantee that the all-party negotiations will begin on time.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the timespan just outlined for the intensive consultations with the Northern Ireland parties is very short.  A determined and committed effort is required of everyone involved to ensure the maximum progress is achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> There has been an emphasis in comment in Westminster and elsewhere on the problem of decommissioning.  I understand this, but let us not forget that addressing the decommissioning of arms is one of the best means of building confidence and trust.  We are putting in place a process in which decommissioning will become possible, as it is already desirable in every other sense. It is through the confidence and trust that can only be built by political dialogue that we will make decommissioning practically achievable.  That is a challenge for everybody.  An important part of making that challenge a credible one is the clear recognition in the communiqué that confidence building also requires that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.</P>
    <P>That important point should be reflected upon in Northern Ireland and the neighbouring jurisdiction.  These two processes complement one another: a process of meaningful negotiation complements and reinforces a process of taking arms out of politics just as a process of taking arms out of politics complements and reinforces a process of meaningful negotiation.  That is the complementarity established so clearly in paragraph 12 of the communiqué agreed today.</P>
    <P>It is important that people debating this issue should recognise that what we need to achieve is a positive complementarity between these two factors, where the process of decommissioning reinforces the process of negotiation in a serious way and where the process of serious negotiation also helps in dealing with the decommissioning problem.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the British Prime Minister and myself that all our contacts and meetings will act as further steps on the road to the commencement of all-party talks on 10 June.  This morning's communiqué represents an historic opening.  Never before have we had the <Col N="902" /> possibility of sitting down together to discuss all the issues that divide us.  No one participant will determine the agenda, the format or the conditions for participation.  In the end, the peace that belongs to all the people of Ireland must be underpinned by political agreement. After many twists and turns, we have created a hill on the road to agreement. The journey down the rest of the road starts now.</P>
    <P>In today's communiqué the two Governments have created a political means and a firm guarantee whereby the overwhelming wish of the Irish people, expressed in the cry for peace last Sunday in towns, villages and cities of this land, North and South, can be given practical political expression.  The role of political life is to provide a channel and a means whereby people's aspirations can be given reality.  This communiqué gives reality to the heartfelt aspirations and demands of the Irish people, North and South, Unionist and Nationalist, for peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>I express my thanks to all involved on behalf of the Government in this exercise. I also express my thanks and appreciation to the British Government, and to the British Prime Minister, John Major, for the courage and decisiveness that he has shown in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My party, Fianna Fáil, warmly welcomes the definite political progress that has finally been achieved by the two Governments, 18 months to the day after the original ceasefire.  I welcome the fact that a firm date has been set for convening all-party negotiations. While an elective process would have to be broadly acceptable, the important thing is that it will lead immediately and without further pre-conditions to the convening of all-party negotiations with a comprehensive agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the fact that the two Governments are finally reverting to the understanding on which the original ceasefire was based that <Col N="903" /> Fianna Fáil in Government helped to bring about.  This is the understanding first set out in paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration, in which the only precondition for participation in dialogue and negotiations with other parties is a permanent end to violence. We on this side of the House and many others have been saying for more than a year that the basis for a move to all-party negotiations had already been provided by the sustained ceasefires. The two Governments have now vindicated that point of view.</P>
    <P>The setting of a date for all-party talks does represent a breakthrough. For a long time both Governments, but particularly the British Government, argued that there was no point in doing this unless the unionist parties had agreed in advance to attend.  The alternative view, which has not prevailed, was that those who were obstructing or boycotting the start of negotiations should be clearly identified.  It is now clear that the people, whatever their political persuasion, will not thank the parties who refuse to take part in peace negotiations unless their unrealistic pre-conditions are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I accept parties do have serious and genuine concerns about the existence of large arsenals, which will only be heightened by recent events.  These concerns will need to be addressed in a serious manner at the start of all-party negotiations, and this is what we have always advocated.  The Mitchell principles and recommendations about confidence-building measures come from a neutral source, and have a lot of validity.  I believe they will prove the best and least contentious way of dealing with many issues.  Additional issues, like the principle of consent should be dealt with in the course of negotiations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the renewed commitment of both Governments to a lasting peace and comprehensive settlement on the basis of the fundamental principles in the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document.  We are <Col N="904" /> delighted that the Framework Document after a year's absence has finally re-emerged.  This is something we have strongly argued for.</P>
    <P>While I note that in paragraph six the two Governments affirm the fundamental priority they attach to securing the earliest possible inclusive negotiations to address comprehensively all the relevant relationships and issues in an inter-locking three-stranded process, I am puzzled that in paragraph nine only the Taoiseach requires to be satisfied that the nature of an elective process has to be within the three-stranded structure.  I would like clarification on this as adherence to the three strands is vital throughout the process.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is an immediate move to unilateral consultations on proximity talks to settle the form and agenda of negotiations over a 10-day period.  Some intensive brainstorming is clearly needed.  We remain frankly sceptical about the necessity of an elective process and we see a lot of problems in it, particularly once the heat of a campaign is generated.  We do not have a strong view on the nature of the elective process, recognising that there are sincere and legitimate views on both sides.  I have had the opportunity to listen to the parties on both sides of this argument.</P>
    <P>We hope that the two Governments and all political parties will work together to ensure the success of the process that has been outlined by the Taoiseach, and that the failure to honour the firm aim of starting negotiations by the end of February contained in the 28 November communiqué will not be repeated.  The timetable must be strictly adhered to.  Good faith will be vital on all sides.  I would urge that the IRA ceasefire be reinstated forthwith, and I expect that it will be, so that Sinn Féin can immediately play a full part in all political talks and negotiations on an equal footing, and have direct access to both Governments at the highest level.</P>
    <P>I would ask the IRA to give a full and unequivocal commitment at least equivalent to the definitive statement made on 31 August 1994 that restores the <Col N="905" /> integrity of the peace process, and that it do so without reservations.  My party will then do its utmost to ensure that Sinn Féin are treated fairly and in a non-discriminatory manner in relation to their participation in future talks and negotiations.</P>
    <P>I hope that all political parties in this island will be imbued with a deep sense of responsibility towards the people of Ireland, North and South.  Their welfare, and in some cases even their lives, are at stake.  The people have expressed their will in an unmistakeable manner that there must be a peaceful accommodation of political differences.  The voice of the people will have done more than anything to restore peace.  There is no place for further violence, and there must be negotiations leading to a peace settlement.</P>
    <P>What has been agreed today by the two Governments should have been done long ago.  It is never wrong to carry out one's public commitments.  It is a great pity that it has appeared to take a major crisis and a breakdown in the peace process to inject a real sense of urgency into political progress, because that can send all the wrong messages.  I deeply regret that the response that should have been given to peace has only followed now after recent events. That only encourages a dangerous cynicism about democracy.  It is an indictment of the way in which the peace process was mishandled over a long period, particularly by the British Government, from the aftermath of the Framework Document to the publication of the Mitchell report, major initiatives, both of which were effectively cast aside.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am glad that the two Governments together are at last in a position to give the peace process the momentum it always needed.  The original progress made in the peace process came about because the British Government in the final analysis was willing to listen to the Irish Government, which had a greater understanding of the psychology of the situation.  The problem arose when they stopped listening to us. <Col N="906" /> Throughout the last year, I and my colleagues have argued inside and outside this House, the Forum and elsewhere what needed to be done.  I hope and believe that lasting lessons will have been learned on all sides.  We all have to examine our consciences, with the determination that the mistakes of the past year will not be repeated.  I do not intend to say anything today that might provide the slightest justification for a continuation of violence.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding today's developments, the IRA ceasefire should have held in all circumstances, as originally promised.  As the main democratic republican party, committed to the ultimate goal of an Irish unity achieved in peace by agreement, we are confident of the Irish people's ability to move forward and, if necessary, fight their political battles by exclusively political and democratic means, however long it takes and no matter what obstacles are placed in the way by others.  There are no short cuts.  Our national destiny has evolved over centuries, but this coming generation faces uniquely favourable circumstances for a major national advance on all fronts, provided those chances are not marred by violence.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the IRA acted out of frustration at what it saw as the provocation, prevarication and arrogance of its opponents in the British Government and the Unionist parties.  The IRA was never defeated, and no one should have made the mistake of treating it as if it had been.  The British Government should have taken realistic advice on the decommissioning issue from this House. As against that, the Irish Government, Fianna Fáil, other parties in this House and in the Forum and Irish-Americans did their best in good faith, even if some critical mistakes were made, to sustain confidence in the ceasefire.  Solemn and unqualified commitments had been made by the IRA and Sinn Féin leaders. We did not deserve to be let down. What the IRA did on 9 February and subsequently was extremely dangerous and we are fortunate that other paramilitary organisations, loyalists and <Col N="907" /> republican socialist, exercised a commendable restraint, which could not necessarily be counted on again.  I praise them for doing so and if they stick to that position the whole of Ireland will not forget it in future.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of the ceasefire was damaging to Sinn Féin and to the credibility and trustworthiness of the republican movement.  I nevertheless believe that, even if it is a little slow to begin with, trust can be restored, if the right response is given swiftly now and is sustained long-term into the future.  I am sure everyone committed to the peace process will be greatly relieved if the nightmare of the last three weeks is over.</P>
    <P>I am sure the IRA will recognise that a breakthrough has been achieved, even if it should have happened earlier, but it would make a huge mistake if it were ever again to resume its campaign.  As the peace forum stated it its report, and the British Government in its clarification of May 1994, no political party has a veto.  In today's climate, the people throughout the island are demanding peace and the political accommodation that will underpin it.  The IRA is deeply mistaken, if it believes that it or any other organisation can continue to exercise a veto on political progress.  That may have been the position for 25 years, but we are moving into a new era when all vetoes coming from any one party or organisation will be broken.  We saw this with the Ulster Unionist Party only the other night.  Progress towards a political settlement has started, however slow it may be, and will not be halted by paramilitary violence; if anything the opposite will be the case.</P>
    <P>Members of the republican movement need to transform all their energies into politics.  They showed in the last 18 months that they were well able to hold their own.  Democratic politics is often a slow, wearisome business, with few immediate rewards.  Yet at other times it can also be exciting, exhilarating <Col N="908" /> and fast moving.  We have all experienced both the highs and the lows of politics.</P>
    <P>The paramilitary organisations in the North must accept, in the words of the prophet Isaiah, that &ldquo;their warfare is accomplished&rdquo;.  They must face the logic of that in the course of negotiations, both in terms of their organisations and in regard to the safe, verifiable and mutual disposal of their weapons, as part of the wider demilitarisation of Northern society.  The six Mitchell principles and the recommendation of a phased start to decommissioning during negotiations will need to be addressed when those negotiations start.  My party has shown in the past few years that it is prepared to do everything reasonable to assist in this democratic transformation to bring everyone in from the cold in an inclusive manner.  However, like other parties in this House we will have nothing to do with any attempts to maintain a twin-track strategy of armalite and ballot box or to keep open the option of a future resort to violence.  Far from strengthening the hand of Sinn Féin at talks, such tactics would in practice have the very opposite effect of completely marginalising it.</P>
    <P>No one should mistake the nature of the current position.  Everyone was deeply shocked by the breakdown of the ceasefire.  In chastened mood, we have all made great efforts, in some cases greater than before, to create the conditions which can restore peace.  It would be a serious misreading of the current position to believe that future concessions or breakthroughs can be achieved by further violence.  It would be an equally serious misreading of the position, if the ceasefire were restored, for either the British Government or the Unionist parties to once again up their demands or reinstate preconditions that helped lead to the present disaster. Statesmanship and a more enlightened spirit of generosity and magnanimity must now take over on all sides from petty rancour and vindictiveness.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is this more important than in the area of prisoners.  If the ceasefire <Col N="909" /> is reinstated for good, a more enlightened approach must be adopted by the British Government.  It is not Unionist opinion that is the problem, but right-wing Tory prejudice.  If the peace holds, the British Government should commit itself to the accelerated release of all prisoners, except those convicted recently of the most serious offences. Paddy Kelly, who is suffering from an advanced state of cancer, the proper treatment of which was callously delayed by the Home Secretary, should be released on parole on humanitarian grounds as a gesture of good faith by the British Government or at the very least transferred close to his family in Portlaoise. I impress on the Government the importance of the prisoner issue.  There are also prisoners' issues to be attended to in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>We are open to the idea of an all-Ireland referendum, provided the question is meaningful.  After the experience of the last two weeks, it may be helpful to have an authoritative statement on the matter by the people of Ireland for the first time since 1918.</P>
    <P>There is disagreement about the form of an electoral process.  There is no reference in the communiqué to an electoral body.  We have heard the case put forward by parties on both sides of the argument and it is a matter in the first instance for them to resolve.  I note the Government will decide on the basis of what is most acceptable, but if the parties cannot agree on the form of elections, there would be a case for them going straight into negotiations without elections.  We are still not convinced of the merits of an election, particularly when parties get into the heat of a campaign. But we accept that the points of view of different parties must be accommodated. However, it is important that the peace process is not diverted into a debating forum which would avoid serious negotiations.  This was the danger presented by the recent Unionist document.  All I ask is that the commitments made by the two Governments in the communiqué are kept, particularly <Col N="910" /> the date for the convening of negotiations, and that the negotiations planned really are negotiations, not assembly or committee-type debates.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their respective teams on their contribution.  I am also glad that on Monday the British Prime Minister was again able to demonstrate his independence. My party has concentrated on keeping channels open and making the arguments in public so that the people know what is going on and what is really at issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the peace process is back on the rails very shortly.  I look forward to the restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  Let us all turn our faces firmly towards a peaceful, democratically agreed future in Ireland, in which justice, partnership, equality and the principle of consent are all part of a new political dispensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, warmly welcome the communiqué issued by the two Governments.  It offers a fair, balanced and sensitive formula for reviving the peace process.  I commend, in particular, the efforts of the Taoiseach in the past few weeks.  He did not lose his nerve but painstakingly sought to build the political process with a view to restoring the IRA ceasefire.</P>
      <P>I also commend the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, all the officials involved and other members of the Government.  It is only correct that we do this.  It is fair to say most Members held their nerve in the past few weeks.  Calm and reasoned contributions were made and people were supportive.  This is as it should be and I hope it will continue.  Despite the anguish and heartbreak triggered by the Canary Wharf bombing, the communiqué issued today is a beacon of hope and optimism in the political landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay bribute to the O'Brien family from Gorey who have showed enormous courage, honesty and true patriotism in their unequivocal denunciation of the IRA, of whom their son was a member, and full apology to the victims of <Col N="911" /> the London bombing.  Even though they must have been torn asunder between the anguish of their son's death and the realisation of the awful atrocity in which he was embroiled, they were unequivocal in the attitude they adopted.  They sent a singular and clear message to the British public that there is no support in Ireland for political violence.  Given the way they handled their tragedy, they have made an enormous contribution to the political process and, hopefully, to the revival of the peace process.</P>
    <P>It is fair to acknowledge the leaders of the smaller loyalist parties, the PUP and the UDP.  Even though it must have been difficult for them, they used their influence to ensure there was no retaliation after the ending of the IRA ceasefire. Their efforts and courage have saved some families from going through what the O'Brien family and many other families have gone through in the past three weeks.</P>
    <P>Since 9 February there has been much anguish and heart searching and, as the communiqué says, the people took the process over, it is the people's process. However, I also found a certain ambiguity in the attitude adopted by the public. While they were clear that the IRA was responsible for the bombings they were equally inclined to blame the British Government for its reluctance to move the process forward and for the failure to grasp the opportunity presented, particularly by the Mitchell Commission report.  There was also an acknowledgement of the failure of certain Unionist politicians to seize the opportunity presented over the past 18 months.  I hope we all learn lessons from what has happened.  Democratic politicians and, in particular, sovereign governments must never be seen to reward those who engage in violence. We must make politics work and learn lessons from what has happened in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people displayed their outrage, sought to take the process in hand and do something about it, whether by <Col N="912" /> wearing a white ribbon, making telephone calls to radio programmes, writing letters to newspapers or their extraordinary response to the marches last weekend.  People were genuinely determined not to let this opportunity pass but rather to seize it and to be seen to do something about it.  We must respond generously to this action.  It is clear from the communiqué that the Governments have set the chart for the way forward, they have spelled out the route we have to follow.  We must be generous and enter the proximity talks which will start next Monday and continue until 13 March in a spirit of openness and mutual understanding, willingness to do business with those with whom we disagree and a desire to make politics work.  If people are not prepared to approach the process in that spirit then the future is bleak and it will take much longer than it might otherwise take to achieve a political settlement.</P>
    <P>We have to grasp the opportunity to create in Northern Ireland a society to which Nationalist and Unionist can give allegiance.  By its existence, Northern Ireland recognises the legitimacy of Unionism, whether it is in the flags and emblems, The British administration at Stormont or the parliamentary representation at Westminster.  Northern Ireland has to become a society which equally recognise the aspirations and identity of the Nationalist community. We must not forget this and it is a huge challenge for the Unionist community to recognise and appreciate this. Nobody wants to live in a society where more than 40 per cent of the people are completely alienated.  Unionism and Nationalism are not compatible but it is possible to create structures and institutions where they both can be accommodated and to which each person, regardless of his identity, can give his allegiance.</P>
    <P>That is the challenge facing all of us and over the next while I would like to see concentration on the way forward, the path to a political settlement.  I would like us all to concentrate our minds on how we can achieve that <Col N="913" /> settlement and the elements of it.  The first element is there can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of the people there wish it.  That position is endorsed in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and supported by every Nationalist party on this island except Sinn Féin.  Equally, there can be no internal settlement.  The North-South dimension is the right of Nationalists for their legitimacy and identity to be recognised.  This, too, must be one of the ground rules of the settlement.</P>
    <P>The communiqué sets the date of 10 June for all-party talks.  Given that we now have the date sought for so long by so many, the door is open for Sinn Féin to come back into the political process. There can be no more excuses and no more ifs and buts.  We have spent too much time over the past 18 months arguing about words and seeking clarification on decommissioning, permanency and self-determination and setting preconditions.  Arguments about words get us nowhere and we must move away from this approach.  Sinn Féin must now move to use its influence to ensure the IRA restores the ceasefire. It must also go further and commit itself to using only democratic political principles as a way of achieving its political ends and renounce violence.  If the shadow of a gun or the echo of semtex hangs over the talks they will not be very meaningful or effective, and Sinn Féin must also know that.  In the context of all-party talks, we must create trust and mutual understanding and seek to create confidence building measures without wasting any more time.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed this evening to hear Martin McGuinness say there had to be more clarification.  Last Sunday he said that if a guaranteed date for the start of all-party talks was announced by the Government he would return to the IRA to secure a ceasefire.  He must return to the IRA and seek to have the ceasefire restored given that there is now a clear commitment to a precise date and not just a timetable.  He and his party will be judged on what they do <Col N="914" /> in the next few days, not the next few months.  The steps taken in the next few days will show the bona fides of everybody and opportunities may be missed if people do not act quickly.  History will be very cruel to those who turn down the opportunity now being presented. Sinn Féin is being given a second opportunity to come into the political process on the same basis as everyone else.  I hope it does not fail to grasp this opportunity because if it does, it will be its fault alone, it will have put itself outside the democratic political process by adopting an ambivalent attitude to violence and choosing not to use its influence over the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>I want to be as helpful as possible but there is a confusing element in the communiqué. On the 6 o'clock news this evening one broadcaster said the door was now open for all-party talks on 10 June without any preconditions while the other broadcaster said Sinn Féin could come into the process if the IRA ceasefire was restored.  Those two statements are somewhat incompatible. Paragraph 5 of the communiqué states:</P>
    <P>Both Governments are agreed that the resumption of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin and their participation in negotiations requires the restoration of the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I know we have to read the entire document but paragraph 7 states:</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach agreed that an elective process would have to be broadly acceptable and lead immediately and without further preconditions to the convening of all party negotiations with a comprehensive agenda.</P>
    <P>I know what is meant by that statement but it is somewhat confusing.  Perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare will clarify it.  I assume I am reading the document correctly when I say that without a restoration of the ceasefire, Sinn Féin will not be involved in either ministerial dialogue or in talks on 10 June.  I hope I am correct in assuming this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> I also believe that in addition to Sinn Féin seeking to have the IRA ceasefire restored, we need to see an endorsement of the six Mitchell principles.  We also need to see a commitment on decommissioning.  That is essential, whether it is to come now or at the top of the political agenda on the first day of the talks.  Only after decommissioning will we have meaningful dialogue and real negotiations which can lead to a political settlement.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the reference to the three strand process in the communiqué; that is important from the Nationalist perspective.  We have to see each strand in terms of the other strands.  Each strand gets its strength and shape from reference to the other strands and they cannot be separated. Although it will be a matter for the British Government to decide on the nature of the elective process, it would be very foolish and counterproductive for the British and Irish Governments not to be at one after the proximity talks on the electoral process to be chosen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern said, and I agree with him, that it might well be that we do not need an elective process.  I have great reservations about the damage that elections can do to this process.  Northern Ireland is the one place in the world where there is no floating vote, where things do not change.  In the context of elections people can become more polarised.  Extreme positions are adopted as parties look over their shoulder at the more extreme elements in their community.  I am worried about the potential of talks coming so quickly after elections of that kind.  It is difficult for democratic politicians to ever condemn the idea of elections but elections can have a damaging effect in the context of the Northern Ireland peace process, and we must all recognise that.  On the agenda from next Monday to 13 March must be the possibility that we do not need elections; that idea should be explored by the Governments.</P>
    <P>I have mixed views about the idea of a referendum or referenda.  As well as <Col N="916" /> the waste of time and money involved, I do not believe that meaningless referenda can have anything but damaging consequences.  Unless we can put meaningful concepts to the public we would be very foolish to engage in any referendum campaign.  I found it quite disturbing over recent days to see those who were allied to the IRA and refused to condemn the atrocities in London in recent weeks wearing the white ribbons crossed with green, holding their placards and engaging in the peace demonstration. What would be the result of all parties, including Sinn Féin, wrapping themselves around a meaningless referendum campaign?  We need to be careful.</P>
    <P>The peace process belongs to the ordinary people and they will not let it slip; they are determined about that. They want us to use our imagination, skills and experience to bring about a political settlement because we will have sustainable peace only when we have a fair political settlement and it is important to recognise that.  Political vacuums are always filled by the men of violence.  I appeal to everybody to approach the process that will begin next Monday with open minds and generous hearts.  They should not do anything that might in any way damage the process and delay the possibility of finding a real political settlement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We want to achieve a transformed society in Northern Ireland where citizens from both communities are equally regarded in the laws and, I hope, in a constitution for Northern Ireland, which my party supports.  There has to be parity of esteem and equality of treatment. Enormous opportunities will come to all citizens of Northern Ireland when we achieve that settlement but there are also huge opportunities for the people in the South and in Britain.</P>
    <P>If there are any lessons to be learned from the opinion poll in this morning's issue of <i>The Irish Times and The Guardian</i>, it is that people want peace.  They are also prepared to accept anything <Col N="917" /> that will guarantee a fair political settlement. They are prepared to compromise and to be generous and, if we can respond to that spirit among the public &mdash; it might take time &mdash; we are back on the road.  The process is back on the rails and I hope everybody grasps the opportunity they have been given because they might not get another such opportunity to be fully involved in the political process in the future.</P>

      <P>The agreement arrived at today by the two Governments has the potential to restore fully the momentum of the peace process.  This potential will be fully realised with the co-operation of all parties and politicians.</P>
      <P>We all share a solemn obligation to ensure that the process advances to a successful conclusion.  The peace process cannot advance in an atmosphere of recriminations, threats, and ultimatums. Party posturing must give way to all party co-operation towards a common goal of a peaceful and democratic accommodation.  We should be guided by the powerful demonstrations for peace which took place in all parts of this island last Sunday.  We should be guided by the quiet dignity of the O'Brien family of Gorey who buried their son today.</P>
      <P>The IRA in particular should take note of the public mood.  There is no mood for violence, there is no mood for bombs in London or anywhere else. This mood is confirmed in an opinion poll published today which shows that 89 per cent of people in the Republic, 80 per cent in Northern Ireland, and 81 per cent in Britain think that partition is not worth taking or sacrificing life for. Furthermore, the majority opinion favours an immediate resumption of the IRA ceasefire and the decommissioning of IRA arms either before or during talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day of the patriot game is drawing to an end; people want to express the love of one's country in more positive ways.  The overall message of the poll is that the people of these islands <Col N="918" /> want peace without reservations.  It is up to us as politicians, together with our counterparts in Britain and Northern Ireland, to secure the peace they want. Likewise, it is up to the IRA to remove their veto on peace.</P>
    <P>What has happened today is that the politicians have saved the peace process from the gunmen.  This is the result of a continuity in the approach of the two Governments that predates the ceasefires and survived the recent bombings by the IRA.  Progress is being made in spite of the obstacles created by the bombs.</P>
    <P>I reject any suggestion that bombs injected urgency into our efforts to reach today's agreement.  The bombs injected crisis into the process.  They destroyed lives and trust.  To concede the point that the bombs injected urgency into our efforts is to concede the validity that violence is useful or has a political value.  It is to encourage more young men like Ed O'Brien to go down the road of planting bombs.  I urge everybody to be cautious about the words they use in articulating the view that in some way the bombs of the past weeks had anything other than a damaging effect on the peace process.  It was the politicians who held the peace during the worst years of the violence in Northern Ireland.  It should be remembered that it was the democratic politicians, both Nationalist and Unionist, who, because they stood by democratic principles ensured that there was not a complete descent into violence over the past 25 years.  Politics was put under great strain and at times it seemed that a complete collapse of society in Northern Ireland was imminent.  Thankfully, the forces of democracy &mdash; represented not just by the political parties but by the various voluntary groups of civil society &mdash; prevented this happening.</P>
    <P>These forces are now called on again to secure a peaceful and democratic future.  The primary responsibility rests with the political parties to grasp the opportunity contained in today's agreement. A significant breakthrough has been made in fixing a date for all party <Col N="919" /> talks.  The parties in Northern Ireland are being asked to design an appropriate elective process in intensive multilateral consultations scheduled to begin next Monday and to end by Wednesday, 13 March.  With or without a ceasefire, the process is being renewed.  The journedy towards agreement has been resumed.</P>
    <P>To deal with the points raised by Deputy Harney as to whether there is ambiguity in the communiqué with regard to access by Sinn Féin to all-party negotiations and the consultative process on the question of the ceasefire, there is no doubt whatsoever in the minds of the Irish or British Governments but that Sinn Féin cannot enter negotiations unless there is a ceasefire.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has an obligation to its supporters to play a full part in the process. There are no preconditions that do not apply to everyone else &mdash; an absolute commitment to peaceful methods to secure a comprehensive negotiated settlement.  It is essentially a matter for the IRA to make Sinn Féin's full participation in the process of negotiations possible by reinstating its ceasefire permanently and without equivocation.</P>
    <P>I trust that those in Sinn Féin who I know favour the political path will now assert themselves so that they can extract themselves from the cul-de-sac into which the IRA has driven them. They should be aware that the IRA's resumption of violence has severely damaged Sinn Féin's credibility as a democratic political party.  That will not be easily restored but it can be if they make the right choice now.  The first minimum step towards that end is a restoration of the ceasefire.  We all hope they will make the choice for democratic politics.  It is a choice that will be universally welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister have jointly stated their hope that all parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations. Confidence measures will naturally be necessary.  Among these is the need for all participants to make clear <Col N="920" /> at the beginning of the negotiations their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the International Body on Decommissioning. Its proposals on decommissioning also need to be addressed. This obviously is of paramount importance for Sinn Féin, the UDP and the PUP.</P>
    <P>In is appropriate on an occasion such as this to pay tribute to the political leaders of loyalism who ensured that the universal loyalist ceasefire has been maintained.  This has been a true test of leadership and they have come through it strenghtened.  But for them, there could have been a full-scale resumption of violence which would have been extremely difficult to stem.</P>
    <P>We are not yet, of course, out of the woods as far as violence is concerned and nothing can be taken for granted.  If political violence continues, all democratic parties must stand together with a view to achieving sufficient consensus on the important issues we have to address.  The key to progress is a democratic consensus that transcends the division between Nationalist and Unionist, between North and South, between British and Irish.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear.  There is no war between Britain and Ireland.  There is no war between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The cause of division in Northern Ireland is the conflicting national allegiances of the two main communities there.</P>
    <P>This Government, like its predecessors, has put an enormous effort into the work of laying the foundations for a democratic accommodation that will underpin a durable settlement.  We worked with others in this endeavour and, in good faith, accepted Sinn Féin's declarations of peaceful and democratic intent.  Our hopes and trust were &mdash; like those of all parties in this House &mdash; betrayed by the London bombs. However, we were not prepared to deny the hopes of the people of this island, and so we persevered to arrive at this moment of opportunity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> The opportunity now exists for all parties to play a constructive part in reaching an agreement.  Engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender, as President Clinton said on his visit, it is an act of strength and common sense.</P>
    <P>Common sense tells us that flexibility is required if all parties are to succeed in our common endeavour.  Realistically no party is going to get everything it wants, and the sooner all parties reconcile themselves to this reality of politics the more likely we are to reach agreement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there have been some parties more comfortable with posturing than with politics.  Obduracy has been more attractive than the challenge of serious political engagement and argument. Both the politics of grievance and the politics of siege are less demanding that the politics of accommodation, less demanding certainly and most definitely less rewarding for society.</P>
    <P>This is the nature of the challenge at this crucial stage of the peace process. Real courage is called for, the courage to leave the past behind and take a new approach to the future.  A new approach is necessary when we consider that Northern Ireland has been living through the most protracted conflict in modern Irish history.  This has left a mark on society that an 18 month ceasefire could not erase.  Trust has to be established and the hurt and anger acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Today's agreement charts a clear way forward.  A date for all party negotiations has been set.  An elective process is to be designed by the parties themselves.  It is open to Sinn Féin to play a full part in the process once the IRA ceasefire is restored.  With goodwill on all sides, the needs of peace and democracy can surely be met.</P>
    <P>Let us be under no illusion.  We are embarked on a long and difficult journey. There are no short cuts.  Key issues such as consent and self-determination will have to be addressed and, as the experience of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation shows, these will require <Col N="922" /> protracted negotiations if they are to be satisfactorily resolved.  Such issues will have to be addressed with an open mind.  Whatever views parties hold should be open to compromise.  The Irish people cannot forever be imprisoned by history.  The people themselves are no longer prepared to accept the shackles of the past.  They have modest ambitions that are rooted in the here and now.  They have indicated clearly their preference for peace and a democratic settlement.  They want to live in peace with their neighbours. They will not lightly forgive those who would stand in their way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Sunday the people of this country, old and young, signalled massively their demand for peace on this island.  We will all have our memories of Sunday's march.  I remember walking with the 3,500 people in my constituency and the moment of silence we shared.  The image I will treasure is that of a small child, proudly carrying his banner with the simple message, &ldquo;Give us back our Peace&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The importance of today's announcement is that it provides the clearest possible road map to all-party negotiations and to peace.  We will start the negotiations on 10 June.  We want our peace given back to us now.</P>
      <P>The joint communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister today represents a critically important milestone in the developing peace process. It has moved that process forward decisively and has set us on a course that will lead to all-party negotiations on 10 June.  It presents all parties with a challenge but equally offers all parties an opportunity.  It is open to all to play their part in achieving a lasting political settlement which will mean the end of violence once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of today's summit offers the clearest possible demonstration of the continuing commitment of both governments to proceed together in their efforts to achieve a lasting peace and a comprehensive settlement to the <Col N="923" /> Northern Ireland question.  It is, in particular, a tribute to the personal commitment of the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister to the task of securing such a settlement.  I can say that with great sincerity, having been close to the commitment of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others who have worked so closely with the Taoiseach.  It also reflects their joint determination not to be deflected from that task by recent tragic and totally unjustifiable events and not to allow violence or the threat of violence to influence the convening or the course of negotiations.</P>
    <P>Those events, the ending of the PIRA cessation of violence on 9 February and the senseless bomb attack in Canary Wharf that night and later acts of terrorism, put in jeopardy the progress achieved since the historic opportunity opened up by the agreement on the Downing Street Declaration in 1993 and the events of August and October 1994. Those events equally put at risk the gains made in the period since the launch of the twin-track process as a result of the joint communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister on 28 November last.  Much progress had been made in the twin-track process both as a result of the work of the international body, which reported in January and of the intensive efforts of the Government in the preparatory talks aimed at the launch of all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>It would have been possible for either Government, in the aftermath of those events, to have surrendered to the counsel of despair.  Neither Government was prepared to do so because it would have played into the hands of those who see violence as the ultimate answer to the very complex issues underlying the Northern problem &mdash; issues which are intrinsically political and incapable of resolution by violent means.  Neither Government will ever bow to the bomb and the bullet.  It is our duty as a democratic Government to protect the people of this State from terrorism.  We will never fail in our commitment to do so. <Col N="924" /> We would also have represented a betrayal of the hopes and aspirations of the vast majority of the people of these islands who want a future of peace and stability if we had not persisted with our efforts to find peace despite the recent acts of terror in London.</P>
    <P>Both Governments continued with the difficult, but critical, task of seeking a way forward based on democratic principles and in keeping with the twin-track process.  The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister have continued to be involved closely with those efforts.  They reaffirmed those principles of democracy and non-violence today and have moved the process forward.  More than that, they have charted a course which brings the prospects of a comprehensive political settlement significantly closer.</P>
    <P>The course they have set involves three key stages which will pave the way to the convening of all-party negotiations on 10 June.  That date is now fixed.  The three stages involved in the weeks ahead are directed to it.  The date for all-party negotiations is not, however, otherwise dependent on those stages.  It will not, therefore, be possible for any group or party to delay the convening of all-party negotiations on 10 June by seeking to block progress at earlier stages.</P>
    <P>The first of these stages will be a process of intensive multilateral consultations with the relevant Northern Ireland parties, beginning next Monday and continuing over a period of ten days.  Those consultations will have the objective of reaching widespread agreement on: proposals for a broadly acceptable elective process leading directly and without preconditions to all-party negotiations; the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of those negotiations; and will consider holding a referendum in Northern Ireland to mandate support for a process to create lasting stability, based on the repudiation of violence for any political purpose, with provision for a parallel referendum here.</P>
    <P>The second stage in this process will be when the two Governments meet <Col N="925" /> again immediately after the conclusion of the multilateral consultations to review their outcome.  Following that review, the British Government will bring forward legislation on the elective process based on a judgment on what seems most broadly acceptable. Decisions will be taken at that stage on the other matters which are the subject of multilateral consultations including the issue of parallel referendums, North and South, and any necessary legislative measures will also be brought forward for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The third and final stage of that process, following whatever elective process is decided upon, will be the convening of all-party negotiations on 10 June.  Those negotiations will be open to all parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué makes clear that the all-party negotiations will address comprehensively the relevant relationships and issues in an inter-locking three-stranded process.  The Governments have already set out their thinking in that regard in the Framework Document agreed last February. That framework deals comprehensively with the requirements of the three distinct relationships which need to be part of any settlement &mdash; the relationship between the two communities in Northern Ireland, the relationship between both parts of the island of Ireland, and the relationship between the two sovereign Governments.</P>
    <P>The process launched by today's joint communiqué creates a new opportunity and new basis for moving the peace process forward.  The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister have made clear their hope that all parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations.  They have called upon Sinn Féin and the IRA to make Sinn Féin's participation in such negotiations possible.</P>
    <P>It is now a matter for the IRA to decide whether Sinn Féin should participate in the process of negotiation which <Col N="926" /> Sinn Féin has so long sought.  It is equally up to the IRA whether it wishes to create the conditions in which a resumption of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin will be possible.  These are questions which only they can address. Sinn Féin has a critical role in bringing the case for restoration of the ceasefire to the IRA.  We urge it to do so now.  A positive result, in the form of a renewed cessation guarantees Sinn Féin, without further preconditions, passage to dialogue with Ministers, to the consultative process and to all party negotiations.</P>
    <P>By taking that step it will respond to the heartfelt wish of the great majority of people on this island, most eloquently demonstrated last Sunday.</P>
    <P>The reality is that any decision other than one to restore the ceasefire will mean that Sinn Féin will have to be excluded from all-party negotiations directed at a comprehensive political settlement.  The Governments do not want this result.  We want to see Sinn Féin participate fully in all stages of the process from this point.  The Governments have signalled their determination to work in partnership with those parties exclusively committed to peaceful methods to secure a comprehensive negotiated settlement in the absence of the cessation of violence for which they both look.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué clearly, therefore, presents a challenge to Sinn Féin to which I hope they will respond because it offers Sinn Féin a place in the process of seeking a political settlement. That place is available to it and it knows the steps that are now needed if it is to take that place.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué equally presents a challenge to the other political parties in Northern Ireland.  The task being asked of them is to engage with both Governments in finding agreement on a range of issues necessary to the all-party negotiations but on which &mdash; to date &mdash; agreement has not been reached.  Some of them have sought an electoral process.  We are now saying that the question of an elective process and its nature is primarily a matter for <Col N="927" /> the parties in Northern Ireland to determine, but that the Irish Government would support any proposal of that kind which is broadly acceptable to those parties, has an appropriate mandate and is within the three-stranded structure.</P>
    <P>It is obviously desirable that the most widespread possible agreement is reached on the matters which will now be the subject of intensive multilateral consultations in the coming two weeks in accordance with paragraph 10 of the joint communiqué.  The process of multilateral consultations is directed to that objective by providing a means by which agreement can best be reached. The two Governments will, as is made clear in the joint communiqué, work with the parties to ensure that this process of consultation will lead to a fair and acceptable basis for the early launch of substantive all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>The timetable set down for this purpose is deliberately demanding.  I am confident from my experience of the earlier stages of the preparatory talks process that this will not hinder the task of securing widespread agreement on the matters at issue, provided that the parties approach the multilateral consultations with the commitment they deserve.  This is not a time for those parties to step back but to engage with both Governments in the task ahead.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué also proposes that, as a confidence building measure, participants in all party negotiations would need to make clear at the beginning of those discussions their total and absolute commitments to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the international body. That report found widespread acceptance and approval and I would therefore expect that no party should have difficulty in addressing the principles it sets down in a positive fashion.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué also recognises that participants in the all-party negotiations would also need to address the international body's proposals on decommissioning.  That is consistent with the international body's report <Col N="928" /> which recommended that decommissioning should receive a high priority in all-party negotiations.  The whole issue of arms decommissioning has proved to be one of the major impediments to progress up to now for reasons that I do not need to rehearse this evening.  It is manifestly right that it is an issue best left to the parties for discussion as part of the comprehensive all-party negotiations agenda.</P>
    <P>That is what the international body recommended and the communiqué allows.  We expect it to be addressed seriously, but we emphasise that there is no question of a one item agenda.  There is no prospect of longer-term peace and stability in Northern Ireland unless all of the issues that underlie the problem are seriously addressed.  The communiqué recognises this when it states that all parties require reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiation is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué provides, as I have said, an historic opportunity for us to make progress in the peace process. That opportunity demands a response from all sides.  It requires peace if we are to create the conditions for fully inclusive negotiations aimed at a political settlement and the environment in which they can prosper.  It requires openness by all parties to the legitimate concerns and aspirations of other parties. Our hope now must be that all parties will grasp this opportunity and approach it in the spirit it deserves.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue raised by the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The application for the transfer of Patrick Kelly, to whom the Deputy referred, has been returned to the British Home Office for consideration. Approval has been given by the Department of Justice and it is now a matter for the Home Office to approve the transfer.  I hope, in the spirit of today's events, that transfer will be agreed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> I am proud to be associated with the effort to return to the child I saw last Sunday the peace that all of us are looking for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I raise it because of controversy on the issue which was reported in last weekend's newspapers.  The programme for Government states that the Government is committed to the promotion of a vigorous third force in banking and that policy will be directed towards ensuring a major role for the existing State banks and the TSB in any future restructuring.  That commitment appears to have disappeared into oblivion. Every other week there are media reports to the effect that the third banking force is on or the third banking force is off.  The only Government decision following such reports is to initiate a leaks investigation &mdash; the Garda has been requested to interrogate politicians and journalists.</P>
      <P>The latest instalment of this long-running saga came to light last weekend when the Tánaiste was reported to have scuppered the plans of the Government sub-committee.  That report has been denied by the Tánaiste who claimed that the person who leaked the information &mdash; who could only have been a member of the sub-committee and whose identity is, I think, known to all of us &mdash; was being mischievous.  It appears there is a three-way ideological tug within Government in terms of a third banking force.  Fine Gael wants to sell off a majority stake in the TSB, Labour seems to be pressing for a new State-led third banking force while Democratic Left does not want to upset Fine Gael and also does not want an outright sell off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> The chaos and confusion which has existed for the past 12 months cannot continue.  The Government should announce its decision, even if it is that the Cabinet cannot make up its mind and that the <i>status quo</i> will remain for the rest of this administration.  The uncertainty has been damaging to the TSB, ACC and ICC in that management and staff of the companies have been unable to plan for the future.  The private banking sector is also concerned at the stalemate and indecision.  The paralysis on this issue is very damaging to Ireland's reputation both at home and abroad.  My great fear is that in the end a rainbow mixum-gatherum decision will be made which will be bad for all the institutions involved.  I call on the Minister to tell the House what exactly the Government plans to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1994 consultants were appointed by my predecessor to identify the various options available to the Government in respect of ACC Bank, ICC Bank and the TSB.  The consultants completed their report in October 1994 and presented it to the Department.  On the basis of this study, proposals were prepared for the Government which set out a particular view on the way forward. When I took up office as Minister for Finance in December 1994 I was advised of this position.  I examined the papers on the matter and concluded that the contextual framework for the study was deficient.</P>
      <P>The sum of the considerations, particularly the role of the credit unions who are now a major player in the financial sector for a large number of our people, and the ongoing role of An Post, which reaches out to an enormous number of people who would otherwise have no connection with the banking sector, was not in any way seriously addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial sector in general in Ireland is currently going through a period of change.  The demarcation line between banks and building societies is becoming blurred.  Competition is increasing, putting pressure on costs. <Col N="931" /> Together with advancing technology, this will require the sector to commit large sums to investment.  In recent times An Post has made huge advances in retail services.  It has also invested heavily in information technology and the automation of its counter services. The credit unions have also made huge strides in the past few years, including the extensive introduction of information technology systems and major expansion of its community-based branch network.</P>
    <P>These major and ongoing changes in the nature of the market in personal banking services were given insufficient weight in the proposals presented to me when I took over the portfolio.  For the most part, consideration was limited solely to the commercial banks within the State sector.  I was therefore, disappointed that matters had not proceeded further and that the broader framework had not been sufficiently addressed. When I took over the portfolio a major amount of work remained to be completed before any serious consideration of the available options could commence. To this end, I met a wide range of interested parties, including representatives of the boards and staff of all the State banks and senior management in those banks which have expressed an interest in participating in any proposed restructuring of the various institutions.</P>
    <P>Throughout the life of this Government, the issue of the future structure of the State banking sector, including TSB Bank, has been under continuous consideration. The Government wishes to facilitate the State banks so that they can maximise their impact on economic development as well as their own business success.  I am happy to say that all banks, including TSB, ICC and ACC, are reporting record profits and performance.</P>
    <P>The wider role of An Post and the credit unions was also considered in this context.  The options for restructuring <Col N="932" /> the State banks continue to be examined by myself and a number of Government colleagues with a view to identifying the most effective solution having regard to the nature of the individual institutions, their particular customer markets, the needs of the whole community in its broadest sense and most importantly development in the EU.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this matter has been under consideration for some time. However the issue of how one might best restructure the banks in order to achieve our objective in relation to the creation of a vibrant and competitive banking market is a complex one.</P>
    <P>Also, if the matters I referred to earlier had been taken on board when the initial consideration was taking place, we might be further down the road at this stage.  I know that the need for detailed consideration is understood and appreciated by all those involved and I am assured that they are continuing to compete profitably in their chosen marketplace taking full advantage of the opportunities presented by the current economic climate.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me at this stage to make detailed statements about what may or may not happen until the matter has been resolved by Government.  Nor am I prepared to comment on media speculation on what may or may not transpire in relation to the restructuring of the State banks.  However, I recognise that this process has been taking place for some time.  I am very keenly aware of the need to ensure that employees and management in the institutions concerned should not be adversely affected by uncertainty regarding the eventual outcome.</P>
    <P>This is why I have been available at all times to those most closely involved and have had numerous meetings with all the participants.  My door has always been, and continues to be, open to them.</P>
    <P>This Government would, rightly, be attacked as irresponsible if it abused its position in the financial sector in any way.  Therefore, I have approached this issue in a careful and constructive way. <Col N="933" /> It would be remiss of me not to take into account all the possible scenarios before arriving at a recommendation which can be put to the Government. However, the Government is very much at one on the overall objective, to arrive at the solution which best addresses the interests of all.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the creation of a strong and vibrant banking market.  The issue of how to achieve this is complex and difficult.  I refuse to be rushed into recommending a particular solution to it.  Getting it right must be the priority.</P>

I compliment the Minister for Justice on her recent announcement that a new Garda station will be built in Blanchardstown &mdash; there is nothing like a hanging to focus the mind.  That decision was as a result of the local gardaí taking the unusual step of seeking a meeting with their local Deputies.  Gardaí do not get involved in politics, they stay well away from politicians as they go about their business. However, the frustration of the gardaí in Blanchardstown led to them taking this unusual step of approaching their local Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Ministers of State, Deputies Currie and Burton, Senator McGennis and other public representatives attended that meeting.  The decision to provide a new Garda station was taken when local gardaí proposed not to report for duty in the station on 1 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement to build a new station was welcomed.  I met some of the gardaí concerned and informed them of the decision.  I communicated with the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works on this matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Currie should ensure that the gardaí who postponed their protest to May pending progress on the building of that station, <Col N="934" /> will have their appeal listened to.  I hope he can confirm that the sketch drawings, which the Department of Justice recently promised to supply to the Garda representative body, will be available in April, that detailed architects' drawings will be completed by the end of May, that tender documentation will be circulated and tenders sought by June or July and that a contract will be placed in September to enable work commence on the construction of this urgently needed facility in the second half of 1996.</P>
    <P>The condition of the local station is deplorable.  The station does not adequately meet the needs of the 50,000 to 70,000 population in the greater Blanchardstown area.  It consists of an old private house in the main street which accommodated ten to 20 gardaí many years ago, but many more gardaí are based there.  Local gardaí whom I met last Monday told me there is talk of the Office of Public Works locating a social welfare office on the restricted site selected for the new station.  They told me that section 41 of the relevant legislation provides for the allocation of a substantial car park compound.  I hope the Office of Public Works does not intend to locate a social welfare office there on the cheap.  It would be undesirable to locate such a public office alongside the new Garda station and that site would not be suitable for it.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, had the honour of representing Dublin West the Garda station in Lucan was renovated and a Garda station was provided in Ronanstown.  Adequate facilities have not been provided for Garda stations in the greater metropolitan area.  I appreciate that the Garda Commissioner must have priorities, but some elaborate Garda stations have been built elsewhere which serve smaller catchment areas than Blanchardstown. The gardaí in Blanchardstown want work to commence on the new station in the second half of this year.  Local gardaí in Clondalkin have also considered not reporting for duty to their station.  Gardaí investigating the <Col N="935" /> murder of Marlyn Rynn in Blanchardstown have to use the incident room in Cabra Garda station as the one in Blanchardstown Garda station is not suitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address the concerns of the gardaí in Blanchardstown so that they will not have to take action in May.  The schedule I outlined for the construction of the new station should be put into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to record progress on the provision of a new district headquarters in Blanchardstown.  The Minister and I fully accept that the existing Garda station in Blanchardstown is totally inadequate for the policing needs of this developing area and has been for a long time.  I can assure the Deputy that a very high priority is being afforded to the provision of a new station and that the project is progressing without delay. It is a matter of public record that the decision taken, and publicly announced by the Minister for Justice and myself, was made well in advance of the meeting in Blanchardstown to which Deputy Lawlor referred.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between the Office of Public Works, whose responsibility it is to procure a site and build a new station, and Fingal County Council are at an advanced stage with a view to acquiring the site at the corner of the main street and Corduff Lane, known locally as &ldquo;the Clonmel site&rdquo;, for the erection of the new station.  These negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily and no difficulties with the acquisition of the site are envisaged despite the many rumours to the contrary which have, for whatever reason, been circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor I have any reason to believe or suspect there will be any problem in acquiring this site. The Office of Public Works expect to conclude an agreement on price with Fingal County Council very shortly. While the site in question is part of property which is the subject of transfer <Col N="936" /> from Dublin Corporation to Fingal County Council, the Minister is assured this will not present any problems.  In other words, once price is agreed and the necessary legal formalities in relation to title are completed the site will be acquired.</P>
    <P>The local station party has been kept informed of progress and is aware that this project is being progressed as a matter of priority.  It appreciates that it will take some further time to complete all the legal formalities of site acquisition and has postponed its threatened walkout. In this regard, I take this opportunity on the Minister's behalf and on my behalf to thank the gardaí serving in Blanchardstown for their patience and co-operation and reasoned approach in this matter.  They have tolerated conditions for many years which should not have been imposed on them or the local community they serve.</P>
    <P>In the meantime steps are being taken to make conditions a bit more tolerable. For example, I understand that a portacabin was delivered to the station last Monday which will help to alleviate the accommodation problem being experienced.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is being allowed full access to the site and, concurrently with the site negotiations, planning of the new station is proceeding. A detailed brief of requirements, which was drawn up following consultation between officials of the Department of Justice and the Garda, has been forwarded to the Office of Public Works.  It is now a matter for the Office of Public Works to prepare detailed drawings and agree these with my Department and the Garda.  When this is done the Office of Public Works will immediately undertake the necessary planning consultation and prepare tender documents.  Work has been proceeding and the Minister fully expects construction of the new station to begin before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The need for a new station at Blanchardstown was evident long before the Minister took office.  However the Minister Deputy Owen immediately made it <Col N="937" /> one of her priorities to get something done about it.  She put in motion the search for and acquisition of a suitable site, the preparation of plans for the new building and the earmarking of the necessary funds.  I am happy the project is now well under way and there will not be avoidable delay in providing the gardaí and people of Blanchardstown with their much needed new station.</P>
    <P>As a Minister of State at the Department of Justice who represents a large part of the area served by the Blanchardstown station, I am pleased that this development is taking place during my term of office.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can rest assured I will continue to do all I can to ensure the new station will be provided at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of raising this tragic matter on the Adjournment this evening.  To date it would appear I am having more success than the Department of the Marine in having the vessel raised.</P>
      <P>I am very disturbed at the manner in which the Department has handled this tragic affair, and particularly by the insensitivity of the Minister and his Department to the suffering and grieving of the families involved.  I know the fathers of the two missing seamen.  I spent some time with one of the families missing a son and their only remaining hope is that his body is trapped on board that vessel under water.  They want it retrieved and buried and to put this awful tradedy behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to raise this matter but I have made several attempts to contact the Minister over the past week or so, all to no avail.  I have been left with no alternative but to endeavour to get some answers here about the inept performance of everyone concerned with this sorry mess.  Having chased the Minister for a number of days I was told eventually by his <Col N="938" /> Department's press office that the contract to lift the vessel had been awarded to a Dundalk company, and operations would commence on Saturday last, four days ago.  Yet to date there has been no sign of anybody and perhaps there will not be.</P>
    <P>Prior to my conversation with that departmental press office I had been informed by our marine emergency services that, in selecting a company to carry our this operation, availability would be a major factor and a decision would not be taken based on cost alone. Somebody somewhere has made a big mistake.  The closing date for tenders was 20 February.  It is reasonable to assume &mdash; because of the urgency involved &mdash; the contract was awarded on 21 February, almost eight days ago.</P>
    <P>Why did it take so long in the first place for the Department to seek tenders? Why has the Minister prolonged the agony not alone of those families but of the entire community in Dunmore East?  I do not want to hear any lame excuses this evening about bad weather, breakdowns or the like.  It want positive action to alleviate suffering and distress.</P>
    <P>I am informed there is an operator in Waterford city who could undertake this task quite easily or, alternatively, some of the larger trawlers in Dunmore East.  I plead with the Minister to give the go-ahead immediately to somebody to carry out this operation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him not to insist on the <i>Jenalisa</i> being returned to Dunmore East, as has been suggested, there being many other places to which it can be brought.  The people of Dunmore East have suffered enough.  They do not want to see this vessel again.  It is merely a reminder of this awful tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I support the comments of my party colleague from Waterford.  As the Minister will be aware, the fishermen in the south-east are a very close-knit community and are extremely perturbed and annoyed at the continuing delay in having the <i>Jenalisa</i> salvaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> The families of the lost fishermen and others involved want to know why there are so many excuses for the continuing delay from the Department of the Marine. The <i>Jenalisa</i> was located by a joint Navy-Garda sub-aqua team on 8 February. Twenty days later &mdash; despite repeated promises by the Department &mdash; no action has been taken to raise the vessel.</P>
    <P>Relatives of Niall Power and Peter Nolan are very anxious that the vessel be raised as speedily as possible in the hope of finding their bodies on board. This delay is causing their families much distress and anxiety.  In addition, the people of Dunmore East had been promised a salvage vessel would arrive there on Saturday last to commence raising operations, but it did not arrive. Will the Minister explain what happened and why these operations were not initiated?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister investigate other options immediately, such as the return of the Navy team to undertake the raising of the <i>Jenalisa</i>?  I understand it has the requisite expertise and powers to undertake this task.  Will he respond immediately to the calls of the people of Dunmore East?  The families of the missing men and others have suffered enough already through the loss of three loved ones without being subjected to the ordeal of wondering whether the two remaining bodies are on board.  I know the Minister has taken a personal interest in the matter but I appeal to him to put all hands on deck immediately to ensure this vessel is raised forthwith to allay the stress and fears of the families of the missing men and the local community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware the fishing vessel <i>Jenalisa</i> was lost off Brownstown Head on 4 February 1996, the body of one fisherman having been recovered by another fishing vessel on that day.  The other two crew members are missing, <Col N="940" /> presumed dead.  There is a strong likelihood they were trapped below decks when the vessel was lost.</P>
      <P>First, I extend my most sincere sympathy to the families of the three lost fishermen.  I am particularly conscious of the anguish of the relatives of the two fishermen whose bodies have not yet been recovered.  I assure the House I will do everything within my power to bring this period of pain for them to a close as soon as is humanly possible.  We also need to recall the continuing pain of the relatives of the six fishermen lost in the <i>Carrickatine</i>, which was not found in spite of the most extensive sea and subsurface search ever carried out by our marine emergency services.</P>
      <P>I would like to recount for the House the sequence of events since the loss of the <i>Jenalisa</i> on 4 February.  The families of the two lost fishermen deserve a full account of the activities of the emergency and investigatory services to date and the plans for the future.  I hope that my statement will reassure all concerned that the matter is being pursued with due expedition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vessel was reported lost on 4 February and was located on the seabed on 8 February.  In the meantime there was an intensive search for bodies using Irish marine emergency service coastal units lifeboats and other fishing vessels. The <i>Jenalisa</i> was located on the seabed three miles south west of Brownstown Head on 8 of February.  Naval Service divers, under the direction of the marine emergency service, began an immediate search for the bodies in the vicinity of the vessel.  In the meantime the surface and shore search for bodies continued, as there was no certainty that the bodies were trapped on board the vessel.  The underwater search was severely hampered by bad weather and other dangerous conditions, particularly the fishing nets which lay around the vessel and were a particular hazard for divers operating in very constrained visibility. While the primary purpose of the underwater search was to retrieve any bodies which might have been trapped <Col N="941" /> in or near the vessel, a secondary objective was to examine the state and condition of the vessel with a view to ascertaining the cause of its loss.  In addition to on site examination by Naval Service divers, video recording of the hull and other sections of the vessel were made at the direction of the marine surveyor I appointed to carry out the official investigation into the loss of the vessel.</P>
    <P>In view of the failure of the diving parties to penetrate sections of the vessel where, it was considered, the bodies might be trapped and the recommendation to me on 16 February by the marine surveyor that the vessel be raised, I immediately directed that tenders be sought to raise the vessel.  The specification of the tender, in terms of the method by which the vessel would be raised, the location of delivery etc. were agreed with the investigating marine surveyor and the tenders issued the same day I approved that action.  The investigating marine surveyor is a statutory officer.  Tenders for the salvage operation were received on 20 February, were reviewed in my Department, in consultation with the investigating surveyor, and a contract was placed on the next day, 21 February 1996.  Urgent clearance was also sought and obtained from the Government contracts committee prior to the placing of the contract with North East Diving Services Ltd.</P>
    <P>The terms of the agreement with the contractor were for the salvage vessel to arrive on 24 February but weather and technical difficulties delayed its arrival. It was originally expected to arrive in Dunmore East on Saturday, 24 February, then on the following Monday; it emerged later that further difficulties, including insurance problems meant that the salvage vessel would not be on site until well into the week beginning 4 March 1996.  Officials of my Department reviewed the position with the contractor today.  It was made clear that, in view of these delays, the terms of the agreement had been breached and that there was no option but to regard the agreement as terminated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I am advised that alternative arrangements have now been made with the firm objective of commencing salvage operations by Sunday next 3 March, weather permitting.</P>

      <P>I presume the <Col N="728" /> Deputy is referring to public sector construction contracts.</P>
      <P>While the conditions attaching to public contracts are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, I understand that imposing a requirement of the type suggested by the Deputy on a general basis would give rise to difficulties.  These would relate firstly to increasing costs and, secondly, to our obligations, particularly in relation to EU-funded projects, to award contracts in accordance with the EU provisions.</P>
      <P>Taking due account of the above factors, it is open to contracting authorities, in appropriate individual cases, to consider arrangements to encourage the recruitment of local labour.</P>

Activity under the programme is delivered by FÁS, the Department of Education, the National Rehabilitation Board and the Department of Justice.</P>

    <P>My Department is also responsible for the administration of the Human Resources Community Initiatives &mdash; EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT &mdash; which address issues or problems of particular target groups in an innovative fashion involving the expertise which exists at local level.  The total EU budget available to these initiatives in the period 1995-99 is approximately £85 million &mdash; representing an intervention rate of 75 per cent of total eligible costs. Projects are approved on the basis of their ability to meet the criteria for the Initiatives set by the European Commission and, while the location of projects is considered, it is not a determining factor in approving them.  The outcome of the selection procedures under these initiatives is currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>The Small Business Operational Programme has a total value of IR£53.317 million, of which IR£23.213 million is EU funded.  The programme does not have a separate allocation for the southern Border counties.  Measure 1 of the operational programme provides the funding to subsidise the access to finance scheme.  Based on draw down of loans in the southern Border counties the cost of subsidising southern Border county loans under the scheme is estimated as follows.</P>

    <P>County Enterprise Boards</P>
    <P>Total expenditure in the five southern Border counties was £832,299 in 1994 and £2,478,759 in 1995.  The 1994 expenditure was met in full from Exchequer resources, while that provided in 1995 will be significantly supported from EU funds.  Because of the administrative procedures which govern the operational programme which provides funding to the county enterprise boards, the precise level of EU assistance available to them in 1995 cannot yet be definitively established.  It will, however, be of the order of 75 per cent of eligible expenditure.</P>
    <P>No additional funds were made available to the boards in 1995 as a direct result of the peace process.  However, all the Border boards have been acutely aware of the possibilities of the peace process for development and renewal of the Border area in general and of the funding possibilities available under other programmes to support initiatives aimed at improving the economic and social environment in their areas.</P>

    <P>The programme aims at improving cross-Border co-operation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Projects under this initiative are currently being assessed by a North/South Working Group and decisions on applications will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Wider Horizons Project</P>
    <P>A sum of £3.5 million was received from the International Fund for Ireland for the Wider Horizons Project in 1994; a total of £5 million was received for 1995 and an additional £3 million has been approved for 1996.  Approximately one-third of this funding has been made available to the southern border counties. The British and Irish Exchequer and other sources provide matching funding, amounting to approximately 40 per cent of the total cost.</P>
    <P>The Wider Horizons Project is a programme funded by the International Fund for Ireland, and administered by FÁS.  Its objective is to foster mutual <Col N="734" /> understanding and reconciliation and to promote economic and social advance through vocational preparation, training and development and work experience provision for young people.</P>
    <P>Priority is given to projects which address the issue of social exclusion in relation to the labour market.  The wide range of projects supported to date has assisted up to 60 per cent of the participants to find full-time or part-time employment.</P>

    <P>No additional funds have been available to the RETEX Operational Programme in foot of the peace process.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this programme is to help support the acceleration of economic activities in regions heavily dependent on the textile and clothing sector.</P>
    <P>Initiatives which involve Forbairt are also relevant in the context of the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>The Northern American Partnership Programme</P>
    <P>This is a joint International Fund for Ireland (IFI) and Forbairt initiative.  It is designed to facilitate the formation of strategic alliances between companies located in the Border counties and compatible US-based operations.  The programme is focused primarily on companies operating in the international services and high technology manufacturing sectors.  Forbairt has the lead role in managing the programme which is jointly funded by the International Fund <Col N="735" /> and Forbairt with the International Fund contributing £300,000 over a two year period, commencing spring 1995. Substantial progress has been achieved with the eight companies included in phase one of the programme.</P>
    <P>The American Management and Business Internship Training Programme</P>
    <P>This provides support for managers and technical experts from Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The programme, launched at the Washington Conference, is sponsored by the US Department of Commerce in collaboration with the International Fund for Ireland and is administered at regional level by Forbairt in the Border counties and by the Training and Employment Agency in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ambit</P>
    <P>This is designed to offer hands-on training in US host firms for managers and technical experts with the objective of giving such key personnel access to new technology, product development opportunities and best management practices.  It also encourages the formation of inter-company strategic alliances.  A number of companies from the Border counties are currently participating in the programme, and already a number of strategic alliances between Irish and US companies are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland has committed some $425,000 to date, the US Department of Commerce $85,000 plus staff resources, while Forbairt and the Training and Employment Agency have expended modest amounts towards the promotion and administration of the programme.  It is anticipated that some ten companies each year located in the Border counties will participate in the programme over the next three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pursuing a two-pronged approach to the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In regard to job-creation, the 35 city and county enterprise boards were set up in late 1993 to promote local development in all areas, including areas of high unemployment.  They were established to fill a gap in the support services provided by the State industrial development agencies and have clear enterprise and job-creation objectives.</P>
      <P>Over £20 million has been provided in grants by the 35 CEBs since their establishment, resulting in the creation of over 4,000 full-time and 1,000 part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>Also, it is essential that action be taken to assist those unemployed persons in the areas concerned, and particularly the long-term unemployed, to compete successfully for jobs created in their own areas.  The Local Employment Service will address this task in 14 areas with particular needs arising from unemployment.  By adopting a more integrated system for improving the employability of the long-term unemployed, combined with a strengthening of the links between local employers and placement services, I believe that the Local Employment Service will provide a valuable contribution to the particular needs of the areas in question.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware of the area partnerships which will have as part of their goals, the improvement of opportunities for those seeking work, particularly the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995 shall enter into force on 1 May 1996.</P>
      <P>Part XII of the Act shall confer extensive powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to the regulation of customer charges by credit institutions.  Such charges have been, and, for the present, continue to be, regulated by the Central Bank.  I should say, however, that no increases in existing money transmission charges have been permitted over the last two years. In the case of new charges, the introduction of such charges have been permitted only after discussion with the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>The relevant section of the Consumer Credit Act giving new powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs provides that:</P>
      <P>(a)  Any or all proposals to increase existing charges must be notified four months in advance to the director.</P>
      <P>(b)  Every such notification shall be accompanied by a fee, the amount of which the director shall determine and may be as much as £25,000 per notification;</P>
      <P>(c)  Every such notification shall also be accompanied by a statement of the commercial justification of the proposal, including a detailed statement of cost and details of the extra annual income accruing from the proposal;</P>
      <P>(d)  Within the four month period the director may direct the credit institution to refrain from implementing the proposed increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of proposed new customer <Col N="738" /> charges the same procedure shall apply, save that the prior period of notification and response by the director shall be three weeks.</P>
    <P>In exercising his powers under Part XII of the Act, the director shall have regard to the promotion of competition; the proposed commercial justification adduced; the capacity of the credit institution to avoid the passing on of any costs to its customers, and the effect on customers or group of customers of any proposed increase in existing charges or the introduction of a new charge.</P>

      <P>A strategy document on the services sector is at an advanced stage of preparation. This document will review the impact and growth of the services sector on the structure of production and employment in the Irish Economy and will examine the factors which affect the growth and development of services.

This strategy is currently being finalised within my Department, in consultation with the industrial development agencies, and I plan to have it published in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the United Kingdom Employment Policy Institute report that stated that training is an expensive way of doing little about unemployment and has no measurable impact on economic growth or productivity.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18430/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the UK Employment Policy Institute Report of November 1995, which comprises an Article by J.R. Shackleton, University of Westminster, entitled &ldquo;The Skills Mirage&rdquo;, a copy of which I have seen.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to point out that this study is intended as a contribution to a policy debate, not here in Ireland, but in the United Kingdom, and refers to United Kingdom experiences and policies.  Secondly, there is a difficulty in dealing with questions of the type posed by the Deputy, which run the obvious risk of selectivity and over-generalisation.</P>
      <P>While there is much in the Shackleton Article which I find thought provoking I have to say, however, that there is ample evidence to suggest that meaningful training has an important role to play in Government strategy to reduce unemployment, particularly when it is complemented by other employment generating measures.  Other support measures are also important &mdash; such as the development of the Local Employment Service which aims to facilitate the re-integration of the unemployed into the labour market.  The Government has also adopted a number of employment measures in the areas of welfare, tax reform, public sector investment in job creation and wage subsidies to employers to recruit unemployed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second issue raised by Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash; that training has no measurable impact on the economic growth of productivity &mdash; the Shackleton article does recognise the existence of wide-ranging research suggesting a link between overall skill levels and the performance of the economy.  He does <Col N="740" /> not refute this evidence, he merely suggests that there may be alternative explanations for some of the research findings, and that some claims made for the benefits of education and training may therefore be exaggerated.  In this country, however, a whole succession of reports, including those by Culliton and NESC, highlight the strong link between capability enhancement in industry and improved competitiveness. Personally, I have no doubt whatever that increased investment in higher skill levels in Irish business and industry is vital to the maintenance of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I am now in the final stages of preparing a White Paper on Human Resource Development, which will detail the Government's training policy, not only for the unemployed, but those at work and early school leavers.  The paper will obviously deal in more depth with the issues the Deputy has raised and, of course, many others also.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 81 on Thursday, 25 January 1996, Volume 460, No. 5, columns 1395-6.</P>
      <P>I would also say that the publication of this Bill at the earliest possible date is a high priority with me.  It is a priority because of the importance of the credit union movement in our society.  The movement is all-Ireland with more than 500 individual credit unions, four-fifths of them in the Republic.  Total membership is in the order of one and three-quarter million people and membership in recent years has been growing at around 10 per cent per annum on average. The credit unions' combined loan book in 1994 was estimated at £1.3 billion and lending was growing at something in the order of 20 per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>All of this has been achieved by a movement based on notions of voluntarism, the common bond, community, and self-help.  It is a movement that has created a very significant financial services organisation that commands the loyalty of its members, delivers service and value and does all of this outside the framework of private ownership and the profit motive.  I value all of this and what is has contributed to local, family, personal and social development on this island, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement is now well-placed to grow in significance and to add enormously to the range of services it provides to its members.  This will provide strong competition for the privately <Col N="742" /> owned for-profit credit institutions in particular segments of financial services. This is all for the good of our society and economy.</P>
    <P>However, if all of this is to happen, the legal framework, the supervisory and regulatory regime within which the movement operates will need significant updating.  That is the purpose of the Bill now in preparation.  I see this Bill as a radical measure.  It will consolidate and update legislation, and it will provide the framework for the expansion of the credit unions into new areas of service to their members.  That is why I attach such high priority to the completion of the drafting of the Bill and I look forward to introducing the Bill to this House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the cost of motor cover for young drivers I should point out that the level of premiums charged to young drivers tends to reflect insurers' claims experience of such drivers as a high risk category and the relatively small number of companies offering this type of insurance is also a clear indication of the high risk nature of this type of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reduction in motor insurance premium rates have been announced recently by the Guardian Group of up <Col N="743" /> to 10 per cent in their motor insurance premium rates for new and existing customers and these have been widely reported on in the media.  Premier Direct Insurance also have followed this encouraging course by announcing motor insurance premium rate reductions of up to 14 per cent in certain cases.  I would like to take this opportunity of welcoming the reductions by Guardian and Direct Insurance and I hope that other insurers will now follow suit in setting their motor insurance premiums at suitably competitive levels.</P>
    <P>I view these rate reductions as a vindication of the efforts of the gardaí in their continued enforcement of road traffic legislation and in the implementation of drink driving and other measures.  It is my belief that the reductions should also be perceived as a material reward to motorists for their improved levels of safety and vigilance.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I have commissioned a report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland and of the key factors contributing to the cost of insurance in Ireland.  The consultants have been asked, <i>inter alia</i>, to evaluate the economic impact of private motor insurance costs as a separate aspect of the consultancy study, having regard to the relatively high cost of motor insurance for young drivers, and to recommend appropriate measures based on their analysis of the problem. I am awaiting finalisation of that report by the consultants.</P>

      <P>The Commission President, in the course of addressing the European Parliament on 31 January, spoke of inviting &ldquo;all the Union's political, economic and social forces... to unite in concluding a European Confidence Pack on Employment&rdquo;.  The indications from his speech are that he is seeking a reinvigoration of commitment towards the range of policies already mapped out, including the single currency process, the development of trans-European networks, more research, a strengthened commitment to the development of SME's, and enhanced labour market structural policies. I certainly welcome this initiative from the Commission President with particular reference to its emphasis on the role and importance of small and medium size enterprises, research and local employment initiatives.</P>
      <P>While the focus of the President's initiative is clearly a confidence boosting one, the specifics of what may be intended have not yet emerged. However, I welcome the President's declared intention to undertake a tour of capitals in order to tackle with Heads of State and Government the practical means of achieving true synergy of initiatives taken separately in member states to promote employment and reduce unemployment.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many factors which through their interaction constitute the economy of any State, and determine the overall competitiveness of one economy as compared to another.  However, because these various factors operate to differing levels of performance or efficiency, it is not possible to compare the absolute competitiveness of our economic <i>vis-à-vis</i> the economy of Northern Ireland.  For the purposes of addressing the Deputy's question I propose discussing some of the more significant issues which contribute to the State's economic performance, and consider how these individual factors affect the competitiveness of this economy as compared with the economy of the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance of any economy and <Col N="746" /> its competitiveness with the economies of other trading partners will, amongst other issues, reflect the influence of the following factors;</P>
    <P>Unemployment/Employment rates.</P>
    <P>Taxation policy.</P>
    <P>Productivity of labour and capital.</P>
    <P>New investment in the economy.</P>
    <P>Monetary policy and exchange rate movements.</P>
    <P>Public spending policies.</P>
    <P>Cost competitiveness of industrial inputs.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure quality particularly transport and communications.</P>
    <P>Education and skills of workforce.</P>
    <P>Inflation rates.</P>
    <P>I would comment briefly on some of the above factors as follows.</P>
    <P>Labour costs are a very important component in the competitiveness of any economy and as representing the market price for labour in any economy they reflect unemployment levels, skills or otherwise of the workforce and other influences.  In this context average manufacturing labour rates in this State compare reasonably favourably with similar rates in the UK as a whole. However, the more difficult economic climate in the North of Ireland relative to the UK generally results in lower labour rates in some industrial sectors in the North of Ireland as compared with the UK overall.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 up to 1994 hourly wage rate movements for the overall business sector in this State have been lower than corresponding UK wage rate movements when compared in terms of national currencies.  Partly due to the weakness of sterling during this period this hourly wage rate movement expressed in common currency terms indicates a somewhat lower rate of increase in UK hourly wage rates relative to the Irish position.  In terms of unit labour costs, however, a comparison of Irish manufacturing industry rates with corresponding UK rates indicates that while this country has recorded a slight reduction in unit labour costs since 1990, corresponding UK <Col N="747" /> unit labour costs have increased.  While overall UK labour costs do not necessarily reflect the precise situation in individual geographic regions such as the North of Ireland, the above data are likely to reflect the broad trend of labour rate movements in the North of Ireland also.  Despite the above favourable unit labour cost performance of this country during the period 1990-94, I am conscious of differences in performance of individual industrial sectors from the overall pattern, and I am particularly aware of the competitive difficulties of some of our more labour intensive indigenous sectors in competing with UK and North of Ireland based competition.</P>
    <P>In terms of overall cost increases, Ireland's record on inflation, assisted significantly by wage moderation over the past number of years, continues to be satisfactory.  Our annual rate of inflation has been below the EU average rate and that of the UK every year since 1989 up to end 1994.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness of the North of Ireland relative to this State is also influenced by the substantial funding transfers which the British Government provides for the North of Ireland economy particularly in regard to transport infrastructure facilities.  Notwithstanding the above this State has in recent years also benefited substantially from major investment to our principal road networks and our transport infrastructure generally, consequently significantly improving the competitiveness of transport costs for industry.  Similarly in recent years substantial investment in telecommunications infrastructure in this State has resulted in one of the most effective telecommunications systems in Europe which of itself is a major competitive advantage, particularly in the context of its ability to attract high-tech industry and services, as evidenced by a strong electronics industry sector here and a successful and growing international financial services industry.</P>
    <P>In terms of taxation policy, this country has for many years adopted a policy <Col N="748" /> of assisting industry's competitiveness through the provision of a 10 per cent corporate tax rate for manufacturing industries and international services. This year's budget introduced a low rate of 30 per cent corporate tax on the first £50,000 taxable profits for non manufacturing activity.  The 10 per cent rate of corporate tax for manufacturing industry represents a considerable competitive advantage for manufacturing firms in this State relative to the North of Ireland.  In the past three budgets substantial improvements have been made to the employer's PRSI contribution structure with a view to increasing the competitiveness of industry in this State, particularly in regard to UK and North of Ireland based industry.</P>
    <P>Besides the 10 per cent rate of corporate tax one of the most highly regarded competitive attractions for overseas investors in this State is the high level of skill and training of our workforce, and the high percentage of graduates from third level educational institutes relative to the total of new entrants on to the workforce each year.  Further substantial progress on improving infrastructural facilities and training of our workforce will be facilitated by the substantial funding assistance provided by the EU through the Operational Programme for Industry over the remaining years of this decade.  Consequently in a number of key economic areas I believe that this State is more competitive than the economy of Northern Ireland, while in other areas I believe we are making rapid progress in closing whatever gaps in competitiveness may exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Government's policy is to promote enterprise, reward those in work and encourage those seeking work.  The recent budget contained a considerable number of new measures to advance these objectives. The general direction of such measures will be continued in order to further improve the employment response of the labour market.</P>
    <P>In the light of the above analysis.  I can see no real basis for the suggestion, <Col N="749" /> in the second part of the Deputy's question, that employment policies here are hampering, in any way, the creation of a single-island economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years it has been the policy of the Department of Enterprise and Employment and IDA Ireland to encourage private developers to provide advance factory space for promotion by IDA Ireland.  In locations where advance factories are required, IDA Ireland will in certain circumstances offer rent guarantees of up to two years to developers and will make sites for advance factories available on IDA Ireland industrial estates. This policy is consistent with recommendations of two separate reviews of the property portfolio, by Forfás prior to the transfer of the portfolio to IDA Ireland at the start of this year, and by the evaluation unit attached to my Department.</P>
      <P>There are, therefore, no plans for IDA Ireland to change that policy.  Supply and demand for factory space is, however, kept under continuous review with the objective of ensuring that industrial development is fully facilitated.</P>

      <P>The safety of electrical equipment is governed in Ireland, as it is in other EU member states, by the Low Voltage Directive (LVD) 73/23/EEC.  This directive applies to electrical equipment with a voltage rating of between 50 and 1,000 volts for alternating current and between 75 and 1,500 volts for direct current.  Sunbeds used in the home and in health/tanning salons fall into this category. The directive provides that electrical equipment may not be placed on the market if it poses a safety risk when used for the purpose for which it is intended.</P>
      <P>Under the directive it is primarily the responsibility of traders to ensure that electrical equipment placed on the market is safe and fully satisfies the relevant safety standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive is implemented in <Col N="752" /> national law by the Low Voltage Regulations (SI Nos. 428 of 1992 and 307 of 1994).  These Regulations provide the Director of Consumer Affairs with powers of enforcement and allow for the appointment of authorised officers to carry out inspections on equipment. Inspectors from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs carry out checks on electrical products on sale in Ireland to ensure that they conform to the safety objectives of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Arising from a recent tragic case which was widely reported in the national press, the Director of Consumer Affairs is having a particular type of sunbed examined and that examination is ongoing.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Health, is examining the possibility of publishing a code of practice for the safe use of sunbeds. Officials of my Department will give advice and assistance in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing double taxation convention between Ireland and the United States, which has been in existence for over 40 years, does not contain any specific provisions relating to the taxation of social security payments. However, the question of US withholding tax on social security payments is being reviewed in the context of the current renegotiation of the Ireland-United States Double Taxation Convention.  In the meantime, under the provisions of the existing convention, credit for the tax deducted by the US tax authorities <Col N="759" /> is allowed against Irish tax on the same income.</P>
    <P>The effect of the inclusion of a provision in double taxation conventions with the US exempting US social security payments from tax in the US is to transfer the taxing rights over these payments to the country of residence of the recipient.  The conventions do not exempt the payments from tax in these countries.  Tax would be payable at the normal rates in the countries in question.</P>

While the Government is monitoring all aspects relating to Ireland's position as a beneficiary of Structural Funds after 1999, it would not be appropriate to speculate, at this time, on what the likely outcome of the Structural Funds negotiations for the post-1999 period will be.  Nonetheless, it can be taken that Ireland will continue to benefit from Structural Funds after 1999.

      <P>Under Section 20 of the Finance Act (No. 2), 1992, liability for licensing (i.e. road tax) on every motor vehicle, either new or second-hand, arises from the time of first registration in the State. However, section 117 of the Finance Act, 1995, provides that where there is a prolonged delay between the first registration of a vehicle and subsequent <Col N="763" /> licensing, the vehicle licence shall be effective from the beginning of the month of licensing provided certain administrative conditions are complied with &mdash; these include notifying the local authority of the intention not to put the vehicle on the road for specified reasons and paying a fee of £20 to the licensing authority within seven working days of the registration of the vehicle.  It should be noted that the provisions of section 117 do not apply retrospectively and, accordingly, arrears of road tax must be paid on registered, but unlicensed, imported cars before they can be issued with a current road tax disc.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, there is no provision to waive arrears of road tax in the circumstances described by the Deputy.  I would suggest that it is in the prospective buyer's interest to check out such matters at the time of purchase.</P>

Similarly VRT is not repayable on the re-exportation of a vehicle but it may be repaid in the event that deregistration is permitted. Section 134 (6) of the Finance Act, 1992, makes provision for such deregistration and consequent repayment of VRT in exceptional circumstances which arose within seven days after registration took place and provided that the vehicle in question had not been registered for road tax under the <Col N="764" /> Road Traffic Act, 1952.

      <Quest>whether IVF fertility treatment is available for medical card holders; whether expenditure for this treatment, costing £2,000, is an allowable expense to be considered when application for a medical card is being considered; the help, if any, that is available to a couple, one earning a gross salary £220 per week towards these expenses in view of the fact that they have been refused a medical card.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is not provided within the public hospital service.  Accordingly, persons wishing to undergo the IVF procedure do so on a private capacity and the cost of the procedure is a matter between the patient and the consultant concerned. Health boards have, however, <Col N="767" /> been advised that they may make arrangements for the reimbursement to the hospital of the cost of drugs used in IVF treatment for medical card holders. In the case of private patients, the cost of the relevant drugs may be reclaimed under the refund of drugs scheme. Other than the assistance available in respect of drugs costs, the public health service does not provide any assistance towards the cost of IVF services available in this country.</P>
      <P>The determination of eligibility for a medical card is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service is considering this matter at present.  The proposal involves the use of a 40 horsepower dinghy, which is greatly in excess of the recommended engine sizes for privately owned open boats on the lakes.  The controls on engine sizes are aimed at reducing noise levels on the lakes and preventing disturbance to both the natural resources and the lakes and to other recreational users, particularly fishermen.  The controls were introduced in consultation with local fishing clubs, who have also expressed concern at the Water Rescue Club's proposal.</P>
      <P>A final decision on the application is expected to be made in the near future.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="777" />&ldquo;The Regional Technical College, Sligo has operated a canteen through a Canteen Society for a substantial number of years.  Representatives of the college have had discussions with staff of the canteen on their situation and the canteen staff have been fully advised of the direction and intention of the college in regards to the running of the canteen.  The college has looked at having the canteen run by a campus company within the college i.e., Ballinode Catering &amp; Services Limited (a company limited by guarantee).  Its objective is to provide various support services and facilities to the students on the campus.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Governing Body of the college on 21/2/1996 detailed discussions on the canteen took place.  The Governing Body agreed that the running of the canteen should be carried out by the aforementioned campus company namely Ballinode Catering &amp; Services Limited with effect from the beginning of the 1996-97 tax year.  It was also agreed that no change should take place in the existing terms and conditions of employment of the staff of the canteen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear from the above that the governing body, including the director, of the college are aware of the arrangements in relation to the provision of canteen facilities in the college.</P>

      <P>A sum of £1,027,000 has been approved in the 1996 Estimates for the funding of activities to promote equality of opportunity in education.  I propose to use this funding to continue some of the equality initiatives already <Col N="778" /> under way in my Department.  These initiatives include:</P>
      <P>(a)  The Physics and Chemistry Intervention Projects, the purpose of which is to introduce these subjects into schools where they are currently unavailable.  The schools in question are girls' schools for the most part.</P>
      <P>(b)  A project offering compensatory education programmes for women seeking to re-enter the education system.  These programmes are designed to enable women to meet educational deficits as they endeavour to return to further/higher education.</P>
      <P>(c)  A transition year project in coeducational schools, which is being run in partnership with schools in Belgium and the Netherlands.  The outcome of this project will be the development of teaching materials which will be used in all three countries.</P>
      <P>(d)  Participation in an exhibition in Cork Regional Technical College to promote engineering and technology as career options for girls.</P>
      <P>(e)  Development of teaching materials for use in the delivery of inservice training to primary teachers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I was aware at the time in a general way that, as a result of cases brought to light from the Ursuline School, an exercise was under way to check that candidates had been properly credited with their marks for all components of the Art examination.  Following an evident failure in the system this was a reasonable step to take.  I would not have expected to be informed of the detailed activities, nor was I.</P>
      <P>The exercise was undertaken to establish that all Art candidates in the 1995 leaving certificate examinations had received credit for all components for which they had presented for examination. It involved the scrutiny of marking sheets and attendance records.</P>
      <P>The most recent case of an upgrade came to light as a direct result of the work initiated in connection with the Price Waterhouse inquiry.  It involved an error in the processing of an appeal. All aspects of this further upgrade will be encompassed within the scope of the Price Waterhouse inquiry.</P>

      <P>The staff in question were offered the option of either accepting the terms of a voluntary redundancy/early retirement package or transferring to the employment of the new catering contractor servicing the college.  The terms on offer in the voluntary redundancy/early retirement package are in line with established norms for the categories of workers concerned in comparable circumstances in the public service, including the higher education sector.  In that context, it is not correct to state that the terms are inferior to those offered in 1988.  It is not feasible to arrange for the group of workers in question to be redeployed elsewhere in the college.</P>
      <P>The union representing the staff has, however, brought the issue to the Labour Court where the case was heard on 22 February 1996.  The recommendation of the court is awaited.</P>

      <P>In checking vehicles for non-taxation it is not the practice for the Garda to distinguish between second-hand imported vehicles and others.  The information sought by the Deputy is not, therefore, available.  On a general note, the results of the last survey carried out by the Garda in 1991 are contained in a report published by the Environmental Research Unit.  This indicated that between 10 per cent and 13 per cent of vehicles were untaxed at any one time. It is presumed that this statistic is the same for imported second-hand cars.</P>
      <P>Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which came into effect on 19 April 1995, provides power for the Gardaí to seize vehicles, <i>inter alia,</i> for motor tax or motor insurance offences.  I understand from the Garda authorities that 1,094 motor vehicles were seized by the Gardaí under the Act in 1995 but that a breakdown of the reasons for the seizures is not available.  Statistics in relation to motor tax evasion offences are contained in the Garda Síochána annual reports copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>I am assuming that both questions relate to the use of external consultants and advisers.  My Department has undertaken three studies using such services since I became Minister for Tourism and Trade in December 1994.  In addition, Public Relations of Ireland Ltd. are on contract since June last year, providing guidance and advice to myself and the Department on public relations matters, and Fitzpatricks Associates are on contract since October last to act as External Evaluators for the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three studies were as follows: (1) Arthur D. Little was appointed to <Col N="792" /> advise and assist the Steering Committee charged with overseeing the implementation of the Bord Fáilte review recommendations; (2)  Indecon advised the Department on the development of a range of options for progressing the National Conference Centre project; and (3)  Mediawise provided advice on the projection and presentation of policy by me as Minister.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by my Department to date on current consultancy contracts is £41,490, of which £7,613 is recouped from the European Commission in respect of the External Evaluation contract.</P>
    <P>The question of consultancy work carried out for agencies under the aegis of my Department is a day to day matter for the respective agencies and, therefore, I am not in a position to supply the details requested by Deputy Callely with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Tourism Council, which advises on a wide range of tourism matters, were specifically asked by the Minister of State at my Department, Mr. Toddy O'Sullivan, T.D., to address the potential for growth in domestic tourism, on which they reported towards the end of 1995.</P>

      <P>The introduction of employment grant assistance related to the creation of employment which is not directly related to capital investment means that fixed asset investment in these companies is not tracked.

      <P>Adoption of the code is primarily a matter for negotiation and agreement between employers and trade unions in accordance with the voluntary nature of our collective bargaining system.  It is, of course, important that adequate procedural arrangements should be in place and be followed if industrial relations are to be conducted in a professional manner; improved procedural safeguards in organisations providing essential services, in particular, are greatly to be desired.  There has been some welcome development in this area; Iarnród Éireann, for example, have now taken account of the code's provisions in concluding an agreement with their workforce. I am aware that the code also figures in discussions that are ongoing in other organisations at present.</P>
      <P>While I would like to see quicker progress made in this area, I have to acknowledge that the tabling of the code tends to take place in the context of wider negotiation processes, which of their nature are complex and take time. I would, nevertheless, like to avail of this opportunity to encourage negotiating parties to take account of the code's provisions and thereby improve the stability of the employment relationship.</P>

      <P>There is no medical evidence to suggest that work with computer display screen equipment causes adverse effects on eyes or eyesight, or leads to worsening of existing conditions.  However, working with badly adjusted or defective equipment can give rise to temporary eye fatigue, symptoms of which include red or sore eyes and headaches.</P>
      <P>The use of display screens is governed by Part VII of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. No. 44 of 1993) which, <i>inter alia</i>, implements Council Directive 90/270/EEC on the minimum health and safety requirements for work with display screen equipment.  These regulations came into effect on 22 February, 1993 and set out the factors to be taken into account by employers in relation to the use of display screens.  In addition, employers are required to provide employees with comprehensive health and safety information about work involving the use of visual display units.</P>
      <P>Adherence to the provisions of the regulations concerning the design of computer software and equipment, location and layout of the workstation and design of the work activity will minimise the instance of eye fatigue and other conditions associated with work involving computer equipment.</P>
      <P>The regulations also require that employers make appropriate eyesight tests available to employees who habitually use display screen equipment as a significant part of their normal work. Employers are further obliged, should the results of such tests require, to have an opthalmological examination carried out on the employee concerned.  Where corrective appliances are required and where normal corrective appliances are not adequate the employer is required to provide the employee concerned with special corrective appliances appropriate to his or her work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority which is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of these regulations <Col N="796" /> has recently published detailed guidelines on the operation of the 1993 regulations in order to assist employers in fulfilling their obligations under those regulations including the correct use of computer equipment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the legal provisions I have mentioned afford adequate protection to employees whose work involves using computer display screen equipment.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the cost of new regulations on Irish businesses and I am aware that an increasing proportion of these regulations are emanating from the European Union.</P>
      <P>The cost of compliance with new and, indeed, existing regulations is widely recognised.  In 1994 the Task Force on Small Business considered the regulatory burden on business and recognised the burden arising from compliance costs particularly for small business.  The European Commission, in a report presented to the Madrid European Council in December 1995, recognised that European enterprises face an increasingly complex, legal, fiscal and administrative environment.  The 1995 annual report of the European Observatory for SMEs has estimated the total annual cost of administrative burdens on all enterprises in Europe to be in the order of 150 - 250 billion ECU (IR£122 &mdash; 204 billion).  I share with the European Commission and other member states a strong concern at the extent of these costs and a desire to see these burdens reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improvement of the administrative and legal environment of enterprises is a priority measure under the EU Multiannual Programme on Enterprise Policy <Col N="797" /> 1993-1996.  As part of this programme, a business impact assessment system now forms part of the Commission system for preparation of EU regulations.  I welcome the establishment of this system as a means of identifying, at an early stage, costs associated with Commission proposals.  I will continue to support proposals for continued development and improvement of this system.</P>
    <P>The importance, at EU level, of detailed evaluation, transparency and effective and timely consultation cannot be over emphasised as a means of keeping compliance costs to a minimum.  I believe that all EU proposals for regulations must establish whether the benefits of the proposed measure are in proportion to the costs to be imposed on business and others, particularly small business.  Our priority must be the maintenance and creation of employment and where increased regulation can be seen to interfere with that priority, then I feel such regulations should be kept to an absolute minimum or even dropped from our agenda altogether.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the fact that the average return on sales by companies which have been grant-aided by Forbairt is only 4 per cent as against 6 per cent for small businesses in the United States.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>An annual survey of Irish economy expenditures by manufacturers in Ireland is carried out by Forfás.  The most recently published results of the survey are for the year 1993.  The survey showed that, in the case of Forbairt-assisted Irish owned manufacturing companies employing 20 or more persons, the average rate of profitability as a percentage of sales was 4 per cent.  In the case of slightly larger <Col N="798" /> companies employing more than 29 persons, the figure was 4.5 per cent.  Preliminary data from the 1994 survey indicates that profitability in companies employing 20 or more persons is stable at 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>Forbairt also assists the indigenous internationally traded services sector. The survey found that companies in this sector employing 20 or more people had profits as a percentage of sales of 10.1 per cent in 1993.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that there are substantial variations in profitability as a percentage of sales as between different sectors of Irish-owned industry, and these different levels of profitability must be viewed against the background of the different levels of capital employed in each sector in order to make any meaningful comparison.  It could be hazardous, therefore, to compare an average figure for all Forbairt-assisted Irish companies with an average figure for all small businesses in the United States without any analysis of the respective industrial structures of both countries.  Account would also have to be taken of any differences in the methodologies employed in arriving at both figures, including both the categories and sizes of business included in each case.  In this regard it is important to bear in mind that &ldquo;small businesses&rdquo; in an American context may include quite large companies by Irish standards, in terms of sales, numbers of employees and capital employed.</P>
      <P>There are of course many reasons why businesses in one country may be more profitable than in another.  For example, American firms have ready access to much larger domestic markets than Irish firms, and this may facilitate economies of scale which Irish firms may only achieve through exports. American firms also appear to invest a greater proportion of their income in research and development, which is initially costly but yields long-term benefits in terms of sales and profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> I am very conscious of the importance of increasing profitability in Forbairt-assisted firms.  We need strong profitable Irish firms in order to provide secure employment, compete in domestic and foreign markets, generate investment capital, and contribute to Exchequer income.  In real terms, the profitability of all Forbairt-assisted manufacturing industry, including overseas firms in the food, drink and tobacco sectors, has increased by 131 per cent in the period 1987-1993 &mdash; admittedly starting from a very low base.  Over the period of the current industry operational programme, Forbairt, through its sophisticated and comprehensive range of industrial supports, including grants for research and development, is aiming to assist Irish industry further to improve its performance and generate the increased employment we so badly need.  The operational programme also includes export promotion measures operated by An Bord Tráchtála.  The Government as a whole is also conscious of the need to strengthen Irish industry in whatever way it can through its fiscal and economic policies.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy's question arises from my replies to supplementary points he raised in the context of Question No. 33 on 10 October 1995 (Volume 456, No. 6, columns 1444/50).  Since then, the &ldquo;Companies Report&rdquo; for July 1993 to December 1994 has been published and <Col N="800" /> that report adverts, <i>inter alia</i>, to the subject matter raised by the Deputy.  There is no question of the Companies Office having a policy of not striking off companies which have failed to make the statutory annual returns for over three years.  The companies report outlines the various enforcement actions of the Office.  Official striking-off is only one of the possible actions.  The report also adverts at page 29 to the rates of statutory compliance by companies.  Essentially, a four-pronged approach has been adopted to improve filing rates in the Companies Office using the law as it currently stands.  In 1996, it is proposed to petition the courts to disqualify directors who neglect their filing responsibilites.  Thus, current enforcement measures include: a statutory &ldquo;late-filing fee&rdquo;; prosecution of companies; prosecution of directors; company strike-offs, and most recently, proposed disqualification of directors for failure to file returns.</P>
      <P>At the registrar's direction, 5,607 were struck off the register in 1992, 13,087 in 1993, 4,025 in 1994 and 14,351 in 1995.</P>
      <P>The initiative of the &ldquo;late-filing fee&rdquo; resulted in a considerable number of companies bringing their affairs up to date.  By way of illustration, 28,000 annual returns were filed in the immediate run-up to the introduction of the fee in October 1993; in October 1994, 13,000 annual returns were filed and in October 1995, over 10,000 annual returns were filed.  These figures compare with an average monthly intake of some 5,500 returns.</P>
      <P>In 1992, 593 companies were prosecuted for failure to file returns, 2,341 in 1993, 1,979 in 1994 and 626 in 1995.</P>
      <P>In 1993, a decision was taken by the registrar to commence prosecution of individual directors of companies in respect of their personal failure to ensure the filing of statutory documents. As a result, 40 were prosecuted in 1993, 103 in 1994 and 116 in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my replies to Question No. 6 on 25 January 1996 (Volume 460, No. 5, columns 1318/24) and to Question No. 36 <Col N="801" /> on 21 November 1995 (Volume 458, No. 5, columns 924/5), I outlined a series of improvements which are planned for the Companies Registration Office over the next few years.  In the overall, I am satisfied that the enforcement activity by the Companies Office is leading to the creation of a climate of increased awareness in the business world of the statutory filing obligations on registered companies.</P>

      <P>To be successful, IDA Ireland has to market the elements of Ireland which can credibly support industrial investment.  IDA Ireland must match national advantages, in terms of competitiveness, with the business sectors which suit Ireland's skills.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is following a clear policy of being first with the industry leaders in emerging technologies.  In 1995 a total of 22 electronics projects, greenfield and expansion, were announced by IDA Ireland.  These have an employment potential of approximately 7,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland focuses on the electronics sector because Ireland offers to companies a competitive mix of skills, costs and financial advantages.  The industry is important to Ireland because it is one which can best meet our economic objectives.  It is a sector which has grown at a remarkable pace over the last 20 years.  Over one third of total employment in IDA assisted companies in 1995 was in the electronics sector. The sector is relatively new and like all new/innovative sectors there is constant change and volatility:</P>
      <P>&mdash;change in technological terms, which sees relatively rapid obsolescence of today's technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" />&mdash;change in individual company's fortunes, driven by both technological and competitive factors.</P>
    <P>However, the effects of these changes can be minimised by innovation or diversification.  Many leading companies of yesteryear have either had to carry out major internal restructuring or risk disappearing altogether.  There is no immediate sign that this volatility will disappear, as new innovations such as networks, internet, multimedia telecommunications and superhighways are developed and commercialised.</P>
    <P>The many successes in job creation in the electronics sector over the last number of years, and particularly in 1995, has raised the question of how we can assist in the maintenance of the high level of employment and of the creation of new opportunities.</P>
    <P>The main requirement is a systematic and continuous way of assessing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the industry by the industrial development agencies, the industry itself and outside informed observers on the sector.  Given the increasing importance of the electronics sector to industrial development and employment creation all segments of the sector are kept under review.  My Department, IDA Ireland and Forfás in conjunction with outside analysts will continue to assess the electronics sector with a view to maximising its potential in the context of overall industrial development.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the Initiative in question rests with the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach. EU Structural funding amounting to 300 million ecu will be provided initially for a three year period, of which 240 million ecu has been allocated to Northern Ireland, with the balance of 60 million ecu being allocated to the Border counties in Ireland.  The 60 million ecu derives from three funds, viz European Social Fund (20 mecu) European Regional Development Fund (35 mecu) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (3.5 mecu).</P>
      <P>No specific funding is available to my Department or its agencies as such under the initiative.  However, my Department has central responsibility for drawing-down aid from the European Social Fund in respect of the Initiative, as well as for all other ESF funded programmes.</P>
      <P>The 20.625 mecu ESF funding will be distributed to projects which are approved for assistance under the Initiative.  The selection of projects for Social Fund aid will primarily be made by Area Development Management Ltd. and the Combat Poverty Agency, which are specified in the operational programme as day-to-day management agencies for the initiative in the Border counties of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In effect, therefore, my Department's main role in the programme is to act as a conduit for the ESF component of the financial transfers between Brussels and the management agencies and to ensure compliance with the relevant regulations.</P>

      <P>I would like, first to inform the Deputy that the perspective of the White Paper has been broadened beyond the narrow concept of &ldquo;training&rdquo; and will now be entitled a White Paper on Human Resource Development.  This paper derives its terms of reference in the first instance from the commitment in the Government's policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  Its ultimate objective is to define the strategies and policy instruments which will secure an upgrading in the quality of our human capital to the level of best practice in competitor <Col N="806" /> countries; and to improve the opportunities, particularly for those at the margins of the labour force, to gain access to the labour market.</P>

The inherent difficulties in addressing the range of issues arising, combined with any anxieties to get our policies and prescriptions right, has meant that the drafting process has taken longer than I would have wished. However, the drafting is now at an advanced stage and I would hope to finalise it for submission to Government in the reasonably near future.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for Partnership Government 1993-97 provided for the establishment of an Employment Protection Unit to protect existing jobs by providing advisory services to firms experiencing difficulties and to those trading well and eager to grow.  This unit was established within my Department in August 1993.  It was decided in the initial phase of establishing the unit and getting it operational, to use the services of agency specialists to assist in dealing with the technological, financial, business and personnel/training issues for firms.  Two officials from Forbairt were seconded to the unit in this regard.  In August 1995, one of these specialists returned to Forbairt.  The work of the unit is now largely the responsibility of <Col N="807" /> the sectoral unit of my Department. Specialist advice is provided by the official who has remained on secondment from Forbairt.</P>
      <P>The decision to put in place a local employment service to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed was taken by the present Government in February 1995.  Overall responsibility for the delivery of the service was assigned to me and a special policy unit to oversee the delivery has been established within my Department.  In order to ensure that the most coherent and co-ordinated service is provided and, given the central role which FÁS, the training and employment authority, will play in its delivery, one official from that organisation has been seconded to assist in the work of the policy unit.  In this regard, the decision to second the official was not influenced by the embargo on staffing numbers.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the use of agency personnel outlined above, formal consultations were not held with the staff unions in my Department; they were however informed of these developments. Meetings with staff unions are undertaken on a regular basis to discuss relevant issues in my Department.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy on public expenditure, the question of reallocating existing resources available to me to meet priority needs is kept constantly under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 114, 115, 116, 117 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The badger is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and may be removed only under licence for research purposes, and in accordance with conditions specified by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.  In the context of the bovine TB eradication scheme, my Department applies for licences generally where badgers have been identified as contributing to high levels of bovine TB.  The number of licences issued to my Department by the wildlife service in 1995 on a county by county basis is set out on the following table.  Licences are valid for periods of 12 months from the dates of issue.  In the first instance, a statistically determined number of badgers, usually less than 12, is snared to determine the presence or otherwise of bovine TB in the badger population.  Snaring ceases if TB is not found.</P>
      <P>While in place, snares are inspected every 24 hours by authorised Department personnel and this generally continues for ten days after which the snares are removed.  Any snared badgers are killed humanely by experienced authorised operatives who have valid firearms licences and the entire servicing operation is carried out under the supervision of my Department's staff. All badger carcases are sent to laboratories for postmortem examination following which they are disposed of, usually by incineration.  I am not aware of any evidence or suspicion that snared badgers have been used in badger baiting.</P>
      <P>Cage traps have been found to be unsuitable for catching the required number of badgers to identify infection in a badger population.  Such traps are also more liable to be interfered with as they are far more visible than snares. Snares are located close to sett entrances in such a way as to minimise the risk of ensnarement of other animals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure concerned is one which is wholly funded by the EU as part of the market support arrangements in the <Col N="813" /> milk sector.  Therefore, any amendments on the lines indicated by the Deputy would be a matter for the European Commission in the first instance.</P>
    <P>However, I should point out that, given that the primary purpose of the scheme is to promote the consumption of butter the European Commission would not be likely either to extend it to cover products which compete with butter or to allow payment directly to recipients.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment on 15 December 1994, one major study has been undertaken by my Department and four major studies have been undertaken by expert groups involving departmental staff and one or more persons from outside the Department. These studies do not include the many assessments, reviews and analyses of issues which are an intrinsic part of the day to day work of the Department or the ongoing work of representative expert groups such as the dairy, beef and sheepmeat quota review groups. The undertaking of studies by the State agencies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the board and management of each such agency.</P>

      <P>This is an internal matter for Teagasc which is charged under section 4 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988 with responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, for agricultural research and training. However I have made inquiries from Teagasc and I understand that the organic unit at Johnstown Castle, which was initiated in 1990, has assembled technical and economic information pertaining to an organic cattle/sheep system.  A report will be issued in September 1996 on the technical and economic findings.  I understand that the unit will continue to be operated to organic standards and that essential technical information will continue to be assembled.  The actual deployment of staff within Teagasc must remain a matter for the body itself.  I understand that there may be further discussions between Teagasc and representatives of organic farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>With effect from 1995 EU regulations governing the <Col N="816" /> suckler cow premium scheme require that cows must be of a beef or predominantly beef breed in order to be eligible for the premium.</P>
      <P>Under the EU regulations governing the use of quota the position up to now was that an applicant had to use at least 50 per cent of his quota rights in at least one of two consecutive years; otherwise the part not used during the second year would be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.  For example an applicant with a permanent quota of 20 rights who used only nine rights in 1994 must have used at least ten rights, 50 per cent of his quota, in 1995.  From 1996 onwards the quota regulation provides that farmers holding quotas of seven or less must use at least 70 per cent of their quota in at least one of two consecutive years, otherwise the part not used during the second year will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.  Farmers whose quotas are greater than seven must use at least 70 per cent of their quotas every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.  Farmers with justifiable exceptional circumstances may be exempted from these rules.  Use of quota means making application for and being entitled to payment on a certain number of animals.  Where a quota holder makes application for the suckler cow premium on an animal which is deemed ineligible for any reason, including an ineligible breed, he is not regarded as having used a quota right in respect of that animal.  In certain cases, the imposition of penalties could result in an applicant being deemed ineligible for any premium in respect of a given year or, in some cases, for two years.  In such circumstances the applicant is deemed to have used quota in respect of the number of eligible animals found at the field inspection which gave rise to the penalty.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by ESB that the average salary of a 50 year old employee may increase on average by approximately 2.5 per cent after 1 September 1996, assuming the implementation of CCR and the payment of the next phase of <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  This increase depends on employee eligibility for productivity agreements.  The total cost of making that employee redundant, in present value terms, is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  £20,300 relating to a lump sum of one year's salary.</P>

    <P>The cost of the severance, as outlined here, must be measured against the cost &mdash; estimated at £275,000 in present value terms &mdash; of keeping the employee in service until age 65 on full pay.

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy applied in 1985 for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts.  His application was referred to the Army Pensions Board, which is the statutory body appointed under those Acts to investigate and report on such applications. The board reported that the applicant did not satisfy the conditions for the award of a pension in that his disablements were not attributable to <Col N="825" /> his military service as required by the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>The applicant's case has been reviewed on a number of occasions in the light of additional material furnished by him, but the board did not alter their original report.
