      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business I am sure Members will very much wish to join me in extending a most warm welcome to parliamentary delegations from the Republic of Tunisia and the Republic of Lithuania.  We express the ardent hope that the visit to Ireland of both delegations will be most happy and successful.  On behalf of all the Members of this House I extend to members of both delegations a most hearty céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take: No. 10 &mdash; Statements on Northern Ireland.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: (1) the opening statement of the Taoiseach; the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party; the Leader of the Progressive Democrats Party and the Leader of the Democratic Left Party, who shall be called upon in that order, <Col N="2016" /> shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (2) the statement of each other member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (3) Members may share time; and (4) the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be called upon not later than 4.30 p.m. to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we will debate Northern Ireland and next Tuesday and Wednesday nights during Private Members' time we will debate the economic difficulties in the Border region. Will the Taoiseach say how, during the Irish Presidency, the Government allowed the loss of £78 million from the Delors package, negotiated as part of the Essen proposals and the last matter negotiated by Fianna Fáil in Government, with no response from the Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a decision of the European Parliament, not of the governments and it is a matter that is now being reopened by the European Commission because it does not agree with the decision made by the Parliament in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, in reply to Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Taoiseach said that he had no involvement in and could do nothing about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern is misquoting and misrepresenting what I said yesterday.  I did not say that we could <Col N="2017" /> do nothing about the matter, I said we have no involvement in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should watch matters such as this.  It was difficult to negotiate that money in Essen and, even during the Irish Presidency, the Government was not watching what was going on in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government had an opportunity to consider the Supreme Court judgement in the McKenna case and has it been in a position to decide the parameters within <Col N="2018" /> which it must operate in the context of the forthcoming bail referendum?  In view of the Taoiseach's solo run yesterday, has he abandoned all hope of getting the support of Democratic Left and the Labour Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the Opposition parties.  I know that the proposals will have the support of the three Government parties.  Yesterday the Fine Gael Party announced that its director of elections will be Deputy Charles Flanagan.  He will lead a very vigorous campaign and I know the same applies to the Labour and Democratic Left parties in Government.  It will be interesting to see how vigorous the Deputy's party is in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be apparent to the Taoiseach that were it not for Fianna Fáil pressing this issue throughout 1995 we would not be holding a referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give a commitment to the House on the introduction of the school attendance Bill? We are reading daily reports about young children who urgently require protection, roaming the streets.  It is a serious indictment on all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach clarify the lead story in <i>The Examiner</i> today in which the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and the Attorney General claim they will take a case against British Nuclear Fuels on the Sellafield issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the appropriate time.  Yesterday, during questions, the Minister for the Environment had no knowledge of it.  Can we have some clarity from the Government as to whether this story is true?  If it is true, maybe the <Col N="2020" /> Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, will tell the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who is chairman of a committee looking at the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on why the report on physical and sensory disabilities is being shelved once again?  Its publication has been delayed on a number of occasions and now it is being shelved again.  It was to form the basis of planning for the future for the disabled in our community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there legislation in that area, Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking me about a report, not about promised legislation.  Therefore, it is not in order on the Order of Business.  Obviously, I will make the necessary inquiries and revert to Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to comply with the McKenna judgment in providing independent information to the electorate on the bail referendum or any future referenda? The essence of the McKenna case was that the Government cannot supply information and cannot propose one side or the other.  Will the Taoiseach comply with that judgment and will he use the Bill I have placed on the Order Paper to set up an independent referendum commission to allow independent information to be given to the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>While every party in the House may be in favour of the bail <Col N="2021" /> referendum, there may be future referenda we do not all favour.  The public is entitled to independent information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will comply with the Supreme Court judgment which is binding since it is the supreme interpreter of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not contravene the judgment by the expenditure of public funds in a way that would be contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court in the McKenna case.  The Deputy can be at ease on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give Government time to discuss the commitment in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> in relation to the establishment of community based teams to combat drugs abuse due to the drugs crisis in every community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>To what legislation is the Deputy referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a promise and commitment in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> There is a crisis in our communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly in order for the Deputy to seek a debate on the topic he mentions because of its importance.  I suggest that he first communicates with his own party's Whip who if he is agreeable will then transmit his request to the Government which will consider it in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach could give Government time, as I have suggested in relation to hepatitis C and for a debate on agriculture?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the reply the Taoiseach gave to Deputy Dempsey, when independent advice is <Col N="2022" /> being given to the electorate on the referendum, will there be a fair and independent tendering process?  This was not so in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that question will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach to consider whether he will give a facility to his backbenchers and others who wish to discuss agriculture, which is our biggest industry and specifically the beef crisis.  In the past seven days has the Taoiseach considered the proposal for such a debate in Government time?  Does the Government accord that sort of priority to the issues to be addressed?  Can the Taoiseach now tell the House that he is favourably disposed to such a debate?</P>

    <Title>Statements on Northern Ireland.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>For several years a great many people have given much of their time, resources and talents to bringing about, by agreement, a new order in Northern Ireland, a new order in which the killing and the pain of the past 25 years would be confined for good to the pages of history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Monday's bomb attack in Lisburn demonstrated clearly the scant regard those who run the republican movement have for those painstaking efforts.  Not <Col N="2023" /> only did it undermine the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, it also damaged the prospects for underpinning such peace by a political agreement.</P>
    <P>The timing of this IRA outrage was directly and cynically aimed at destabilising the loyalist ceasefire.  We must not allow the IRA to succeed in what the <i>Irish News</i> aptly described yesterday as the betrayal of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some will, hopefully, argue that the Lisburn bomb may be a last spectacular, just to show what the IRA can do, as a prelude to calling a ceasefire.  &ldquo;The volunteers will need something to keep their morale going for a while, so a few people have to be killed&rdquo; might be one way of putting it.  If that is the calculation of the leaders, it hardly suggests that any ceasefire that follows it will involve a real acceptance of the Mitchell principles by those who ordered the two Lisburn bombs, that a new ceasefire will necessarily hold in all circumstances and that the republican movement has transformed its analysis in a profound way.</P>
    <P>This line of argument shows that the IRA will have a significantly difficult task to convince the rest of us that a further ceasefire, whenever it is called, is credible and irrevocable.  One thing is clear &mdash; the Lisburn bombs were intended and calculated to cause the maximum number of deaths and injuries, to shatter as many lives as possible, to leave as many men and women as possible paralysed in pain, to cause as many bitter tears as possible.  That certainly was the calculation of those who ordered the Lisburn bomb.</P>
    <P>The one clear and loud message that this House must send out to those engaged in or contemplating violence is that violence and democratic politics do not mix.  This House, as the democratic representatives of the Irish people, will always reject and repudiate the fascist tactic of the armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other.  These are not tactics that are alternative to one another.  The republican movement, as a whole, must choose between them once and for all.</P>
    <P>The democratic political process in <Col N="2024" /> Northern Ireland is embodied by the multi-party talks which resumed on 9 September.  These talks have all the imperfections inherent in the democratic process everywhere, but which are especially evident when the divisions between the participants are profound.  The difficulties encountered in those talks cannot be used as the excuse or the reason for a heinous act like the Lisburn bombing.  Of course the talks are slow; our own Forum for Peace and Reconciliation did not conclude its much simpler task all that quickly, and the divisions there were much narrower than they are in Belfast.  Some progress has been made in the Belfast talks.</P>
    <P>Agreement was eventually reached on the rules of procedure for the talks. Senator George Mitchell was and remains the chairperson of the process. Neither of these agreements would have been conceivable in the failed talks of 1991-92.  While the decommissioning issue has caused considerable difficulty, there is an agreed approach between the two Governments on that issue, something that was not there in 1991-92 or even a few months ago.  If we compare with the 1991-92 talks, there has been, on this very issue, intensive bilateral and triateral, face-to-face contact involving the Irish Government and the Ulster Unionist delegations, again a step forward.  Such intensive dialogue did not take place on any issue in 1991-92.</P>
    <P>Irish and British Ministers now meet at least three days every week to discuss how we can move the talks forward.  The Tánaiste and I are in constant contact with our counterparts.  Never in history have the two Governments been working as closely together as they are now. If we need a summit we will have one, but we do not want distractions, public relations exercises or hints that solutions can be imposed, colonial-style. That is not the way the talks process has been structured in the first place.  It has been structured to achieve agreement between the two Governments and a sufficient consensus of the parties in Northern Ireland.  That &ldquo;and&rdquo; is important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> The two Governments simply cannot do it on their own.  If they could, it would have been done a long time ago. Look at some examples of what the two Governments have been able to agree since the formation of this Government: the Joint Framework Document in February 1995; detailed communiqués following summit meetings between the Prime Minister and myself, particularly in November 1995 and February 1996; ground rules for substantive all-party negotiations in April 1996; procedural guidelines and a draft agenda for all-party negotiations in June 1996.  What we now need, in addition to agreement and action by the two Governments, is agreement between the two Governments and a sufficient consensus of the parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Every possible avenue continues to be explored with a view to finding a way in which both decommissioning and substantive three-strand issues can be addressed seriously and in parallel on the basis of the Mitchell report.  Of course, the Government would have wished for speedier and more discernible progress.  With that aim in mind, we have made an enormous effort, since the talks resumed, to inject new momentum and substance into the process.  I have spoken to the Prime Minister on a number of occasions over the past week and officials have been &mdash; and continue to be &mdash; in intensive, sometimes hourly, contact with their counterparts, including in 10 Downing Street.  On Saturday, the Prime Minister and I agreed to renew our efforts to make the talks work and to build on our joint approach to those talks in every way possible.  The joint paper agreed between the two Governments on the issue of decommissioning, published last week, has demonstrated clearly our shared commitment to give the process continuing necessary impetus.</P>
    <P>Our proposal was to open negotiations in the three stands on either 7 or 14 October while addressing in parallel the decommissioning issue on the basis of the Mitchell report.  That is the <Col N="2026" /> only realistic way to achieve decommissioning, and I urge the talks participants to work constructively and in good faith to implement all aspects of the Mitchell report.  That report is the key to a resolution of this issue.</P>
    <P>Achievement of full decommissioning of course requires in practice the participation of Sinn Féin because the decommissioning we are talking about is, by definition, voluntary decommissioning, but Sinn Féin's participation is by no means indispensable for the negotiations to proceed and agreement to be reached.  No one, armed or unarmed, has a veto.</P>
    <P>A fully inclusive agreement would of course be preferable.  Accordingly the Government has worked very hard to enable Sinn Féin to enter the negotiations which have been under way since 10 June.  Channels of communication at the level of officials have been kept open with the sole purpose of bringing about a credible restoration of the IRA ceasefire which, this time, would hold in all circumstances.  Logic and the previous statements of the republican movement on the peace process dictate that the ceasefire should never have been broken in the first place.  That logic, in terms of a restoration, should surely have been reinforced beyond all doubt with the commencement of the multi-party talks on 10 June.</P>
    <P>The position now, as it has been since February 1995, is that the Government will continue to carry forward the political process, with or without Sinn Féin. At the same time, however, the two Governments have demonstrated clearly their commitment to hold open the door to a fully inclusive process. Acts like the Lisburn bombing make it much more difficult, in the democratic and political sense, to continue to keep open direct channels of communication. It is clear that so far the Sinn Féin leadership has not convinced the republican movement as a whole to abandon for good the two-prong approach of politics and violence.  Some may well be sincere in trying to achieve that, but it <Col N="2027" /> has been suggested that they have accepted the ground rule that there will be no split in any circumstances.  Objectively that means, if true, that in important matters the hardest of hardliners have been given the final word.  If that be so, let me say this to the hardliners.  If the republican movement wants to be taken seriously, as democrats &mdash; with all of the benefits which that confers &mdash; it will have to get rid of the tactical use of violence for good &mdash; no more Lisburns, no more spectaculars, no more beatings, no more coded warnings, just the ballot box.</P>
    <P>In what way were the ideals of Tone advanced by the years of IRA violence? The answer is that they were not.  That violence deepened existing divisions and created new ones between Protestants, Catholics and dissenters.  Before the IRA started its work, many Unionists considered themselves to be Irish. Far fewer do so today, thanks to the republican movement's counterproductive strategy.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in the days ahead many commentators will attempt to analyse the reasons that have brought the peace process to this point.  It is important to do that but I want to put on record my views on some of the arguments that may be advanced.</P>
    <P>It has been widely argued that Sinn Féin and republicans were deceived or let down by the slow progress during the IRA ceasefire in moving into comprehensive talks.  There was a delay.  The Government certainly would have wished for a start earlier than we secured, which was 10 June.  Given the nature and depth of the division in Northern Ireland, however, and the logical necessity of ensuring that the Unionists would actually take part in the talks, this delay should not have been sufficient to lead to resumed violence.  The fact that this delay alone led to resumed IRA violence raises questions as to the depth of its commitment to peace on any terms other than those dictated by itself.  This concern is reinforced by the fact that the active <Col N="2028" /> preparation of violence by the IRA was under way long before the ceasefire ended and has obviously continued long after the talks started.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, the republican movement appears unable to reconcile itself with the fact that the British presence in Ireland is not the British Army or state, but one million Unionists.  They are the British presence.  It seems the republican movement cannot, within its analysis, address Unionist concerns other than in a framework which they know Unionists cannot and will not accept.</P>
    <P>The widely presumed notion &mdash; and it underlies many of the questions raised on occasion in the House &mdash; that the talks process could ever have been speedy reflects an inability or an unwillingness to understand and acknowledge the profound and necessarily divisive nature of the issues the talks set out to address.  The talks in Belfast are about the nature of the state.  There are few, if any, historical examples of quick or easy consensus of agreement being reached anywhere in the world on a matter of this nature between parties as divided as the participants or potential participants in the present talks.  Hence the talks had to be slow and that should be understood.  Presumptions otherwise should not underlie questions which are made superficial by that presumption being implied in them.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt in some detail with the decommissioning issue but further elaboration might be useful. Whatever about the manner in which it first came to prominence, we have to acknowledge that there were, or are, genuine and deep-seated concerns on this issue.  That came across very clearly in, for example, the presentations made to the Forum For Peace and Reconciliation by the main Protestant churches. That strong concern had to be responded to in the talks.  It was bound to be a problem in any talks.  Anyone who pretends decommissioning will not be a problem in the talks is not being realistic.  As a Government, we faced up to it and with the British Government we set up the Mitchell body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2029" /> That body's report offered a means by which the impasse on decommissioning could be surmounted.  It signposted the way to a substantive, all-inclusive process of negotiations.  It struck the appropriate balance between the sincere concerns surrounding the issue on one hand, and the practical considerations involved of getting voluntary decommissioning on the other. More recently, the two Governments, in our joint paper published on 1 October, made clear our firm adherence to the report as a realistic basis for dealing with the decommissioning issue in the talks.</P>
    <P>The paper published by the Ulster Unionist Party on 30 September does not offer such a basis.  I believe a workable arrangement can be reached and, for our part, the Government will do everything possible to bring that about. The Government has already briefed the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; as have the British Government &mdash; on our intentions in regard to legislation to deal with decommissioning.  I am taking the opportunity presented by this debate to announce that, as a further demonstration of our commitment and good faith on the issue, the Government intends to publish this legislation at an early date.</P>
    <P>The decommissioning issue will not be allowed to block our path to comprehensive three-strand negotiations.</P>
    <P>Turning to the issue of marches and parades, there is no doubt the events this summer have severely damaged inter-community relations and the climate for dialogue.  The sectarian fall-out manifested itself in many sinister ways &mdash; boycotts; damage to schools, halls and churches; arson attacks on private property; interference with people's right to worship; punishment beatings and murders.  All these manifestations are profoundly wrong and point to the depths of divisions that exist.  The events of the summer, therefore, underscore the urgency and reinforce the need for the multi-party <Col N="2030" /> talks to continue, to achieve progress and, ultimately, to reach agreement.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, the British Government has established an independent review of parades and marches. The Government here will be making a submission with a view to avoiding a repetition next year of the damaging effects which characterised this year's marching season.  We deplore what happened at Drumcree and elsewhere but it can never be regarded as a credible justification for what the IRA did in Lisburn or elsewhere.  Holding offensive and threatening parades and killing people are both wrong, but they are not exactly on the same moral level.</P>
    <P>Throughout this process the Government has not only emphasised our rejection of coercion but also the need for balance.  The word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; permeates the principles and realities set out in the Joint Declaration as well as the proposals outlined in the Joint Framework Document.  The reason for that should be clear to everyone &mdash; an ultimate settlement is contingent on the achievement of a reasonable balance between the positions of the parties on the many issues involved in the three core relationships.  One of those necessary balances relates to the whole question of consent.  Without agreement and consent, stable political arrangements for the governance of Northern Ireland are an impossibility.  Any resort to force is fundamentally at variance with the principles of agreement and consent. Therein lies a key question and a key challenge not only for Sinn Féin but also for the republican movement as a whole.</P>
    <P>The loyalist paramilitary organisations and the political parties who offer them analysis, deserve great credit for maintaining their ceasefire, even in the face of provocation.  I strongly endorse the positions taken by the leadership of the UDP and PUP, that loyalist paramilitaries should not have their agenda set by the provocation exemplified by the cynical bombings in Lisburn.</P>
    <P>The loyalist ceasefire has made an enormous contribution to peace and <Col N="2031" /> stability in Northern Ireland.  We have welcomed the constructive contributions to the talks made by the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic Party and are happy that their continuing participation in the talks is assured.  Their contribution continues to be needed.  A decision on their part to undertake a ceasefire was the right decision at the time.  It remains the right decision to uphold the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>Let me say directly to loyalists, and to Unionists generally, that we, the people in the Repbulic, have no agenda for a progressive take-over of Northern Ireland against the wishes of a majority of people there.  If there ever was such an agenda or mentality here, it certainly has gone.  I believe it is clear to many people in Northern Ireland &mdash; Unionists, Nationalists and republicans &mdash; that this is so.  It has been acknowledged as a fact by many independent and objective commentators, including many of a Unionist orientation.  There are probably still quite a number of Unionistminded people in Northern Ireland who have not grasped this sea change in public opinion in this State, not only in the policies of all the constitutional parties in this State but among the population at large.  If those Unionists who doubt the change in opinion here had been present at the Forum for Peach and Reconciliation, they would have seen for themselves that Irish Nationalists are far from constituting a monolith hostile to their interests and what they believe.</P>
    <P>There is no pan-nationalist front intent on pursuing a malign agenda to undermine the identity or heritage of Unionists or their involvement with the United Kingdom.  Any Government I head would never wish to be part of any such agenda.  To be fair, I do not believe such an agenda would be followed by any Government that could be formed from any combination of the parties that are represented in this House, for all the parties here have embraced the principle of consent.  All the parties here supported the Joint Declaration made by my predecessor and the British <Col N="2032" /> Prime Minister on 15 December 1993. It is, perhaps, worth recalling here the contents of paragraph 5 of that declaration which are as follows:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, on behalf of the Irish Government, considers that the lessons of Irish history, and especially of Northern Ireland, show that stability and well-being will not be found under any political system which is refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a significant minority of those governed by it.  For this reason, it would be wrong to attempt to impose a united Ireland, in the absence of the freely given consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach accepts, on behalf of the Irish Government, that the democratic right of self-determination of the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and must, consistent with justice and equity, respect the democratic dignity and the civil rights and religious liberties of both communities.</P>
    <P>That shows that all the parties in this House &mdash; those were words agreed to by my predecessor &mdash; and all constitutional Nationalist parties throughout the island, as well as others, support the position being taken by the Government.  That multi-party agreement embodied in the Downing Street Declaration, was fully repeated and replicated in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, where constitutional parties sat down with Sinn Féin to see how far agreement could be reached on the realities, principles and requirements of a path to a political settlement. Apart from Sinn Féin, all the parties held absolutely firmly to the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>While in a technical sense, the cause of the failure to get unanimous agreement on the Forum's report related to the method of measuring democratic ratification of an agreement emerging <Col N="2033" /> from all-party talks, in essence the breach with Sinn Féin came down to consent.  The report of the forum noted that a substantial consensus had developed around the position set out by the two Governments in the Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>All the participating parties, apart from Sinn Féin, agreed to a statement, as follows:</P>
    <P>Should [comprehensive, all-party talks] result in an agreement, and if that agreement were democratically ratified, North and South, then the result of the ratification process will represent a valid and legitimate exercise by the people of Ireland as a whole of their right to self-determination.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin did not agree to the reference to &ldquo;democratically ratified, North and South&rdquo; but the essence of the matter was that they could not join all the other parties in accepting the principle of consent in regard to the wishes of a majority of people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>All the parties represented in this House acknowledge that consent, in those terms, does not now exist for a united Ireland and is unlikely to do so in any near future.  Our focus has been on parity of esteem and equality of treatment between the two main traditions within Northern Ireland, including the right of both traditions to pursue legitimately their aspirations, on the basis of the principle of consent, freely given.</P>
    <P>The principle of consent also permeates the Joint Framework Document of the British and Irish Governments. However, that document goes further.  It clearly states that as part of an agreement confirming understanding between the two governments on constitutional issues set out in the document &mdash; essentially on a balanced constitutional accommodation &mdash; the Irish Government will introduce and support proposals for change in the Irish Constitution to implement the commitments in <Col N="2034" /> the Joint Declaration &mdash; the Irish commitment being one I cited earlier.  The Framework Document states:</P>
    <P>These changes in the Irish Constitution will fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland and demonstrably be such that no territorial claim over Northern Ireland contrary to the will of a majority of its people is asserted...</P>
    <P>The Joint Framework Document sets out the parameters of a possible settlement as seen by both Governments.  As such it informs indeed, constitutes a large part of the basis of the Government's approach to the multi-party talks.  Thus, in preparing for the substantive negotiations we want to see starting very soon in those talks, the Government continues to study amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, which would emphasise that it is agreement between people and not territorial aggrandisement that we are seeking.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to pursuing a meaningful peace process that will bring an enduring peace which will underpin the political process, thereby leading to accommodation through dialogue.  Despite the setbacks, we remain of the view that this would best be done through an effective talks process, conducted in an entirely peaceful atmosphere.  However, with or without an IRA ceasefire, and therefore with or without Sinn Féin, we are determined to ensure that the talks process is conducted in such a way that the prospects for its success are maximised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all deeply appalled by, and unreservedly condemn, the IRA bomb attack on a British army base in Lisburn.  It has left many people wounded, and what remained of the peace process in complete tatters.  Some of us were aware that time was running out fast, and warned people to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bomb attack in Britain last February, which ended the IRA ceasefire, was deeply irresponsible.  We all felt betrayed.  It certainly contributed to the <Col N="2035" /> deteriorating atmosphere this summer leading to the events at Drumcree and since, even if it was not the sole cause of it.  The events of recent days have been even more appalling.</P>
    <P>It is hard for me to find words sufficient to express my dismay and revulsion at the premeditated and deeply provocative IRA decision to renew its campaign of violence in Northern Ireland after more than two years.  It is an act of such criminal stupidity, and with the potential for such evil consequences, that it is difficult to believe any rational organisation could decide to do it, let alone one calling itself Irish and republican.</P>
    <P>The bomb attack is a deeply unpatriotic act.  It is the people on this island, Unionist and Nationalist, who will be most affected.  All of us would be critical of the way in which the peace process has been allowed to be squandered over the last few years.  Why should the people of Northern Ireland, the people of Ireland who have so badly wanted peace, be made to suffer.</P>
    <P>The IRA bomb attack is directed at the lives, security and prosperity of the people of Ireland, North and South.  It sabotages the progress that could be made through a peaceful political process, notwithstanding the current difficulties and setbacks.  It will hold back the entire country, if the violence continues and escalates.  It runs a high risk of provoking a chain reaction if it is not halted.</P>
    <P>What I find hardest to understand is the political defeatism, cowardice and political illusions of the IRA.  They have skilled political leaders.  Why do they refuse to trust them?  Twenty-five years of violence were marked by complete futility, in which nothing was achieved in terms of any worthwhile advance towards a united Ireland.  Whatever realistic hopes there might have been of achieving a united Ireland by agreement, over time, have been largely destroyed by the IRA.  Northern Ireland is divided as never before.  We, the people of this Republic, do not want an <Col N="2036" /> unstable united Ireland built on the peace of the cemetery and on the ashes of sectarian bitterness and hatred.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the IRA, however misguided, was motivated by genuine republican ideals.  I see no evidence of any understanding of genuine republicanism among them that could be a foundation of peace and ultimate unity in the 21st century.  Republicans know, because they have said it, that Unionists cannot be coerced into a united Ireland against their will.  They know, because they have said it, that they do not have sufficient force or the necessary support to push the British Army and Government out of this country.  They know that no agreement will work without Unionist participation, because they have said it.  Why then do the IRA persist in tactics that it knows will lead nowhere, except to more death, destruction and disaster?  The ideals of the United Irishmen, the leaders of 1848 and the leaders of 1916 have nothing in common with the actions being carried out today.  Where are the ideals that inspired a nation?</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that the leadership of Sinn Féin recognises in its heart of hearts the truth and force of what I am saying.  Despite the impressive mandate for peace which it won in June and which should have been used to participate in talks, it has not been able to persuade others within its movement.  However discouraging events have been, they are the only people who can persuade the IRA to stop their campaign of action.  Sinn Féin, if it is to have a long-term future, must redouble its efforts to win the battle of minds in which the victory is a commitment to democratic methods alone.  The IRA's decision of autumn 1994 was the absolutely correct one.  The decision to return to violence in February last was an absolutely wrong one.  If the argument for peace was won in 1994 by the wisdom and logic of John Hume, Gerry Adams and Albert Reynolds, then that same argument for peace can be won again.  Those arguing for the democratic option must have the constant support <Col N="2037" /> of both Governments, without any shillyshallying, equivocation or doubts.</P>
    <P>The immediate concern of everybody is the impact that the bomb attacks may have on the loyalist ceasefire.  I recognise the historic contribution that its ceasefire has made and can continue to make.  The loyalist parties have won the respect of many people in the South by their forthright and courageous stand, with relatively little immediate political reward.  I urge them to stick to their principled position, including their adherence to the Mitchell principles. Their political cause has nothing to gain from a loyalist return to violence, and that is the view of their own political and community leaders, not just mine. Their spokespersons whom we have all got to know to some degree, some better than others, have articulated the cause of peace and restraint and have tried extremely hard &mdash; I am not sure if it is understood in this part of the island how hard they have to work.  There are those who sometimes believe that they are in the sabre-rattling position.  Many times this summer I have taken their side because from our communications I understand they have to genuinely work within their groupings to try to convince their past colleagues who would like to return to violence of the democratic ways.  I hope they will understand from this House today that we recognise that fact.  It is important to them.  The contribution they have made, not only this year but in the autumn of 1994, is not always recognised.  After the IRA ceasefire in 1994 they moved by October 1994, after all the years of violence, to the loyalist ceasefire.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Daly in a public address in France yesterday expressed the view that none of the parties involved, neither the British Government, the Unionists nor Sinn Féin, will ever enjoy a better opportunity for peace than the one they have thrown away.  I agree.  All of us are dismayed at the speed with which the peace process has been allowed to unravel.  While the breaches of the ceasefire are entirely the <Col N="2038" /> responsibility of the IRA, the breakdown of the peace process and its inability to make progress is largely the fault of others.  What I said in February I repeat now, that all of us to a greater or lesser degree share in some of the blame.  Collectively, we have allowed the best opportunity for peace in 25 years to escape us.</P>
    <P>The British Government will not be thanked by history for the way it frustrated the peace process after it was gifted, mainly through the effort of others, with an unexpected ceasefire.  It was the British insistence on prior disarmament, in order to satisy right-wingers and preserve a parliamentary majority, that quite literally wrecked hopes of political progress.  The peace process and the ceasefires were based on the premise that there had been no military victory and no military defeat on either side.  How can you insist on a surrender of arms, when there has been no military victory?  The British Tories had to pretend they had won, and therefore insisted on what they knew the IRA would never concede.</P>
    <P>We all remember the line the British Tories brought to us at Christmas 1994 and early in 1995 &mdash; try to go and talk to Sinn Féin and others and just get one single bullet.  That meant only one thing, &mdash; surrender.  It had little to do with taking arms out of the process.  It was to show the world they had achieved surrender.  It is a scandal and indictment of the political incompetence of the British Government that it could not organise inclusive peace talks even after 16 or 17 months ceasefire.  Apart from excluding Sinn Féin the British treatment of paramilitary prisoners, who had played a key role in opting for peace, sent all the wrong signals.  Surely the very least that those prisoners could have hoped for, having clearly turned their back on violence, was that their situation would not be worsened.  In many cases, the plight of the prisoners was made much worse. Such treatment made no sense whatever.  Neither I nor my colleagues argued for the release of people forthwith.  However, Deputy Ó Cuív and <Col N="2039" /> others on the Government benches who worked with him and visited many of the prisons have highlighted the deterioration in the position.</P>
    <P>The greatest tragedy so far as the Irish side is concerned was the change in Government.  Despite its best efforts &mdash; I acknowledge that the Taoiseach and others have undertaken a great deal of sincere hard work &mdash; the Government has not succeeded in retaining the confidence of the republican movement or even the same level of confidence among the wider Nationalist community.  Neither has it won the confidence of the Unionist and loyalist community.  On many occasions it was not tough enough in public with the British Government which sought and succeeded in moving the goalposts many times.  I will say no more on this subject as we in Fianna Fáil believe we have a patriotic duty to pull together during a time of crisis and to try to make progress with as much political unity as possible in the House.</P>
    <P>The Unionist parties also have to answer for their responsibility in the breakdown of the peace process. Neither in the talks, in which the SDLP still participates, nor in the forum, which is not attended by any Nationalist party, have the Unionist parties shown the slightest interest in reaching an accommodation or political settlement which would underpin the peace process.  The best example of this was the day the Unionist parties only turned up at the forum meeting.  They had a glorious opportunity that day in July before Drumcree to show they had an interest in moving matters forward.  The Alliance Party stayed out of that meeting and the Women's Coalition had pulled out.  During that meeting the Unionist parties decided to have a debate about what flag should be in front of them on the table and what flag should be placed in the hall.  They managed to spend the entire day &mdash; how they managed this I do not know &mdash; discussing the size of the Union Jack to be placed on the table and in the hall.  This is an example of how serious they were <Col N="2040" /> about moving matters forward.  The only thing I congratulate them on is for managing to sit for a full day and dragging on the meeting.  Even in this House where Members have an ability to talk at length we could not manage to keep a debate on that subject going for a full day.  I give that day as an example and, as far as I know, most of the meetings since then have been as unproductive.</P>
    <P>The tactics of the parties led by Dr. Paisley and Robert McCartney have been wrecking ones.  They have shown not the slightest concern or interest in peace.  The Ulster Unionist Party has not felt strong enough to confront such tactics.  The entire Unionist effort has, therefore, gone into obstructionism and making it as difficult as possible for Sinn Féin to ever join the talks.  The decommissioning issue has been used cynically in the past 18 months to control every aspect of the talks.</P>
    <P>I leave it to the people of Northern Ireland to judge which parties have made a genuine effort to consolidate peace and which parties have undermined it.  It has often been said that Governments should not be influenced by the politics of the latest atrocity but what was right a month ago is still right today.  The terms on which Sinn Féin can take part in the talks should not be made more difficult as a result of what has happened.  My view of what is needed to re-establish peace has not altered in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>First, the IRA must restore its ceasefire.  If the August 1994 ceasefire is restored with adequate assurances that it is complete and definitive and that there will be no further going back on it, Sinn Féin should be allowed to take its place without delay at the table on the basis of the Mitchell principles. Second, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Downing Street Declaration, the two Governments should establish a timeframe for talks and define the length of the period in which agreement should be reached.  Third, it should be accepted, as we have argued all along, that decommissioning should be part of the talks process and not something on <Col N="2041" /> which prior agreement and movement are required.  Fourth, a liberal regime for the release of politically motivated prisoners, loyalist and republican, should be established once there is a clear commitment to permanent peace. Fifth, action should be taken by the British Government independently of the talks process to enhance quality and parity of esteem and to build confidence and economic and social progress.  Sixth, multilateral talks often prove sterile and there is a case of conducting such talks well out of the public view, as was done originally in the Middle East process. There may also be a case for moving the talks to a neutral location outside of these islands.  It has been suggested in the corridors of Congress that President Clinton should, before or after the election, invite the parties and Governments to Washington to provide an impetus for progress.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House give the highest possible credit to Senator George Mitchell who used all his negotiating skills to facilitate the parties to the Northern talks in making some progress.  We are deeply indebted to him for this.  It is a pity the participants in the talks did not allow themselves to make more use of his skills to bring them into substantive talks.  It will be difficult to find another person of such stature who has the time and inclination to work so hard on their behalf with so little return for that work.  We on this side of the House were instrumental during the pre-Christmas period in lobbying for Senator Mitchell to take up that position.  Most people, excluding the Americans, poured cold water on the idea at the beginning but this view eventually changed.  The Government was correct to listen to us and to support his taking up this task.  I do not blame Senator Mitchell for being absent for a few weeks.  My information is that he does not intend to return for some time. I hope those people who treated him unfairly will at least acknowledge what he tried to do for them and stop some <Col N="2042" /> of the backbiting at which they are so good.</P>
    <P>I was unimpressed by the brevity of the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister last Saturday and the decision by the Prime Minister to absent himself from the dinner held by the Irish Presidency during this sensitive time in Anglo-Irish relations and difficult time for the peace process.  This did not augur well and perhaps the Prime Minister should reflect on this decision.  I have often regretted that relations between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister do not seem, on the face of it, to be of the same quality as the productive relationship between Deputy Albert Reynolds and Prime Minister during the period 1992-94.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the two Heads of Government get together and agree to give fresh impetus to the talks process. The log jams have to be cleared and some of the parties in the North told that a more serious approach is expected of them.  If they meet but achieve nothing we will say nothing about that.  It would be much better for them to have met and tried to show that they are sincere and interested and that other matters do not fill their everyday agendas.  Politicians and those who work in the House understand busy schedules but 15 minute meetings, ten minute phone calls and the failure to attend a State dinner create the impression in the minds of people who may not want to be convinced or who are cynical of the system or who live in communities who have suffered much, that people do not care.  I am not stating that they do not care, but an early summit may help to influence people and have a dramatic effect at a time of crisis.  I call on them to arrange such a meeting.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly refer to the marching season, the Framework Document, the three strand approach and the fact that the Canary Wharf bombing occured between a period of uncertainity and one of movement.  I do not want to discuss these matters in detail but when they are considered one can see why people wrongly believe there is <Col N="2043" /> a way to make progress.  Both Governments should not allow that impression to be created.  I will not list the events which took place but I discussed them with individuals from Sinn Féin and I spoke to loyalist and community leaders.  Arguing against their perceptions of what was achieved is not an easy battle to win.  When these events are analysed &mdash; many excellently documented arguments in that regard have appeared in our national newspapers &mdash; it is not easy to convince them they are wrong.  It is my opinion that every Member of this House believes they are wrong, but we should not play into the hands of those who feel that the use of violence can achieve something.  The record of the past two years does not stand up to analysis and democratic politics and a summit meeting could help us move away from some of those issues and tragedies.</P>
    <P>Political leaders cannot afford to despair, but neither should they engage in foolish optimism when it is not justified.  We need to concentrate minds on the appalling prospects facing us if we do not take every action within our power to halt the slide back into violence.  We must make every effort to do so.  I am only interested in the future.  I cannot change the past, I can merely reflect upon it.  We must work on the future.</P>
    <P>In the early months of this year I raised in this House a matter which, at the time, people stated made no sense. It involves the possible conflict between the Tánaiste's role as President of the European Council and his role in the Northern peace talks.  It is documented in the Official Report that I stated there are Members on the other side of the House who could take responsibility for dealing with the talks.  It is not good that meetings are being changed or that those involved have no track record.  I say this because people involved in the talks have made it known.  I do not believe the Tánaiste can adequately carry out both jobs.  Last week, he was forced to cancel attendance at the important Pittsburgh Conference and at <Col N="2044" /> the Northern talks to establish a European presence at the Middle East peace talks.  This is not a satisfactory situation, and it is not too late for the Taoiseach to reallocate Cabinet responsibilities &mdash; or at Minister of State level, if appropriate &mdash; so that the highest priority is given both to Northern Ireland and the European Presidency.</P>
    <P>My party will continue to do everything possible to contribute constructively to the restoration of peace.  We need calm and responsible leadership combined with quick and decisive action.  The IRA must be left with no excuse for continuing its campaign of violence and this debate will help that process.  I hope that, despite all appearances to the contrary, it is not too late to salvage peace.  I believe it is not too late because I am an optimist and there is still room for manoeuvre.  The future of all of us depends on the outcome of events in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In recent months I spent as much time as any other politician discussing the North with people on all sides of the divide.  We cannot allow the situation to drift to the other side of elections.  If we try to do so in either jurisdiction there will be a return to full-scale violence.  No one should believe that the process can be patched up for a period in the hope that we can return to the agenda in the future.  It is my assessment that this will not work.  The required action must be taken in the weeks ahead.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt last Monday was black Monday for the people of Northern Ireland.  Once again, they could hear sirens blaring and see the emergency services in full flight. They watched hospital doctors describe the injuries inflicted on 30 people.  The IRA had brought violence back to the streets of Northern Ireland.  One eyewitness drew an analogy between her shattered window and the shattered peace process.  Many believed in the <i>de facto</i> ceasefire in place in Northern Ireland. Last Tuesday's admission that the IRA <Col N="2045" /> was responsible for the bombs at Lisburn brought that myth to a shuddering halt.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach agreed to arrange this debate.  He stated that all parties should place on record their outrage at the events in Lisburn. That must be the focus but we must also try to chart a way forward.  Condemnation has a role to play, but democratic and constitutional politicians must ensure that the initiative is seized back from the men of violence and that a vacuum is not created which will allow them to flourish.  Following Monday's bombing and Tuesday's admission from the IRA, all we heard from its associates in Sinn Féin was a perversion of logic as they blamed the Unionists and the two Governments for what happened.  It was stated that the Governments had not set in train meaningful dialogue.  I dismiss that out of hand.  All members of Sinn Féin could do was express regret at the explosions.  Words of regret are inadequate in the face of such barbarity.  The taking of life, whether it is the life of a British soldier, an RUC officer or an innocent civilian, can never be used as a tactic for anyone's political gain.  It is not the way to achieve political progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many who believed that Sinn Féin and the republican movement wanted to embrace the peace process.  I want to question that the assertion.  There was much discussion of TUAS &mdash; the total unarmed strategy &mdash; but we now know it was a suspension of reality to accept it.  The republican movement has been pursuing what a commentator in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 5 October described as the tactical use of the armed strategy.  That movement believes in using violence when it suits and playing at peace when it suits.  We must ask ourselves if it was ever serious about peace.  If it was, why was the London garage where English police discovered ten tonnes of explosives and an assortment of bomb making equipment two weeks ago hired two weeks after the IRA ceasefire in August 1994?  The <Col N="2046" /> cars which carried the bombs in Lisburn were purchased four months ago.  The lorry which carried the bomb that exploded in Canary Wharf last February was stolen and altered before President Bill Clinton visited Ireland earlier this year.  At least ten Tory MPs have been informed by the British police that their names are on an IRA hit-list, that their lives are in danger and they are potential targets.</P>
    <P>In other words, the training, the transportation and the targeting by the IRA has continued apace while its political subordinates in Sinn Féin have been preaching peace.  This begs the question as to whether members of Sinn Féin are merely the glove puppets of the army council.  The identity of those who make up that council has yet to be established but there is every reason to believe that some of its members have been masquerading as peace-makers in Sinn Féin. There is compelling evidence to suggest that the republican movement has been alternating between politics and violence as it sees fit.  For them it is an interchangeable srategy.  I suppose every democratic politician wants to look on the bright side and to understand the republican mind-set, but understanding that mind-set and wanting to be positive does not mean we should replace positive thinking with wishful thinking.</P>
    <P>In making up our minds about the real intention of the republican movement we should reflect on two recent examples of the perverse workings of Sinn Féin and its leaders.  The Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, was quick to dismiss the Taoiseach's much publicised comments in Washington about a real chance of an IRA ceasefire in the short-term.  He wondered from where his optimism and upbeat assessment emanated. Of course he knew otherwise.  Yet, when he was asked this week about the IRA atrocity, he said not to ask him about it because he is not the IRA.  That does not make sense.  He knew there was no possibility of a ceasefire because he knows well what is going on inside the IRA, but when asked to comment on why it carried out such an atrocity he <Col N="2047" /> was quick to tell us we should ask its members and not him.  As far as I am concerned Sinn Féin and the IRA are the one organisation and of course it is convenient for Sinn Féin to try to convince us otherwise.</P>
    <P>The perpetrators of violent acts do not have a place in democratic politics. People must not bomb their way to the talks or use guns, bombs and explosives to get their political way.  Earlier this year when Garda Jerry McCabe was murdered in a cold blooded fashion and his colleague injured I called for contacts to be cut off between the Government at official level and Sinn Féin. That did not happen.  The contacts have remained in place.  I renew that call this morning because after that cold blooded murder all we heard from Sinn Féin were words of regret.  It could not even bring itself to condemn the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána.  The person the Garda want to interview in connection with that murder was released early from Portlaoise prison, is on the run and has not been found.  That should make us realise that if we are ambivalent or believe in appeasing rather than being tough with people, more and more atrocities will occur.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record what was achieved during the ceasefire because I am tired hearing people tell us about the little progress made during that time.  Prisoners were released early from prisons in the Republic, exclusion orders were lifted on certain persons travelling to Great Britain, Border roads were opened and the broadcasting bans on Sinn Féin representatives were lifted.  There was open access for the Government to the White House and elsewhere, the forum was established, troops were withdrawn to barracks in Northern Ireland and many returned home.  The Joint Framework Document was published in 1995 and the Ground Rules for substantive talks were published in April 1996.  The Mitchell Commission was set up to overcome the problems with decommissioning and a talks date was established.  All that happened as a result of peace.  Sinn Féin <Col N="2048" /> achieved more when it was pursuing its peace strategy than when it pursued solely its armalite strategy and it should reflect on that.  Many people suspended their critical faculties, but I would like to believe I did not and I do not propose to say now: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  People must be given the benefit of the doubt.  My party played its part in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to bring people together to try to attain peace and a political settlement, but we are not prepared to be ambivalent when it comes to the attitude that should be adopted towards Sinn Féin.  I hope the Government holds a similar view.</P>
    <P>Talking to Sinn Féin since the Canary Wharf bombing has not achieved anything.  It has not achieved a single change in IRA strategy and that is obvious from the Clonaslee bomb factory.  Martin McGuinness told us if a date were set for all-party talks he and his colleagues would go to the IRA and ask for a ceasefire.  When questioned about that now he claims that as there is not meaningful dialogue there is nothing with which to go to the IRA.  It is time to call Sinn Féin's bluff.  It is time it was made realise it will be isolated in the political wilderness unless it makes up its mind about whether it wants politics or violence and that they are not interchangeable tactics.</P>
    <P>I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Ahern in paying tribute to David Ervine, Gary McMichael and others who, despite the pressure, are still preaching peace.  They have shown remarkable courage and are a source of great inspiration.  One should contrast the way they acted during this process with some of the longer established Unionist politicians.  David Ervine stated recently that as far as he is concerned some people in Northern Ireland suffer too much and others do not suffer at all.  I wonder if some people on the Unionist side were happy with peace and not prepared to go down the road of negotiating a political settlement. Were they merely happy to have peace?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> Last June I described my disillusionment with what I perceived to be happening at the talks process and I reiterate those remarks this morning, even though the Taoiseach chastised me at that time.  Given that it was four years since many of those parties had engaged in dialogue with each other &mdash; not since the talks of 1992 &mdash; it was depressing to watch from the outside as people argued about procedures, wrangled about where they sat and other such matters. That was not inspiring for people in the North or South or for those in the United States who invested so much in the peace process and held out great hopes for the all-party talks.  I hope participants in those talks realise the great onus that is placed on them to make politics work.  When constitutional politics does not work the vacuum is always filled by violence.  The manner in which George Mitchell was treated is a disgrace.  He has the patience of Job and we are fortunate he stayed with the process despite having to return to the United States for a short time.</P>
    <P>The war of words engaged in during the past two years is also disgraceful. There have been rows about decommissioning and definitions.  Arguments about words will get us nowhere.  We must get away from the question of definitions and deal with the substantive issues at stake.  We must deal with the political issues that must be resolved if we are to have a political settlement in Northern Ireland.  Rows about words are doomed to failure.  We will never agree about definitions but, with goodwill, there is hope that we can agree on the substance of the peace settlement.</P>
    <P>I will spell out what I believe is the substance of that settlement.  We must learn an elementary lesson that Northern Ireland is not a homogenous society. Unionists and Nationalists consider themselves mutually exclusive.  In such a society, the models of majority rule, &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; or &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; are doomed to failure and not acceptable. Northern Ireland is as British as it is Irish and the governmental model put in <Col N="2050" /> place there must reflect that reality and the conflicting loyalties and identities of the two communities.  Protestants and Catholics live side by side in the Republic.  Irish Protestants and Catholics live side by side in other parts of the world and if people in Northern Ireland and the political leaders are interested in a political settlement Protestants and Catholics can also live side by side in Northern Ireland and that means the <i>status quo</i> cannot continue. Northern Ireland must become as Nationalist as it is Unionist.  Its nationalism must be economically, socially, legally and institutionally recognised in that society, but that will not happen unless we respect the differing traditions.</P>
    <P>Six basic principles form the basis of the settlement that will have to be negotiated.  I have no doubt there will be a settlement in Northern Ireland.  It may not happen this year or next year, it may even take up to five years to happen because building peace and a political settlement throughout the world is a delicate and slow process.</P>
    <P>The basis of that settlement will be that there can be no internal settlement. There has to be a reinstatement of the relationship between Unionists and Nationalists, between North and South, between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and between the Republic and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The second principle must be that there will be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of the people there wish it.  That must be the starting point. Each party in this House and each party to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, with the exception of Sinn Féin, accepts that basic starting point.  The third principle is that the right of the people of Northern Ireland to choose between belonging to the UK or to a united Ireland does not override the need to have a partnership society in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fourth, we must acknowledge the nature of Northern Ireland's society.  At <Col N="2051" /> present it tilts in favour of unionism. This means that the society is unionist. The British administration at Stormont, the parliamentary representation at Westminster, the flags and emblems and all the elements that go to make up the society recognise that it is unionist.  I would ask Unionists, if the tilt goes the other way would it be right, if the British Government made comments about Northern Ireland, to refer to it as a foreign Government?  Would it be right if MPs at Westminster expressed their concern about what is happening in Northern Ireland, to regard that as impertinent?  Would it be right to describe the BBC, for example, or the culture of the Unionists as foreign and alien?  I put these questions to the Unionists.  That is how they treat Nationalists.</P>
    <P>It is essential to recognise that tilt, and as a fifth principle, that means having North-South institutions and recognising the nationalist identity and perspective.  In the future it may mean recognising an east-west relationship if ever there is united Ireland.  I feel as strongly about that east-west relationship in the context of Northern Ireland as I do about the North-South dimension at present.</P>
    <P>As a sixth principle we must recognise that the strands of the three strand process are not separate.  They draw their strength from each other like a rope, the configuration and strength of which comes from all its strands.  It is wrong to say the Irish Government should have no interest or right to express its views in strand one.  The only way the process will work is if the Dublin, London, Unionist and Nationalist views can be accommodated in one package.  To try to separate them, as many seek to do, is unreal and unhelpful.</P>
    <P>The final principle is that the settlement must come from the centre.  That is the only way to achieve a political settlement.  Worthy as it was to try to bring everybody into the process it was unreal.  That is not to say I did not or do not approve of the talks &mdash; I would love <Col N="2052" /> if they could work.  However, if we cannot get a settlement between the UUP and SDLP or get them to agree about the way forward and stretch across the community divide to negotiate a settlement, how can we ever get those like Bob McCartney, Ian Paisley, Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness to embrace a settlement across the community divide?</P>
    <P>The talks will be doomed and the initiative put in place on 10 June will be destroyed unless a new dynamic is injected to the talks process.  Having spoken to many people in Northern Ireland over a long period about how the situation can be moved forward, I believe there is no point blaming what did or did not happen or how people reacted to different events.  The process was always going to be slow.</P>
    <P>The two Governments should meet the two main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, the UUP and the SDLP.  One Government will not be able to meet the two parties together.  If the UUP is invited to Dublin it will not come and even if it does nothing fruitful will arise.  The Governments should seek to establish a consensus on a way forward from such a meeting.  If that is not possible the current process will quickly slide into oblivion.</P>
    <P>I respect Deputy Bertie Ahern's point about a meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister &mdash; that could be a starting point.  However, unless John Hume and Séamus Mallon and David Trimble and John Taylor can come to a basic agreement that will inject a dynamic into the talks process, it cannot survive.  It will be damaging if it is suspended for a number of months. Postponing it until after the next general election here or in Great Britain will make no difference.  No matter what the Governments do, the main players at the end of the day must be the parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The successful political process in South Africa only came about because of two great men &mdash; Nelson Mandela and F.W. De Klerk &mdash; one of whom had to reach agreement with a man his <Col N="2053" /> government had incarcerated for many years.  There was international pressure and help from many, but it took those two men to make it work, although it was not without its difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is a huge onus on John Hume and David Trimble to make the process here work.  They must ensure Northern Ireland is transformed into a society where Nationalists and Unionists are treated with equality of esteem; a society in which everybody can give allegiance to the police force and in which the flags and emblems reflect the conflicting community allegiances in that society.  It must be a society which institutionalises and recognises nationalism in every sense &mdash; economic, social and legal &mdash; as it does Unionsim.  That involves a role for North-South institutions.</P>
    <P>Above all else, it must be a society where there is a level of trust between the main players.  If there is not a level of trust between David Trimble and John Hume there will be no opportunity to build such a society in the short-term. A minimum level of trust does not mean that people have to love each other.  It means they must respect each other and be prepared to do business with each other.  Constitutional politicians must grasp the opportunity presented to them.  They have the goodwill of this House, of governments everywhere and of the people of Ireland and Britain. They could not have more going for them.  I hope they will not allow the men of violence to fill the vacuum they have created.  I hope they will embrace the opportunity and in so doing we will move away from the gloom that has descended.</P>
    <P>It is hard to be optimistic but we must not give up.  We must insist the process works.  The two Governments should cut the links with Sinn Féin and show they will get tough with them.  That will help the loyalist paramilitaries greatly. If the Governments call a meeting with the UUP and the SDLP the possibility exists to ensure the process is saved and can transform Northern Ireland.  Thus <Col N="2054" /> the peace process could become a peace and a political settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa):</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some media speculation in recent days suggesting that the Lisburn bombing was intended as a so called &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; prelude to an IRA ceasefire.  If this is the case then it reveals a very sick mentality on the part of the republican movement.  The IRA statement a day after the attack seeks to justify the two bombs as being directed at &ldquo;personnel connected with the Thiepval barracks&rdquo;.  Does the IRA not know or not care that many of the people who earn their living from Thiepval barracks are of a Unionist background, the kind of people Gerry Adams refers to as his brothers and sisters?  I suggest to the republican movement that only fascists would define their own family as people you murder and maim in their own ultimate interest.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the IRA bombs in Lisburn on Monday was two-fold: first, to murder and maim the greatest possible number of people and second, to precipitate an end to the loyalist ceasefire.  The fact that no warning was given is clear evidence of the IRA's intent. The second bomb was designed to kill those who survived the first, as well as those who went to their rescue.  This is a tried and tested terror tactic.  What better way to create panic and what better way to delay medical help and treatment for the injured.</P>
      <P>This was wanton violence, a case study in terrorism which cannot be justified under any circumstances.  The IRA's mealy-mouthed statement admitting responsibility was a case study in hypocrisy.  I wonder why it took it a day to issue its statement.  Perhaps it put the same care into syntax as it does into bomb-making, but there is at least one big lie in its statement.  It lied about its intent to provoke loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IRA desperately wants an end to the loyalist ceasefire and has set out in the most cynical and calculated way to achieve this end, yet the IRA seeks to portray itself as defending the Catholics <Col N="2055" /> of Northern Ireland.  The reality is that the IRA defends no one.  It is quite cynically seeking to use vulnerable Nationalists as a means of laundering its image.  Such deceit, and such recklessness should not and cannot go unchallenged.</P>
    <P>It is essential in the interests of unionism and democracy that the loyalist ceasefire is maintained and every support should be given to all those working to maintain it and to any genuine initiative within the republican movement to move away from the veto by the so called Army Council on democracy and progress.  Political violence is morally wrong.  It is futile, and simply adds to the cycle of grief, bitterness and hatred. The IRA knows this full well.  It knows that there is no way that bombs and bullets can unite people except in fear and in death.</P>
    <P>Yet the IRA persists with violence.  It is not so stupid as to believe that it will bring Sinn Féin into all-party talks.  No democratic party could agree to this sick proposition and the message must go out loud and clear from this House that Sinn Féin's participation in all-party talks is dependent on an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire and that IRA bombs invalidate Sinn Féin's democratic posturing.</P>
    <P>The republication movement must be given no comfort on this score.  It must be given no reason to believe that it can bomb its way into negotiations.  The requirements which applied in relation to participation in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation also apply to Sinn Féin's inclusion in all-party talks. Nothing said in this House should lead republicans to think otherwise. Inclusion in democratic negotiations requires adherence to democratic procedure and only to democratic procedure.</P>
    <P>Nothing that has happened or has not happened at the current negotiations provides any justification for violence.  It is true that the talks have been difficult and that it will require a determined effort on the part of all the participants to provide impetus to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> The best response to the IRA bombs is to make that effort.  Democracy must be seen to work.  The legacy of the recent appalling summer must be overcome.  We must not surrender to despair.  All of us have the duty of hope and we must fulfil it.</P>
    <P>It is true that the all-party talks have often been repetitive, tortuous and frustrating.  They are likely to display these characteristics for the foreseeable future, but they are not a sham, they are not irrelevant.  Their inconclusive nature is a thousand times better than the finality of a bomb or a shot from an armalite.</P>
    <P>If we are to move forward we must of course, be governed by a sense of realism, but we must also, in the words of Jesse Jackson, keep hope alive. However, I would caution those who harbour the hope that the outcome of elections both here and in Britain will give them an advantage that they do not at present enjoy.  The broad approach of both Governments enjoys bipartisan support in both Parliaments.  There cannot be an accommodation with those who seek to maintain as an option the right to bomb.</P>
    <P>Marking time until after the next election will not alter the fact that the fundamental issues to be resolved have been exhaustively explored and are well known.  There are no blinding relevations waiting out there to transform our understanding of the tasks ahead.  The legacies we share and the aspirations that have divided us will not changed in one year, five or even ten.  Therefore, now is the time to address the substantive issues.</P>
    <P>First there must be agreement on agendas for the remainder of the opening plenary session of the all-party talks and for the substantive negotiations.  In particular, we need to find, once and for all, a way of dealing with the vexed question of decommissioning.  Progress on this issue can only be made and has to be made alongside negotiations in the three strands.  Our approach throughout has been firmly based on the report of the international body, no more no less, <Col N="2057" /> which recognised that there is an intimate connection between progress on decommissioning and progress on the political front and the growth of political confidence.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning is, technically, a complex issue, requiring specialist involvement but politically it is basically a matter of trust.  Trust will not be won either by jettisoning the question of arms altogether or by according decommissioning a symbolic primacy which is counter-productive in terms of achieving the overriding objective and actual goal of political agreement.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have made proposals for the procedural handling of decommissioning in the opening plenary, which in our view are consistent with the Mitchell report and which, if adopted, would help clear the way for an early resolution of the opening phase of the negotiations and a move into talks on the real issues.  If accepted these proposals would ensure that decommissioning forms a significant stream in the negotiating process.  That is the realistic path to achieving progress on it.</P>
    <P>Unionists have nothing to fear from entering negotiations proper.  Their position is amply protected by a range of measures: the need for sufficient consensus among the participants before agreement on any proposition; the assurances given by both Governments in the Framework Document and repeated in the ground rules that the outcome of the negotiations will be put to referendum North and South, and the full acceptance by the Irish Government, and the overwhelming majority of Nationalists of the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>It is vital for all the peoples of these islands that an honourable accommodation should be found to this chronic and costly conflict.  That is a shared responsibility between both Governments and the political parties, Unionists as well as Nationalist.  All of the parties in these islands have to prove by deeds as well as by words, their determination that the negotiations will succeed.  Both Governments have a particular <Col N="2058" /> responsibility to ensure momentum.  We need to rededicate ourselves to the success of the negotiations and to demonstrate strong and purposeful leadership, while at the same time remaining sensitive to the concerns and requirements of the parties.  This Government, in particular, is eager to play its part in the development of trust and to meet with and respond to any parties which may be sceptical about our intentions and good faith.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has to face the fact that dialogue is messy and difficult, with no assurance of easy or early agreement, but ultimately it is the only process which can bring agreement.  Those people within Sinn Féin who have accepted the realities of political discourse have to persuade their more fundamentalist colleagues of these realities.</P>
    <P>The loyalist parties have won widespread admiration for their sustained ceasefire and positive contributions to the political debate.  It is vital for unionism and democracy that they continue to contribute at this level.  The leaders of the loyalist parties have shown that it is possible to repudiate violence completely while maintaining, and indeed enhancing their political credibility, integrity and influence.</P>
    <P>The IRA is out of step with the overwhelming majority of people on this island who reject violence.  The republican movement would be very unwise to continue to flout the popular will.  It should note the universal revulsion at the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe. There is very little tolerance in this State for political murder and even less acceptance for any supposed distinction between organised crime and political gangesterism.</P>
    <P>Every opportunity has been provided to Sinn Féin to play a full part in democratic politics.  This Government has done everything it possibly could to facilitate Sinn Féin's entry to the mainstream of politics.  It has been given every possible assistance every step of the way and it has taken everything but returned nothing.  Sinn Féin has not completed the journey.  Instead, since 9 <Col N="2059" /> February it has marched to the beat of the IRA drum as a camp follower of violence.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has to come clean with the Irish people.  It can continue to operate as an instrument of IRA propaganda if it chooses or it can function as a democratic political party.  There can be no more prevarication, no more posturing as peacemakers while acting like Pontius Pilate in relation to violence.</P>
    <P>The Irish people, for their part, have made their choice clear.  Their choice is for peace, political dialogue and an honourable accommodation in Northern Ireland.  It is our duty as politicians to see that their wishes are respected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other Members in expressing my deep revulsion and condemnation of the bombing outrage perpetrated by the IRA in Lisburn last Monday.  It is the grace of God that so far nobody has died as a result. That is not the way the IRA planned it. They placed two bombs with the second one timed to explode in a position where they knew casualities from the first one would be handled and dealt with.  Two people are seriously injured and about eight others are still in hospital.  We send the sympathies of this House to those who have suffered injuries.</P>
      <P>The IRA betrayed the Irish people and besmirched the name of republicanism.  We should make it clear, as has been done by all speakers this morning, that there is no place for violence in democratic politics &mdash; they do not and cannot mix.  That incident and the 25 years of terrorism we have endured, other than the short respite we had for the last two years, clearly demonstrates there are responsibilities on terrorists to desist from their actions and for those elected in the democratic process to take action to ensure the political way forward is the right and successful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All parties must rally to support the Government.  That is not to say we can be silenced from criticising the mistakes made.  The Taoiseach said the widely presumed notion that the talks could <Col N="2060" /> ever have been speedy, reflect an inability or an unwillingness to understand and acknowledge the profound and the necessarily divisive nature of the issues that the talks set out to address.  I fully agree with this. However, he went on to say these talks are about the nature of the State.  They are about more than that.  They are about a three strand relationship, how the people of these islands can arrive at a final resolution after hundreds of years and live in peace and prosperity together.  They are about a resolution within Northern Ireland and the creation of institutions which will merit and receive the loyalty and consent of all the citizens within those boundaries. They are about the relationship between the Six Countries and the Republic &mdash; its Government and the people who live there.  They are about the relationship between this island and our neighbours, with whom we have historic links, many of them through difficult and traumatic times.  We are bound together by geography and many other things.  We have to establish a proper relationship which will bridge the next century and millennium.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the apparent misunderstanding of the full nature of the situation, as displayed in the Taoiseach's speech.  It appears he was unwittingly demonstrating his misunderstanding of the depth of feeling.  I understand his continuous efforts to encourage the Unionist mentality and to continue to bend over backwards, which is admirable in his efforts to assure them they have nothing to fear.  There has to be a balance between this and understanding the mindset, desires and aspirations of the Nationalist community.  I fear that balance is sometimes lost.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the difficulty of the talks in his contribution, that they would never be speedy.  The sheer complexity of the issues to be grasped means the Government should use its most experienced and competent team in negotiations and that there should be a level of continuity.  The <Col N="2061" /> Government should re-examine the composition of the team.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern constructively suggested last April that, considering the workload of the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach should seriously consider the composition of the team and the allocation of particular responsibilities in the peace process talks.  It is important to concentrate our minds on this national issue.  One is reminded of Herr Genscher, the German Foreign Minister, who was compared to God, except the difference was that God was everywhere and Herr Genscher was everywhere except Bonn.  We know the Tánaiste sometimes has a godlike self-righteous air.  His workload is such that he is everywhere but Dublin and Belfast.  At this sensitive time we need continuity in relations to the talks process.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the composition of his team at the talks, to ensure we have the greatest level of expertise possible on a continuous basis. This is essential if we are to make progress.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Taoiseach's attitude when he says &ldquo;colonial style imposed solutions will not work&rdquo;.  There has to be leadership from both Governments.  The process has to be driven forward by both Governments.  They cannot stand back and allow themselves to be vetoed every step along the way by Messrs.  Trimble, Paisley and McCartney.  This process requires nothing less than the leadership referred to by the Taoiseach when he talked about what has been achieved &mdash; publication of the Joint Framework Document, detailed communiqués, ground rules, procedural guidelines and draft agendas for all party negotiations.  We have not had one day of substantive talks.  We have had much action but no achievement. Achievement is required at this stage to move the process forward.  We need the type of leadership on this issue being given by my party leader, Deputy Ahern, who has called on both Prime Ministers not to have 15 minutes telephone calls or snatch moments at a <Col N="2062" /> Heads of Government meeting in Dublin, but to sit down face to face without something prepared by their civil servants and to act as political leaders by giving direction and initiative to this stalled process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern outlined six points which were worked out by our party's committee on Northern Ireland on the way forward at this critical time.  He made the point that Government should not be influenced by the politics of the latest atrocity and that what was right a month ago is still right today.  The terms on which Sinn Féin can take part in the talks should not be made more difficult as a result of what happened.  Our view is that the IRA must restore its ceasefire.  Second, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Downing Street Declaration both Governments should establish a timeframe for talks and define the length of the period in which agreement should be reached.  This is not colonial style as interpreted by the Taoiseach.  It is leadership by Governments, not to be dragged back by the weakest link in the chain which is the backbenchers of the Conservative Party as they face into a general election. Leadership is required by our Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>Third, it should be accepted, as we have argued all along, that decommissioning should be part of the talks process and not something on which prior agreement and movement are required.  Decommissioning is essential. Senator Mitchell outlined how it could be handled and we have always supported him.  Fianna Fáil was the only party on these islands that supported Senator Mitchell in advance of the publication of his report and we accepted what he said.  Fourth, a liberal regime for the release of politically motivated prisoners, loyalist and republican, should be established when there is a clear commitment to a permanent peace.  One of the tragedies of the last two years has been that the loyalist and republican prisoners who played such an important role in bringing about the peace process have not been rewarded <Col N="2063" /> for their role and support.  What happened after the republican ceasefire of August 1994 and the loyalist ceasefire of Autumn 1994?  In Christmas 1994, fewer prisoners were released than the previous year &mdash; totally illogical and insensitive; an act of political stupidity by the British Government and the Northern authorities.  What happened?  We have seen the process come under strain.  We have seen bombs going off.  What happened when the bomb went off in Canary Wharf?  Something that could not be agreed, which was a date for talks, was suddenly agreed.  We should not be sending those signals to terrorists.  The last thing Governments should be seen to do is rewarding terrorism, but, quite bluntly, that is what happened after Canary Wharf.  It should not have happened.  It sent the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>Fifth, action should be taken by the British Government independent of the talks process to enhance the quality and parity of esteem.  This brings me to parades and the behaviour surrounding them.  Work has to be done by the commission looking at parades to ensure that it makes an early decision and recommendation.  Otherwise, if we get past Christmas into spring it will be too late for next year and we will have more incidents like Drumcree.  Who wants to go through that again?  We also believe that the British Government must build confidence and economic and social progress.  We badly need that.</P>
    <P>Sixth, multilateral talks often prove sterile.  There is a case for conducting bilateral talks out of public view as done originally in the Middle East.  There is also a case for moving the talks to a neutral location outside these islands.  The need for that was illustrated by Deputy Ahern when he referred to the nonsense at the forum meeting in July when the Alliance Party did not attend.  The only thing discussed by the Unionists was the size of a flag, where they would fly a flag and if a flag was to be flown, something that had been decided by the forum in advance.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to show leadership by calling for a summit <Col N="2064" /> between both Prime Ministers.  I want to refer to yesterday's performance by the Labour Party in the European Parliament.  Surely, there is no clearer indication of a lack of cohesion within the Government.  We are attempting to give proper signals on the need for peace and reconciliation, the need for economic progress arising from that and the fact that there will be support for efforts towards peace and reconciliation from Europe, American and elsewhere, but what do we see in the actions of the Labour Party in terms of peace and reconciliation?  The Vice-President of the Socialist Group in the parliament, a Labour Party representative from Dublin, is promoting a cut of £78 million in EU reconciliation funds for the North.</P>

      <P>The EU Commissioner for Regional Affairs, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies expressed her deep regret over a decision by the European Parliament's budget committee to propose a £78 million cut in the EU special peace and reconciliation fund for Northern Ireland.  For the Government parties to send such a signal at this sensitive time is appalling and outrageous.  We have a serious matter on our hands, the reestablishment of the peace process which the people of both islands treasured, and we need leadership at <Col N="2065" /> Government level.  My party Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has suggested six points of action to the Government in addition to calling for a summit between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.  I ask the Government to listen.  I acknowledge that it listened when we proposed the role for Senator Mitchell. On this occasion, on behalf of those who do not want to see the bomb and the bullet back in our society on a long-term basis, please listen again to the suggestions from my party leader.</P>

      <P>His efforts go back to before Deputy Reynolds's time as Taoiseach.  I have always acknowledged the role played by Deputy Reynolds in building the peace process and changing Fianna Fáil's attitude to Northern Ireland.  Through his efforts he was able to persuade the Fianna Fáil Party who up to then always believed there was only one solution.  He is the one man who acknowledged the principle of consent and how it should be applied to Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, others now seem to be moving away from that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern's leadership of Fianna Fáil is obviously under threat.  He has <Col N="2066" /> always been very positive in regard to Northern Ireland and I hope no member of his party will try to force him, in his own interest, to drive a wedge between the Government and the Opposition on the tragedy of Northern Ireland.  It is a tragedy which, unfortunately, will have its effect not only in the North and Britain but also in the South. We should try to encourage those who have committed acts of violence in recent months to move away from that line.  I hope Deputy Ahern will not be forced by some of his mavericks to drive a wedge between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of Government in their pursuit of peace on this island.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Reynolds, as Taoiseach, played a major role in regard to Northern Ireland.  I also acknowledge that if it were not for the role of President Clinton and the American Government we would not be in the present position and would have gone down a road of total destruction.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the people in mainstream Unionism, Mr. Trimble and Dr. Paisley, did everything in their power to ensure we would not resolve this problem.  Not alone did they make it impossible for Nationalists to take their places at the table, they also attempted to prevent the other wing of Unionism or loyalism, the fringe parties who have played a major role, from taking their places.  Having taken their places they then tried to have the fringe parties removed.  Their contribution to the difficulties in Northern Ireland must be called into question.  It certainly has not been positive.  Perhaps in the next few days they will try to improve the position rather than condemn those who have attempted in recent years to build peace.</P>
    <P>Whereas the British Government has made a major contribution in trying to bring both sides together, unfortunately it too has dragged its heels.  Maybe it has difficulties.  Maybe it is a lame duck Government which does not have the support of the majority in terms of the <Col N="2067" /> line taken by John Major, but the difficulties of Northern Ireland should be placed above the problems of the Conservative Party.  Those problems should be set aside to ensure that whatever is necessary to continue the peace process is done.</P>
    <P>I have always acknowledged that a considerable number of people in Sinn Féin have played a major role in leading that party and the broad republican family along the road of democratic politics.  Unfortunately, there appears to be an element within that organisation who have yet to be convinced.  It would be wrong of us to break links with the people who have taken great risks to bring those who do not concur around to their view.  Nobody expects the IRA to bomb its way to the negotiating table, and deep down it does not believe that is the road to follow &mdash; certainly the vast majority in Sinn Féin do not believe it. Sinn Féin must take courage and tell those in the IRA that enough is enough, that they cannot continue to do what they are doing, plunging this country into a civil war.</P>
    <P>People should listen very closely to what is being said by the loyalist paramilitaries.  They can hold the line only for so long.  They have taken great risks and are constantly under threat not only from the people on the opposite side of the fence but from within their own ranks.  They need our support and that of the British Government.  The British Government must help them by taking action on the prisoner issue.  It was difficult for this Government to extract some small concessions in regard to Irish prisoners in British jails.  The problem remains with loyalist prisoners and unless the British Government tries to alleviate that problem it will contribute to plunging this country into a civil war.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was set up in an effort to build bridges between the various communities.  It is a tragedy that because of the actions of the Provisional IRA at Canary Wharf, that body ceased to function.  Whereas it was being perceived <Col N="2068" /> by some as a pan-nationalist front, it was far from it.  There was an opportunity to bring Sinn Féin into mainstream politics and to debate the problems with them.  It was an opportunity for them to realise that there were people with a different view which would have to be taken on board in any agreement on Ireland which might be reached over the coming years.  Unfortunately, that is not now taking place because of what happened.</P>
    <P>I appeal to members of Sinn Féin who believe that there is only one way, the democratic way, to impress upon their people in the broader republican family, i.e. the IRA, that there can be no solution in the way they are going.  Tell them to stop in the name of the people of Ireland for God's sake.  They must take that leadership role.  It is not enough for any of us to get into the politics of condemnation.  We want to see a pro-active approach from the leadership of Sinn Féin to bring those people on board and not to allow them to bring the rest of us into the depths of a civil war.</P>
    <P>I hope that all sides of this House will remain at one in the interests of building peace and reconciliation on this island, instead of having cheap shots at one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation now developing in Northern Ireland is quite clearly a tragedy.  In the summer of 1994, when the ceasefire was announced, we had tremendous hope. All parts of this country and the world were hopeful that at last we would reach an end to the terrible tragedy that has dominated Northern Ireland for so many decades.  We hoped that people would be serious about getting down to basic dialogue and removing whatever hurdles might be there rather than promoting them.  In the intervening two years we have gone from crisis to crisis while meeting one obstacle after another.  It has been almost impossible to make any real headway.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in trying to do something concerning Irish republican prisoners in Britain and elsewhere.  Both loyalist and republication prisoners were instrumental in bringing about the ceasefire in the first place.  Wide ranging consultations took place with them and they were almost unanimously in favour of the ceasefire declaration which was initially made by republicans in August 1994 and by loyalists in October of that year.</P>
      <P>In the summer of 1995 and again at Christmas that year, I visited Whitemoor, Belmarsh and Full Sutton prisons in Britain.  I made the visits as part of a Labour Party delegation which included Deputy Broughan, Deputy Bree and Senator Maloney.  The visit was made at the request of the prisoners themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious situation we experienced was at Whitemoor where prisoners were incarcerated in an isolation unit.  They were on a dirty protest at the time and were held in windowless rooms.  The lights flickered on during the night so that the prisoners could not get any sleep.  They were not allowed <Col N="2070" /> any exercise or recreation and were given their food to eat without cutlery. One prisoner, who was vegetarian, received large portions of meat covering the vegetables at every meal.  The situation was pretty outrageous but, thankfully, a stop was put to it when we brought it to the attention of the authorities.</P>
    <P>These prisoners had been at the heart of getting the ceasefire up and running but this type of response was seen as demeaning.  Instead of responding to the initiative that had been taken, the authorities appeared begrudging and seemed to be introducing worse conditions than those previously in operation.</P>
    <P>In November 1995 the Transfer of Sentenced Persons legislation was introduced and it has now been operating for almost 12 months.  During that period only two prisoners have been transferred from England under the legislation.  They are Paddy Kelly, who is grievously ill with cancer, and Brendan O'Dowd, who has already served 23 years of his sentence.  The legislation has been operating painfully slowly.  Our Department of Justice has indicated its willingness to receive all republican prisoners currently in British prisons, yet only two have been transferred. That shows an incredible lack of commitment by the Home Secretary and the British authorities.  It is actually undermining the peace process.</P>
    <P>I saw Paddy Kelly last Friday in Portlaoise prison and his medical condition is quite serious.  He has four new growths on his body; one on his back, two under his arms in the glandular area and, perhaps most seriously, one on his groin.  If the growths spread to his liver he will have three to five months left. He will enter hospital tomorrow for surgery to remove the growths.  He was transferred after much pressure and because the cancer seemed to the authorities to be terminal.  He is one of only two prisoners to have been transferred which is a totally inadequate response to the prisoners' families and the prisoners themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> We will travel to Britain again at the end of this months for a further visit to mark the anniversary of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons legislation.  The visit will underline the need to respond in a meaningful fashion to the prisoners' requirements and those of their families.  That in itself will underpin some progress towards getting the ceasefire back on the rails.</P>
    <P>Equally, loyalist prisoners have expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of progress that has taken place since they declared a ceasefire almost two years ago.  The authorities have not responded in the way that should have been expected if people were serious about removing hurdles from the path to progress in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The second area on which I can speak from experience concerns the marches and parades in Northern Ireland this summer.  A Labour Party delegation was at Drumcree, the Lower Ormeau Road and Derry for the Orange marches and the Apprentice Boys' parade.  My experiences at Drumcree and the Lower Ormeau Road were some of the worst I have ever had.  There was a total breakdown of law and order at Drumcree.  The forces of law and order literally stood idly by while Orange thugs patrolled the streets surrounding Drumcree and did what they liked. They brought equipment into the area along with munitions.  After four or five days the situations was so volatile that the RUC chief constable probably had no choice but to allow, or to force, the march through.  When it eventually took place there was unnecessary violence. Mr. Trimble and Dr. Paisley behaved in a most provocative manner and failed to give leadership.</P>
    <P>The Apprentice Boys were much more cohesive and disciplined and entered into negotiations with the Nationalist community and community organisations to reach agreement on the proposed routes with the result that the expected conflict and confrontation did not materialise in Derry, as it did on the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast and <Col N="2072" /> Drumcree.  I hope the new commission will come up with a set of guidelines which will be underpinned by consultation on both sides.</P>
    <P>The response of loyalist leaders in recent days has been very positive.  They have strongly urged their members in a wonderful example of leadership not to do anything rash.  I hope Sinn Féin will do the same and say to the IRA that there is no future in breaking the ceasefire and plunging Northern Ireland into another wave of bombings and killings.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate. There was a row across the floor about the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation moneys.  It was suggested the socialist group in the European Parliament did not support the proposals that these moneys should be slashed this year.  It did.  It is now being suggested that it was a housekeeping exercise.  In the region of £78 million has been diverted to depressed steel and textile regions following acceptance of a proposal from the socialists group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that the take-up of moneys was slow.  For the past six months at least at Taoiseach's Question Time Deputy after Deputy on this side of the House raised the way in which funds have been disbursed in Border areas. ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency were given responsibility for the programme by the Government.  I attended an all party meeting at which the Members who represent Border areas decided to ask the Government to arrange to redirect some of these moneys to Border areas where they are badly needed to put proper industrial infrastructure in place to give us a boost. As Deputy Bradford is aware, when I raised the matter at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body Mr. Séamus Mallon concurred with me but nobody <Col N="2073" /> took any notice of what Oireachtas Members were saying.</P>
    <P>On the breakdown of the peace process, like all other speakers, I condemn the IRA for bringing us back to the brink.  The word &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo; has been used.  This sense of betrayal is felt just as much on this side as on the other side of the House.  Deputy Brian Fizgerald referred to the Tánaiste's record, but many people took risks in initiating the process.  It is for that reason many on this side of the House feel a sense of betrayal at the way the IRA has ruined it.</P>
    <P>I participated in the first direct talks with Sinn Féin in 1988 at a time when it was extremely difficult to meet.  On the morning we were due to meet Sinn Féin eight soldiers in a bus were blown up. We wanted to convince Sinn Féin there was a better way, a constitutional route, to achieve its aims and that it should do what my party did at the end of the Civil war.  Sinn Féin also believed it should do this.  We were never sure whether it could bring the hard men of the organisation with it.</P>
    <P>Nothing happened until September 1994 when the hawks and the doves in the organisation came together to agree an IRA ceasefire.  For 18 months in private and in public, particularly when I was co-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I spent endless hours trying to cajole people to take the constitutional route.  I could not understand why their confidence was undermined.  There was no movement. As Deputy Costello rightly said, the prisoners on both sides, one of the main elements in putting together the peace strategy, were abused.  Instead of making life easier for them it was made more difficult.</P>
    <P>There were warning signals of which my party was acutely aware.  We were always fearful however that in raising the matter in the House, particularly at Taoiseach's Question Time, we would be accused of being too hard on the Government.  Deputy Fitzgerald alleged that in some way we are trying to drive <Col N="2074" /> a wedge between the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach but nothing could be further from the truth.  My party leader put it extremely well about six months ago. Even then the outlook was bleak.  He said that because of the EU Presidency the Tánaiste unfortunately would not be in a position to have a hands on approach.</P>
    <P>We have tried our best to cajole the Government into taking action.  From speaking to people, including non-politicians, who were involved from the outset in developing the Nationalist consensus &mdash; it is clear that what hit the nail on the head was the Taoiseach's refusal to meet John Hume and Gerry Adams when such a meeting was requested. That refusal sent out the wrong signal to the people whom Gerry Adams had been trying to convince to follow the constitutional route.  It was the death-knell of the consensus we tried to encourage whereby the SDLP and Sinn Féin in the North, and the main Nationalist opinion in the South &mdash; normally portrayed by Fianna Fáil &mdash; came together.  That process was based on the belief that there would be a compromise among those parties.  There was such a compromise but, unfortunately, it was rebuffed not only by Unionists but by Unionism, backed up by the British Government whose spokesperson, Mr. Mayhew, stated in the House of Commons that he could not force the Unionists to the table.  That attitude persists to the present day and it is the reason our leader asks the Taoiseach to insist on a summit between the two Governments. History has proved that the only way a British Prime Minister will come to the table, and entice others to come to the table, is by exerting pressure but, unfortunately, that was not exerted in the past two years.</P>
    <P>I attended a British-Irish Association conference in Cambridge the weekend the IRA called its ceasefire.  During one session, mainly middle class Unionists spoke about the future.  I was astounded at their attitude when they said that until every bomb and bullet is handed over, they would not talk to Sinn Féin. <Col N="2075" /> I did not participate in the discussion for some time because I felt it was mainly a Northern interest discussion, but I eventually said I could not believe what I was hearing.  I told them that for the first time in 26 years they were facing the possibility of peace in their part of this island, yet they were not prepared to go forward in a positive way.</P>
    <P>A year ago in Cardiff I attended a meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body at which Mr. Ancram was questioned.  I questioned him on the phrase &ldquo;some decommissioning&rdquo; which had been used by him.  He could not tell me what he meant by &ldquo;some decommissioning&rdquo;, but Mr. Trimble uses such language even to this day.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may say otherwise but I am absolutely convinced the attitudes portrayed at that meeting of the British-Irish Association, and the attitude of Mr. Ancram last year, reflected a Unionist agenda.</P>
    <P>Many people were taken with the six principles in the Mitchell document, which was painstakingly put together. Paragraph 15 of that document, however, is the most important of all.  It states:</P>
    <P>But a resolution of the decommissioning issue &mdash; or any other issue &mdash; will not be found if the parties resort to their vast inventories of historical recrimination.  Or, as it was put to us several times, what is really needed is the decommissioning of mind-sets in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Roy Magee once used the phrase &ldquo;decommissioning of the tongues&rdquo;.  Paragraph 18 of the Mitchell document states:</P>
    <P>However the issue of decommissioning is resolved, that alone will not lead directly to all-party negotiations.  Much work remains on the many issues involved in the political track.  The parties should address those issues with urgency.</P>
    <P>What have we seen for the duration of the talks?  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, who is in the Chamber, has <Col N="2076" /> participated in the talks.  I do not envy him his task.  We talk about consent, to which Deputy Fitzgerald referred.  Consent is important but one man's consent is another man's veto.  &ldquo;Compromise&rdquo; is the correct word to use.  There has been compromise on the Nationalist side but, unfortunately, there has not been any compromise on the Unionist side.  That is the reason the talks process is not moving forward.  Unionists know if they move forward they will have to compromise.  The ultimate fault in that respect lies with the British Government because it is not prepared to tell Unionists they have to compromise, and that they must live with the Nationalists on this island.</P>
    <P>We constantly talk about the three strand process but I question the commitment of the Unionist parties, particularly the Ulster Unionist Party, to the three strand process because it issued its own document where, in effect, it wanted to jettison the North-South institutions and establish its own bodies which would have no effect.  Unionists must be forced to recommit themselves to the three strand process if we are to move forward.</P>
    <P>I have always tended to be optimistic about Northern Ireland but in recent months I have been extremely pessimistic.  The reason we are at this impasse is because the two Governments reduced the pressure in the past two years.  That is a shame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support holding this debate on the current situation in Northern Ireland.  The escalating polarisation of the two communities in the North is a source of the most acute alarm and concern for all who have a deep commitment to the future stability and well-being of all the peoples of this island and our neighbouring island.  It challenges the strength of our democratic institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the challenge is both clear and formidable.  Before addressing the precise nature of the challenge and the options open to us to do everything in our power to restore peace and hope, <Col N="2077" /> I will comment briefly on the general political response to the atrocity at Lisburn on Tuesday last.</P>
    <P>In general we heard the usual totally justifiable criticism of the cruelty and cynicism of the bombing.  I am deeply concerned, however, about the almost total reliance on facile condemnation by certain politicians.  Such a response is totally inadequate and seriously undersells the potential of our political system to successfully tackle the problem.  It goes almost without saying that everybody committed to the political process in managing a society repudiates the use of violence in solving problems.  It is barbaric, out of date and there is no place for it.  We must go on from here because our commitment to the concept of society is meaningless if we do not fully recognise the intrinsic value, integrity and dignity of every human life.  Similarly, we are committed to taking every possible step to ensure the safety of all individuals.  Such a philosophy is an implicit part of the mind-set of every person who works for the common good.</P>
    <P>While it is both necessary and reassuring for many people to hear politicians reiterate their total abhorrence of violence, it must be but a first step in responding to the appalling crisis in the North.  For the remainder of my contribution I will focus almost exclusively on what I consider to be the predominant necessity.  This involves encouraging every possible effort and initiative which will reopen the door to peace and social cohesion in Northern Ireland and encourage a move away from the sterile and utterly failed policies of violent conflict and bigotry.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely necessary to acknowledge the tremendous benefits of goodwill and diplomacy which yielded such a welcome dividend in August 1994.  Up to that time &mdash; for nearly a quarter of a century &mdash; we had a dreadful and depressing sequence of atrocity, condemnation, further atrocity and further condemnation.  Very many people both inside and outside political life in <Col N="2078" /> Ireland and the UK made outstanding efforts to move those committed to violent struggle in the direction of peace. That was not an easy job.  We have to salute the leadership of people like John Hume, Albert Reynolds, Gerry Adams and John Major, because they were pivotal in the process which resulted in the attainment of the much longed for ceasefire of the main protagonists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As well as providing an atmosphere of peace and hope, the ceasefire had one other major side benefit, particularly from the perspective of southern Nationalists.  That was the emergence of leaders like Billy Hutchinson, Gary McMichael in particular, and David Ervine.  It was refreshing to hear those people who steadfastly pursued the Unionist line in Northern Ireland but who did not reiterate the same old line of the traditional Unionists.  That was a welcome development because they communicated a message which, while reaffirming a strong commitment to the political and cultural allegiances of the Unionist people of Northern Ireland, also acknowledged explicitly a clear acceptance of the rights of the Northern Nationalist minority to their beliefs and aspirations.  After a generation of listening to the appalling sectarian and bigoted utterances of a number of Unionist representatives, perhaps best epitomised by the leader of the DUP, the clear acceptance of the need for inclusiveness and understanding shown by the new Unionist leaders has been extremely welcome.  The future of Northern Ireland, indeed the totality of these islands, can and will be secured if we make every possible effort to build on the very many positive signs of willingness to accept change, particularly among those people I mentioned.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that there is not normal democracy in the North.  There are two divided communities, and those people who talk about majorities and minorities have the story wrong from the start.  How is it that local communities and councils can, at that level, do positive and constructive work whereas <Col N="2079" /> in the national fora they cannot agree even on an agenda?  I suggest strongly that in the medium and long term we pursue local government in the development of the whole political process in the North.  It has been shown to work there to the very great benefit of both communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Paul Bradford.  It would be deeply regrettable if the decommissioning issue were to prevent the peace negotiations from moving ahead to explore the lines of a possible agreement.  For that reason, and because of the limited time available to me, I will confine my remarks to that subject, although I would like to deal with some other matters as well.</P>
      <P>A key and essential objective of the negotiations must be the complete removal of the gun from Irish politics. Indeed, the six Mitchell principles on which the talks are founded require commitment to the verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary arms.  The question is not, therefore, whether all weapons should be decommissioned but, rather, how this goal can best be achieved.  Full decommissioning will only come about on a voluntary basis. This necessarily requires the co-operation of those actually in possession of the weapons.  No matter how desirable it may be, decommissioning cannot with any plausibility be instantly demanded irrespective of the political context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Viewed from this perspective, the decommissioning question could certainly have been better handled during 1995.  Unattainable criteria were set and served both to reduce Nationalist confidence and to foster unrealistic Unionist expectations.  Nevertheless the international body established by the two Governments chaired by Senator George Mitchell plotted a way out of this morass.  It did so with great skill and balance.  It is clear that decommissioning can happen only on a mutual basis, that is, through the involvement of both sets of paramilitaries.  That <Col N="2080" /> mutuality will, plainly, only be possible if all parties are present at the negotiations and believe that they have been fairly involved in reaching a favourable compromise.</P>
    <P>Actual decommissioning will only take place, therefore, as a result of intensive discussions running alongside political negotiations in which both Sinn Féin and the two loyalist parties are full participants.  To insist, as some are doing, on unworkable decommissioning preconditions is, in essence, to ensure that decommissioning can never happen.  That would be a great irony in itself.</P>
    <P>The proposal, put confidentially by the two Governments to the Ulster Unionist Party, reiterated our commitment to work with all other participants in the negotiations to implement all aspects of the international body's report, that is, the body chaired by former Senator George Mitchell.  We suggested that a committee be established to work to secure that goal, operating in parallel with the substantive political negotiations.  As a demonstration of our good faith and determination to ensure that there would be no blockages on our part, our Government and the British Government have said they would introduce enabling decommissioning legislation in their respective parliaments.  Details of that legislation were spelled out very clearly to the Unionist parties so that as progress is made on political issues the legislative framework would be enacted, if necessary, by Christmas.  We would also make available a range of expert personnel, including independent experts of international standing who, it is envisaged, would play an appropriate part in the work of a verification commission when that is subsequently established.</P>
    <P>Despite all this, and the compromises which it involved, regrettably, the Ulster Unionist Party responded to this proposal by calling a press conference and publishing its own proposals which, in essence, look for agreement to be reached on an entire and timetabled decommissioning scheme in advance of any substantive debate on political <Col N="2081" /> issues.  It has also demanded that, following the entry of Sinn Féin to the negotiations after an IRA ceasefire, there should be, during a so-called catch-up period, a first instalment of actual decommissioning before it could enter into political negotiations.  This would, in essence, involve a return to the so-called Washington III criterion, involving substantial up front decommissioning ahead of any talks, and would depart radically from the report of the international body.  Such a departure would have as its effect not the achievement of decommissioning but the destruction of the prospect of ongoing inclusive negotiations.</P>
    <P>The only realistic way to achieve the decommissioning which we all want is to advance on the basis of all aspects of the Mitchell report.  This Government would welcome total decommissioning tomorrow.  To the utmost possible extent we will do all we can to disarm paramilitaries through the actions of our security forces, but we must not confuse that necessary exercise with the goal of voluntary decommissioning by those who hold illegal weapons.  Unionists may say that instead of engaging with them we are, despite many rebuffs, continuing to woo Sinn Féin.  They may say that we have to make a choice between one or the other.  We reject totally the necessity of any such choice.  We want to engage with the Unionists.  We were ready to get into substantive negotiations back in June, with or without Sinn Féin's presence, and we remain ready now.</P>
    <P>None of the delays in moving the process forward can be attributed to our Government and I can say that with great personal conviction having been involved in practically all of those negotiations.  Nor do we ask for any special treatment for Sinn Féin.  There has to be an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  Moveover, it would clearly be necessary for Sinn Féin, like everyone else, to make clear its commitment to the six Mitchell principles and to advance all aspects of the Mitchell <Col N="2082" /> report alongside meaningful negotiations.  Clearly the recent actions of the IRA continue to widen the credibility gap which Sinn Féin itself will ultimately have to confront and overcome.</P>
    <P>The factors which led us to seek an inclusive process in the first place involving all the parties to the conflict remain valid today.  It may be that such a process will prove impossible to create, not least if republicans are unable to make a commitment to peaceful and democratic means.  It behoves the rest of us not to make decommissioning an obstacle, to stymie those inclusive negotiations which, in the end, are the only means of achieving decommissioning.  In these difficult times and circumstances the responsibility on democratic political leaders to offer a way forward and to demonstrate the primacy of politics over the bullet and the bomb is compelling and absolute.</P>
    <P>Time is running out and there is no doubt the negotiations are in difficulty. We are in a very frustrating process.  We took a long time to get by the rules of procedure but that was done.  We are locked in discussions about decommissioning but we need to enter into real negotiations on the substantive issues in the three strands and we need to do it quickly and to prove that compromise and political accommodation are possible because the alternative is chaos and a return to the nightmare of the past 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the ceasefire of September 1994 this is the third or fourth occasion on which we have had a substantive political debate on the Northern Ireland issue.  Apart from the debate which took place in the aftermath of the IRA ceasefire in 1994, on each occasion since we have been speaking about a situation that has deteriorated to a certain extent.  There were doubts and fears about the future of the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the problem which has been of concern was that the expectations in 1994 would always be difficult <Col N="2083" /> to realise.  Everybody was absolutely thrilled with the decision to call a ceasefire in 1994 but too many people felt that the problems not simply of 25 years warfare but of 800 years could disappear in a short few months or years.  That was never going to be the position.  Doubts can be cast about how matters proceeded over the past two years and some will say progress was slow.  That is a valid criticism.  On the other side of the equation we have to recognise that too many of us expected that problems which were generations old could be solved in a few weeks or months.  It could not be done in 1994, it cannot be done in 1996 and it will not be done in 1997.  Anyone who expects there is a new way forward and that we can find a magic formula that will come like a thunderbolt and dissolve the problems of generations is living in cloud cuckooland.  The factors which prevailed in 1996 are the same as those which existed in the 1980s and in the 1990s &mdash; a divided community, a divided people, doubts, fears and threats.  Those are the factors we have to deal with today and they are no different from those which prevailed in the summer of 1994.  It requires time, patience, political skill and goodwill all round and let us hope we have those qualities in abundance.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Dermot Ahern who spoke about the Nationalist consensus which was gradually built up over a number of years and which, in a sense, came to fruition in the summer of 1994.  He felt a very wrong signal was given to that overall Nationalist consensus when the Taoiseach refused to meet Gerry Adams and John Hume during the summer of 1995. That point has been made by a number of commentators.  That sort of wrong signal on the part of the Government would surely pale into insignificance in comparison with the wrong signals which are given every time a bomb explodes, a punishment beating takes place or a ceasefire breaks down.</P>
    <P>The Government must reach out as far as possible to the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland who have always <Col N="2084" /> felt isolated and under threat.  Equally representatives of militant republicanism have a duty to reach out to the Unionist community in Northern Ireland and not to give the type of wrong signal which the bomb and the bullet give.  There will always be faults all round and there will be a requirement always to be critical of all sides. The worst signal that can be given from any side is that of the bomb or the bullet and that is why the events of the past week have been so damaging both in the short term and in the long term.</P>
    <P>It is always necessary, and it was absolutely necessary this week, that the Taoiseach and the Government be strong in their words of condemnation concerning what happened in Lisburn. There can be no part in a new Ireland for the politics of bombs and bullets.  We are being repetitive when we say that but we have to keep saying it because apparently some people are not listening.  Progress was not made on any side during 25 years of terrible warfare in Northern Ireland and it will not be made by that means over the next 25 years.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise there will not be a military solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  It is important that both Governments, both police forces, and everyone involved in security throughout the island should remain vigilant and try to do everything possible to deal with the security risk to the people and to the State.  There is an onus to protect the security of the State. We have to realise also there will not be a military solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  While there is even one man on the mountain with a dangerous dream and an armalite in his hand there will always be a military problem which can be resolved only by political methods and means.</P>
    <P>I add my strong words of condemnation of what happened during the week.  I condemn it out of hand.  It has nothing to do with the building of a new Ireland.  We have to reach beyond condemnation and try to reach forward <Col N="2085" /> towards a political settlement.  Reference was made here to changing the mindsets and decommissioning but we have to make that extra effort to understand the mindsets of the people who feel they can make political progress through bombs and bullets.  We in this House find that difficult to understand because we condemn that concept totally.  That mindset which is unfortunately prevalent in a strong minority of people will have to be tackled.  Until that mindset is changed there will be always the one man or woman willing to let off a bomb or to fire a bullet.  That will always cause political problems until we can change that mindset.</P>
    <P>We must continue to reach out in an even-handed fashion to Unionists and Nationalists.  Both communities are part of the problem and must be part of the solution.  The two communities have made progress in recent years but they have also shown glaring weaknesses and a lack of willingness to compromise and understand.  The failure of the Unionist community in this respect is sadly evident, particularly from a political perspective.  There is an unwillingness by their political masters to accept what has been the position of the Government for the past 25 years, that is the policy of consensus which was so clearly enunciated in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Joint Framework Document and Downing Street Declaration.  What more does the Government have to do and what more does the public have to say to reassure Unionists that we have no desire to force them into a united Ireland through the bomb and bullet?</P>
    <P>I believe ordinary Unionists are much more advanced than their political representatives.  I accept that during the elections in Northern Ireland last spring the Unionist electorate showed a marked willingness to vote for the traditional Unionist parties rather than the newer and more progressive Unionist parties.  However, when a community feels under threat, as the Unionist community in Northern Ireland obviously does, people tend to vote for certainty, <Col N="2086" /> conservatism and extremism rather than the more moderate middle ground.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with the leadership being given to ordinary Unionists who I believe are willing to try to carve out a new future.  The majority of Unionists realise that they will not be forced into a united Ireland and that this is not part of the Government's plan.  However, their leadership does not share the same advanced thinking and is not willing to take part in real and genuine negotiations.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the equation, Nationalists and, in particular, the representatives of militant nationalism in the North, must show the same willingness.  Some speakers said that Nationalists had made some compromises.  This is true to some extent but until such time as the leaders of militant nationalism, namely Sinn Féin, put on record their acceptance that there can be no military victory over Unionists and that there can only be a political settlement and solution it will be difficult to get everyone to the talks table.</P>
    <P>I join with other speakers in calling for a new IRA ceasefire.  While the talks process is not making progress as quickly as we would wish it is still the only way forward.  I encourage both Governments and political parties in the North to show the necessary imagination and courage and to make the necessary compromises to give us a new and better Ireland.</P>

    <P>I am opposed to and condemn all violence irrespective of where it comes from.  The bombing in Lisburn this week was wrong from a moral and tactical point of view.  Violence has many sources and natures and to selectively condemn violence from one side without understanding the underlying violence of the whole society that is Northern Ireland is to ignore the problem and not bring about a solution.</P>
    <P>I hope Sinn Féin has the confidence to see that it can achieve much more through democratic politics, by mobilising Nationalist opinion and by trying to persuade those who see the UK as a better alternative to an independent Ireland that they are wrong.  It would make much progress in the long term by going this road.  I have been open and unequivocal in my promotion of this idea over a long period.</P>
    <P>We will not solve the problem by engaging in ritual condemnation.  We can only solve the problem if we understand the fundamental nature of it.  The problem is that approximately half the community in the sub-state of Northern Ireland does not feel any natural allegiance to the ruling state.  Words such as &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; are used in relation to the North.  These types of emotive words are purposely designed to convey a certain idea.  The one thing we can never get away from in regard to the North is that there is a largely disaffected Nationalist community, a large number of whom vote for Sinn Féin because they fundamentally disagree with the position in which they have been placed, a position which they regard as essentially anti-democratic. <Col N="2088" /> British Ministers constantly refer to the &ldquo;greater number&rdquo;, but to have rigged the numbers in the first place is an insult to the intelligence of Nationalist Ireland.  It also puts back the day when a solution can be found to the problem.</P>
    <P>I hope even at this stage that Sinn Féin can persuade the IRA there is only one way forward and that as a united people working with our Unionist fellow Irish people we can achieve much more than we ever can with the bomb and bullet.  Since the 1994 ceasefire &mdash; which I believe most people privately accept caught it on the hop &mdash; the British Government has done everything in its power to convince everybody and, in particular the IRA, that the opposite is true.</P>
    <P>I have often had arguments with prisoners about the effectiveness of violence.  They are very quick to point out that nothing happened until after the Canary Wharf bombing.  It is very difficult to argue that point when it is put straight to you face to face.  They point to that incident in arguing that the British Government understands only one language.  When the opportunities were available and there was no violence, there was no movement.  There was only obstructionism and the creation of total stagnation.</P>
    <P>On Monday, before the bomb exploded in Lisburn, a radio commentator asked me whether I would prefer if the talks were suspended until after the British general election or, alternatively, if they broke down.  I replied that neither scenario was acceptable, that stagnation of that kind promoted the feeling common among Nationalists that the talks are going nowhere and that the belief that everything in Ireland must await the convenience of English politics had undermined the peace process.  I drew an analogy with a person riding a bicycle and I stated that when the bicycle is going forward there is reasonable stability but when it begins to slow down it begins to wobble.  Essentially, that is what happened with the peace process.  When the rate of progress slowed down and there was no <Col N="2089" /> movement on a bill of rights, the issue of prisoners, changes to the court system and the other injustices involved in this situation, the entire peace process came off the rails.</P>
    <P>I received a letter dated 12 September 1996 from Joe O'Connell, a prisoner in Full Sutton Prison, a week after I visited him.  I quote:</P>
    <P>My own view as regards the ceasefire is that it should never have been called off and I've stated as much in a letter published in AP/RN last February and nothing that's happened since has changed my view that it was a bad decision by the IRA to return to the armed phase.  I am more than hopeful at the moment that the IRA will restore its ceasefire before too long.</P>
    <P>That is very interesting when one realises the Joe O'Connell was removed from Full Sutton Prison within the week and placed in solitary confinement in Liverpool.  He is known to write publicly to newspapers on his own behalf to promote the peace process.  A prisoner who has realised, and publicly stated, that the peace process is the only way forward is suffering punishment for his beliefs in British prisons.  He has already served 20 years in prison.  How can we persuade his colleagues that he is on the right track when this sort of thing happens to those who openly support peace?  How can they be persuaded that there is justice under British rule?  It is very difficult to do so.  If we want to understand the IRA and the republican mentality in Northern Ireland, we must understand these realities.  How can we explain to Joe O'Connell that that is what he gets for his trouble when someone such as Lee Clegg is released from prison after four years?</P>
    <P>Having destroyed the republican ceasefire by procrastination, the use of completely unfair and illegal treatment, delaying every possible process, refusing the transfer of a 70 year old man due for release next January and sitting on every other prisoner transfer until taken <Col N="2090" /> to court, the British have done their best to destroy what was the greatest moment in our history: the dawning of peace.  I hope they listened to Pastor Ian Major speaking on RTÉ radio this morning who stated that there should be immediate movement on the issue of the loyalist prisoners.  Having broken one ceasefire, will the British persist in refusing to give anything to the loyalists and recognise the difficulties in which the loyalist paramilitaries find themselves?  Will the British once again draw them back into violence?  In its dealings with this country, is it beyond the wit of the British Government to understand the nature of the problem we face and have the wisdom to see that much more will be achieved to bring about peace through generosity of spirit than through tough security measures?</P>
    <P>Over the years, many Members have correctly paid tribute to the late Senator Gordon Wilson.  I believe he was and is worthy of every tribute ever paid him. What made him so different from other people was that, in the hour of crisis, instead of calling for revenge and increased security measures, he held out the hand of friendship to those who hurt his nearest and dearest.  If we believe he was right and did more for peace in Ireland than all the security measures in place, surely the greatest testament we could build to his memory would be to act with generosity and stop trying to solve a political problem through security methods.</P>
    <P>The speech by the Taoiseach this morning does not contain many new ideas.  The Government continues to discuss a solution to this problem with or without the republicans in the North and with or without Sinn Féin.  Someone pointed out a number of years ago that if talking to the Alliance Party would solve the Northern Ireland problem there would be no problem because that party was never involved in violence. We must face the political reality in the North.  We must acknowledge that because of its creation and maintenance and its legacy of discrimination, many <Col N="2091" /> people see the legitimacy of using violence to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>Most states and peoples throughout the world do not rule out the use of violence in all circumstances.  I hope that people in Ireland do rule out its use.  As a nation, a state or a people, the British &mdash; and other peoples throughout the world &mdash; do not rule out the use of violence when what they consider their vital interests are challenged.  Let us recognise it as a political problem and develop political solutions.  There must be all-party talks.  There is no point in not talking to all the parties.  We must reach that point and create the circumstances for doing so in a positive way, not by erecting bogus barriers such as decommissioning.  We must remove the various difficulties to reach all-party negotiations.  Those must be real negotiations with a fixed time limit.  They must not be permitted to continue year after year thereby breaking the patience of those trying to move away from the path of violence towards a political solution.</P>
    <P>The situation of Northern Unionists is not the same as that of the Nationalist community when it comes to talks. Unlike the Nationalists, they are represented at the talks by, as they see it, their legitimate Government.  Their input to the talks must be predicated and the final decision on their position must rest with what they recognise as their sovereign Government.  If the Nationalists in the North had a part in electing this Parliament, I would say the same to them.  Irrespective of party allegiances, everyone in this House accepts the right of the Government to negotiate on our behalf because the people we represent have a part in electing that Government and believe it represents them.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Unionists believe they are citizens of the United Kingdom and that it is a legitimate state. As democratically elected politicians they have to bow to the will of their parliament and Government.  Unfortunately, because of <Col N="2092" /> the creation of that state the Nationalists, particularly republicans, who have never accepted its legitimacy, are not in a similar position.  They do not have an opportunity to elect Members to this House and they do not recognise the British Government as their legitimate Government.  That is why they must be directly represented at the talks.</P>
    <P>We talk of democracy and peace.  As Deputy Flaherty stated from the Government benches, the British have undermined democracy.  We have tried to build faith in democracy and some of us even went to the trouble of visiting prisoners to explain the democratic route.  We argued for the democratic route and said we could bring about change democratically.  One of the greatest tragedies of the past two and a half years was the manner in which representations, made by democratically elected politicians in this House, about serious miscarriages of justice in respect of republican prisoners were ignored.  Undermining democracy in that way helps feed the beliefs of those in the republican movement who have always believed in violence.  It strengthens their hand against those arguing for a new way.  If we are serious about trying to achieve peace, the three major protagonists must see that the way forward is through generosity.</P>
    <P>I hope the loyalists and Unionists stay their hand in returning to violence. They have shown fantastic courage in the past two years.  In resisting the temptation to return to violence I hope they continue to give that good example. Even at this late stage I hope Sinn Féin talks to the IRA and persuades its members that their tactics are merely detrimental to their cause and that a united Nationalist people could do more than violence to achieve legitimate political goals.  Even at this late stage the British Government should show the generosity that has been lacking in its movements on the peace process.  It should show generosity to loyalist prisoners and the republican community. That would do more than ritual condemnation to bring about peace.

      <P>Those who are, or appear to be, ambivalent about the question of violence tend to adopt a cynical and perhaps contemptuous attitude to what they call the politics of condemnation.  The most important message that must emanate from this House is a clear and unambiguous chorus of condemnation of IRA activities.  There can be no ifs or buts about that.  Members on all sides must sing from the same hymn sheet and send out an all-party united message in that regard.</P>
      <P>The IRA broke the ceasefire last February at Canary Wharf.  While that was a shock for everyone, the way in which the bombing was carried out in Lisburn last Monday marked a new low in a sordid saga of IRA terrorism.  There is something sick about purposely setting off a second bomb to murder and maim human beings going to the aid of those injured in a first explosion.  It is difficult to grade the degrees of condemnation, but I am heartily sick of the IRA.  It is the scourge of this country and I am glad to hear unanimous condemnation of its activities from all sides.</P>
      <P>How often must the IRA be told the Irish people have no time for its unchristian and evil behaviour?  How often must it be told it does not have a mandate from anybody for what it is doing. While its members wade through the blood of innocent people to achieve their objectives they are putting themselves further and further away from those stated objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to go further than a chorus of condemnation at this stage.  We must examine new ways in which we can express that condemnation and deal <Col N="2094" /> with the scourge of the IRA.  I compare the godfathers of the IRA to the drug barons who are similarly wreaking havoc on this island.  The best way to deal with drug barons is to expose them. Is there some way in which the godfathers of the IRA can be exposed and held up to public opprobrium?  Why should they be allowed to continue in the mysterious shadowy way in which they have conducted themselves in the past?  Why can they not be exposed in the manner in which the drug barons were exposed following Veronica Guerin's death?</P>
    <P>Let us give a clear message not only to the IRA but to the sneaking regarders &mdash; the accomplices before the fact &mdash; who provide funding and safe houses for those involved in these acts.  They should be told to lock up their houses because there is no future in their activities.  There is a need for the Governments, in particular the UK Government, to be sensitive to public opinion. I mentioned this following the death of Diarmuid O'Neill.  It seemed that this young man, who was a member of the IRA, was shot in cold blood without explanation.  If that was so, it was against the rule of law.  There may be an explanation and I will wait to hear it because an explanation is called for. Apart from the wrong of anybody breaking the rule of law, particularly the forces of law and order, it must be borne in mind that inflaming public opinion only lends support to those involved in terrorism.</P>
    <P>There is an air of great gloom with regard to the political process. However, there are structures in place which, if properly used, can lead to dialogue which will offer hope for the future.  There are the Mitchell principles and the Framework Document which are sound bases for negotiation.  They are acceptable to all constitutional political parties and they ask no preconditions of any of these parties.  That is the basis on which a political settlement will be arrived at ultimately.</P>
    <P>There are two philosophical points which need to be considered in relation <Col N="2095" /> to the peace process.  I will put them forward with some difference for discussion.  The first is whether there is a real prospect of making substantial progress at the moment.  There are two opposing views in Northern Ireland and they will have to be reconciled if we are to have a political settlement.  Therefore, compromise is needed.  We could blame the old enemy and talk about Britain interfering in Ireland's affairs or we can look at the matter rationally and ask whether the upcoming general election in the UK is the most appropriate time to secure the compromise I mention.</P>
    <P>The Unionists and the Nationalists will have to compromise if there is to be a settlement.  Given that the parties in Northern Ireland are facing a general election it is not the best time to try to secure a compromise.  There is a case to be made for accepting that reality and accepting that there will be delays in bringing the peace process to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>While there are positive signs in relation to the peace process there is a stalling process in operation at present. I do not expect to see substantive progress or compromise before the next UK general election.  I would take that reality into account in my policy on the peace process.  It may be that the train of peace is stalled because of this. However, all is not lost because it is still on the rails.  The next major impetus may not occur until after the general election in the UK but if so, so what? We have waited long enough for a settlement and, provided we put our minds to it and accept some loss of time in the immediate future, we can still stay on track.</P>
    <P>The second philosophical point is the question of all-party inclusive talks &mdash; to what degree they will lead to a settlement or whether it will be possible to get all parties to agree to a settlement. If one examines other countries one always finds that the extremes never agree.  It is the right approach to try to involve all parties and to have inclusive talks.  However, I am not in favour of <Col N="2096" /> giving the extremes on either side a veto on a settlement.  That is why I favour the approach of sufficient consensus.  If it is not possible to get all parties to agree, let us go ahead as a strategic aim on the basis of securing sufficient consensus.</P>
    <P>In the Middle East peace process Mr. Arafat and Mr. Netanyahu are talking again.  Will it ever be possible for Hamas to agree to whatever final arrangement may emerge?  Is it possible that the fundamentalist rabbis will agree to any settlement?  I think not.  Attempts should be made to involve them but if they are not prepared to discuss a rational compromise they have to be excluded.  A similar situation may arise in regard to a settlement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are positive signs so we should not be totally gloomy, despite the awful behaviour of the IRA.  Fortunately, the loyalist groups have not succumbed to provocation and it is fortunate that the support from abroad continues.  President Clinton and the EU continue to give their support, despite the glitch in the European Parliament committee yesterday which can be overcome.</P>
    <P>Wiser heads, despite strongly held views, turned away from the confrontation and bitterness in Derry during the marching season and the same happened in Bellaghy.  These are positive elements which cannot be overlooked. If we can focus on those who are prepared to talk and compromise and seek the formula and timing which will enable that compromise to be reached, we can bring the political talks to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past couple of years we have all expressed our happiness at seeing a degree of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, in Ireland as a whole and in Britain. However, there have been bombs at Canary Wharf and in Manchester, Garda Jerry McCabe was killed on duty in Adare and there have been bombs in Lisburn, which have caused serious injury.  My nephew works a short distance from where the bombs exploded <Col N="2097" /> in Lisburn.  For those who do not know people who live near to where the bombs explode, it can be easy to talk about how simple it is to get agreement. However, those of us who live in the Border area and who have friends and relations living with such events realise how difficult it is to find a long-term solution.  The bombing in Lisburn is a major threat to the future of the peace process.  That two vehicles were able to penetrate the high security army barracks raises questions about security and raises fears among people in the North.</P>
      <P>Tourism and trade benefited greatly from the peace, creating the prospect of jobs and a future for families.  Many were looking forward to a period of new prosperity.  For the first time younger people especially could go shopping or engage in activities in towns and cities across Northern Ireland with a reasonable peace of mind and their families could sleep in their beds at night content that they were not in danger.</P>
      <P>The Border roads have been reopened and I hope and trust that the type of thing that happened in Lisburn will not result in somebody who does not understand the situation deciding to close some of them.  There is no doubt in my mind and in the minds of others in this House that the closure of those roads created more rather than less room for terrorism.  We want to ensure that mistakes in the past are not made again and we hope those roads will never again be closed.</P>
      <P>It has already been stated in this House a number of times that in the midst of this situation we must congratulate loyalist fringe parties and those who were involved in parliamentary activities for not taking the bait and starting retaliatory action.  We must hope and pray that people like Reverend Roy McGee and others who have had a major role to play in this regard can continue to play that role and ensure that this does not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2098" /> Sinn Féin must go back to the IRA and make sure that common sense prevails.  None of us can be in any doubt that the preparation involved in planting the bombs in Lisburn or Canary Wharf did not happen overnight.  Those bombs were planned long in advance and it is sad at this stage in the IRA's campaign that some of the victims are very young people who have been virtually sucked into its organisation during the so-called peace process.  That is the most worrying aspect.  While one wing of the hardline Nationalist movement was claiming it was working in the interest of the peace process, another element of that group was literally training young people and getting them involved in carrying on what they consider the alternative means to achieving their objectives &mdash; the ballot box in the one hand and the armalite in the other.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the failure of Sinn Féin to sign up to the formula at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin.  That gives some indication of the difficulties we face.  At that forum members of Sinn Féin were dealing with people around the table who were trying to be helpful.  Those people may not have agreed with them, but they wanted to bring in Sinn Féin and to try to reconcile the position.  Sinn Féin was asked to sign up to a fairly simple formula and at the last minute it opted out.  That did not send a clear message to the other sector of the population who had chosen not to attend that forum, the mainline Unionist parties.  That gives some indication of the fact that there are hardline people on one side, but the forum highlighted that there are also hardline people on the other side and that is why there is great difficulty in reaching a compromise.  We must beg both sides, on our bended knees, to try to understand that there is no future in the bomb and the bullet.  That action might get big headlines for a few hours or a few days and will leave members of families maimed or suffering for the rest of their <Col N="2099" /> lives, but it will never solve the Irish national situation.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Wulf-Mathies said that yesterday was a sad day because a European parliamentary committee decided that it would make an effort to cut the peace and reconciliation budget to Northern Ireland and the six Border counties.  She said that it was with deep regret&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Commissioner committed herself and the Taoiseach and the Government committed themselves to ensuring that this situation will be rectified.  I, with my colleagues opposite, raised the issue of the delay in getting that money drawn down.  We were assured that this type of thing would not happen and it is now up to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others to ensure that it does not happen. I assure this House and the people of Cavan-Monaghan, whom a number of Members represent, that I will do everything in my power to ensure that no cutbacks are made but that increases are given because we need them guaranteed until the year 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable, after 18 months of peace and six months of indecision since then, that we have to debate this problem again today.  During that time of peace the people saw an opportunity to develop a region where economic growth had been retarded for 25 years.  For many the Lisburn bombing was the last straw.  Rather than give in to the bombers, it is important to renew our efforts for constructive dialogue because no matter where one lives there is no alternative to negotiations through talks.  The Lisburn bombing at a most <Col N="2100" /> sensitive period in Irish politics was a slap in the face to men like George Mitchell who has made such a contribution to the establishment of peace and has endured so many insults and jibes during the last few months when he was trying to set up the talks process.  It was also a slap in the face to many churchmen and politicians who worked so hard.  It was a real let down.  It happened at a time when industrialists were meeting in Philadelphia to discuss joint ventures about attracting inward investment to the Border region.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in Government and in Opposition has always held that the peace process would have to move along at a fast pace and from the change of Government in 1994 I have heard Government speakers claim that it would be a long drawn out process and that there was no need for pressure.  I believe that many Members who occupy the seats opposite regret the lack of drive and initiative during the summer of 1995.  If the tempo generated by Fianna Fáil from October 1994 until the change of Government had continued we would be much further forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ceasefire brought a positive response and financial commitment from the EU and the Delors initiative with hundreds of millions of pounds available to help the people of the Six Counties and the six southern counties along the Border.  Unfortunately, progress to set the necessary programmes in place was delayed to some extent and applications for funding have been processed only recently.  As I did on previous occasions, I lay the blame fairly and squarely on the Government for dilly-dallying and not making any progress in setting up the necessary structures.  Because of that the take-up under those programmes is well below the level anticipated.  That gave the European Parliament budgetary committee an opportunity to support an amendment to reduce this year's allocation for the peace and reconciliation fund from £125 million to £47 million.  That is in indirect conflict with the recommendations of the EU Commission, the <Col N="2101" /> Council of Ministers and the Parliament's Regional Affairs Committee which intended to retain the figure of £125 million.</P>
    <P>Like many others who served in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation I had high hopes of peace when politicians North and South debated freely and listened to the views of groups representing areas, such as education, health, the economy and trade unionism, and representatives of women's groups, churchmen, former prisoners, former extreme activists and prisoners' organisations.  After more than a year's deliberations it all went for naught and no resolution was found.</P>
    <P>It is important that the IRA restores the ceasefire forthwith.  If Sinn Féin has any control over the IRA, which I very much doubt because that has been proved, it is time it started negotiations with it.  It should also agree a timescale for talks.  Since the peace initiative was introduced, it has been proved that it has to move forward apace.  It cannot be allowed to lag and get stuck in the mud, as has happened over the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>The report on the results of the Irish national literacy survey carried out under the aegis of the OECD, has not yet been completed.  When this has been received and considered by my Department I will arrange for publication.</P>
      <P>I am aware from a preliminary briefing that the report will provide comprehensive information on levels of literacy within a range of categories and will place these in a wider comparative context.</P>
      <P>There is, as we know, a significant literacy problem in this country and the report will confirm that fact.  It is important, therefore, that the extent and nature of the problem be measured as accurately as possible and I expect that the report will be extremely valuable in this regard.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment that the figures and the report for Ireland under the aegis of the OECD will be published.  Will the Minister agree that, given the figures for Germany and the USA &mdash; 14.4 per cent and 20 per cent of the population with significant literacy difficulties respectively &mdash; current estimates for Ireland at about 5 to 16 per cent are conservative at the least?</P>
      <P>There is a need to be more pro-active in terms of funding and resourcing adult literacy schemes throughout the country.  Is the Minister prepared to give a commitment today that the Adult Literacy and Community Education (ALCE) budget will be substantially increased in the forthcoming Estimates and budget of 1997?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the budget alone.  There is a problem and identifying it will enable us to resolve it in a targeted and structured manner.  In 1993, we allocated £32.25 million to adult education, which has increased to £47.37 million.  The results of this survey will show us what position we are in the international league.  It will also identify the particular age groups with literacy problems.  This information will help us play our part in resolving an unacceptable problem.</P>

Although we have known about the extensive problem in Ireland it is unlikely that the Bill in relation to regional education boards, for which she has provided a notional amount in the Estimates will be published.  Will the Minister increase funding for adult literacy programmes in the interim?  Does she agree that as we have known there is a percentage of illiterate adults we should not have had to wait for the OECD report to increase the ALCE budget?</P>

      <P>I have substantially increased the resources from £32.25 million to £47.37 million.  The VTOS and the straight literacy scheme are also available to those returning to education.  We not only have interventions for adults and an invitation to them to return to education, there are also interventions in place to prevent another generation leaving the Irish education system with literacy problems.  There have been allocations and interventions to break this cycle as early as pre-school level.  There have also been interventions at primary school level, changes in the curriculum at second level and an increased budget for adult education.</P>
      <P>This report will identify the age cohort and the range of literacy problems they have, which will give the Department, the vocational education committees and ALCE the information to target the increased resources more effectively.  I expect to publish the report soon.  It would be useful then to have a discussion on the findings in terms of a future action plan.</P>

Does the Minister accept that we as a society stand indicted for a lack of commitment to people who are short of the basic and fundamental skills to enable them to progress in life?  Contrary to all the other sectors in education, this sector and these citizens are being deprived and discriminated against.  We owe it to them and society to significantly increase the ALCE budget.</P>

If there is one sector of the community that felt the education system failed them in the past, it is those who do not have literacy skills.  I am satisfied that the budget is being increased and I will seek more <Col N="2105" /> funding.

What kind of commitment will the Minister make to give these people the support they need?  She is being vague about providing resources.  Can she give an absolute commitment to provide a specific amount in relation to resources for this critical issue?  It must also be borne in mind that illiterate people are excluded.  They are on the scrapheap of society.  While we need to have the problem identified and quantified, we definitely need the resources to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies about the necessity for resources.  I thank those who are involved in this, be they teachers or voluntary workers.  I accepted a survey last week about the attitudes and the particular difficulties that adults have about going back to learn how to read and acquiring skills.  Given the profile of those who have literacy problems it suggests that past experiences in education would make some loath to return and seek help in that area.  The funding of the voluntary service which prepares people who are then willing to move into other sectors of mainstream education has been successful.  The information in that survey about the attitudes of those who experience literacy difficulties and the coming on stream of the OECD survey, which will quantify and specify the sectors that have most needs in this, the Year of Lifelong Learning, will benefit those who need our help and will help us to target resources in the right area.</P>

      <P>The White Paper states that assessment procedures should be comprehensive enough to test the full range of abilities across the curriculum and to evaluate all the elements of learning.</P>
      <P>Oral/aural examinations are an integral part of the programme for leaving certificate applied since 1995.  Students will have an oral/aural component as part of their final test in English and communications in the leaving certificate applied in June 1997.  In addition oral examinations for the various student tasks are held over the two years of this new programme.  The experience of examiners to date is that this mode of examination appears to be beneficial for the candidates and for the examining process.</P>
      <P>It is my firm belief that the development of oral skills is an important element in the English curriculum, both at junior and leaving certificate levels.  It is my desire that suitable arrangements are made as soon as possible to provide oral/aural tests in English.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, a number of difficulties to overcome, including <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> talks, costs, disruption of teaching time and the opposition of the ASTI to the introduction of school-based teacher assessment.</P>
      <P>If these difficulties can be overcome we can progress to the introduction of oral/aural tests.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's change of heart.  She has expressed a desire to see the introduction of oral examinations at junior and leaving certificate level.  Over a year ago I tabled a similar question and the response I received was that the Minister had no plans to proceed along this route.  Will <Col N="2107" /> the Minister accept that she has not been pro-active enough in developing this issue?  All students, irrespective of whether they are doing leaving certificate applied or the standard leaving certificate should have access to proper oral training and teaching and should be assessed in oral English competence. This is a fundamental skill which is of vital importance to any student leaving school for the workplace.  We have to get away from the practice of concentrating debate on the best four or five in the class while everybody else looks on. It is time we gave the opportunity to all young people in our system to develop self-confidence and the capacity to speak and communicate well in English. This will enable them to progress fully in life.</P>

      <P>This time last year we were completing arrangements to introduce oral and aural examinations to the leaving certificate applied.  This is an intervention at leaving certificate level for those who traditionally would not have sought the more academic paths to a future as they left school.  I welcome the co-operation of the teachers, unions and management which allowed us to intervene at that level for these students.  I believe that the final results of these examinations will be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer back to the changes in the curriculum at junior certificate level.  When the junior certificate was restructured in 1989, it included a recommendation that there would be assessment, not only in oral and aural work, but also in portfolio work and written assessment.  It gives rise to problems in devising the curriculum, in training the teachers for the curriculum and in the introduction of that part of the curriculum in the classroom.  The full co-operation of the teaching profession is necessary.  The White Paper repeated my commitment to the introduction of oral and aural assessment and stated that we would set up a group within the Department to <Col N="2108" /> discuss this.  We have not set up that group because we are now over a year concluding the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> talks with the teacher unions.  I suggest that when those talks are concluded it would be timely to open discussions with the partners involved on how best to move forward and then to give a recommendation that is acceptable across the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this is a question of prioritising the issues in education?  Perhaps if she spent far less time establishing new costly bureaucratic structures, such as regional education boards, and stopped lecturing teachers <i>via</i> time in school circulars and 15 additional contract hours etc., there might be a far better possibility of progressing issues such as this, imparting basic oral communication skills to students.  It is more important than the type of ridiculous timewasting that we have experienced over recent years with the partners in education.  The fact that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> talks have not yet concluded is an indictment of the Minister and her negotiating skills.  To be honest, there is no provision in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> negotiations on this issue.  The Minister has avoided it in the context of those negotiations.  It is misleading to suggest that the conclusion of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> talks will lead to progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 16 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I did not change the conditions for the recognition of new gaelscoileanna. It must be appreciated that a successful gaelscoil, like any national school, depends on genuine parental demand. For that reason, my Department has a requirement that a gaelscoil should have at least 20 junior infants who had not attended school previously before recognition can be granted.  This is not a new condition; it has been in existence for a number of years.</P>
      <P>It will be apparent that, if a school is unable to provide such an enrolment on opening, its viability in the future must be in doubt.  Before a new school is given recognition I must be assured that it will be viable.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education &mdash; Charting our Education Future &mdash; drew attention to the significant demographic decline in primary school enrolments projected over the next few years.  The current rate of decline is of the order of 11,000 pupils per annum.  The White Paper pointed out that this rapid demographic decline poses a major challenge for the provision of primary schooling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition to which the Deputy is referring stated that what was necessary was an enrolment of 20 children who had not attended national school before.  The clear intention of this condition always was that the school would be in a position to enrol that number of pupils each year.  However, a practice had developed of applicant schools starting up privately, without departmental sanction, and accumulating a combined enrolment of 20 over two or three years.  Approval for such applications had, indeed, been granted in previous years but, this year, the basic policy criterion requiring 20 junior <Col N="2110" /> infants per annum was strictly followed in order to ensure the future viability of the applicant schools at a time when total numbers are dropping.</P>
    <P>The general position in regard to new gaelscoileanna for 1996-97 is that 14 applications for the recognition of new gaelscoileanna were received in my Department this year.  Six of these applications were approved initially and a further three were approved on appeal. Five applicant schools could not be given recognition.  In the case of Ballinamore, Ballybrack, Clones and Enniscorthy, this was because the proposed schools were unable to meet the enrolment criterion.</P>
    <P>The Maynooth application did not succeed because it was considered that adequate provision exists at present in the nearby Kilcock gaelscoil.  Over half of the enrolment in the Kilcock school comes from the Maynooth area.</P>
    <P>On a general note, I am happy to extend recognition to all applicant gaelscoileanna where the need for such a facility has been clearly established.  In that context, I am prepared early in 1997 to consider fresh applications from each of the above areas for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said she has not changed the conditions but the practice.  The parents of children in the gaelscoileanna involved, based on the experience of other gaelscoileanna and the practice of the Minister and her officials, expected they would receive recognition this year on the grounds that they had 20 pupils over a two year period.  The Minister informed the schools as late as 25 or 26 July that they would not get recognition, despite the fact that they applied as far back as February this year.  The Minister behaved in a disgraceful manner towards those parents.  Irrespective of policy considerations, the very least they deserve is respect and courtesy from the Minister. A phone call almost four weeks before commencement of the new school year was a totally inadequate response.  It certainly signalled a significant change <Col N="2111" /> in practice, as admitted by Department officials at a press briefing on 21 August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In recognising any school I have an obligation to ensure that investment in the school is sound. There are 95 gaelscoileanna in operation and 31 of those were approved by me.  I have signalled in a practical way my commitment to the gaelscoileanna.</P>
      <P>On setting up a gaelscoil there is a requirement that for the school to be viable, there should be an enrolment of 20 pupils per year.  The school would then be entitled to a free site, 100 per cent funding for building, a special pupil-teacher ratio and extra funding towards school books because of the requirement to teach in Irish.  When a proposition is put to the Department on the need for a school the Department has to satisfy itself that it will remain a viable school within the community.</P>
      <P>There have been changes since the former Minister, John Wilson, made special provision for gaelscoileanna and outlined for them very special conditions, at a time when it looked as if teaching through the medium of Irish in urban communities was on the decline. There is now a rapid decline in population and, for the sake of parents who are totally committed, before sanctioning a school the Department must be satisfied as to its viability.  I cannot be satisfied that the schools that did not get the go-ahead would be in a viable position given the changing demographic trends.  Applications for further gaelscoileanna will be considered earlier in the school year than was the case this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admitted that a practice developed in the Department in recent years where recognition was given to gaelscoileanna that had 20 pupils over a two year period.  She said the basic policy is that the schools <Col N="2112" /> should have 20 pupils in one year but that the practice was that sanction would be given if there were 20 pupils in the school over a two year period.  The schools that applied from February this year onwards worked on that assumption.  One gaelscoil had 36 pupils when it reapplied, in the full expectation that it would get sanction.  We all accept there is a need for pro-active policy formulation in this area, to consider the demographics and so on, but surely the Minister could have signalled in February that there would be a change in the practice as developed by Department officials and that a different approach would be adopted in the next school year.</P>
      <P>At the Oireachtas all-party Committee on the Irish Language Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher questioned the Minister on this point on 24 July.  The Minister should take the opportunity today to correct the record of that meeting.  In reply to Deputy Gallagher's request for a guarantee that there would be no change in the regulations the assistant inspector said:</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chinntiú don Teachta nach bhfuil athrú ar bith tagtha ar na rialacha do bhunú gaelscoileanna.  Níl aon athrú meoin [there is no change of attitude] ar an Roinn faoi láthair agus níl aon cheann beartaithe againn go luath.</P>
      <P>The following day the Minister refused to sanction gaelscoileanna in Ballybrack and Enniscorthy.  The Minister should apologise to that committee, particularly to the members concerned.  She should put the record straight that there was clearly a change of practice, with the result that a grave injustice was done to the communities involved.  Can we have a reply from the Minister?</P>

I could not say that.  I have invited them to reapply next year when we will look again at the population trends and the numbers that have indicated they will join.

        <i>(Wexford):</i> How can the Minister stand over a situation where the committee of Gaelscoil Inis Coirthe was in negotiation with the Department of Education through February, March, April, May and June, yet at no time was it informed that the Minister intended to change the interpretation of the rules that had been in existence for a number of years?  It was continually told by her officials that if the required numbers were built up over two years it would get approval.</P>
      <P>How is it that in June 1996 the same gaelscoil was given the go ahead to advertise for a school principal?  It is obvious, both to me and to the gaelscoil committee in Enniscorthy, that while her officials' interpretation was that the rules for recognising gaelscoileanna would operate as in previous years, the Minister stated otherwise in a television interview in July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister owes an apology to the gaelscoil committee in Enniscorthy for allowing them to debate the issue for four months with the Department of Education while she had obviously not informed her officials what stance she intended to take.  How can the Minister justify the constant negotiations by her <Col N="2116" /> departmental officials and also allowing the school to advertise for a principal? Gaelscoil Inis Coirthe is probably operating unofficially in the Minister's opinion but it has 24 plus students, so it is meeting all the criteria that have been set.</P>

      <P>There is no date or time in my mind.  There is, however, a responsibility that when recognition is being given to schools we can guarantee they are viable units before we invest funding in them on anyone's behalf.  I have given an undertaking to deal with applicants for the next year's recognition earlier in the school year.  However, the Department of Education has quite a challenge in dealing with the drop in demographics when we look forward to investing in the primary school sector. Policy concerning the recognition of new primary schools is to be reviewed under the terms of the commission on school accommodation.  All the partners involved in primary education, including the gaelscoileanna organisation, already serve on that commission which has just completed its work on the vocational education committee rationalisation. The commission's next task is planning for the demographic decline.  It is relevant information that any community should have.  We must look at viability differently from the way the former Minister, John Wilson, looked at it when he gave recognition to gaelscoileanna and made special provision for their expansion.</P>

It was not until July they were told they could not do so.  Because of the uncertainty, parents were unwilling to take a chance that there would be a recognised school available in September and placed their children in other schools.  They had no wish to do this.  Does the Minister accept that this is one of the reasons schools did not reach the quota?</P>

      <P>Albert Gubay has submitted a set of proposals to Dublin South County Council and interests in Blackrock, County Dublin and Stewart's Hospital, Palmerstown, have been in contact also.  The decision to proceed will be made in the context of the policy group which is preparing a national policy for sport.  It will also have to be decided in the context of the level of demand for facilities throughout the country.  My Department currently has 1,400 applications for projects valued at almost £500 million, and the level of grants applied for amounts to £48.2 million.  This year I was fortunate to get an increase in the allocation capacity from £4 million to £6 million, but should resources be focused on one facility in one area of the country or should we develop facilities in communities throughout the country?

I am disappointed with the Minister's replies because they are the same answers we have been getting for the <Col N="2124" /> past 18 months.  The Minister was in Atlanta for the Olympics, and rightly so, to share in the glory and honour the achievements of Michelle Smith brought to Ireland.

      <P>I should also add that this issue formed part of the proposals made to the teachers unions and the school management bodies last February under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The proposals included the payment of the honours degree allowance to holders of all degrees conferred and designated as honours degrees by appropriate awarding authorities irrespective of the number of subjects taken at honours level.</P>

      <P>Essentially, a single honours degree is one where only one of two subjects is taken at honours level. There are comparatively few of those and they emanate mainly from UCC. Most degree allowances at second level are given for two subjects: that is the history of the award.  I remind the Deputy, however, that if success had been achieved across the board in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> package put to the teacher unions, and which would include the person to which this question refers, the single subject requirement would no longer be examined by the Department. I understand the person in question has a hearing before the rights commissioner.  I am in the process of concluding talks with the teacher unions and, if there is a successful conclusion to them, I am hopeful this will no longer be a specific requirement.  That would be the end of the matter for those people who took single honours degree subjects in Cork University.</P>

I apologise profusely to the officials but, in fairness, the Minister cannot be blamed for every &ldquo;t&rdquo; that is not crossed or every comma omitted.  The distinction that is persistently made displays a remarkable ignorance of what is involved in a single honours degree at UCC.  In a single honours degree a student studies ten units of one subject in a most concentrated and detailed manner.  The people who make judgements on these matters ought to be the experts of the NUI.  They regard a single honours degree as being as valuable and important, academically and <Col N="2127" /> otherwise, as a joint degree.

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 11, 22, 23, 26, 27, 32, 39, 44, 51, 70, 75, 77 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.  The address of independent mature students for the purpose of determining the rate of grant is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is within 15 miles of the college the adjacent rate of grant is payable.  If the address is more than 15 miles from the college the non-adjacent rate is payable.</P>
      <P>Where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college it is open to the local authority to regard that address as the normal residence and to award a non-adjacent maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>To award the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant to independent mature students irrespective of their address would in effect involve creating a new category within the grant schemes.  This would in turn be likely to lead to demands that this category be applied to all students.  Such a course would involve additional expenditure of about £11 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her explanation but I find it incredible that a lone mother of two school-going children living within 15 miles of University College Cork and paying £50 a week baby-sitting expenses and travel expenses to attend, for example, the Early Childhood BA Studies course, has to maintain a second residence apart from the residence she is renting at the moment to secure the full maintenance rate of £1,600.  The Minister should take a policy initiative to give special treatment to mature students, particularly lone parents who are under considerable pressure to attend full-time education to seek future career opportunities and progress in life.  I appeal to <Col N="2132" /> the Minister to review this condition and allow mature students in particular to avail of the full rate of maintenance grant, low and all as that is.  It is a scandal they should have to depend on the adjacent rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeal being made by the Deputy is not to make an exception but to introduce a new category.  Under the existing categories, students are independently assessed, regardless of address, but based on the catchment area in which they live.  All students within the 15 mile radius get the adjacent rate.  Those outside the 15 mile radius get the non-adjacent rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not.  It would be £11 million for everything else the Minister would throw in after that.  The de Buitléir report recommended that special treatment should be considered for mature students.  They have been treated in a niggardly way by the Minister.  The undergraduate student has benefited to a far greater degree than the mature student.  There are clear additional expenses involved for any mature student to return to education, particularly lone parents.  The situation of a lone parent is extremely difficult and I find it extraordinary that the Minister does not have the heart to review the existing arrangements to facilitate the participation at least of lone parents in full-time third level education.  Why not introduce a new category?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is suggesting that changing the rules or forming a new category involves no cost, let me inform that it does.  Under the existing scheme students are judged on whether they live within or without a radius of 15 miles.  To extend that or review it would cost an additional £11 million for that sector in education.</P>

      <P>A sum of £40 million was realised last year from the abolition of tax convenants and it went entirely to the undergraduate student.  The plight of some mature students is far worse than that of many undergraduate students who receive free fees and so on.  It is discriminatory against people who are on social welfare that they cannot get the full rate of maintenance grant.</P>

      <P>There is no breakdown of figures in regard to mature students.  I can give the Deputy the definition of a mature student, and the definition of dependent and independent mature students.  I can give the Deputy information about the numbers who receive the adjacent rate and those that receive the non-adjacent rate &mdash; 11,788 students qualify for the adjacent rate and 30,561 students qualify for the non-adjacent rate.  There is no category which differs between mature students. The categories are divided in respect of the catchment area.  Those within a catchment area are judged as independent mature students and qualify for the adjacent rate.  Those outside a catchment area of 15 miles qualify for the non-adjacent rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>As already confirmed by the Minister for Finance in his reply to Deputy O'Donnell on 24 May 1995 and by myself in my reply to Deputy Martin on 28 September 1995, the cost implications of implementing the education reform proposals, including the cost of establishing the education boards, were considered as part of the process of finalising the White Paper on Education.  The Minister for Finance and his officials participated in that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting Our Education Future, makes <Col N="2137" /> clear that the establishment of education boards will take place on a phased basis, following the enactment of the necessary legislation.  The gradual transfer of functions to the boards will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question, within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the boards will also bring significant benefits for the administration and effectiveness of education services, through improved regional planning and co-ordination and the provision of support services to primary and secondary schools in the most cost-effective way.  The establishment of the education boards will involve changing the administrative framework for education.  It will not result in a completely new area of expenditure but rather will involve the reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, costing exercises can depend on many variable factors.  These factors include the startup time of an initiative, the timescale within which a proposal is implemented, the outcome of discussions/negotiations with concerned interests, expert advice on the detailed implementation strategies and the final administrative and operational arrangements.</P>
    <P>The operational cost of the education boards, like the costs of many education reform measures, will be determined to a large extent by pay costs.  These in turn would reflect the numbers employed by the board and pay rates at any given time.  It would not be useful or appropriate for me to comment now on what the various elements of new administrative structures might cost at some time in the future.</P>

      <P>I should answer this question since the Minister for Education could not.  She said it would not be useful or appropriate to speculate on what this could possibly cost in the future <Col N="2138" /> when it might get off the ground.  In other words, she has announced a whole policy area and has no idea whatsoever of the cost or when it will start.  She cannot answer this question.  The answer to this question, if I may be so bold, is that a cost analysis has not been done.  The Minister is expecting to embark on a change in policy in relation to education that is far reaching and does not think it would be useful or appropriate to dwell on what it would cost us.  Will the Minister devote more time to identifying what needs to be done within the education system to better the education of our children and less time on looking at structures which it appears she will not be able to implement because she will not be here to do it?</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy of what the education boards are about.  We are looking at an education system which since the beginning of the State has been centralised in the Department of Education in Marlborough Street.  That involves the day to day running of 3,600 primary schools and three different kinds of second level schools and post-leaving certificate activity.  Our education system has been subject to detailed examination not only from within the State but by agencies outside the State.  It has been recommended on more than one occasion by various Governments that the education system should be regionalised instead of administered by a central Department in Marlborough Street.  We are not setting out to put an alternative structure in place or to create ten Departments of Education.  We are responding to informed criticism, debate and advice.  It is proposed to establish on a regional basis the services administered by the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my reply, the main cost in the Department is teachers' pay.  The establishment of ten boards will not take teachers off the payroll.  Consideration is being given to the role of the education board and the regionalisation of the inspectorate and psychological <Col N="2139" /> services so as to meet the needs of the community.</P>

      <P>Like other Members, I condemn the violence of the IRA, and have done so in the case of the Lisburn <Col N="2242" /> and Canary Wharf bombings.  We have suffered violence during every decade since the imposition of partition in the 1920s.  I want to see an end to violence and I call on Sinn Féin to use its influence with the IRA to bring about another ceasefire.  However, it is important for people to remember that another ceasefire will not bring an end to the troubles on this island.  The most serious mistake the British Government made was in thinking the ceasefire announced in August 1994 would bring an end to the troubles.</P>
      <P>Before the ceasefire was announced we had the Joint Framework Document and the Downing Street Declaration. What has happened to those documents? Neither the British Government nor the Irish Government ever refer to them.  Why were these documents not promoted during the 18 months of the ceasefire? I wish I had time to quote some paragraphs from these documents, particularly paragraph 4 of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
      <P>It is worth considering how the democratic parties behaved after the announcement of the ceasefire.  The British Government made absolutely no effort to progress the peace.  I wish to quote from a front page article in the <i>Irish News</i> of 12 February 1996: &ldquo;From the very first hour of the IRA ceasefire the isolation of Republicans was a central part of British policy&rdquo;.  I do not have time to deal with decommissioning in detail but we know how the British Government prevaricated over that issue and the problems this caused.  The elections in Northern Ireland were unnecessary and only served to entrench Unionists further.  The dogs in the street knew who should be at the talks and sitting at the table.  The competition between the Unionist parties during the election led in its own way to the blocking of the roads at Drumcree during July which led to further problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator George Mitchell is a man of the highest integrity and his report could not have been fairer to all sides. The six principles outlined by him <Col N="2243" /> would have ensured that everybody followed the democratic path forward. However, the British Government failed to accept his principles or recommendations immediately.  I question the commitment of the UUP and the DUP to progressing peace.  Everyone knows what needs to be done and it is ridiculous for any sane person who knows the history of violence in the North to spend four months from 10 June trying to put an agenda together.  We must ask how serious they are in that regard.  The issues must be addressed, as must the rights of Nationalists to assert their Irishness.  Consent was written into every joint agreement between the British and Irish Governments during the past number of years.  No one will force a united Ireland on those who do not desire it.  It has been clearly stated that a united Ireland will come about only when a majority of the people in Northern Ireland agree to it.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government are not immune to criticism.  Where were they when the peace process lost momentum?  Why did they not act to renew its impetus?  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, the Leaders of the three coalition parties, have spoken with different tongues at different times.  I am an optimist and I call on the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister to meet each other as a matter of urgency.  They should not throw away the best chance since Partition to bring about a settlement to end violence forever.  It must not be forgotten that agreement must come about within the three stranded context.  There is no question of a settlement within the six counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is in everyone's interests that we should progress the peace and that there should be a settlement.  The Unionists, Nationalists, everyone on this island&mdash; and the people of Britain &mdash; have much to gain.  I call for a restoration of the ceasefire in order that we might pursue meaningful negotiations.  I hope the Governments will act as they should <Col N="2244" /> have in the 18 months after August 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk:</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate could easily be turned into an occasion for an outpouring of despair by those making contributions.  That should not be the case.  If this were to be an occasion for despair, we might effectively abandon both communities in the North to the situation which obtained for the past 25 years. They would have no hope for a final settlement of or solution to the problems that exist there.</P>
      <P>The Lisburn bombing was a heinous crime which every right-thinking person condemns.  It is a grim reminder of events in the North for the 25 years prior to the ceasefire being called in August 1994.  A return to that level of violence is unthinkable.  Following the euphoria of the 1994 ceasefire, the subsequent peace process ground along too slowly.  Frustration inevitably set in and led to some of the problems which are now becoming manifest.  Has the peace process been the victim of the precarious voting situation of the Conservative Government in the House of Commons?  If that is the case, fate has again dealt a severe body blow to the people of both communities in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political representatives, North and South, accept that if progress is to be made, the building of trust between the communities is essential.  However, by its nature, the building of trust is a slow, tedious and painful process.  Both sides in the North must recognise that a start is needed if an eventual settlement is to be reached.  It became obvious during the summer that marching and triumphalism, on one side, and bombing and intimidation, on the other, will not lead to peace.  Sinn Féin must bring its influence to bear on the Provisional IRA to end the violence forever.  David Trimble and the Reverend Ian Paisley must face up to their responsibilities. The images of Drumcree sent shockwaves through the Nationalist community.  Perhaps in a more pronounced way during the summer world television and media interests focused on images <Col N="2245" /> of marching and triumphalism and brought them to homes throughout Ireland and across the globe.  It can be stated that marching and triumphalism belong to a different political era and the time has come to consign them to history.  The sooner this is achieved the better.</P>
    <P>A restoration of the ceasefire by the Provisional IRA with a guarantee of peace would demand a response from the major loyalist parties.  Despite the heinous bombing in Lisburn, I hope there will be a restoration of the ceasefire.  If that occurs, I also hope that meaningful and positive progress can be made at the talks.  That is the only way we will find a final and firm solution to the festering sore of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this delicate debate.  I have very strong views, which are on the record of the House, regarding the situation in Northern Ireland. <Col N="2246" /> One of my strongest views is that there is a solution available which worked in the past.  Having enjoyed the peace which resulted from the ceasefire, it is regrettable that this House is once again debating this issue.  Members should be temperate in the language they use.  I was shocked yesterday when the Taoiseach referred to certain Irishmen and Irishwomen with very strong views about their country being akin to Hitler's Nazis.  I believe he will live to regret that statement.</P>
      <P>It is becoming clear that Fianna Fáil is the only party which is fully and unequivocally committed to the achievement of a peaceful Ireland.  My party believes in the democratic process of a united and peaceful Ireland.  It is only by way of dialogue that progress will be made.  The Government, with its British counterpart, permitted the peace process to stagnate and balked at setting a date for talks.  It was only due to the unfortunate incident at Canary Wharf that a date for round table talks was agreed.  While a great deal was achieved following the signing of the declaration, it is regrettable it took so long to get to the table.  We must not forget the all-party talks in Dublin Castle were suspended by the Government.  We had people around the table and talking, but we were stagnant on the question of decommissioning, prisoners and other such matters.  The Minister in charge of the Foreign Affairs portfolio once stated the peace process was bigger than any man or party and that he would be able to nurture it.</P>
      <P>The finger must be pointed at the Government benches on this matter. The groundwork was done.  It needed only appropriate nurturing, but the Government failed in that task.  After signing the declaration the world was our oyster in terms of a peaceful country.  After 25 years of needless conflict, it is regrettable that the Government has brought us back to this stage.</P>

      <P>I thank those who called for a debate on this emotive issue. As a 27 years old from a Border county <Col N="2247" /> I see on a daily basis the effects of the conflict on constituencies along the Border and on areas within the Six Counties.  The two years of peace was appreciated by all those working or living in, or travelling through, Northern Ireland.  Bombs and killing will never be the correct way forward.</P>
      <P>We have had a summer of terrible upheaval.  I accept that because of the EU Presidency the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has an enormous workload, but somebody must be able to grasp every available opportunity to resolve this problem.  We must not return to the violence of two or three years ago.  What has happened in the meantime is worth too much.  Everyone in the North has a strong view on what is right and wrong and, while it is difficult to square the circle, peace must be the goal.  A solution can be found if there is a will to find it.  Everything possible should be done outwardly and behind the scenes to bring this conflict back from the brink.</P>

      <P>It is with great sadness that I contribute to this debate.  In the aftermath of an atrocity, such as the bomb attack in Lisburn last Monday, it is difficult to escape the sense of despair and foreboding we all share.  I refute any imputation from Deputy Callely that this Government let matters slip.  It has been intensively involved in the process since taking office in 1994.  It is not helpful to the debate to state that we were handed this problem in a certain condition and did not take the ball and run with it.</P>

      <P>The revulsion we all feel at last Monday's atrocity is clear from the serious contributions to this debate. The anger we share at those who perpetrated this henious crime is also evident.</P>
      <P>Monday's events cast a dark shadow over our deliberations and reminds us that violence achieves nothing.  It only creates victims.  In condemning that attack, our first thoughts must be with those injured and maimed by the atrocity.  We can only sympathise with them and their relatives and express the hope that they will recover and lead a full life again.</P>
      <P>That attack was the latest in a series of such atrocities since the Provisional IRA announced the end of its cessation of violence on 9 February last.  Those atrocities include the bombing of Canary Wharf and Manchester, the murder of Detective Garda Gerry McCabe in Limerick and the latest bomb in Lisburn.  A common feature of all those crimes is the manner in which violence has been visited on innocent people going about their daily lives.</P>
      <P>We had all hoped the events of 1994 &mdash;the cessation of violence announced by the Provisional IRA in August and the ceasefire announced by the combined Loyalist Military Command in October &mdash; meant that such senseless acts of violence were consigned to the past.  We knew then that sustaining the peace process and securing lasting peace &mdash; the overwhelming desire of the majority on these islands &mdash; would not be easy.  If it was easy it would have been achieved a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been setbacks.  Last Monday's bombs complete the triangle of violence which has brought suffering <Col N="2249" /> and despair to the citizens of this State, Northern Ireland and Britain.  There have been other disappointments.  The slow pace of movement towards all-party talks was a matter of great concern to the Government.  It, nevertheless, sought to remove all obstacles and its efforts brought about the launch of the talks process in June.</P>
    <P>The violence perpetrated by the IRA since February serves no purpose.  It serves only to prevent Sinn Féin's participation in the process of negotiations, which it has demanded for so long.  The IRA statement issued in the aftermath of the Lisburn bombings spoke of regret for any injuries caused to civilians, but not for those sustained by the personnel connected to the Theipval Barracks and sought to place the blame for the attack on the British Government.  Let it be clear, this House and the people we represent will not parcel out our expressions of regret and horror on the basis of the professional calling of the victims of violence.  We extend our sympathies to all the victims and their families.</P>
    <P>The IRA statement also talks about &mdash; as Sinn Féin has done for a long time &mdash; the need for an inclusive process of negotiations.  The IRA and Sinn Féin must realise that an inclusive process of negotiations will not be possible while the IRA persists with its campaign of violence or maintains the option of violence to be used as and when it is deemed politically useful.  We believed in August 1994 that the day of the armalite and the ballot box had passed.  It is time the IRA demonstrated that.</P>
    <P>The International Body spoke of the need to decommission mind-sets in Northern Ireland in a search for a lasting and peaceful settlement.  Part of that process has been the expunction of that philosophy and of any explicit or implicit threat it carries of violence, or a return to violence, in the event of negotiations.  Sinn Féin and the IRA must face up to that reality.  The two Governments believe the multi-party talks under way offer not only the best <Col N="2250" /> but the only way forward to a negotiated settlement and we will continue to work with those parties which are exclusively committed to peaceful methods.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are participants in that process do not need to be reminded of the painfully slow progress in the talks process.  Nevertheless, the talks offer a framework and we must not be deflected or deterred from that course by what happened last Monday.  Securing meaningful progress will not be easier in the aftermath of Monday's events. It will require not only renewing our commitment to that process but the combined efforts of both Governments and the participating parties to find a realistic basis on which to work.  The issue which prevents progress at present is decommissioning and the best way to deal with it is through the talks process. The Government remains committed to the recommendations in the report of the international body and continues to believe that they offer the only realistic basis on which progress can be made on this issue.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that work has been ongoing in my Department in the period since the publication of the report on legislation which would enable its recommendations on decommissioning to be given effect.  As the Taoiseach indicated, the Government intends to publish that legislation at an early date.  The task of securing progress in the negotiations falls equally on the two Governments and the parties.  It is not something within the gift of the Governments alone as progress in the talks, in the absence of unanimity, requires the support of parties sufficient to represent a majority of the votes cast in the Northern Ireland elections in May and a majority of the Unionist and Nationalist communities.  The task of seeking that progress is not one which the Government has shirked or will shirk.  I join other speakers in looking to the parties to work meaningfully with the two Governments to show that the talks process can work.</P>
    <P>I echo the sentiments expressed about <Col N="2251" /> the role the Ulster Democratic Party and the Popular Unionist Party have played in the talks.  Those who had contact with those parties are impressed with the commitment to progress which they brought to the process and the manner in which they presented their case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the State's response to violence, I want, as Minister for Justice, to reassure the House of the continuing commitment of the Government and the security forces of this State to counter terrorism.  The Government has always opposed the use of violence for political ends.  Successive Governments have responded to such violence, regardless of its source, by doing all in their power to protect the people of this island from those who have recourse to it.  The Garda, with the support of the military authorities as required, remains in the forefront of the fight against terrorist violence and continues to take all measures necessary to combat the threat.  Action against terrorist organisations and the search for terrorist weapons has been unrelenting.  This is evidenced by a number of significant successes, including the seizure of a large quantity of arms and ammunition at Clonaslee, County Laois, in June, the seizure of more than 1000 kilogrammes of home-made explosives following the interception of a van in County Monaghan in November 1995 and the seizure of a significant quantity of arms destined for the INLA in April that year. Arrests were also made as a result of each of those operations and prosecutions brought.</P>
    <P>It is also evidenced by the fact that the total amount of illegally held weapons recovered by the Garda in the period since the August 1994 ceasefire exceeds 600 firearms, 30,000 rounds of ammunition and 60 kilogrammes of Semtex, as well as substantial quantities of home made explosives and other improvised weapons.  These facts give the lie to suggestions made from time to time that the ceasefires were followed by an easing in the pursuit of terrorism by the forces of the State.  Nothing could <Col N="2252" /> be further from the truth.  Those who espouse violence have been and always will be pursued by the forces of law and order.</P>
    <P>The security forces' response to the terrorist threat is under constant review and, moreover, the high level of cross-Border security co-operation which already exists and which has been a hallmark of Garda-RUC relations will be maintained and strengthened.</P>
    <P>Our hope is that the bomb attack in Lisburn does not mark a full scale return to violence by the Provisional IRA.  It is also our hope that the Combined Loyalist Military Command will not allow itself to be provoked into abandoning its ceasefire.  Nobody stands to gain by that.  Our duty, as constitutional politicans, is to continue to strive to show that the political path is the only way forward.  That places a heavy duty on all those engaged in the talks process in Belfast.  The Government will be constantly mindful of that duty.  I ask all other parties at the talks to bear that duty in mind and show that the talks offer a meaningful forum for dealing with the substantive issues that need to be addressed.</P>

      <P>I join in expressing condolences to the victims of the bombs in Lisburn earlier this week.  I had hoped there would have been all-party consensus on this matter because it is far too serious to have any point scoring.  Those who think that wrapping themselves in the green flag will gain them votes in elections are sadly mistaken.  The Irish people are not in form for such play acting.</P>
      <P>The great difficulty is that the evil people in the IRA have won the battle when it comes to deciding whether a peaceful solution should be pursed in the form of all-party talks or whether a bombing and shooting campaign should be recommenced.  We can only hope that the public revulsion expressed will change the minds of these horrible people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to a statement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign <Col N="2253" /> Affairs, Deputy Spring, last summer referring to republican prisoners in British jails.  I am the leader of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe for this year.  The Council of Europe is a humanitarian body which examines human rights abuses and the inhuman and degrading treatment of people in detention.  In his statement the Tánaiste indicated that the treatment of republican prisoners in British jails had worsened considerably since the implementation of the ceasefire in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that with the implementation of the ceasefire their conditions would have improved considerably.  I was taken aback on reading the statement.  As a consequence three parliamentary delegations from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party visited the republican prisoners who were about 24 in number in the prisons of Belmarsh, Whitemoor, Full Sutton and Frankland.  The reports of the three groups condemned the British system.</P>
    <P>Violence begets violence.  We must ensure that procedures are carried out properly.  The republican prisoners have been convicted of appalling crimes &mdash; murders, bombings and maimings &mdash; yet prisoners must be treated with a certain amount of respect.  The reports of the parliamentary delegations indicated that the prisoners were locked up for 22 or 23 hours a day; given the minimum of food; their heating was turned off in the severest weather in winter and their family visits were frustrated to such an extent that some of them did not receive visits for 12 or 14 months.  In addition they were deprived of sleep by searches during the night, constant knocking on the cell doors or by the turning on and off of lights.  These practices should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter at the Council of Europe on the committee on human rights and legal affairs of which I am a member.  The committee agreed that a subcommittee on human rights should visit the prisons to see the conditions at first hand.  The British delegation to the <Col N="2254" /> Council of Europe has frustrated our attempts to have the subcommittee on human rights visit the prisons.  It is a sad reflection on the British Government and the British delegation in Strasbourg.  There are no similar complaints from prisoners in Northern Ireland or in Portlaoise Prison.  If justice is to be done and we are to defeat the terrorists, we must ensure there is equity and that people are treated in a proper and humane fashion.  While we sympathise with the victims of violence and condemn the men of violence, we would like to see justice meted out properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business the Taoiseach quoted the editorial in the <i>Irish News</i> about how the IRA has betrayed the people of Ireland.  The word &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo; is exactly right.  It applies to all the hopes so poignantly held by the people in both parts of the island and beyond that the cruel shadow of violence was being lifted and that they could once again enjoy their birthright of peace.  It applies to all those here, in Britain, in the United States and elsewhere who took political risks to build bridges into democratic politics for the republican movement.  It applies also to those within the republican movement who, I sincerely believe, made great efforts to lead their movement out of an ever more futile and murderous cul-de-sac.  It applies to the stated goals and ideals the republican movement professes to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time like this it is very difficult not to succumb to anger and despair.  No one can avoid feeling these emotions and the more one has worked to better the situation the more keenly they will be felt.  At the same time we must recognise that these emotions, however understandable, are bad counsellors and policies made in their shadow are unlikely to be wise.  It is at such times that a calm and steady assessment is important, particularly for Governments, which must make the hard decisions.  Let us therefore review the <Col N="2255" /> many constructive points which have been made here today.</P>
    <P>At the top of any list of generally agreed positions is the acceptance, held firmly and without question on all sides in this House, that violence is morally wrong, without political justification, incapable of producing any solution and it must be resolutely opposed by all the security means at our disposal and all the political resources at our command.</P>
    <P>It follows clearly that no tactic of mixing violence and politics can be tolerated.  No amount of ballot boxes can hide the armalite.  Any society which tolerated the armalite with one set of ballot boxes would sooner or later end up with an armalite with every ballot box.  I am certain that Sinn Féin can point to no moment, before, during or after the ceasefire, when this principle was not the bedrock and explicit basis on which successive Irish Governments have had dialogue with it.</P>
    <P>A second area of near universal agreement is that the solution to the Northern conflict must be pursued and can be found only through political dialogue and the fullest possible application of the principle of concent.  A united Ireland imposed without the clearly expressed agreement of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland would be a flagrant breach of the principle.  It would be the very opposite to a solution and it is simply an inconceivable option for most people on this island, North and South.  It quite literally will never happen.  Anyone who pretends otherwise is either grossly deceived or grossly deceiving &mdash; whether the claim comes from a Nationalist quarter to foster unreal illusions or from a Unionist quarter to stoke the old fears the better to manipulate them.</P>
    <P>At the same time, political consent is not a concept which stops at the Border. As Deputy Harney spelled out in her contribution this morning, Unionists who invoke it in the direction that suits them, namely as a protection against being forced into a united Ireland, have also a duty to respect it where it may <Col N="2256" /> not suit them, namely the need for new arrangements to which Nationalists in Northern Ireland can give their consent. Much of the misunderstanding which Unionists complain of in the South or internationally stems from their persistent failure to act upon this point, which most observers see as a sheer practical necessity as well as being a requirement of fairness.</P>
    <P>It is broad common ground also that a political solution must address all the key relationships and ensure parity of esteem and just and equal treatment for the identities and aspirations of both traditions and both communities. Unionists cannot be marginalised in their own country, and neither can Nationalists.  Equality and mutual respect are not just moral ideals &mdash; they are in practical terms the only ground on which the two communities can reach a stable equilibrium.</P>
    <P>It is common ground also that the Stormont talks have, potentially at least, all the ingredients necessary for meaningful negotiations.  They are inclusive in intent and could become so in practice subject only to decisions which lie in the hands of the republican movement itself.  They address all strands.  They have a comprehensive agenda with all issues unquestionably on the table.  They have outstanding chairmanship.  They can be the vehicle for a meaningful accommodation, if the political will is there all round.</P>
    <P>The parameters of such an accommodation are well understood between the two Governments.  They enjoy, broadly speaking, bipartisan support in both Parliaments and therefore represent something close to a settled consensus between the wider Irish and British democracies.  Anyone who accepts all the existing realities and not just those of them it is tactically expedient to acknowledge will conclude that any likely accommodation will be recognisably in the mould described in the joint framework documents.</P>
    <P>Today's debate helped to remind us how many solid reference points we have in terms of agreed common <Col N="2257" /> ground.  These points of agreement did not always exist.  Many are from lessons learned from mistakes and bitter experience.</P>
    <P>We should not really be surprised that in the new approaches and in the political risks we have taken in the quest for peace we are still refining our road maps and our reference points are less clear.  We must find our bearings in a situation that is still fluid and open to change for better or worse.  As democrats we have a duty to encourage those who may be beginning to understand the futility and poison of violence to commit themselves exclusively to the political path.  Any peaceful future must of necessity emcompass that change.  As democrats we have also a duty to ensure that our dialogue does not in any way compromise our democratic principles and institutions.  What we are offering and all we will ever offer is a bridge into the democratic arena whose basic ground rules are unchanged, the same for all and incompatible with any hint, much less threat, or use of violence.</P>
    <P>The peace process was rightly called a process.  Fundamental change, such as exchanging a culture of violence for one of exclusively democratic commitment, is rarely instantaneous.  Setbacks and disappointments are only too likely. These must be seen in the context of the wider question of the overall direction of change.</P>
    <P>Apart from the moral opprobrium earned by IRA actions since the breakdown of the ceasefire, they are putting an emphatic question-mark over this issue.  They are progressively widening the credibility gap which Sinn Féin must overcome if it is ever to deal as a fully accepted democratic player among all the other democratic players.  They are refurbishing the suspicions and hatreds which even the most hardened paramilitary must recognise as threatening the welfare of both communities and the basic values of both.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently sought to maintain a careful balance <Col N="2258" /> between giving the necessary encouragement to those who are genuinely seeking a transition from violence to peace while at the same time ensuring that this cannot be exploited by those whose purposes could well be the opposite.  Consistent with that, we have both maintained our guard and refrained from slamming any door gratuitously.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the security measures necessary to counter terrorism from every quarter remain and have always been maintained in full force.  Garda actions, and some significant successes, speak for themselves in that regard.  I mention it only because sometimes one hears statements or interviews implying that involvement in the peace process must mean some degree of indulgence to those in violation of the law.  That never was and never will be the case.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have constructed a political process which will accommodate Sinn Féin on certain specific terms, but, if those terms are not met it enables all those who do abide by the necessary democratic ground rules to do business without them and to demonstrate clearly that violence carries no political veto.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret and concern to the Government that the rate of progress at these talks has been disappointingly slow.  Contrary to some recent and rather astonishing statements by some Unionist spokespersons that this is because the two Governments had a foot on the brake while waiting for Sinn Féin, I want to state clearly that the Government and all other participants except the three Unionist parties have been seeking eagerly to get into the substantive phase of the negotiations since 10 June.  The main stumbling block in the talks so far has been the shadow of the decommissioning issue which, intentionally or otherwise, is being developed by the Unionist parties into a hurdle that the republican leadership would find it impossible to clear.</P>
    <P>The Government has made clear that we see decommissioning as an essential part of any comprehensive peace settlement.  We have shown by our actions, <Col N="2259" /> including the preparation of legislation, that everything that lies in our power will be done to further that objective. However there is little point in us, or anyone else, pretending we will do things on decommissioning that are not in our power.  Our security forces have had a &ldquo;decommissioning policy&rdquo; from the beginning, to do their utmost to detect and confiscate illegal weaponry. They will leave no stone unturned in this respect in the future.</P>
    <P>We must not however confuse this necessary exercise with the wider ambition to persuade those who have so far eluded detection, to disarm voluntarily. That wider goal can only be achieved through an inclusive process of negotiation and with the co-operation of those who hold the weapons.  That is a political challenge, and it is for the Unionist parties as well as the others to create the political climate where it can become a reality.</P>
    <P>The report of the International Body offered an impartial, objective and carefully balanced analysis of how the decommissioning issue might be handled.  We have from the beginning urged all parties to accept the report as the basis for movement forward out of the quagmire in which we have been bogged down.  We succeeded, in June, in reaching agreement with the British Government on this issue, and the joint proposal we published on 1 October is firmly grounded on the necessity of commitment to the implementation of the Mitchell report in all its aspects.  In this context, it is regrettable that the Ulster Unionist Party seemed last week to retreat from its earlier acceptance of the report and to reinstate a precondition close to Washington 3.  However, I welcome Mr. Trimble's assurance, in a speech delivered on Saturday, that &ldquo;we cannot now... return to prior decommissioning&rdquo;.  We look forward to exploring the scope for flexibility which may exist and to moving rapidly forward.</P>
    <P>On a wider scale, it would be absurd for the negotiations to break down over <Col N="2260" /> an issue which remains, for as long as there is no IRA ceasefire, entirely hypothetical, given that the need for decommissioning to be mutual eliminates the possibility of loyalist action at this time. It is equally paradoxical that the political process should for so long have been dominated by an issue which elevates military hardware to a place of primacy, and gives the paramilitary quartermasters an unprecedented role in the pace of the political process.  Surely the time has come to move on at speed to the real issues which so urgently need to be confronted and which have been spelled out by many speakers earlier today.</P>
    <P>I do not deny the very real emotional force of the decommissioning question has been underscored by Monday's atrocity.  The fear that the republican movement might, even after the entry of Sinn Féin to talks, seek to use the language, or even the methods, of coercion and threat is understandable.  So is the anxiety that even after an honourable and balanced settlement some republican diehards might return to force.  I do not say these fears are unreal but when examined they can surely be put in perspective.  Unionists can rely on the firm basis of principles on which the negotiations have been established, and which safeguard both the primacy of democratic means and the need for majority support for any settlement.</P>
    <P>They can depend on the continued determination of the security forces on both sides of the Border, as well as, surely, their own continuing resilience and determination not to be intimidated.  The overwhelming majority of Nationalists, on the questions of violence and of consent, are not, and will not be, on the side of the IRA, but on the side of their Unionist neighbours. Which situation is, objectively, more threatening to their security and well-being: a political vacuum filled with bitterness and recrimination, or a political settlement encompassing the principles of consent, democracy and nonviolence?</P>
    <P>We share with the Unionists the need to be reassured on the good faith and <Col N="2261" /> democratic commitment of Sinn Féin before they are admitted to the political process.  For as long as they do not meet the terms we have set out they will not be at the negotiating table.  It is important however to recognise that inclusive negotiations against a background of peace are incomparably the best approach, and therefore should be kept as our preferred goal.  If that cannot be attained, then we must do everything to make a success of the options we have.  It would be perverse however to gratuitously block the routes whereby, if wiser counsels ultimately prevail in the republican movement, the truly peaceful and inclusive process we would wish to see can become a reality. Negotiations to end the conflict are in the last analysis a duty for all those who have a contribution to make.  We should press Sinn Féin to meet their responsibilities and requirements in that respect, on behalf of the constituency they represent and which deserves the place at the table which the IRA has blocked.  I look forward to returning to Stormont next week, at the head of the Irish Government delegation, and to working with all of those committed to democracy to prove that violence and intimidation will not blow us of course.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with some specific points raised in the course of the day.  A number of Deputies have referred to the recommendation by the European Parliament Budget Committee to reduce the 1997 budget for the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  I understand all members of the European Parliament wish the agreed programme to continue and that the budget amendments are not based on any wish to halt or damage the programme.  Yesterday's proposal by the Budget Committee is only a stage in an extended budgetary procedure and I am sure the difficulties are temporary and will be resolved.  I can assure Deputies that the Government will do everything possible to ensure that the full funding, as agreed by all institutions of the Union, is made available to the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> Deputy Bertie Ahern criticised the Government's handling of the peace process and in particular the extent of my involvement.  These criticisms are entirely unjustified.  As far as the Government is concerned, I doubt that any previous Government has ever devoted more time to the Northern Ireland question.  Neither, I would suggest, has any previous Government been in such frequent and sustained contact with the British Government in seeking to carry forward the peace process. In addition to permanent channels of communication through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and diplomatic missions, regular contact between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, and between me and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ministers and officials spend three days of every week in Belfast where they are in virtually continuous consultation with their British opposite numbers.</P>
    <P>For anyone to claim there is little to show from such contacts is to ignore reality.  What the two Governments are trying to do &mdash; to secure the negotiation of a comprehensive political settlement which is both acceptable to the Governments and the representatives of all democratically mandated political parties in Northern Ireland, and capable of securing popular approval in referendums North and South &mdash; has not been attempted before.  If we want these negotiations to succeed &mdash; regardless of whether Sinn Féin is involved &mdash; we have to be prepared for a long and difficult journey.</P>
    <P>The Government is both energetic and effective in pursuit of our policies. I find it hard to reconcile suggestions from Deputy Bertie Ahern that I am not sufficiently involved in matters relating to the North with frequent Unionist protestations that my pervasive influence is their main problem.  I can assure the Deputy that I am fully engaged in Northern policy in general and in the multi-party talks in particular.  Furthermore, the Government fields a highly experienced and effective team of Ministers and officials at the <Col N="2263" /> negotiations which, I would suggest, yields nothing in comparison to that fielded during the 1991-92 talks.</P>

      <P>Human rights, whether we are speaking about Northern Ireland or far away in Myanmar, are extremely important and cannot be ignored.  The deplorable situation in Burma which has been highlighted by Amnesty International must be addressed by all governments.  The Irish Government in its position as President of the EU has a unique opportunity to highlight this issue and to ensure that effective pressure is brought to bear on the Government in Burma now known as Myanmar.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, is an inspiration to people all over the world.  There is an extremely oppressive regime in power there and Amnesty International and the John Pilger Report on Channel 4 have highlighted the enormous human rights abuses.  Burma is far away but it is critical that the Western world, and particularly Ireland during its EU Presidency, make its views known on this appalling abuse of human rights.  It is important to internationalise these issues.  Just as international help and involvement has been important in Northern Ireland, it can help those suffering abuse under other regimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Burma's name may have changed but oppression remains.  The military rulers declared 1996 the year to visit their country but there are many facts that will not be found in government handouts or tourist brochures.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been imprisoned and killed.  There is martial law and the generals continue to imprison anyone suspected of opposition.  One of the world's most famous prisoners of conscience, Aung San Suu Kyi, still faces daily oppression.  She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and continues to face attacks for opposing the <Col N="2264" /> Government and trying to introduce democracy.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International are not allowed to enter the country and people are frightened of speaking out.  There is evidence that much of the infrastructure is being built by forced labour.  Those who are friendly with Aung San Suu Kyi have been arrested and some have died in deplorable conditions in Burmese jails.  A young assistant of Aung San Suu Kyi has been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment only because she was a campaign assistant.  There are tragic stories about many young citizens in Burma.  Two young girls of one of the minority groups were forced to become unpaid porters for the military.  They were raped continually while working for the military and, in fact, died on their return home.  I hope that during the Irish Presidency we will continue to exert international pressure on the regime and that the EU will speak with one voice on this issue.  Tourists must know the real story of this country and the repression behind the infrastructure which they are being shown.  I hope the Irish Government in its role will ask for the release of prisoners and demand that the opposition are allowed to operate.  Democracy in its most developed form is fragile and flawed, but as the situation exists in Burma it is brutalising for its people and must be challenged continually.</P>

      <P>The Government remains very seriously concerned at the continuing deterioration of the situation in Burma.  We deplore in particular the practice of torture, summary and arbitrary executions, forced labour, abuse of women, political arrests, forced displacements of the population and restrictions on the fundamental rights of freedom and of speech, movement and assembly, which have been reported there in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I attended the ASEAN Regional Forum in Jakarta on 22-23 July 1996 I sought a meeting with Mr. Ohn Gyaw, the Foreign Minister of the <Col N="2265" /> Union of Myanmar.  This was the first such meeting between the European Union and Myanmar since 1994.  In our encounter, I indicated to Mr. Ohn Gyaw in forthright terms the concerns of the European Union in relation to the deterioration of political and human rights in Myanmar and the unwarranted restriction the fundamental rights of freedom of speech, movement and association.  I urged the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to implement without delay the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Burma, to enter meaningful dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and to bring about national reconciliation and democratic reform respecting the aspirations of the Burmese people as expressed in the elections of May 1990.</P>
    <P>I also sought a full and satisfactory explanation of the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death of the late Mr. James Leander Nichols who had acted in a consular capacity for Denmark and Finland in Rangoon.  I should also add that discussion of Burma dominated the informal dinner for Ministers attending the ASEAN Regional Forum in Jakarta and was addressed at the ASEAN Regional Forum proper, at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conferences and in bilateral contacts which I had with ministerial colleagues from ASEAN and their full dialogue partners.  On 26 September 1996, I led the EU ministerial troika in a further meeting in New York with Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw.  I reiterated the concerns of the European Union and indicated that the explanations which have been offered by the Burmese authorities to date are neither full nor satisfactory.  I informed him that, given the apparent unwillingness of the Burmese Government to enter any significant discussions on the EU's legitimate preoccupations, the EU had taken a series of steps which it had already announced in Jakarta.  It had requested <Col N="2266" /> that the UN Special Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and Imprisonment visit Burma, that the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma investigate the circumstances of the death of Mr. Nichols and that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights take action on Burma.</P>
    <P>Since then the situation in Burma has deteriorated further, with the recent widescale detentions of supporters of the National League for Democracy (NLD), and the blockading of access to the residence of NLD leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  On 1 October 1996, at a meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, which I chaired, the EU issued a declaration expressing its concern at these events. The EU called for the immediate and unconditional release of all those who have been detained and to allow for the resumption of normal activities by the National League of Democracy.  Finally, the European Union emphasised the need for genuine dialogue to commence without delay between SLORC and the National League for Democracy as being the only possible credible way forward for national reconciliation in Burma.  The council also noted that the EU Commission was completing its inquiry into possible future suspension of the generalised systems of preferences trade benefits for Burma.  The Irish EU Presidency has also pursued the question at the highest level in diplomatic contacts most recently during the EU-Japan Summit on 30 September 1996 when the Taoiseach raised the question of Burma with Prime Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.  There are also regular contacts with the American State Department in Washington DC concerning developments in Burma.</P>
    <P>The European Union is giving active consideration to further possible restrictions in relation to Burma.  The situation is at present being discussed by the Common Foreign and Security Policy's Asia-Oceania Working Group at their <Col N="2267" /> meeting in Brussles today and tomorrow.</P>

      <P>This matter relates to proposals to slash moneys from the peace and reconciliation fund.  It emanates from the European Parliament Budgetary Committee and is sponsored by the Socialist Group of which the Labour Party is a member.  We abhor what happened.  Many people, including Ms Bernie Malone, are saying this is a housekeeping exercise because the uptake on the money is slow and, ultimately, we will not lose the overall figure.</P>
      <P>Why has the uptake of this money been slow?  It is because of the system that has been set up by this Government in respect of the disbursement of that money in the Border areas.  The Government involved ADM, which was quite right, but the Combat Poverty Agency was brought in by somebody for a reason.  All sides of the House have been vociferous in their attitude as to how best this money could be spent; 20 per cent of the money was to be spent in Border areas.  We have had all party meetings to try to insist that a portion of this money be diverted into the Borer areas to provide a proper industrial infrastructure.  These areas have suffered as much, and in some cases even more, than the North, but there is huge Exchequer backing in the North which is not found in the southern Border counties.  This is required in these areas to assist peace and reconciliation.  This issue is relevant to my constituency, but there are areas along the Border outside my constituency which are in even more need of a proper industrial infrastructure to entice business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the task force on funding arrangements in the Border region, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, was given responsibility for the Border areas and I often wonder if he <Col N="2268" /> knows what his job is in that regard. This report is a farce and was expensive. It tells us about the funds that are available.  We already know about them.  The only recommendation is that these funds should have a distinct identity, there should be a better application form and perhaps more leaflets to inform people about them.  Unfortunately, the existence of these funds builds up a huge expectation in the people along the Border.  When people come to apply for these funds, they find that they are designed for some airy-fairy schemes and not something that is really needed in the Border areas.</P>

      <P>This, as my colleague said, is an appalling decision.  The fact that it was defended by an Irish member of the Parliament is also appalling.  I am not surprised that a Labour member would defend it because the Labour Party has nothing to offer in rural Ireland, especially in the Border area. This matter had been raised time and again in this House by myself and others.  We expressed concern at the involvement of ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency and at the delay in setting up the necessary facilities to ensure the money would be distributed as there is substantial funding available.  We have to move from our current position. The most serious aspect of this is that we have the Presidency of the EU at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach washed his hands of this particular issue on two different occasions here yesterday.  He stated &ldquo;If the Deputy has any problems he wishes to pursue with the Members of that Committee, he should pursue it with them&rdquo;.  On another occasion he said &ldquo;I am not answerable for the actions of members of the European Parliament. If the Deputy wants to say something to them he should do so&rdquo;.  That worries me.  The Taoiseach does not care about us losing £78 million.  I ask him to interest himself in this issue and pressurise the Tánaiste to influence his colleague in the European Parliament to vote on it in a fortnight's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> I also ask him, even at this late stage, to reshuffle his Cabinet and appoint a Minister to the Border region because that is the fundamental problem.  No one in Government cares about it.  The Taoiseach should use his influence with the Fine Gael MEP in his area and also at European level.  We are concerned that he walked away from the conference in Pittsburg last week, which he was supposed to attend on behalf of the Border region.  I ask the Minister for Finance to use his influence in Europe to ensure that the decision on the diminution of funding for the Border region is repealed when it comes before the Parliament in two weeks' time.  I compliment the MEP for Connacht-Ulster, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, who has been very active in highlighting this issue.</P>

      <P>Funding for this initiative has been provided through the annual EU budget.  The first ECU 200 million was funded from within the Structural Funds resources, while the additional ECU 100 million was drawn from the reserve for Community Initiatives.  In the draft 1997 budget sent to Parliament by Council, provision was made for commitment appropriations of ECU 159.9 million for the special programme for regions in both parts of Ireland.  The draft budget for 1997 is now being considered by the European Parliament as part of the ongoing budgetary procedure.</P>

    <P>The European Parliament's Committee on Budget has reduced the commitment appropriation by ECU 100 million.  Their justification for doing so is <Col N="2270" /> that the resources provided were not fully utilised in 1995 and that expenditure in 1996 is likely to be significantly below the amounts provided. The committee envisage that the unused appropriations from previous years be carried forward to supplement the amounts available in 1997.  The Parliament has taken the view that the savings which would thus accrue in 1997 should be used to provide additional funds for other Structural Funds programmes. Ireland totally rejects the position of the budget committee and calls on the European Parliament at its plenary session on 24 October to restore the amounts proposed by Council.  I am confident that the Budget Council at its second reading of the budget in November, which will be presided over by the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, will reject any amendment which would put at risk the funding of the programme in 1997.  I hope that Parliament will take account of the Council's strong view on this matter.  The European Parliament justified the proposed reduction on the basis that the Council has not acceded to its request to provide additional cover of ECU 100 million to replace the resources taken from the reserve.  It is regrettable that the funding of the peace programme should be called into question because of this technical development.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner for Regional Policy, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, has issued a statement strongly criticising the action by the Parliament's budget committee.  The Commissioner reconfirms the Commission's commitment to the peace programme, which is carrying out valuable work in difficult circumstances.  The Commissioner points out that although total expenditure on the programme in 1995 was slower than expected due to the new administrative arrangements &mdash; which the Commission insisted on implementing, not the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner points out that although total expenditure on the programme in 1995 was slower than expected due to the new administrative arrangements, it is now accelerating. The present forecast is to spend ECU 70 million of aid in Northern Ireland.  A further ECU 28 million will be spent in the Border counties.  In total, it is expected that in 1996 some ECU 100 million will be spent.  The Commissioner has insisted there is no doubt that there are enough projects to absorb the amounts in 1997 for which the Commission asked and which the Council confirmed.  Ireland fully supports the Commission's position.  Ireland will be pressing for continuing adequate funding for 1998 and 1999.</P>
      <P>An unusual feature of the programme and a major contributing factor to the perception regarding slowness of expenditure is the extent to which implementation of the various measures has been devolved, at the insistence of the Commission, to intermediary funding bodies and the emphasis on actions to combat social exclusion which permeates much of the programme.  The intermediary bodies are funded by way of global grants on foot of legal agreements signed between them and the EU Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>This departure from the norm was strongly recommended in the course of widespread consultation in the eligible areas carried out by the EU Commission task force and the two administrations.  The setting up of the intermediary bodies took time, but they have been in place for much of this year and the pace of commitments under the programme is very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2272" /> The consultation process carried out by the Commission and the two administrations found a widespread emphasis on the need to combat social exclusion in order to achieve the objectives of peace and reconciliation.  All sectors, including the business sector, urged that the theme of social inclusion, as well as forming an important sub-programme in its own right, should also inform all the other measures and sub-programmes of the programme.  In the difficult circumstances pertaining in Northern Ireland at present the thrust of the programme is particularly relevant and I would ask the House for its support in Ireland's efforts to ensure that adequate funding is secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I requested this Adjournment debate on the need to re-establish good Garda-community relations in Dublin's inner city to combat the drugs problem in order to highlight and bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice the seriousness of the position in this area and the level of frustration of the local community as it witnesses drug dealing openly conducted in streets and neighbourhoods at all hours of the day and night.  The open dealing in drugs and the Garda's seeming inability to stop it has led to frustration in the community.  This is compounded when they see local anti-drug groups being targeted by the Garda. There is a belief, no matter how ill-informed, that the Garda is more preoccupied with controlling the activities of anti-drug groups than tackling the drugs problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I met local people who were peacefully patrolling their estate off Cork Street.  A woman told me that earlier she had reported to two gardaí in a van parked across the street that two young girls were dealing in drugs at that moment.  She said that the gardaí politely thanked her and said they would deal with the matter, but they sat there and did nothing about it.  A few <Col N="2273" /> minutes later they drove off while the two women completed their dealing and left.  Incidents such as those create a sense of helplessness in communities where people want to co-operate with the gardaí.  The frustration of the local community is shared by the gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>There is a need to direct greater resources and Garda manpower to these areas to show people that as a society we are concerned about these matters. We should have the political will to take whatever action is necessary.  I have advocated on a number of occasions a zero tolerance attitude towards crime, be it drugs or illegal cigarette dealing. We must send out a clear signal that as a society we will not tolerate breaches of our laws.  To permit illegal drug dealing on our streets without the maximum level of Garda action sends out the wrong signals.  Recently I spoke to a retired member of the Garda who witnessed people in Henry Street and other areas selling cigarettes, most of which are illegally imported.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent setting up of the operation, Dóchas, as a first step, but it must be that.  Despite the possibility of renewed terrorist activity and the need to direct extra Garda manpower back to the Border, the extra 500 gardaí in the inner city must remain there on a long-term basis.  This must be augmented by more community policing in conjunction with the local people.</P>
    <P>In reply to my written question the Minister yesterday informed me that, in effect there are now fewer gardaí on the beat than there were 11 years ago.  In real terms over the past 11 years we have recruited 79 fewer gardaí annually than have either resigned, retired or otherwise left the force.  If the Minister examines those figures she will see that they are correct.  I invite the Minister to accompany me, and other local Deputies, on a tour of parts of the inner city without prior notice.  She will see for herself the low level of visible Garda presence and will hear the frustration of local people who see their offsprings' <Col N="2274" /> childhoods being taken away from them on the streets and corridors of their own neighbourhoods.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to maintain the current Garda presence and not to return them to Border duty.  If we have to we should get them from somewhere else, but I want to see a growing confidence among people in the Garda.  They want to co-operate with them.</P>
    <P>At meetings I attended I heard people say that they will not take part in illegal demonstrations.  They do not want anything illegal to be done.  They want to work within the law, but the Garda must be given back-up resources to deal with these people.  It is almost too late at this stage.  We have a big job on our hands to restore people's confidence in the Garda.  They want to have that confidence restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest and concern to Deputy Briscoe.  I assure him that for my part, as Minister for Justice, tackling the drugs problem is an absolute priority.  I am well aware of Deputy Briscoe's long standing concerns expressed in the House, both when his party was in Government and now when it is in Opposition.  I know he is not highlighting this issue because he thinks it only began in the past day or two, or during my period in office.  I would not belittle what Deputy Briscoe said because I know he is an advocate of community activity and the necessary response from the State.  I am aware of the dangers of drug abuse and drug trading and the damage they are doing to inner city communities.  I am also aware of the pain being suffered by families as a result of drug abuse by individual family members.  I am determined to tackle the scourge of drug use and drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken a number of important steps to improve the response of the State agencies in dealing with the problem.  I will pass on to the Garda Commissioner Deputy Briscoe's comments about the reaction of people to the effectiveness of the Garda in their areas. <Col N="2275" /> I assure the Deputy that the Garda are tackling the problem.  He referred to Operation Dóchas and Members will be aware that the Garda has reviewed its operations in relation to combating the drugs problem, particularly in Dublin's inner city areas.</P>
    <P>Last week the Garda Commissioner announced the commencement of Operation Dóchas.  The new strategy will operate in all Dublin districts and will involve the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain clothes gardaí. The uniformed gardaí will adopt a high profile through both foot and mobile patrols.  They will work to forge greater links with the community &mdash; which is what Deputy Briscoe is calling for &mdash; and with community leaders and families with problems.  Back-up will be provided by specialist mobile and other units.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned the need for more community police and this is essentially a force of community police which will be available to go into such areas.  Deputy Briscoe will be glad to know that the 165 gardaí transferred earlier this year to the Border counties are returning to Dublin this week.  Some of them have arrived and the remainder will return this weekend.  All of them will be deployed in Dublin and to the best of my knowledge, unless something unforeseen happens they will not be factored into the continuing patrols in the Border area for protection against BSE.</P>
    <P>In this operation gardaí will seek the support of the community and will distribute leaflets to households asking people to give information to their local Garda stations or via a confidential freephone number.  The aim is to create a situation where local people can see that the Garda are enforcing the law and helping the community to overcome their difficulties with drug abuse.  I have discussed the new strategy with the Garda Commissioner and I am confident that with the support of the community the force will tackle drugs related crime.  In particular, it will target the street trading the Deputy referred <Col N="2276" /> to, and will significantly improve the quality of life in areas where drug dealing is prevalent.  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that the strategy will be kept under review for an initial period of three months and that any changes necessary will be made to ensure its success.  We obviously want to see how it is working and if adaptations have to be made to the system they will be.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that they are involved with a number of local anti-drug groups and experience a high level of co-operation from local people.  They acknowledge that this level of co-operation is not forthcoming from all groups.  The precise objectives of a small number of indivuduals in certain groups is not clear.  Gardaí have been excluded from some public meetings and one wonders why.  It is important to note that local community action may be based on local information which may fall short of the standards of proof required to satisfy the law and the courts.  The Garda point out that there have been a number of recent successful operations against drug dealers and pushers, that such operations may be covert and for that reason are not always obvious to the communities.  Offenders are now appearing before the courts as a result of those operations.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I introduced a number of significant measures on the broader front of national policy to combat the drugs problem.  I outlined these many times.  The recent establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau is having a great effect on drug traffickers and organised criminals.  There is a need for greater co-operation and the recruitment of more civilians to the Garda as well as increasing the numbers of recruits going into training.  Additional judges have been appointed, there are extra court sittings and additional staff have been appointed to the forensic laboratories.  Tough new legislation, such as the drug trafficking Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act, is attacking the type of crimes that Deputy Briscoe has so <Col N="2277" /> often referred to during his long service in the House.  I am glad that I, as Minister for Justice, have overseen the introduction of a number of these new measures.</P>

      <P>The issue of Irish Steel has been with us for a long time. We have had protracted Adjournment debates and last year legislation was introduced.  The final settlement was welcomed on all sides of the House and involved the deal with ISPAT where by arrangements for Irish Steel were put in order, including the clearance of debts and input of moneys by the Government.  We are all conversant with the background.</P>
      <P>Today, however, I am talking about 30 more redundancies which have been announced.  The workers who had already accepted redundancy packages from Irish Steel have made great sacrifices so that the enterprise could flourish.  Prior to the ISPAT redundancy arrangement those workers put their act together in a strong and vibrant way to ensure that the plant would survive and that it would be attractive for purchase which is what occurred.  This sacrifice has not been appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is short changing the workers in relation to aid provided by the EU.  Some £300,000 was provided by Brussels in the form of a readaptation <Col N="2278" /> fund so that former Irish Steel workers could adapt to the loss of work.  Under the terms of the agreement with Brussels the State has to put up a matching amount.  This will result in redundant workers receiving about £3,000 each. The Government, however, is attempting to argue that the minimal redundancy terms given to the Irish Steel workers when the rationalisation took place should count as matching finance.  This goes against the spirit of the agreement with the workers and represents a serious breach of faith by the Government.  Irish Steel workers are being treated differently to steel workers in other EU states who qualify for the adaptation fund.</P>
    <P>The Government also has serious questions to answer about what has happened to training moneys provided by the EU for Irish Steel in December 1994.  Part of this money should be available for retaining redundant workers, including the 30 about to be laid off.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Steel Bill was brought before the Dáil earlier this year the Government gave a commitment that it would honour agreements made with the workers.  Will the Minister for Enterprise and Employment honour those agreements?  I have been in consultation with MEPs and officials in Brussels about the matter and understand that a measure of progress has been made.  Further work remains to be done however.  I wish to ensure that the rights of the workers are fully recognised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish ISPAT Limited is a private company.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has no control over the operation of or the decisions made by the company.  Under a rationalisation plan produced by Irish Steel Limited in 1994, coinciding with the serious downturn in the international steel market, it <Col N="2279" /> was expected that the level of employment in the company would be reduced to 331 workers.  Under the sale and purchase agreement signed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and ISPAT International on 6 September 1995, ISPAT undertook to maintain employment at this level.  Employment in Irish ISPAT currently stands at 364.</P>
    <P>Given the decline in steel prices, one would be surprised if the company were not, as part of the normal management process, giving consideration to effecting savings, including savings on staffing costs.  That said, however, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment would imagine that reductions in job numbers would be in the context of voluntary redundancies.</P>
    <P>The measure known as readaptation aid was formulated by the European Commission to ease the burden of steel workers who have been made redundant under the current restructuring of <Col N="2280" /> the steel industry and is administered under Article 56 (2) (b) of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. An application was made by the Department of Enterprise and Employment on 29 July 1994 under this measure for readaptation aid for 205 workers in Irish Steel.  Since that date I understand that the Department has supplied full details on each of the Irish Steel workers affected to enable the European Commission make a decision as to the eligibility of the workers to receive these payments.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Enterprise and Employment has recently received a communication from the EU Commission that 194 Irish Steel workers are eligible under this scheme and that a decision as to the amount of aid to be paid to each worker will be made by mid-November at the latest.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 October 1996.</P>

      <P>My Department employs a total of 37 inspectors of guidance-psychologists.  Psychological and guidance inspection services have been provided to second-level schools for a number of years.  In 1990 four psychologists were appointed to work on a pilot project in primary schools.  A further ten psychologists were appointed in 1995 to initiate a Department of Education psychological service for primary schools.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 45 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that a number of concerns have been raised regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  However, I can assure the House of my continuing commitment to <Col N="2142" /> meeting the educational needs of travellers.  The report to which the Deputies refer contains more than 160 separate recommendations relating to education and training for travellers.  The recommendations are very wideranging and span the full spectrum of provision from pre-school to adult education.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the report in July 1995 the Government established an interdepartmental working group, under the aegis of the Department of Equality and Law Reform and including representatives of all Government Departments with an involvement in the area, to consider the feasibility of implementing the recommendations. The working group reported earlier this year.  The recommendations which have implications for my Department are now being pursued.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force recommended that additional posts be allocated to the visiting teacher service for travellers.  I am pleased to announce that I have decided to allocate a further three teachers to this service in the current year.  These posts will be advertised shortly.  The report also recommended that responsibility for senior traveller training centres, which cater for 15 to 25 year old travellers, be transferred from the Department of Enterprise and Employment to the Department of Education.  Agreement in principle has been reached on this issue and my Department is working on the detailed arrangements for this transfer.</P>
    <P>In addition, the interdepartmental group concluded that the co-ordination of the delivery of education services for travellers could best be addressed by creating a special committee in my Department, which would consult with the various interest groups, including traveller organisations.  Arrangements are under way for the establishment of this committee.</P>
    <P>My commitment to the future development of education services for travelling people is set out clearly in the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future.  My aim, as set out in the White Paper, is to promote <Col N="2143" /> the full and inclusive participation of travellers at all levels of the education system.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the number of one-teacher primary schools which had 20 or more pupils enrolled on 30 September 1995; and her staffing policy in relation to one-teacher schools.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of one-teacher primary schools which had 20 or more pupils on 30 September 1995 was 25.  The staffing of a primary school of any particular year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of teaching posts allocated to a school for any particular year is determined in accordance with the staffing schedule for that year.</P>
      <P>In line with the current staffing schedule for primary schools, a one-teacher primary school will qualify for its first assistant's post when its enrolment on the previous 30 September reaches or exceeds 28 pupils.  However, a newly-established school, which is experiencing rapid enrolment growth, can qualify for its first assistant's post from the date on which it achieves an enrolment of 33 pupils, even if the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year was less than 28.</P>
      <P>In addition, a maximum class size guideline of 28 pupils applies to one-teacher schools which have more than four standards.  A one-teacher school which is in breach of this maximum class size guideline may qualify for its first assistant's post when its enrolment reaches 28.  The first assistant's post is suppressed in a school when its enrolment drops below 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May of this year I indicated that two-teacher schools which were due to lose their first assistant's posts and thus become one-teacher schools would retain their posts for the 1996-97 school year.  This concession was allowed for <Col N="2144" /> the 1996-97 school year only because of concerns expressed regarding the impact on smaller schools of the decision not to improve the staffing schedule in the current year.</P>

      <P>The home school community liaison scheme was expanded in the 1995-96 school year by the inclusion of an additional 49 schools at primary level and 36 schools at post primary level.  This brings the total number of schools at primary level to 181 with the services of 105 local co-ordinators and at post primary level to 84 schools with the services of 83 local co-ordinators.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, outlines the intention to continue and further develop the home school links programme in areas of disadvantage, as resources permit.  All schools will be required under the provisions of the White Paper to have a formal home school links policy as part of their school plan.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  This initiative called Breaking the Cycle seeks to discriminate positively in favour of schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new targeted programme of supports is being made available to 33 selected schools in areas of particular disadvantage in the large urban areas of disadvantage.  The selected schools will <Col N="2145" /> receive a special package of supports including funding for materials and equipment and after school projects.  The schools will also receive extra staffing to allow for a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 in all junior classes.  A newly appointed co-ordinator has been appointed who will oversee the implementation of the scheme.  In addition, 25 clusters of rural-small schools with less than five teachers which have high levels of disadvantage have been selected to receive a targeted programme of supports which also includes funding for materials and equipment and after school projects. A locally based co-ordinator is being newly appointed to each of the 25 clusters.  Each co-ordinator will work with families and teachers in the selected schools to combat the effects of educational disadvantage.  I believe that this new initiative will help to further promote home school links in the schools that have been selected for inclusion in both the urban and rural phases of the scheme.</P>

      <P>My priorities for the Irish Presidency of the European Unioin are: first, school effectiveness &mdash; principles and strategies to promote success at school; second, lifelong learning; and third, in-career development of teachers.</P>
      <P>Over recent Presidencies &mdash; notably the German, French, Spanish and Italian Presidencies &mdash; measures contributing to the development of quality education have been emphasised and dealt with.  Given the importance of educational quality, which is also one of the fundamental principles in the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, I selected three themes which are central to the provision of quality education for all students.</P>
      <P>Discussion documents on school effectiveness, lifelong learning and in-career development of teachers were prepared some months ago and these are now being discussed by the EU Education Committee.  I look forward to a wide-ranging exchange of views on these issues at the Education Council on 21 November.  In the case of school effectiveness and lifelong learning I will be seeking the adoption of Council conclusions which will put in place a framework of ongoing action in these areas.</P>
      <P>In addition to work at the Council of Ministers, a range of other important issues are being dealt with by way of the Department's Presidency conference programme.  Five major conferences will be held on the following themes: 1. gender equality for 2000 and beyond, 2. in-career development in education, 3. best practices in substance abuse prevention educational programmes, 4. guidance in the information society, and 5. European year of lifelong learning &mdash; European closing conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy may be aware that I published, last July, a brochure entitled Initiatives and Activities in Education.  This outlines the EU Presidency programme in education.  It was <Col N="2147" /> distributed to Members of the House, and I will be happy to make further copies available, if requested.</P>

      <P>My Department's role in the pre-school area centres on the delivery of the Early Start Pre-School Programme.  This programme is currently focused on schools serving urban areas which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  The early start pre-school programme was first introduced in 1994 with the establishment of pre-school projects in eight locations and extended in 1995 to a further 32 locations.  This brought the total number of pre-school classes now in place to 56.  The classes in question have a capacity to cater for up to 1,680 children.</P>
      <P>I have established an expert monitoring committee to oversee the operation and future development of the early start pre-school programme.  This committee is representative of the partners in education and a wide range of interests involved in the provision of pre-school services.  I have also arranged to have the project evaluated by the Education Research Centre in Drumcondra and this process is continuing. Any decision on further expansion or improvement of the programme will have regard to the outcome of the evaluation exercise, the advice of the monitoring committee and the question of resource availability.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the proposed appointment of additional visiting teachers for travellers was unable to proceed in 1995 due to the Government's need to curtail the growth of numbers in the public sector. However, appointments of teachers to special schools and to special classes, including classes catering for traveller children, were not affected by the Government's decision and continued in the normal way.</P>
      <P>In September 1996 posts becoming surplus as a result of falling enrolments again became available for distribution within the primary school sector.  The process of finalising decisions on the allocation of these posts in the special needs areas has recently been completed by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that one of the special needs areas selected for additional support on this occasion is the visiting teacher service for travellers.  I have decided to allocate an additional three posts to this service in the current school year.  The posts in question will be advertised shortly.  I hope to be in a position to announce further teacher post allocations to other special needs areas in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach):</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that issues relating to suspension and expulsion of students with behavioural problems are complex and difficult.  It is Government <Col N="2149" /> policy to actively encourage the retention of students in the mainstream education system by means of a broadly based and diverse range of curricular options.  For the school year 1996-97 I have put in place the junior certificate elementary programme which will further contribute to this strategy.</P>
      <P>The first course of action open to parents whose children are excluded from the mainstream school system by virtue of suspension or expulsion is one of appeal to the school authorities.  My Department, through its guidelines on school discipline, lays considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.  In cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child readmitted to the mainstream school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of its inspectorate in a consultative process with school authorities. In addition, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils with special needs in order that the most appropriate provision can be made.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, proposes the establishment of education boards.  These boards will be given a clear role in relation to appeals arising from decisions of schools affecting students including decisions concerning suspension and expulsion.  The Government has approved of the drafting of the Education (Education Boards and Boards of Management) Bill which will give effect to these proposals.  I hope to publish this Bill shortly.</P>
      <P>A school attendance Bill which is also in preparation in my Department will address further the issue of suspensions and expulsions.</P>

      <P>In the majority of cases, the needs of pupils with behavioural difficulties are capable of being met within the mainstream school system with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers or guidance counsellors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy may be aware that I have recently introduced a pilot scheme of teacher-counsellors which is intended to offer special targeted support to selected primary schools encountering particular difficulty in coping with disruptive and disturbed <Col N="2161" /> pupils.  They key role of the teacher-counsellor is: (a) to co-ordinate a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies which will help prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour; and (b) to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behavioural difficulties in the classroom.</P>
    <P>The pilot scheme has been introduced in the Tallaght-Clondalkin and north inner city areas of Dublin.  A total of 27 teacher-counsellors have been deployed to-date and the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department's Inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Where more severe behavioural difficulties are identified as a result of an assessed emotional disturbance on the part of a child, placement can be arranged in one of the 14 special schools dedicated to the needs of such children. These schools have been established in close association with the child psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also wish to note that the health boards have recently developed a number of special residential care units to cater for children with serious emotional and behavioural difficulties.  Each such unit is being designated as a special school by my Department and attracts favourable staffing and resource allocations.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Education, Charting <Col N="2162" /> our Education Future, the policy objective will be to provide second level schools that are large enough to adequately meet the variety of curricular demands, to meet community education needs and to enhance the role of schools in vocational education and training and adult and continuing education.</P>
      <P>A Commission on School Accommodation Needs was established in March 1996 to conduct comprehensive demographic and statistical research and to report to me.  The first task of the commission is to report on the rationalisation of the vocational education committees and it is intended that this report will be published on Friday, 11 October 1996.  Among the commission's subsequent tasks will be the provision of recommendations for the rationalisation of schools at second level.  The impact of the demographic decline will be considered by the commission in this context.  It is anticipated that there will be centres where rationalisation is not possible and, in such cases, the education boards will play a key role in ensuring that adequate educational opportunities are available.  Where rationalisation is not an appropriate option, close co-operation between schools in a given locality will be necessary in order to provide a comprehensive range of senior-cycle programmes. The education boards will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate arrangements are put in place to provide a variety of senior-cycle programmes in a locality.  Special consideration in the provision of resources will be given to small schools in isolated areas.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive curriculum is available for all schools.  Each individual school cannot be expected to be in a position to provide all programmes. Schools select and provide the programmes most suitable for the needs of their pupils.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to advise on how the demands of the very wide variety of subjects can be met within the junior cycle curriculum.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  My Department is currently engaged in urgent efforts to put suitable transport arrangements in place for the children in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> My Department makes every effort to provide school transport for children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services. However, in some instances this is simply not feasible due to particular circumstances such as excessive cost; too long a distance; or the inability of a child to avail of a service because of the nature of the disability.  In such cases my Department offers a grant to the parents to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.  The amount payable depends on the distance involved and the level of attendance of the pupils.</P>
    <P>The children in question have been enrolled at a special class for pupils with speech and language disorder which has been established at the school mentioned by the Deputy.  A total of eight children have enrolled in this class.</P>
    <P>Because of the dispersed locations of the children in relation to the special class, it has not proved possible to arrange a transport service to the class. Neither have the children's parents found it possible to make alternative arrangements within the limits of the grant assistance offered in this case.  In view of these developments and in order to facilitate the children in question, my Department is urgently examining ways of overcoming the present difficulty.  I would be hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be devised in the near future.</P>

      <P>Financial assistance to schools in acquiring information technology hardware and software is provided to schools through a variety of funding arrangements from my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the school administration project a total of £609,507 was expended in 1995.  The breakdown between hardware and software and between school sectors together with the number of schools is set out in the following table. It is intended to provide a further £500,000 for information technology equipment for schools under this project in 1996.</P>
      <P>Grants for equipment, mainly information technology, for schools offering the restructured leaving certificate vocational programme amounted to £1,683,565 in 1995 comprising £1,280,848 for secondary schools, £122,717 for community and comprehensive schools and £280,000 for vocational schools.  A total of 114 schools received payments during 1995. A breakdown between hardware and software and schools sector is not readily available.  The total provision for equipment in 1996 is £4,571,000.  In the case of the schools offering the leaving certificate applied an annual resource grant in respect of equipment and materials is provided, which is calculated on the basis of £125 per leaving certificate applied pupil.  A review of the financial support for schools providing the leaving certificate applied is currently taking place and will be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £603,000 was spent in 1995 on the supply of computer equipment to 15 community and one voluntary secondary school (£10,000) in association with the provision of new schools or the provision of major extensions which required the equipping of computer-technology rooms.  In the case of building projects in the vocational sector the amount spent on computer equipment is a matter for the relevant vocational education committee subject to the upper limit for the purchase of furniture <Col N="2167" /> and equipment which is set by the Department of Education.  A detailed breakdown between hardware and software is not readily available.  To date in 1996, a total of £279,000 has been allocated by the post-primary building unit in respect of information technology support.</P>
    <P>A grant scheme for the purchase of equipment for pupils with a disability was introduced in 1995.  There was a total expenditure of £38,230 in 1995 comprising £14,808 for the voluntary <Col N="2168" /> secondary sector (5 schools), £9,739 for the vocational sector (94 schools) and £13,683 for the community and comprehensive sector (3 schools).  There is a provision of £450,000 for 1996.</P>
    <P>Computer software and hardware may also be purchased by schools or vocational education committees from within their annual running cost allocations from the Department.  This is subject to the discretion of the relevant school authorities as appropriate having regard to their own needs and budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 117, 118 and 119 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with disabilities, both in an integrated environment and in special educational facilities.  The fundamental objective is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own areas within the ordinary school <Col N="2169" /> system.  The Deputy will appreciate that the degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children involved.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out details of proposed strategies for the achievement of this objective, including the establishment of a national data base to facilitate the planning of provision for all students with disabilities, the designation of a number of ordinary primary schools as centres where children with particular disabilities may be educated, an expanded role for existing special schools dealing with a variety of disabilities, and the setting up of curriculum development projects for students with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>The White Paper envisages that, following their establishment, the education boards will have statutory responsibility to ensure that adequate educational provision is made for all students with disabilities in their areas. Each student with a disability will be assigned to the nearest appropriate special school in the region, whether or not s/he attends the school.  An action plan to arrange for the implementation of the White Paper proposals is being prepared by my Department.  It is envisaged that the proposals will be implemented over a number of years as resources allow.</P>
    <P>The special educational needs of pupils with less serious physical or mental disabilities are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where necessary, of remedial, resource or visiting teachers.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers, 36 resource teachers and 39 visiting teachers are currently in place in the primary system.</P>
    <P>Where more serious disabilities are involved, arrangements can be made for placement in one of the 272 special classes or 106 special schools which are available to cater for children with special needs.  Each of these facilities is dedicated to meeting the needs of particular disability groups.  Each facility <Col N="2170" /> enjoys a special reduced pupil teacher ratio and attracts special rates of capitation funding.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides capital funding towards the cost of facilities such as special toilets and wheelchair ramps, in order to facilitate access for special needs students, as well as funding for other special materials and equipment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>As Presidency of the EU, Ireland is leading the Union's response to the crisis in the Middle East Peace Process and, to this end, we are in continuing contact with the Israeli authorities and other parties concerned.  The approach of the EU is set out in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 11 of 2 October last.</P>
      <P>Following the decision of the Special Meeting of the European Council in Dublin on 5 October that I should convey messages to Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat, I visited the region on 6-7 October.  In meetings with both leaders, I stressed the importance attached by the EU to the urgent revitalisation of the peace process.  I also emphasised the EU's intention to make an enhanced commitment to the search for progress in the Middle East commensurate with the Union's economic contribution and involvement in the peace process so far.  My meeting with Mr. Netanyahu was friendly and constructive and the Prime Minister clearly indicated his appreciation of the efforts of the Union in support of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also had a meeting on 6 October with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. <Col N="2174" /> David Levy, my third meeting with him over the last month.  These continuing contacts with the leaders of the Israeli Government, which reflect the Union's close and long-standing relationship with Israel, have enabled me to convey clearly the EU concerns on the need for restoring momentum to the peace process.</P>

      <P>The European Union's policy in regard to East Timor is based on the common position adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996, details of which I gave in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 22 on 4 July last.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Common Position, Ireland, as Presidency, is actively supporting international efforts to promote respect for human rights and a just and peaceful solution to the question of East Timor, which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>
      <P>The current focus of these efforts is on the continuing talks, under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General, between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers, who are due to meet again in December and the all-inclusive intra-Timorese dialogue, which is to be convened for a third round early next year.  Ireland has indicated its willingness to make a financial contribution towards the cost of holding the latter talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of an arms embargo on Indonesia by EU member states, for which consensus would be required, will be kept under continuing review by the <Col N="2175" /> Irish Presidency in the light of developments in East Timor.  To be effective, an arms embargo would need to be applied universally on the basis of a United Nations resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Customs Service has primary responsibility for preventing the illegal importation of controlled drugs.  In the Single Market era, the Customs Service is required to play an increased role in protecting not only our frontier but also the Irish section of the external EU frontier against the illegal importation of drugs.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Revenue Commissioners responded to that situation by allocating substantial resources to this area, in particular by setting up the Customs National Drugs Team, CNDT, in 1992 with specific responsibility for detecting and preventing drug smuggling.  This dedicated team operates on a countrywide basis, including at air and sea ports, and it also supplements the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are responsible for combating drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that because of the vital role played by intelligence in combating <Col N="2178" /> drug smuggling, the Customs Service has devoted considerable attention to ways of enhancing intelligence gathering.  Intelligence units of the CNDT, comprising 28 staff, are specifically dedicated to this work and operate along the entire coastline of the State.  The co-operation and assistance of trade associations as well as individual companies involved in the movement of goods and persons has been enlisted through the conclusion of memoranda of understanding.  These are aimed at heightening the awareness of employees of airlines, shipping companies, freight forwarders, ferry companies etc. to the dangers of drugs smuggling and provide them with ready channels of communication with Customs.  The Customs Service has also enlisted the assistance of the general public in the fight against drug smuggling through the Drug Watch Programme, which was launched in 1994.  Under this programme, the assistance of coastal communities, maritime personnel, as well as people living near airfields, has been enlisted to report unusual occurrences to Customs. This programme has met with a very positive response.  There is also close international co-operation in the area of intelligence exchange.</P>
    <P>In order to extend the capabilities of Customs in the fight against the smuggling of drugs and other illegal substances by sea the Commissioners set up, as a pilot scheme, a martime unit in 1990.  Due to the effectiveness of the unit and with the advent of the Single Market the maritime unit was extended to five craft.  The primary aim of the maritime unit, as part of the CNDT, is the combating of drug trafficking by means of the gathering of intelligence on the movement of vessels in our coastal waters, the boarding and rummaging of yachts, pleasure craft and fishing vessels in passage or at anchor and the surveillance of parts of our coastline where smuggling activities are likely to occur and which are inaccessible to the Customs mobile task units.  Where monitoring of suspect ships and yachts operating <Col N="2179" /> outside the range of the CNDT maritime units is required the Naval Service and Air Corps provide vital assistance in this regard.</P>
    <P>Among the measures approved by the Government in July of last year to improve law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem were closer working arrangements between Customs, the Garda and the Naval Service, including the introduction of a joint task force to combat drug smuggling operations about which the law enforcement agencies had prior intelligence.  Detailed operational guidelines for the joint task force were agreed by the three agencies in May of this year, which provide for a Naval Service involvement where there is a maritime dimension to operations of this kind.  The implementation of these measures has enhanced the close co-operation that existed between all the Government agencies in the battle against drug smuggling and has maximised the effectiveness of our enforcement resources.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the drug watch programme and the joint task force is demonstrated by the joint Customs-Garda-Naval Service operation which resulted in the recent large seizure of cocaine off the <i>Sea Mist</i> in Cork and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all concerned.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the present measures taken by Customs in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies concerned provide adequate protection against drug smuggling along the Irish coastline.  The position will of course be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>It is a universal feature of health care systems that the cost of acute care in general hospitals exceed the rate of inflation in the general economy.  Those costs are created by a number of factors including the rapid advance of technology in the health sector, greater demand on the system by patients and pay increases in a system which in Ireland has two-thirds approximately of its overall costs accounted for by pay. Demographic changes such as a greater number of elderly persons in our population also contribute to the increased demand and costs.</P>
      <P>To control general hospital costs it is critical that the number of beds in the system is managed and that optimium use is made of the available resources. In this connection the number of general hospital beds has fallen significantly in the past ten years.  In 1986, for example, the number of beds totalled 14,500 approximately, the current figure is now 12,500.  The reduced number of beds are being used on a more intensive basis for example, there are many more day-care beds in the system than ten years ago and this allows for a considerable increase in patient care.</P>
      <P>My Department and the health agencies have been involved for some years in value for money programmes which cover both the hospital and non-hospital areas.  Those programmes have been very useful in ensuring that value for money is obtained in the relevant areas. These programmes will continue and intensify with increasing co-operation between health boards and public voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> In addition, there are a number of areas which are regulated and assist in the control of costs.  For example, the number and type of medical consultant appointments are regulated by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Again, the introduction of technology is monitored closely by my Department to ensure that there is not an excessive supply of high technology introduced in the health services; a proliferation of such technology would clearly lead to a considerable increase in costs.  It is my intention to establish a consultative forum where there can be an exchange of ideas and information between the public and private sectors as regards the application and introduction of high technology.</P>
    <P>A review of certain bed day costs from 1977 to 1995 &mdash; figures for 1966 are not readily available &mdash; indicate an average increase in respect of acute hospitals beds from £40 to £320 per bed day over the period.  It is very difficult to predict future costs within the health services.  However, my Department will continue to pursue the initiatives already mentioned with the various health providers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 97, 98 and 99 together. The provision of dental services to national school children in counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo is the statutory responsibility of the North-Western Health Board.  I have been advised by the board that, of the total approved complement of one principal dental surgeon and 15 dental posts in County Donegal, there are currently one principal dental surgeon and 11 dental surgeons &mdash; whole-time equivalents &mdash; employed by the board in the provision of dental services in the county.  The number of dentists currently employed in Inishowen is the equivalent of 0.6 full-time posts.  Two of the current vacanies are for dentists for the Inishowen area.</P>
      <P>The board is having great difficulty in recruiting professional dental staff for County Donegal, particularly for the Inishowen area.  These posts have been advertised nationally numerous times. The board has advised me that every effort is being made to rectify the situation.  The average number of school-children a dentist has currently in his/her care in County Donegal is 3,500. This compares with an average of 1,838 children per dentist in Sligo/Leitrim.  In 1990 there was one principal dental surgeon and the equivalent of 10.66 whole-time dental surgeon posts employed in County Donegal.  The introduction of the Dental Treatment Services Scheme under which treatment services to adults are provided by private dental practitioners under contract to the health board has enabled the health board dental services to focus more on provision of services to children.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the fact that since 1980 administrators and management staff in the Irish health services have increased by 32 per cent while the number of medical and dental staff fell by 1 per cent; whether he has satisfied himself that there are currently 1.68 administrators per medical staff member as against 1.25 in 1980; and whether this increase in administration costs is a substantial component in the 50 per cent real increase in Irish public health expenditure since 1990.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The management/ administration grade category is a broad designation which encompasses many functions in the health services and includes: community welfare officers, patient services officers, medical records staff, medical, surgical and out-patient appointments staff, health centre receptionists, consultants' secretaries, secretarial and clerical back-up to community care and other services.  The vast majority of the people in this grade category are involved in tasks which directly relate to and impact on patient care.  It is also the case that the vast majority of these staff are at relatively low grades with obvious implications for costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any enhancement of existing health care services and the introduction of service initiatives necessitate the provision of clerical and administrative support as an integral part of the development, as medical and dental staff cannot operate in isolation.  When service developments are being examined in the Department, any additional administrative posts are subjected to particular scrutiny to ensure that only essential needs are being addressed.  Apart from new developments health agencies have discretion in regard to the allocation of posts within a global ceiling approved by the Department.  There are no grounds for believing that the health system is currently over-managed. Changes in the method of collecting data on health service numbers have meant that the figures for 1995 are not directly comparable to 1980 data.  The first date for which directly comparable figures are available is 31 March 1987, <Col N="2187" /> at which time the ratio of management/administration staff to medical staff was 1.60 to 1.  The current ratio &mdash; 1995 &mdash; is 1.72 to 1, which indicates that the rate of increase is not as high as the Deputy's question suggests. In the period 1990 to 1995 the numbers of medical staff increased by 15 per cent, while the numbers of management/administration staff increased by 19 per cent.  This period has seen many developments in regard to revenue generation and enhanced accountability requirements which have a direct bearing on administrative and clerical support.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement.  The energies of the management side dealing with the nurses' claim have so far been concentreated on developing jointly with the nursing unions a set of proposals designed to bring to finality the nurses' claim under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The nursing unions are currently engaged on a consultation process with their members on revised proposals arising from the independent adjudication process provided for in the framework agreed between the Government and ICTU.  They will shortly conduct a ballot on these proposals aimed at bringing this process to finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay proposals developed under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement involve an element of restructuring.  This applies to nurses and <Col N="2188" /> many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí etc. who have or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in some cases even within grades.  This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question will now have to be considered in regard to all affected groups across the public service. Detailed discussions on this issue have yet to take place.  When this general policy issue has been resolved, the Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> A motorised transport grant is payable by health boards for the conversion of an existing motor vehicle or towards the purchase of an adapted new car for use by a disabled person. The objective of the grant is to help a person with a disability seek and-or retain employment.  Eligibilty is subject to a means test and a medical assessment and the maximum grant payable at present is £2,718.  Persons who require a car for purposes other than getting to or from work may qualify for assistance under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 made by the Minister for Finance.  The tax reliefs available include Vehicle Registration Tax &mdash; VRT &mdash; VAT, excise duty on road fuels and road tax.  As the payment of a motorised transport grant in an individual case is a matter for the health board <Col N="2189" /> concerned, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer, Midland Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

Accordingly, the regulations restrict the payment of essential repairs grants to houses where there would be no continuing need for housing provided by the local authority in the vicinity of the house to be improved.  Under the scheme, authorities may pay grants up to the full approved cost of the repairs, subject to a maximum, which is adjusted in line with the House Building Cost Index; the maximum grant currently stands at £5,173.  Authorities may recoup half of their expenditure on such grants from my Department, up to a limit of £900 in any one case.  I have no proposals, at this stage, to amend the terms of the scheme.</P>

There are a number of reasons for this failure rate.  A significant proportion of students take up classical studies for the first time in the senior cycle; a significant number of students take classical studies for one year only when repeating the leaving certificate examination; there has been a large increase in the numbers taking classical studies particularly in 1994 and 1995; and the course is wide ranging and the quality of answering on some topics was very disappointing.

      <P>A scheme was introduced by my Department in 1993 whereby school management representative bodies, including Educate Together, are grant-aided to assist them in meeting the cost of items such as mail issues, publications, and organisation of seminars and meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" /> The amount of the grant is related to the number of schools which are represented by each management body.  In 1993, 1994 and 1995 annual grant assistance of £1,000 was given to Educate Together.  This amount was increased by 100 per cent, in 1996 to bring the annual grant to £2,000.</P>

      <P>The Crumlin multi-denominational school was given recognition from September, 1994.  This is its third school year of operation and the current enrolment is 30 pupils.  The school has been asked to vacate its current temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>As with all new multidenominational or all-Irish schools, initial recognition was granted to the Crumlin school on a provisional basis.  When such schools have been in operation for a number of years and can satisfy my Department with regard to their conduct and future viability, permanent recognition may be granted.  During the period of temporary recognition it is the responsibility of school management to provide temporary premises to house the school.  It is only when permanent recognition has been granted that such schools can claim capital grant aid from my Department.</P>
      <P>Crumlin multidenominational school has temporary recognition at present and accordingly does not qualify for grant-aid for capital work.  The school has applied for permanent recognition and this is being processed by my Department at present.  Officials from my Department have arranged to meet with the management of the school on Wednesday, 16 October 1996 to discuss the issues.</P>

The Central Applications Office is a private company limited by guarantee &mdash; non-profit making &mdash; which processes such applications centrally on behalf of participating institutions.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 123, 124 and 136 together.  I am satisfied that adequate provision is made for the devices to which the Deputies refer.  My Department provides and maintains specialised equipment for all schools for the hearing impaired.  There are five such schools, three in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Limerick.  My Department also provides and maintains radio aids for children with hearing impairment attending primary and post-primary schools.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have arranged for the implementation of a phased upgrading of specialised equipment required in special schools and classes.  The question of provision of such equipment is kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that adequate arrangements currently exist to ensure that my Department is fully aware of the wishes and needs of parents and children in the area of deaf education services.  Where issues arise which might affect the interests of such groups, my Department makes every effort to ensure that the opinions and values of those concerned are sought and considered.  I should also mention that the interests of the hearing impaired were fully represented to the special education review committee whose report has provided a <Col N="2198" /> most valuable blueprint for the future development of special education service, including those relating to the hearing impaired.  I am not in a position to provide precise details of the number of applications and inquiries received by my Department concerning the provision of bilingual signing teaching for deaf children.  The issue in question has certainly been raised with my Department from time to time.  However, as yet there is no consensus on its introduction in the special schools serving hearing impaired children.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the considerable dissatisfaction to which Deputy Mary Wallace refers in relation to the manner in which my Department deals with deaf education as part of the overall special education section.  The reality is that the group in question does form part of the wider special needs area and as such are appropriately dealt with by the special education section.  The question of reestablishing the deaf education policy committee within my Department is under ongoing review in the context of overall developments taking place in relation to education services for the hearing impaired.</P>

      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers and another adjacent school have submitted a joint application to my Department for the provision of a resource teacher post, a special class for mildly mentally handicapped children and a special class for moderately mentally handicapped children.  My capacity to allocate resource teacher posts in any year is determined by the resources available in that year and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  In the current year, a number of resource teacher posts are available for allocation to primary schools.  The process of selecting schools for receipt of these posts is now at an advanced stage.  I expect to be in a position to announce details of the schools selected for these posts shortly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to note that my Department has recently sanctioned the establishment of a special class to cater for pupils with mild mental handicap attending the schools in question.  My Department's primary inspectorate is currently investigating the need for a special class for children with moderate mental handicap at the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>

A member of my Department's psychological service participated in a case conference relating to this child at the end of may 1996.  This case conference, which was organised by the Eastern Health Board social work department, concluded that application should be made to have the child enrolled in a special school which would be equipped to meet the child's special needs.  I am advised that the issue of this enrolment is being actively pursued at present.  Work is taking place on the development of a suitable school programme for the child and I am hopeful that the enrolment can proceed just as soon as the arrangements for the programme are finalised.</P>

    <P>My capacity to allocate remedial teacher posts in any given year is determined by resource availability in that year.

    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.

    <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach.

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.  Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards.  Supplements are calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of a rent which the health board considers appropriate, having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maximum rent levels are determined by the health boards in the light of local knowledge and taking into account such factors as current accommodation costs in the area.  Accommodation costs are based on information on average rents charged in the area received from local auctioneers and letting agents.  The <Col N="2216" /> maximum rent levels on which rent supplements are based are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs.  Since January 1996, health boards are setting maximum rent levels for various classes of people in line with the requirements of Statutory Instrument No. 382 of 1995. For this purpose the health boards must determine the appropriate maximum amount of rent in respect of which a supplement is payable having regard to the family circumstances and the location of the residence.</P>
    <P>The health board considers that the person in question is over-accommodated in that she is a lone parent with one child living in a three bedroomed house, where the rent is £80 per week. The Midland Health Board has advised that the maximum amount of rent supplement payable to a lone parent with one child in the Athlone area is £45 per week, and £50 per week to a lone parent with two children.</P>
    <P>The health board has advised the person in question that if another person shared the accommodation, the board would be willing to pay another rent supplement to that person for their portion of the rent, provided they satisfy the criteria for entitlement to a rent supplement.  The health board has further advised that where a person who is considered to be over-accommodated does not wish to source cheaper accommodation or to share their present accommodation, they are expected to meet the balance of the rent from their own resources.</P>
    <P>According to the board, there is accommodation available in the Athlone area within the limits set by the health board.</P>
    <P>It is open to the person to appeal this decision to the appeals officer of the health board.</P>

      <P>The parliamentary question of 25 June 1996 referred to by the Deputy was answered by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has responsibility for the eligibility conditions for participation in community employment.  The reply to the question indicated that resources constraints ruled out the possibility of extending the eligibility categories to include those on the live register signing for &ldquo;credits&rdquo; only.</P>
      <P>Participation in my Department's work supportive schemes in the case of unemployed people is also subject to certain live register requirements.  These requirements are the same for men and women.  In the case of the back to work allowance, unemployed people must be aged 23 years or over, have been signing the live register for at least 12 months and in receipt of a payment from my Department.  As regards second chance education schemes such as the second level initiative and the third level allowance, the minimum age requirement is 21 years while the unemployed person must have been on the live register for at least six months and getting a payment from my Department.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to vary the requirement that a person must be in receipt of a payment from the department, as the basis of the schemes is the retention of such payment while engaged in work or education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular person <Col N="2218" /> in mind I would suggest they be advised to contact their local social welfare job facilitator or their local FÁS office.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that 76,943 United Kingdom pensioners who currently reside in Ireland may be claiming social welfare benefits and that the number has escalated by almost 100 per cent over the last decade; and his views on the escalating cost in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>Statistics are not available in my Department as to the number or nationality of pensioners who have transferred their residence from the United Kingdom to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to statistical data provided by the United Kingdom Department of Social Security the number of people resident in Ireland in receipt of a DSS retirement pension or widow's benefit <Col N="2221" /> in 1995 was 76,943, (the figure quoted by the Deputy), representing an increase of over 70 per cent since 1985.</P>
    <P>This figure represents not only payments to persons who have only worked in the United Kingdom but also to persons who have worked in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Some recipients in the latter group are Irish citizens and may also be in receipt of an Irish pension either under our national legislation or EU social security legislation. The figures also include persons who have acquired an entitlement to a United Kingdom pension based on their spouse's insurance in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The legislation of the European Union provides for free movement of persons and equality of treatment between our own nationals and nationals of other EU member states who are workers or former workers and who are resident in this State.  Our social welfare legislation is fully in accordance with these principles.  This legislation also provides for payment of contributory pensions to persons who are resident in other member states.  Some 13,490 people resident in the United Kingdom are in receipt of Irish contributory pensions at an estimated cost of £24 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Additional benefits, such as the free schemes, are also available subject, of course, to the normal qualifying criteria. Everyone agrees that the free schemes are very important to the pensioners as they enable them to lead an active retirement and maintain social contact. Over the years the free schemes have been extended to include those in receipt of United Kingdom or Northern Ireland pensions similar to the qualifying Irish payments, those in receipt of pensions from other EU member states or from a country with which we have a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
    <P>Those in receipt of United Kingdom payments and in receipt of free schemes are receiving benefits to which they are legally entitled.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that the Department <Col N="2222" /> of Social Security estimates that the annual cost of UK pensions to persons resident in Ireland in 1995 was £114 million.  The Deputy will appreciate that this inflow is of considerable benefit to the Irish economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I asked the Director of Consumer Affairs some months ago to undertake an investigation into the prices of magazines imported from the <Col N="2224" /> United Kingdom because of the widespread perception that the benefit of the appreciation of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling was not being reflected in lower cover prices.</P>
      <P>In his report submitted last April, the director found that:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the two main importers/distributors determined the retail prices for such magazines on the basis of a variation of a formula first agreed by the National prices Commission (NPC) in 1983.</P>
      <P>&mdash; in contrast to the inclusion of an &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; of 5 per cent agreed by the National Prices Commission, to compensate for the additional costs associated with the distribution of these magazines here, the distributors had in the meantime increased the uplift to 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>&mdash; it was no longer valid for the distributors to rely on a formula which is 13 years old, and which had not been reviewed, to justify current prices</P>
      <P>&mdash; the operation of the complex formula operated by the distributors resulted in the retailers charging the same price, and</P>
      <P>&mdash; newagents are given a guaranteed margin on each magazine and do not complete on price.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the director's report, I met separately the two principal importers/distributors and with the interests representing retail newsagents. On all those occasions I invited the interests concerned to justify the current pricing arrangements, having regard to the findings of the director.  In addition, I subsequently afforded them the opportunity to make written submissions to me in support of their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, I decided to make the Maximum Prices (Magazines) Order, 1996 on 9 July 1996.  Before the Order could take effect the principal importer/distributor, joined by one of the retail newsagents' interests, applied <Col N="2225" /> to the High Court seeking an interlocutory injunction and judicial review.  The principal distributor had claimed in an affidavit that the order would result in their sustaining losses on the sale of UK magazines alone of approximately £1 million per annum with the consequent potential to cause up to 200 job losses on the wholesale distribution side of their business.</P>
    <P>Following the issues of legal proceedings and on the basis of the legal advice available to me, I decided to revoke the order.  I have also decided that the consultancy unit in my Department shall undertake an investigation of the cost structure, both wholesale and retail, and operating margins underlying the prices of home as well as imported magazines.  Such an investigation shall comprehend the distribution arrangements for such magazines and the extent to which they are connected with those for newspapers.</P>
    <P>It is clear I have not set aside the findings in the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs on magazine prices.</P>

      <P>Employees who are laid off on a temporary basis are able to claim the social welfare benefits to which they are entitled.  Under the redundancy payments scheme, operated by my Department, employees may be entitled to a redundancy payment from their employer if they have been laid off for a certain period (usually for four consecutive weeks).  Such action does have the effect of terminating the employment contract.  The employer has a right to give counter notice if there is a <Col N="2226" /> reasonable expectation that employees will, within four weeks of lodging their redundancy claims, enter on a period of at least 13 weeks' unbroken employment.</P>

      <P>To make the best <Col N="2229" /> possible use of the limited funding available, the rate of aid payable under the dairy hygiene scheme was geared in favour of smaller scale producers i.e. a 60 per cent grant for those with milk quotas of below 15,000 gallons.  This Scheme is now suspended because its total allocation from Structural Funds has been exhausted but in the event of its re-introduction I would not envisage any change in the principle of favouring smaller scale milk producers.</P>

      <P>Provision for the payment of pensions <Col N="2240" /> by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for such dependants was introduced.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.</P>
      <P>A second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted in 1985 when all soldiers, as well as pensioners, who had opted out of the contributory scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decision and to join the scheme.</P>
      <P>The number of widows, whose husbands chose not to become members, and who are outside the ambit of the scheme, is currently estimated at about 200.</P>
      <P>Widows of soldiers would generally be eligible for survivors' contributory pensions under the social welfare Acts.</P>
