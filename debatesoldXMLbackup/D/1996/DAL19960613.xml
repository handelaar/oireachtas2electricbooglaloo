      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8, the motion on chemical weapons; No. 9, the motion on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; No. 3, amendments made by the Seanad to the Dumping at Sea Bill, 1995; and No. 17, resumed statements on the Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the proceedings on Nos. 8 and 9 shall be brought to a conclusion within one hour in each case and the following arrangements shall apply &mdash; (i) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State, of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party and of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 10 minutes in each case, (ii) Members may share time and (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes in each case; (2) the proceedings on No. 3. if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 2 p.m. today and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments thereto, include only those <Col N="2050" /> set down or accepted by the Minister for the Marine; and (3) No. 17, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court has now made its decision and I realise it must report back to the High Court, which in turn must inform the Government and then the Bill must be signed. Has the Taoiseach a possible timetable for this?  Will he ensure the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will keep in touch with our spokesperson and the Whips so that we can arrange a timetable which will avoid uncertainty on this matter now that the long delay is over?</P>

      <P>The legislation is ready and, as soon as legally proper, it will be published.  The legal procedures which must be gone through are a matter for the courts and other organs of State rather than the Government but as soon as we are in a position to move on this matter with legal prudence, the legislation, which is ready and which the Government has approved, will be published.</P>

      <P>The passage of the legislation through the House depends on the willingness of Members to enter agreements through their parties as to the ordering of business.  As far as the Government is concerned, I have already indicated that as soon as it is legally prudent for us to publish the Bill we will do so and it will be ready to be taken in the House on that day or any immediately subsequent day, if time can be agreed for it.  There will not be any avoidable delay by the Government but obviously the Legislature also has a role to play in this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are two legislative proposals on telecommunications in preparation. The drafting of the first one, the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, dealing with independent regulations, is almost complete.  We except to see that Bill introduced next month or so.  There is also a Telecommunications (Worker Participation) Bill which was being prepared, the content of which may well be incorporated in the Bill to which I have just referred, so that the two may be available next month.  Then there is a further Bill concerning the strategic alliance and the making of arrangements derived therefrom which will have to await the conclusion of the alliance.  It is unlikely that Bill will be available until the second half of 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, signed by Ireland in Paris on the 14th day of January, 1993, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 5th day of June, 1996.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to move this motion approving the terms of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, commonly known as the Chemical Weapons Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chemical weapons are, by their nature, among the most odious of the weapons of mass destruction.  They can have <Col N="2057" /> no place in a civilised society.  Modern efforts to ban chemical warfare go back over 120 years, to the Brussels Declaration of 1874 which prohibited the use of poisons and poisoned bullets in warfare.</P>
    <P>The great merit of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Conventions is that it provides for the elimination of this entire category of weapons.  It is an unprecedented international disarmament agreement, unique in its scope in negotiating history and in the comprehensive verification system which is an integral part of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The convention was the result of 24 years of negotiations on the framework of the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament.  The ending of the Cold War gave fresh impetus to protracted discussions, so that the negotiations were concluded by September 1992. The Convention was approved by consensus at the General Assembly of the United Nations on 30 November 1992 and opened for signature in Paris on 13 January 1993.  To date is has been signed by 160 countries, including Ireland, which was among the original signatories.</P>
    <P>The 1925 Geneva Protocol had already banned chemical and bacteriological warfare.  The Chemical Weapons Convention, for its part, is designed to exclude the possibility of the use or threat of use of chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>Thus, it prohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention and direct or indirect transfer of chemical weapons under any circumstances. Each State party to the convention must undertake never, under any circumstances, to use chemical weapons, to engage in military preparations to use chemical weapons, or to assist, encourage or induce any one to engage in prohibited activities.</P>
    <P>A core element is that all chemical weapons and related production facilities have to be declared and thereafter eliminated under international supervision, within ten years of the entry into force of the convention.  This provision is of real and pressing interest to the <Col N="2058" /> international community.  The two principal possessors of chemical weapons, the US and the Russian Federation, are thought to have, between them, some 70,000 tonnes of chemical weapons.  Up to two score countries in total are believed to possess some chemical weapons.  While their production is cheap, the destruction of chemical weapons is both very expensive and environmentally challenging.</P>
    <P>The convention also prohibits the use of riot control agents as a method of warfare and reaffirms the prohibition under international law of the use of herbicides as a method of warfare. Importantly, it establishes the right of States parties to request and receive assistance and protection against the use or threat of use of chemical weapons. This provision is of particular interest to developing countries, as not all countries have highly developed capabilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Chemical Weapons Convention breaks new ground in multilaterally negotiated disarmament agreements by requiring State parties to demonstrate conclusively their compliance with its provisions.  The convention includes a far-reaching verification regime which is designed to enhance the security of States parties by limiting any possibility of clandestine development, production, storage or use of chemical weapons. Ireland looks forward to exercising our right to demonstrate full compliance with our obligations under the convention. States parties in good standing will have nothing to fear from the verification system.</P>
    <P>Not later than 30 days after the convention enters into force, each State party must submit detailed declarations with respect to its possession or control of chemical weapons, of old and abandoned chemical weapons and of chemical weapons production facilities together with a general plan for their destruction, the provisions governing which are spelled out comprehensively. Declared chemical weapons production, storage and destruction facilities will be subject to systematic on-site inspections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The convention lays down how these inspections will be carried out.</P>
    <P>Given that chemical weapons are relatively easy to produce, the convention also requires declarations of chemical facilities that are engaged in permitted activities related to certain scheduled chemicals.  Its monitoring system thus involves declarations and routine inspections of relevant civilian chemical industry facilities.  It is the proposed declarations and routine inspections of these civilian facilities that are most relevant for Ireland and particularly for our chemical industry.  I will revert to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>In addition to arrangements for routine inspections, the convention is reinforced by an unprecedented challenge inspection regime.  Subject to certain precautions designed to guard against frivolous use of this mechanism, the challenge inspection provision allows any State party to trigger an international inspection at any facility or location in any other State party at short notice, in order to clarify and resolve questions of possible non-compliance. The State party which is the object of a challenge inspection has no right of refusal, an extremely important element of this convention.</P>
    <P>To oversee its operation, the convention provides for the establishment of a body called the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - OPCW &mdash; which will be based in The Hague.  The OPCW will establish an inspectorate which will have the right to conduct a range of on-site verification and inspection activities to ascertain the validity of each State party's declarations. This will result in the carrying out, at short notice, of routine inspections of certain facilities from time to time.  As with bodies established under other international conventions, the budget of the OPCW will be provided by contributions by States parties based on the United Nations' scale of assessment.</P>
    <P>Each State party is required to designate an authority to ensure effective <Col N="2060" /> implementation of the convention's provisions by, <i>inter alia,</i> liaison with the OPCW, as well as liaison with other States parties.  In Ireland's case the Government has designated the Department of Enterprise and Employment as the national authority.  The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health will carry out Ireland's obligations in relation to the convention.</P>
    <P>The convention is expected to have an important role in controlling international trade in substances susceptible of being used by would-be proliferators to develop chemical weapons programmes. This in itself can act as a deterrent to proliferation.  Trade in scheduled chemicals with non-State parties will be subjected to certain limitations and restrictions.  This means, <i>inter alia,</i> that failure by any EU member state to ratify the convention would have implications for the Single Market, given that once the convention entered into force, trade in chemicals between State parties and non-State parties will be subject to restrictions.  All partners, not least Ireland as future Presidency, are determined that this situation will not arise.</P>
    <P>As I have illustrated, the Chemical Weapons Convention places quite onerous obligations on State parties.  In particular, the obligation to demonstrate full compliance is more highly developed in this convention than in any previous, multilaterally negotiated disarmament agreement.  For these reasons, although it has not yet entered into force, the Chemical Weapons Convention already serves as a kind of benchmark against which other disarmament and non-proliferation agreements in the making are measured.  Its verification provisions are seen as providing a strong precedent to be emulated in new treaties under negotiation or in existing treaties which are being strengthened.</P>
    <P>The negotiations to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty, for example, have been influenced by the experience of the Chemical Weapons Convention. <Col N="2061" /> Let me state at this point my strong hope that these negotiations will be completed on schedule, so that a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which includes stringent provisions for monitoring compliance, will be be opened for signature at the United Nations in September this year.  Following from the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995, a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, with the coming into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention early in 1997, would amount to heartening progress towards ending the proliferation and advancing the complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction.  That has long been a policy of successive Governments and all parties in this House.</P>
    <P>The process of strengthening the implementation of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is also influenced by the Chemical Weapons Convention.  In this House on 30 May, The Tánaiste made clear that the period of the Irish Presidency of the EU would be crucial to the final outcome.  The Tánaiste said we will do all we can during our term of office to give impetus to the negotiations aimed at reinforcing the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention with a legally binding and effective verification regime which we now have in regard to chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>The Chemical Weapons Convention is now expected to enter into force around January 1997.  Sixty-five ratifications are needed to trigger a 180 day lead-in period to entry into force.  To date, 52 countries have ratified the convention. These include 11 of our European Union partners.  Like Ireland, the remaining European Union countries, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal are well advanced in the ratification process. Besides being necessary for reasons related to the Single Market, ratification by all 15 European Union members as part of the first 65 would send a strong political message to the rest of the world about the great importance which the Union attaches to the convention and to its role in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. <Col N="2062" /> Four more ratifications from the side of the Union would bring the, total significantly closer to the threshold figure of 65 and would establish the conditions for the Union to take diplomatic action to promote the earliest possible entry into force of the convention and thereafter the widest possible adherence to it.  Ireland, which as Presidency will be leading EU efforts to promote these aims, should itself have ratified before 1 July.  If, as we all hope, the United States is in a position to ratify in the coming weeks, the remaining ratifications necessary to trigger entry into force could come quickly.  It is also very important for the credibility of the convention that Russia should ratify at an early date, because between them Russia and the United States have more than 70,000 tonnes of chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>I met the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the OPCW, Mr. Ian Kenyon, when he visited Dublin on 30 May for discussions concerned with ratification of the convention.</P>
    <P>To carry out Ireland's obligations under the convention, implementing legislation is required.  To this end, the Government has approved draft heads of a Bill prepared by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in consultation with representatives of the industry concerned.  The draft Bill is being considered by the parliamentary draughtsman and we hope to publish it very shortly with a view to ensuring that the legislation and any other measures needed to enable Ireland to discharge fully its obligations under the convention will have been adopted in advance of the entry into force of the convention.</P>
    <P>In its role as protector of the safety of workers who handle toxic chemicals, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is well placed to identify those companies in Ireland whose handling of scheduled chemicals make them subject to annual declarations under the convention.  While it is not yet clear how many Irish facilities might be <Col N="2063" /> affected and while the number could be relatively large, the provisions of data for inclusion in national declarations is not in itself an onerous task.  Much of the information required may already be available to the national Authority in other contexts.</P>
    <P>Routine and challenge inspections during the first year of operation of the convention are likely to focus on chemical weapons facilities rather than civilian facilities.  However, in subsequent years, some routine inspections of Irish chemical facilities can be expected for the specific and limited purpose of verifying, the data on the more toxic chemicals that will have been provided in our annual declarations under the convention. The number of facilities in Ireland likely to be affected by inspections is thought to be very small and in any event significantly smaller than the number subject to declarations. Although we do not anticipate a challenge inspection of a facility in Ireland on foot of an allegation of non-compliance from another State Party, the legislation powers must be put in place to enable Ireland to meet that contingency.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the OPCW is to help developing countries to cope with the obligations imposed by the Chemical Weapons Convention.  During my meeting with him last month, I told Mr. Kenyon that we would consider supporting the efforts of the organisation in this area through the Irish aid programme if a suitable project could be identified.  This would be in the area of training.  Officials from developing countries would be trained by the organisation on the potential use of chemicals for chemical weapons purposes.</P>
    <P>The effort incurred in implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention in this country will be very modest in relation to the political and practical costs of failure to ratify.  In supporting this motion, the House can demonstrate Ireland's serious commitment to playing <Col N="2064" /> our part in banishing these noxious weapons from the face of the earth.  I am confident that the House will share my view that the Chemical Weapons Convention is a precious contribution to a most valuable objective and that Ireland should ratify it at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chemical Weapons Convention was open for signature on 13 January 1993 in Paris by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The signing of the convention on the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction marked the culmination of protracted and intensive negotiations on the part of the international community to ban chemical weapons.  After more than 20 years the convention was signed by 127 countries, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>The convention had a long history.  It has been debated and negotiated at a conference on disarmament by a negotiating body of the international community for a decade and was finally adopted by that conference in September 1992.</P>
      <P>It transpires that the Chemical Weapons Convention is the first disarmament agreement negotiated within a multilateral framework that provides for the elimination of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction.  A Brussels declaration of 1874 was the first modern attempt to ban chemical weapons. It prohibited the use of poisons and poisoned bullets in warfare, yet despite that chemical weapons were extensively deployed during the First World War.  Public horror and condemnation led to the signing of the General Protocol of 1925.  The Protocol made the use of chemical or biological weapons illegal but did not forbid their development, production, stockpiling or deployment.  This factor led to the beginning of discussions on the Chemical Weapons Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know only too well, modern warfare is a treacherous business.  We <Col N="2065" /> might be forgiven for believing that anything goes in the midst of war, a notion that is forcibly brought home in the injuries, maiming and deaths that ensue. Close to the start of this century some weapons, from dumdum bullets to biological agents have been deemed horrific enough for the world to seek their banning from battlefields.  The use of mustard gas, for example, has been shunned by most of the world states. However, until the convention garners sufficient ratifying states, mere possession of chemical weapons means that no rules are being broken.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the convention will have enough ratifiers, perhaps by year end, but is every state in favour of such a prohibition? Certainly there are critics.  Both the United States and Russia have voiced their concerns and each has yet to ratify the convention.  Among other arguments put forward, these two nations have suggested that the convention's task is simply too onerous.  They have argued that since just about any chemical could, if misused, contribute to a weapons programme, and since the world's chemical industry is conducted on a massive scale, seeking out proscribed activities is like looking for a needle in a haystack.</P>
    <P>Apart from individual countries, chemical companies have not been slow in profering their reasons as to why the convention might just prove to be too stifling.  Some of these companies have suggested that the rules are two tough, that in providing information to demonstrate that they are not engaged in any illegal activity, they may risk seeing their lucrative trade secrets plundered and pillaged.</P>
    <P>In discussions and negotiations on any programme, proposal or convention, there are always arguments on both sides.  On balance the UN Convention is a prudent path to progress.  We can all appreciate that it would be next to impossible to make any arms control regime watertight and perfect.  Seeking a balance means setting the benefits against the dangers, the pros against the cons.  On balance, the conclusion must <Col N="2066" /> be that the potential benefits of the Chemical Weapons Convention outweigh any existing or conceivable dangers that lie ahead.  Another difficult balance must be achieved between the protection of a company's legitimate commercial secrets and the detection of illegitimate activities.</P>
    <P>One aspect which is critical to the effectiveness of the convention is the provision for swoops on suspected targets at short notice, these swoops to be carried out by international inspectors when one company suspects another of engaging in illegal behaviour.  As technology drives forward, attempts by individual nations or individual companies to breach convention rules will prove more and more difficult.  Skilled inspectors, matched by state-of-the-art equipment and methodologies, should prove an effective beachhead against prospective rule breakers.</P>
    <P>One of the real benefits of the conventions is that old and often disintegrating and dangerous stocks will have to be destroyed.  Russia, having one of the biggest arsenals in the world, has been one of the strongest critics of the convention.  One can appreciate where they are coming from because the destruction of stockpiled mountains of weapons does not happen without adequate resources.  Safe and effective destruction demands sufficient resources, and a cash-strapped Russia does not have such flows of money to make even a dent in their existing stocks.  As a chemical weapons convention without Russia as a ratifier would not be worth the paper it was written on, it is undoubtedly the case that the richer nations of the world must remit funds to Russia to enable her to safely eliminate her weapons.  The benefits would accrue to everyone.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that even those countries who do not sign up to the convention will not be far removed from the tentacles of its powers. Although national laws will have to be enacted to make the convention rules adhere, non-siders will find that their ability to purchase certain chemicals <Col N="2067" /> and industrial equipment from convention members will be severely curtailed.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the opportunity pass without expressing my concern at the nuclear test explosion by China last weekend.  Last Saturday China, oblivious to world outrage, carried out a nuclear explosion at its Lop Nor Desert test site, and announced a moratorium from September after a final blast.  With the comprehensive test ban treaty talks due to conclude by 28 June next, it is regrettable that China has displayed such insensitivity to world opinion.</P>
    <P>At this stage we might well ask if a chemical weapons convention has any implications for Ireland.  Although we are probably relatively safe in assuming that the threat to Ireland from military chemical weapons is low, we cannot, nonetheless, turn a blind eye to the potential that exists for a threat to emanate from, for example, a terrorist organisation or for chemical munitions to be washed ashore on to our coast. This threat from old stocks of weapons is very real for Ireland.  Facts cannot be ignored.  It has emerged in recent months that over a million tonnes of British munitions were dumped off the Irish coast since World War II, in the Beaufort Dyke, for example.  The British Ministry for Defence has admitted, for the first time, that it dumped hundreds of tonnes of chemical weapons and poison gases off the Irish coast. What risk do these munitions pose? Apart from storms and violent seas which can easily disturb the sea bed, the increasing use of piping for industrial purposes between Ireland and the UK will undoubtedly disturb it.  Assurances from the British authorities that the dumping of redundant munitions has been done in a strictly controlled manner to ensure that no damage to the marine environment will occur are of little comfort to those communities who bear witness to canisters and other artefacts appearing close to their local environment. Certainly it is hoped that ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention will ensure that the disposal <Col N="2068" /> of weapons which re-emerge decades later on the lands of another state will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>The production of chemical weapons occurred over decades.  Mammoth stockpiles of killing machines exist as a result.  Their destruction is an urgent requirement.  The destruction of decades worth of munitions will not happen with a ratified convention, but a ratified convention signals a will and a method to achieve the aim of ridding this earth of destructive weapons of war.</P>
    <P>Chemical weapons represent an ongoing death threat and a persistent environmental hazard.  The civilian and military production, development, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons must be halted.  They must be banned by this convention.  As part of our support for this convention we will continue to persist with our consistent calls for the closure of the Sellafield plant.  At EU level we will continue to call for the establishment of an independent nuclear inspectorate.  We will also continue to vigorously push the watertight case for a world-wide ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of land mines.  Ireland should ratify the instrument which is up for consideration by the Oireachtas today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister of State that this will not become derailed as a result of lethargy in the midwest.  I assume that as a result of this motion being passed today Ireland can ratify the convention &mdash; the Minister of State spoke of the necessity for legislation but I take it that is only for the <Col N="2069" /> technical implementation of it and not for its ratification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State agrees with that because it is important that we should ratify it at the earliest moment, whatever legislation may be necessary later.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this morning.</P>
      <P>She said:</P>
      <P>The challenge inspection provision under this convention allows any state party to trigger an international inspection at any facility or location in any other state party at short notice in order to clarify and resolve questions of possible non-compliance.  The state party which is the object of a challenge inspection has no right of refusal.</P>
      <P>That is a most far-reaching provision.  It is perhaps one of the strongest provisions there is in international law or in any international convention or treaty. It is to the credit of all who signed the convention and will ratify it that its provisions will be enforceable.  I would like to think that something similar could be enforced for nuclear weapons and facilities. In particular, I have in mind the Sellafield operation and THORP, the plutonium reprocessing plant, where plutonium is brought in and where what in effect are nuclear weapons are manufactured. A great deal of unpredictable and uncontrollable waste is created.</P>
      <P>We have been told that we are powerless to have an inspection carried out at our behest.  It is interesting that such an installation cannot be inspected even though its effects are potentially far more dangerous than the effects of chemical weapons, which may be more localised.  The significance of this convention should be seen in a broader context, particularly in the nuclear context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nations that possess the greatest amount of chemical weapons are the United States of America and the Russian Federation.  The United States is, I <Col N="2070" /> believe, on course to ratify the convention and destroy all its chemical weapons. It has the facilities and resources to do it.  In the case of the Russian Federation, I hope it is on course to destroy all its weapons but whether it has the resources to do so remains to be seen. As has been suggested, it is incumbent on the west generally to try to help it, financially and otherwise, to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>One might think that these are the only two nations with a significant cache of chemical weapons, but they are not. A country that needs to be discussed in this debate is Iraq.  The use of chemical weapons, not once or twice or occasionally but as a systematic part of the state policy is endorsed by that benighted regime, which unfortunately still exists. I might add that regime had supporters in the not too distant past in this country and even in this House.  The resources of the free world should be used to the greatest extent possible, in particular the powers under this convention, to try to force Iraq to desist from the manufacture, storage and above all the use of chemical weapons against its own population. It has used them against the Kurds and also, it seems, against the Marsh Arabs.  It appears that chemical weapons were used in the Iraq-Iran war. It is well documented that they were extensively used against the Kurds and the civilian population in many villages and towns in Kurdistan.  On one day alone up to 10,000 women and children died as a result of chemical attack by Saddam Hussein's regime in Baghdad.  I presume Iraq has not signed this convention and that it will not ratify it. Whether it is enforceable against a non member is not terribly clear, but presumably it will not be directly enforceable against them.  If the great majority of states subscribe to and ratify this convention they will have a great moral authority in trying to ensure that no country will be allowed to continue to use these dreadful weapons.</P>
    <P>Possibly the biggest difficulty we will have in respect of chemical weapons and allied matters will arise as a result <Col N="2071" /> of weapons dumped at sea by the British after the Second World War, not because of anything we manufactured ourselves.  When the British dumped the weapons Ireland had no jurisdiction or control over the area, but under the next motion to come before the House this morning Ireland will assume a certain limited jurisdiction, however tenuous. It is interesting to consider our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> those weapons.  We did not put them there but we know who did.  Is there an obligation to remove them?  This is what should be done, but it is a very costly and difficult thing to do.  It is unsatisfactory that they could be left there indefinitely.  I wonder if this convention deals in any way with this situation.</P>
    <P>The headquarters of the organisation being set up to enforce the prohibition of chemical weapon will be based in The Hague.  There are three or four what might be termed respectable international cities, The Hague, Geneva, Paris and a few more.  It is a great pity that Dublin cannot get itself on that list.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see this convention will be ratified shortly by sufficient countries to come into effect early next year.  This is to be welcomed.  In many respects it is one of the most important conventions of its type that has ever been introduced internationally.  It is a headline <Col N="2072" /> for what might be done in other areas, particularly on the nuclear weapons side.  I hope it will be copied and taken as the norm in future in terms of international enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Ireland's ratification of the chemical weapons convention, which I welcome.  The Minister rightly drew our attention to the odious nature of chemical weapons and their use in wars and conflicts.  I understand their use was more widespread during the first World War.  There were about 1.3 million casualties of chemical weapon attacks, 95,000 fatal.  I well remember 20 years ago talking to an old man who as a 19 year-old soldier was gassed in Ypres and blinded.  He carried this burden until his 85th year when he died.  That brings home the awful effects of the use of chemical weapons in warfare. The Minister of State and other speakers reminded us that the Brussels Declaration was signed in 1874.  I understand there is an earlier convention signed by France and Germany in Strasbourg in 1675 which prohibited the use of poisoned weapons in warfare.</P>
      <P>We do not have a problem with ratifying the convention.  We have an extensive chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Many of the products it manufactures could be used in the production of chemical weapons.  Naturally, it has legitimate concerns given that all plants will be open to inspection.  This is right and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to be concerned, however, about those countries which have major chemical industries and would not have the same level of respect for the inspectorate. Our attention has been drawn to the fact that the Russian Federation and the United States probably hold more than two thirds of all the stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world.  After the Gulf War Iraq was forced to admit it had an extensive chemical weapons industry.  Deputy O'Malley raised the question of whether it will sign and obey the convention.  I understand it has been <Col N="2073" /> forced to destroy its stockpiles of chemical and nuclear weapons under the supervision of the United Nations. According to news reports this morning, it denied UN inspectors access to certain sites in Baghdad to assess its nuclear capability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised the question of budgeting.  I have a particular concern about the Russian Federation.  While it has signed the convention it appears it is a long way from ratification, although the convention has been introduced in the Duma.  President Yeltsin has not shown any great enthusiasm for it, perhaps because of the cost involved.  The Russian Federation will have to meet at least 25 per cent of the cost of destroying its stockpiles of chemical weapons which are probably larger than those of the United States.  Because it is strapped for cash this presents a major problem.  The delaying tactics and lack of enthusiasm, although this may change after the Presidential election, give cause for concern.  If President Yeltsin is not re-elected, we do not know what attitude his successor will adopt.</P>
    <P>In the United States the Bush Administration signed the convention before leaving office in November 1994 when the Republicans assumed control of both Houses, but it has languished ever since in the United States Congress.  It has had no champion since the election of Bill Clinton as President.  Neither Senator Helms, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee nor Senator Strom Thurmond, the Republican chairman of the Arms Control Committee, both of whom come from North Carolina, has shown any great interest in disarmament.</P>
    <P>Senator Helms blocked consideration of the convention over a year ago because of a row with the Administration about the foreign affairs budget cuts he was demanding and it was resisting.  There was a breakthrough last December when the matter was resolved and discussion recommenced on the floor of Congress.  The hope was that it would be passed to the committee <Col N="2074" /> chaired by Senator Robert Dole who departed the scene yesterday and probably would have been more amenable to its speedy ratification.  I hope his successor as Senate majority leader, who has already been appointed, will show the same level of enthusiasm in dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Russian Federation and the United States ratify the convention as soon as possible.  When ratified by 65 states it will be triggered 180 days later.  I hope the instruments of ratification will be lodged by the requisite number by the end of the summer. It is crucial, however, that it is ratified by the major players.  We should do everything we possibly can in our foreign relations policy to ensure that those two countries ratify it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The selection of sites for the destruction of chemical weapons will give rise to major controversy on a worldwide scale.  While it is relatively cheap to produce chemical weapons it is very expensive to destroy them.  A very complex procedure is used.  To my knowledge there is only one location where chemical weapons are disposed of, Johnson Atoll in the Pacific.  If a major site is chosen, like Muroroa Atoll where the French carry out underground nuclear tests, this will give rise to controversy because of the environmental impact of the destruction of highly toxic and poisonous substances.  It is claimed that eight to nine major sites will be required in both the United States and the Russian Federation which will have ten years to destroy all weapons.  As it will be difficult to reach agreement on which sites should be selected, there will be a tendency to seek sites offshore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this convention, one of the most important ever to be discussed in the House.  Like Deputy Connor, I have read and heard the stories about the use of chemical gases during World War 1.  Vast numbers of people were killed as a result.  In more recent times we have heard about Operation Orange during the Gulf War.  I welcome Ireland's ratification of this convention.  Perhaps the Minister of State will inform the House why it has taken so long to ratify the convention. which Ireland signed in January 1993.  I was informed there was some difficulty in identifying a body to examine legislation and deal with ratification.  Is this the reason countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal have not ratified the convention? We would like to see our European Union partners ratify this convention and, during our Presidency of the EU, we could perhaps encourage all member states to do so.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned by the Minister of State's comments about the large number of chemical weapons held by the United States and the Russian Federation. I hope both countries will ratify the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Burke stated, concerns have also been expressed about nuclear <Col N="2076" /> testing.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has condemned French action in this regard.  China recently ignored the views of the international community and was very insensitive in its announcement about continuing nuclear testing.  I hope our comments will encourage these countries to implement a ban on such testing.</P>
    <P>The Chemical Weapons Convention involves halting the assembly of chemical weapons.  This should be highlighted because the convention goes a step further than past treaties and bans the construction of such weapons.  As Deputy Connor stated, the destruction of chemical weapons is a major issue. Chemical weapons can be produced quite cheaply but it is very expensive to destroy them.  The subject of damage to the environment arises when we consider locations for the destruction of such weapons.  Perhaps the Minister of State can provide some information in this regard.</P>
    <P>The question of inspectors and the powers they will have is also important. According to news reports this morning, Iraq has denied the UN access to and information about its weapons.  We must double our efforts on these issues.  I fully support the Chemical Weapons Convention and I hope Ireland and its EU partners will ratify it in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for his understanding about time constraints. I hope to return the compliment in the future.  The Chemical Weapons Convention is extremely important from a number of points of view.  As the Minister of State indicated, it is a benchmark convention.  Many of its features relating to inspection could be usefully applied to future conventions dealing with other aspects of the arms trade. From that point of view, it merits special attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone is concerned about the situation in Iraq, to which Deputy Connor and others referred.  That illustrates the need for some of the particular features <Col N="2077" /> of this convention.  Iraq is not a signatory of the Chemical Weapons Convention and is not particularly trusted by anyone.  Following the Gulf War, a procedure was put in place to dismantle the nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities of Iraq.  We cannot be sure this will work because the procedure will not remain in place forever.  Once it is finished, we must ensure that no other sources exist from which another unscrupulous regime in Iraq could benefit. It is for this reason that controls on the arms industry are important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to hesitation in the chemical industry about the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention. I have no patience with such hesitation. The chemical industry operates successfully in international markets and I have no objection to this.  People benefit in many ways from the expertise and creativity of that industry.  Like its counterparts, however, the chemical industry must accept that it does not merely operate in a market that protects intellectual property rights.  This is one of the industry's main concerns.  It also operates in a market with an ethical framework that is fixed by society at large. Through the Chemical Weapons Convention, the international community is stating that the ethical framework conclusively rejects the use, manufacture and storage of chemical weapons.  The chemical industry must accept this.</P>
    <P>In this area, as in many others, our scientific ability and creative imagination tends to run ahead of our moral capacity to deal with the effects of our achievements.  I intend no criticism by stating that this convention, and others like it, are simply a delayed response to society's conscience about the fact that our technical ability exceeds our moral determination to use these weapons properly.  Throughout the world there are examples of a disposition in the arms trade to try to circumvent control mechanisms.  We have seen this in Iraq and elsewhere in relation to heavy and light weaponry and small arms.  Such examples illustrate that there is no point <Col N="2078" /> in having morally satisfactory agreements between countries to ban the use of weapons, unless we control production of and trade in the items concerned. That is the basis of this convention.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we should highlight the intrinsic value of the Chemical Weapons Convention and its headlining of the kind of action which should be taken in other areas of the arms trade. I could say a great deal more about conventions of this kind.  I will simply state that Ireland signed this convention in January 1993 and is only now ratifying it.  I am aware it was necessary and essential that the Department of Enterprise and Employment consider the kind of legislation required to give effect to the provisions of this convention. When future conventions of this kind are introduced, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the other Departments involved should give priority to the Preparation of the necessary support legislation for our jurisdiction.  The Minister of State would want Ireland to be in the forefront of measures to combat the international trade of weapons of death and destruction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and their support for this motion.  Some speakers referred to the First World War but my abiding memory of chemical weapons relates to the use of herbicides in the Vietnam war. Those who are familiar with the films of Oliver Stone &mdash; I note there are many students in the Public Gallery &mdash; will know the large areas of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have been destroyed and the land cannot be used for agricultural purposes because of the use of herbicides and chemicals such as Agent Orange during that long conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for all parties in this House to agree that we should play our part in seeking to end the use of such weapons.  We have a sufficient number of effective killing machines for use in warfare without using agents such as chemicals and herbicides, as well as land <Col N="2079" /> mines, whose effects linger long after the conflict has ended.</P>
    <P>Those weapons, including nuclear weapons, have another characteristic in that their removal costs are sometimes ten times greater than the original cost of making the weapons.  It costs as little as £3 to £20 to make a land mine but it would cost approximately £200 to £300 to remove it.</P>
    <P>The Iran-Iraq conflict had a tremendous effect on the urgency and stringency with which this convention was established.  I hope the stringency of some of its measures will be adhered to in the future by other non-proliferation conventions and conventions to ban weapons.</P>
    <P>Chemical weapons were used in the Iran-Iraq conflict and because the major powers were involved in that conflict in a particular way, there was a certain sensitivity about the use of those weapons, and the consequences of that use, which did not previously exist.</P>
    <P>Iraq is currently subject to a United Nations inspection but, unfortunately, it is not being satisfactorily adhered to by that country.  That remains a problem and one of the issues that must be addressed by the international community is to rid countries like Iraq of chemicals weapons and weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>A point was made about the non-proliferation treaty.  The difference between this convention and that instrument is that this convention seeks to ban totally all chemical weapons and herbicides. The non-proliferation treaty accepts that there are five states in the world which have nuclear weapons.  The comprehensive test ban treaty calls on those states to desist from further tests but, unfortunately, it cannot ban nuclear weapons which would be the Government's position; it is a much more limited form of treaty than this convention.</P>
    <P>In relation go the urgency with which this convention has come into force, the difficulty for Ireland has been to identify the appropriate authority.  Some countries have created independent <Col N="2080" /> authorities but following examination and consultation, particularly with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, it was decided that the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health was the appropriate body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor and others, referred to the cost for the Russian Federation of dismantling its huge number of chemical weapons which are stored throughout Russia, from the furthest corner of Siberia to the most western areas of the country.  Following ratification of the treaty by all 15 European Union member states, it will then be possible for the EU collectively, as an element of common foreign and security policy, to lobby other states such as the Russian Federation, which is in receipt of substantial aid and assistance from the EU, to sign up to the convention.  It will be possible also for the European Union to assist the Russian Federation financially with the cost of decommissioning these weapons, which is significant.  Consequently, ratification by all 15 member states is vitally important.</P>
    <P>On the points made by the United States, I understand there are highranking supporters of the convention in the United States Senate and that the appropriate motion is again before that body; the Helms amendments were defeated late in April last.</P>
    <P>I urge the United States to ratify the convention as early as possible. Public opinion in the United States is now sufficiently advanced, following the experience of the Iran-Iraq war, for there to be large scale public support for ratification. If it is ratified, and if we can assist the Russian Federation, we will move towards the implementation of this historic convention.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the <Col N="2081" /> terms of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, concluded at Montego Bay, Jamaica on 10 December 1982, and the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at New York on 28 July 1994, copies of which have been laid before the Dáil on 10 June 1996.</P>
    <P>This is probably one of the most important motions to come before this House and which will have significance for Ireland long after many of us have departed this House.</P>
    <P>It is my privilege to bring before the House this motion to approve the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, with Annexes, which was done at Montego Bay, Jamaica on 10 December 1982 and the agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, with Annex, which was adopted by the General Assembly at New York on 28 July 1994.</P>
    <P>Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution states that the State shall not be bound by an international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.  The convention establishes an International Seabed Authority through which the states parties to the convention shall organise and control the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The convention also establishes an International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea which will have jurisdiction in relation to disputes between states in regard to the provisions of the convention. On becoming a party to the convention and implementing agreement Ireland will be obliged to make an annual contribution to these two bodies and consequently this motion is before the House today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> The United Nations Law of the Sea Convention 1982 is the fruit of the labour of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea which ran from 1973 to 1982.  However, the seeds of much of what was produced by the third conference were sown by two earlier conferences, the first held in 1958, the second in 1960.  The convention was opened for signature at Montego Bay, Jamaica on 10 December 1982.  Ireland was one of the original signatories of the convention and signed it subject to ratification.</P>
    <P>As the law of the sea is one of the oldest branches of international law, the convention is essentially of a hybrid nature.  It is in part a statement of customary international law, in part a statement of new law &mdash; progressive development &mdash; and in part the constituent instrument of new international bodies; the International Seabed Authority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  The convention addresses issues such as the territorial sea, environmental protection, fisheries and the legal regime for the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources of the deep ocean floor beyond areas of national jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption of the convention in 1982, concern was expressed in relation to the principles and regulations governing the exploitation of the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and consultations were held in order to obtain general and universal acceptance of Part XI of the Convention which deals with these matters.  The Agreement Relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention was concluded on 28 July 1994.  Ireland signed the Agreement subject to ratification.  The provisions of the Implementing Agreement overhauls the decision making procedures of Part XI of the convention and restructures the seabed mining regime along free market principles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> The convention gives a near comprehensive statement of the current international law of the sea, and has in addition established some ground breaking concepts.  It provides for the status and the organisation of the legal regime of the seas and sea-beds in the following categories: territorial seas, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone, continental shelf and the high seas.  It also provides for universal standards in the areas of protection and preservation of the marine environment, marine scientific research, the development and transfer of marine technology and for the settlement of disputes concerning the law of the sea.</P>
    <P>The principal benefits of the Convention include: the establishment and stabilisation of the breadth of the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles; the setting forth of navigation regimes of innocent passage in the territorial sea, transit passage in straits used for international navigation and sea lanes passage in archipelagic waters; the reaffirmation of the traditional freedoms of navigation and overflight in the exclusive economic zone and in the high seas; the preservation of the right to use the world's oceans by commercial vessels with seagoing cargoes; the provision of an exclusive economic zone out to 200 nautical miles from baselines for fisheries and other marine resources &mdash; that is of enormous significance to us; the securing of our rights regarding exploration, development and exploitation of the mineral resources such as oil and gas over the full extent of our continental shelf and the provision of criteria and procedures for determining the outer limit of our continental margin.</P>
    <P>Other benefits include: far-reaching rules of protection for the marine environment by addressing vessel source pollution, pollution from sea-bed activities, ocean dumping and land-based sources of marine pollution; the provision of a regime to conserve and manage the natural and living resources of the sea; the provision of special regimes of protection for certain species, for example <Col N="2084" /> the salmon, and for marine mammals, for example whales and the promotion of marine scientific research by the establishment of criteria and procedures for research activities.  A State intending to carry out such research is required to obtain the prior consent of the coastal State in whose waters the research activities will take place.  Under the convention there will be dispute settlement provisions by various mechanisms for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of the convention, in particular, by the establishment of a new court entitled the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.  The procedures are flexible in that they provide for a choice of options as to the appropriate means for the resolution of the dispute. There will also be a regime for managing the development of mineral resources of the seabed beyond national jurisdiction for the benefit of mankind through the establishment of an international organisation, the International Seabed Authority, which will grant licences and establish rules for the exploitation of the resources of the deep seabed.  The convention provides legal regimes for all uses of the sea.</P>
    <P>As a State with a long coastline, Ireland has a natural interest in preserving its rights and resources in the marine environment.  Ireland is entitled to a generous exclusive economic zone and is one of the comparatively few States whose geological continental shelf extends beyond the 200 nautical mile limit.  The importance of the fishing industry to Ireland's economy provides an additional major incentive for ratification.</P>
    <P>Ireland's continental shelf, which is some nine to ten times the size of the onshore, has potential as a location for rich and valuable natural resources which ought to be assessed, and, where feasible, developed.  The Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to be established in accordance with the provisions of Annex II to the convention, will be elected in March from among the States parties to the convention. The Continental Shelf Commission <Col N="2085" /> has the important task of reacting to and making recommendations on the technical case made by each wide-margin state when the procedures for defining the outer limit in accordance with article 76 are being implemented.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to be party to the convention in order to have any outer limit claimed by Ireland established and accepted in international law.  Ireland's claim will be for an area considerably beyond the 200 nautical mile limit and is particularly important because of the great extent and potential of the area. Part of the area being claimed by Ireland is also subject to counter claims by Iceland and by Denmark on behalf of the Faroe Islands.  It is possible that either of these states could lodge a claim with the Continental Shelf Commission once it is established, so Ireland must be in a position to respond.</P>
    <P>Ireland is somewhat protected from these counter claims as a result of its 1988 bilateral agreement with the UK establishing the line of division between the two countries across the entire continental shelf.  As a result both the Faroese claim and the Islandic claim traverse the UK designated shelf before impinging on the Irish designated shelf. Another result of the 1988 agreement was to effectively sideline any dispute concerning Rockall itself.  This point now lies within the UK designated area but has no effect in relation to the continental shelf claims of either country since under the terms of the convention it is a rock and not an island and, therefore, cannot have an associated continental shelf.  Following the 1988 agreement, therefore, approximately two-thirds of the economically more important Rockall Trough is designated by Ireland and the remaining one-third is designated by the UK.</P>
    <P>As a maritime nation, Ireland has had considerable interest in the post-war development of the law of the sea and has been particularly active in its development under the auspices of the United Nations.  It is therefore appropriate for Ireland to proceed as soon as practicable to ratification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2086" /> Virtually all of the provisions of the four Geneva Conventions on the Law of the Sea of 29 April 1958 are either repeated, modified or replaced by the provisions of the convention.  Article 311 (1) of the convention provides that it will prevail, as between states parties. over the four Geneva Conventions.</P>
    <P>In May 1996 there were 90 states parties to the convention and 50 to the agreement.  The convention entered into force internationally on 16 November 1994 and thereafter for other states it will enter into force 30 days after the deposit of their instruments of ratification or accession.  In regard to the implementing agreement, Ireland joined 120 other states in voting for its adoption on 28 July 1994.  There were no negative votes although there were seven abstentions.</P>
    <P>I should add that the European Community intends to become a party to the convention and implementing agreement at an early date.</P>
    <P>On becoming a party to the convention and agreement, the State will be liable to make an annual contribution to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the International Seabed Authority, two of the new institutions established by the convention.  The approximate amount of the contribution of the State to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, for 1996-97, is estimated to be £23,428.  No figures are available in regard to the International Seabed Authority.  At present the authority is being funded from the general budget of the United Nations and it is anticipated that the State will not be obliged to make a contribution until 1997.</P>
    <P>I accordingly commend the convention and implementing agreement to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and obviously support the ratification of the convention.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea which was concluded at Montego Bay, Jamaica, in December 1982 and the Agreement Relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the UN <Col N="2087" /> Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 1982, was adopted by the General Assembly of the UN in July 1994.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1993 an event of significant importance took place in regard to law and order at sea.  At the end of that year there was the sixtieth ratification by a signatory to the Convention on the Law of the Sea, an event which allowed the convention to be brought into force in November 1994.  The sixtieth ratification brought an end to 25 years of negotiation.</P>
      <P>In 1982 the countries convened in Jamaica for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive regime dealing with all matters relating to the law of the sea, bearing in mind that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole.</P>
      <P>The discussions and negotiations of these countries have found life in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The introduction of the text of the convention states that it is multifaceted and represents a monument to international co-operation in the treaty making process. The convention represents an attempt to establish true universality in an effort to achieve a just and equitable international economic order governing ocean space.</P>
      <P>The convention is a complex and comprehensive framework for the regulation of ocean space.  It is a mammoth tome, divided into 17 parts with nine annexes and contains provisions governing the limits of national jurisdictions over ocean space; access to the seas; navigation; protection and preservation of the marine environment; exploitation of living resources and conservation; scientific research; sea bed mining and other exploitation of non-living resources and the settlement of disputes. The convention also established new international bodies to carry out functions for the realisation of specific objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the highlights of the convention's text is its grounding in the idea <Col N="2088" /> that the enjoyment of rights and benefits involved the concomitant undertaking of duties and obligations, so that an overall equitable order may be created. The paramount duty of all states is to respect the rights of others.</P>
    <P>The convention allows, for example, for the establishment of a territorial sea of up to 12 nautical miles in breadth and provides various methods for determining baselines and distinguishing between territorial waters and internal waters.  Beyond the 12 miles boundary, the convention allows for the creation of an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 nautical miles, an issue which led to contentious debate during negotiations on the convention.</P>
    <P>Having laid down guidelines for the determination of the limits of national jurisdiction, the convention sets out the princples and regulations governing the seabed and ocean floor beyond those limits &mdash; limits which are the common heritage of mankind.  Do the guidelines carry any weight?  To copperfasten the convention guidelines, an International Seabed Authority was established, which has the power to administer the common heritage of mankind and to regulate its exploration and exploitation.</P>
    <P>In addition to territorial boundaries and the laying down of principles and regulations, the convention also includes provisions for the purpose of fostering the development and facilitating the transfer of all varieties of marine technology and to encourage the conduct of marine scientific research.</P>
    <P>In the event of disputes the convention obliges that if parties to them do not and cannot settle the disputes in a peaceful manner, a selection of methods can be employed for doing so in the event that they are unable to reach agreement, even with third party intervention.</P>
    <P>The convention's system is compulsory and binding; a party has no choice but to submit to a settlement procedure if requested to do so by the other party involved in the dispute, except in limited circumstances.  Equally important is <Col N="2089" /> the fact that a party is bound to abide by the findings of the body to which the dispute is submitted.  States have the opportunity to use the facilities of the International Court of Justice, arbitration or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea &mdash; a new and autonomous specialised tribunal established by the convention.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the final session of the Law of the Sea Conference in Montego Bay, the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, stated that the international law had been irrevocably transformed and that the convention was like a breath of fresh air at a time of serious crisis in international co-operation and decline in the use of international machinery for the solution of world problems.</P>
    <P>Following final ratification of the convention, Ireland will benefit from many aspects of its articles and annexes.  For example, we will enjoy the benefit of a 12 mile territorial zone around our long coastline and the contiguous zone of 200 miles.  The Minister of State referred to the agreement of 1988 with the UK.  I had the honour at that time of being Minister for Energy and I was involved in the negotiations with the UK on the agreement.</P>
    <P>For island nations, the convention should help to promote the maintenance of international peace and security, as it will replace a mind boggling array of conflicting claims by coastal states with accepted limits on the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf.  Ireland will also benefit from the regime of innocent passage through territorial sea; the regime of transit passage through straits used for international navigation and from the regime of archipelagic sea lanes passage.</P>
    <P>The world community, including Ireland, should benefit from increased interest in and promotion of conservation and the optimum use of the sea's living resources.  Fianna Fáil's policy document <i>Our Place in the World</i> has <Col N="2090" /> committed it to protecting and promoting all aspects of the global environment, an environment which includes the seas and oceans.  The document indicates that most of today's political leaders will be dead before the planet suffers the full consequences of acid rain, ozone depletion, nuclear outfall and species loss.  It also states that we have not inherited the earth from our parents, we have borrowed it from our children.</P>
    <P>The document recognises that our membership of the EU and particularly our forthcoming Presidency, allow us the opportunity to contribute to the environment as a global issue.  The last six months of this year will provide us with the perfect opportunity to continue to promote the aspirations set out in the Convention on the Law of the Sea.  It is the duty of the Government to use this opportunity to the full.</P>
    <P>A convention of this complexity and comprehensiveness cannot ensure that all is a clear blue picture with regard to the oceans and seas of the world.  A recent article in <i>The Economist</i> had as its by-line &ldquo;Seas of Troubles&rdquo;.  These &ldquo;troubles&rdquo; lie in China's claims on what it views as national territory.  About three weeks ago, China's official press, <i>The People's Daily,</i> reported that the Chinese Government had announced that the area of sea under China's jurisdiction had, in mid-May, grown from 370,000 square kilometres to some 3 million square kilometres.  In one fell swoop China has claimed an expanse of sea and countless small islands and reefs in the South China Sea.</P>
    <P>However, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei also lay some claim to these waters.  These neighbouring countries are understandably concerned about the threat that such a newly assertive regime by China could bring an era of instability to the region.  China's action is all the more surprising given that on 15 May this year it ratified this UN convention.</P>
    <P>While it has quite legitimately claimed a 200 mile offshore zone down its mainland coast, it has also drawn a <Col N="2091" /> 200 mile zone around the Paracel archipelago, which Chinese soldiers occupy. As a result Vietnam is incensed.  Clearly, the convention does not solve all sea or ocean based problems.  However, China is not alone.  There is also a stand-off in the Aegean Sea whereby Turkey has threatened war if Greece extends its territorial waters to 12 miles.</P>
    <P>With regard to the agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the convention, which was adopted in July 1994, it is important that Ireland uses its influence at EU and UN level to ensure the benefits of the common heritage of mankind is not solely enjoyed by the developed world.  The International Seabed Authority, established following the agreement, must ensure the common heritage is shared by all.  As one would expect, many developing countries are concerned that implementation of the convention will not benefit them to any extent.  The resources of the seas must not be claimed solely by the developed world.  The history of the developed world ransacking the lands of the developing world must not be repeated.  The Government must use all its powers and energies to ensure that exploitation of weaker and less developed nations does not occur.</P>
    <P>In agreeing that Ireland should become a party to this UN convention and agreement on the Law of the Sea, I hope the Government will take on board some of the concerns I have expressed.  We have a proud history with nations throughout the world, particularly developing nations.  We have enjoyed a particular affinity and credibility with these nations and we must ensure our record continues and prospers.  We must also strive to match our healthy overseas development record with a vigorous demand that the world environment is protected and enhanced.</P>
    <P>We should use every opportunity to highlight the dangers of ships carrying nuclear waste for reprocessing through the Irish Sea to Sellafield.  We must do everything possible to stop this trade in <Col N="2092" /> nuclear waste which threatens the Irish people each time a ship goes up the Irish Sea.  The Government must achieve its goals and I support its intention to ratify the convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion to enable Ireland ratify this long standing convention from which we benefit greatly.  Our position is a great deal stronger legally and economically than it was prior to the introduction of the convention.  I am surprised to note that the main convention was signed in 1982 and various amendments have had to be made to it since.  It is regrettable it has taken so long for the motion to ratify it to come before the House, particularly as we have an inherent interest in having it implemented internationally as quickly and as broadly as possible.</P>
      <P>This is a very large document and only one copy has been placed in the Library.  I cannot get a copy of it and I cannot spend my days in the Library studying it.  To debate its contents without maps is somewhat meaningless.  Will the Minister of State arrange for the Department of Foreign Affairs to send Deputy Burke and me complete copies of the convention, annexes and maps? This matter will arise on a regular basis in the months and years ahead and all parties should have a complete copy of those documents.  This is the sort of topic that, if it is to be dealt with properly, requires a well researched and lengthy speech to take account of all matters that arise.  However, under the rules for the debate I will not have an opportunity to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the international negotiations into which Ireland entered since independence, the least successful were our negotiations on fishing rights on accession to the European Community. As I was a member of the Government in 1972 I have some understanding of why those negotiations were not successful. There was a certain degree of anxiety on the part of many other economic and political interests to have matters completed in May 1972 so that we could hold a referendum on joining the <Col N="2093" /> Community, which the overwhelming majority of our people wanted.  To some extent our fishing rights were sacrificed for the greater good of the country and we are now paying a fairly high price for that.  While there is not much we can do about it, I want to use the opportunity of this debate to say that we should never again be so generous with our assets, particularly our marine resources.  This is particularly important now in the light of the potential resources of our Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>Ireland benefits more than any other country from the provisions of this convention. We are in the unusual position of having a longer coastline and a greater area of Continental shelf in proportion to our land mass than any other country.  As this convention is crucial for us, it is regrettable this debate is confined to ten minutes per Member.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State estimated Ireland's Continental Shelf as nine to 12 times the size of the onshore.  I believe it is greater than that.  We have significant areas outside the 200 mile limit over which I hope and trust the Government will ensure we exercise our full rights under the convention.  The Minister of State said that as a result of the 1988 agreement with the United Kingdom all matters between us and them regarding the Continental Shelf have been settled for all time.  That is not my recollection. She spoke in particular about Rockall area and the Rockall Trough.  From my recollection of my time in the Department of Energy and other posts I held in various Governments we did not finalise an agreement on the division in the St. George's Channel area as between Britain and Ireland.  For the purposes of oil exploration, there are still doubtful areas down the middle of the Irish Sea and in St. George's Channel, in what we call the Celtic Sea and between France and Ireland in what the French call the <i>Mer d'Iroise.</i> These matters have not been finalised.  The Rockall area to the north west is not the only place about which matters have not been finalised.</P>
    <P>The settlement between the United <Col N="2094" /> Kingdom and Ireland relating to Rockall is probably satisfactory from our point of view if everybody accepts Rockall is a rock, not conferring any rights or jurisdictions in itself.  It is worth noting that the nearest mainland to Rockall is Ireland and the nearest land comprises islands off the west coast of Scotland.  As the matter could be argued <i>ad infinitum,</i> it made good sense to reach an agreement with Britain on the matter.  However, it is important that we resist the slightly far-fetched claims of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which may not be pursued.  Rockall is a valuable fishing area but, more importantly, if oil or gas were discovered there it would have great economic benefits. Even if we establish our rights as a nation over fishing there, we have given them away to the European Union.  We must be very careful not to give away any more rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said the European Community intends to become a party to the convention and implementing agreement.  I take it she means the European Union, not just one of the communities, will become a party to the convention.  If the Union becomes a party I presume that would not invalidate the ratification and the rights of individual member states because we have not given up those economic rights to the Union.  We have given up only our fishing rights.  That should be spelt out very clearly because it will be a matter of fundamental importance in the future.  The position in the Irish Sea, the St. George's Channel, the <i>Mer d'lroise</i> and the Celtic Sea should be clarified.  What is being done here in a great hurry today will have huge economic consequences for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The sheer breadth of this convention and the number of areas it covers is almost mind-boggling and it is very important.  Some of the elements of it, which may not appear today to be hugely important or central, are likely to become so in the future.  It is interesting that the Minister referred to one of the benefits of the convention as <Col N="2095" /> the provision of special regimes of protection for the anadromous species &mdash; for example, the salmon &mdash; and for marine mammals.  It is curious that we as a country will be able, under this convention, to enforce other states to protect salmon but we destroy it when it comes into our own territorial waters.  That is absolutely deplorable.</P>

In economic terms it is perhaps the most important agreement Ireland has ever entered into and we are very fortunate to have done so well from it.  We are indebted to a succession of public servants who were engaged in work on it. The person I remember best is Mr. Mahon-Hayes who spent many years working on it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This law of the sea convention is very complex.  It is awesome to think that our Continental Shelf is nine to ten times greater than the land mass of this island, yet we know little <Col N="2096" /> about it and, most alarmingly, are unconcerned about it.  With the exception of the four people present, interest in the debate is minute, which is worrying.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear of the progress made in 1988 in terms of the Rockall Trough, to which Deputy O'Malley referred, and that two-thirds of that area has been allocated to Ireland and one-third to the United Kingdom.  I do not know if that is public knowledge.  I am not sure of the position with regard to the rock called Rockall &mdash; it could not be described as an island. Where does ownership of that lie?  The water around Rockall is particularly valuable because it is quite shallow and, apart from being a good fishery area, it is also very valuable for its natural resources.  Statoil is on the point of drilling in the Porcupine Bank, which is 150 to 200 miles off Connemara.  There will be quite an amount of exploration in deeper waters in years to come.</P>
      <P>It is mind-boggling to think that not alone have we access to a Continental Shelf nine or ten times as great as the island of Ireland but the convention allows us extended rights &mdash; I presume the extended area is half way between Ireland and the United States and Canada. Nobody seems to be aware of that other than the Minister, her advisers and the few people here today.  We have mineral rights to an incredible amount of territory &mdash; for all we know, it may be as large as the United States or China. Underwater mining and mineral exploration, whether for oil or metals, will become exceptionally important in the future.  We are not aware of our wealth and do not have the expertise to exploit it.  We depend on major multinational companies such as Statoil to use its expert knowledge to extract minerals under licence from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate on the extended areas to which we have rights under this convention.  The areas involved must be huge and obviously spread westward to the Atlantic, but how far do they extend in a southerly direction? Deputy O'Malley referred to <Col N="2097" /> the line of demarcation between Britain and France, somewhere in the St. George's Channel.  It would be very interesting to know the delineation involved.</P>
    <P>That we literally gave away the bulk of our fishing rights in 1972 when negotiating our entry to the European Union was referred to.  It is welcome that people who were in Government at the time admit to that, but regardless of what Government was in office the same thing would have happened.  The lack of interest in nautical matters, particularly fishery matters, at higher levels is unbelievable.  Our children and their children will look back in dismay at our neglect in this area.</P>
    <P>We own 16 per cent of the Community's waters &mdash; they are within our territorial Continental Shelf area &mdash; but we have only 4 per cent of the fish quota.  That is alarming and shows a tremendous degree of indifference.  We have been hoodwinked all along the line, even as recently as last year by the Spaniards and other EC countries who supported them, and by the EC Commissioner for Fisheries.  The Spaniards' quota might be reasonable if they abided by the law, but they do not; they buck the laws, the rules and regulations at every twist and turn.  They catch much more fish than they should.  They have little or no regard for quota systems or the preservation of various species of fish.  Their only thought is to catch as much as possible &mdash; retention of stocks is secondary.  They have raped seas and fishing grounds all over the world, in the south Atlantic off the South American coast or off both the Atlantic and Indian coasts of Africa. Last year they tried to do it off Canada but luckily Mr. Tobin, a Canadian Minister of Irish descent, stood up to them and stopped them in their tracks.</P>
    <P>We have not done so &mdash; we have allowed them to fish here since time immemorial.  The Irish Navy Service's fishery crews have done a wonderful job but, as pointed out, our coastline is so vast it is virtually impossible to supervise it all.  They have been overwhelmed <Col N="2098" /> because at any given time there are dozens of Spanish fishery ships &mdash; they should be called ships rather than trawlers &mdash; fishing illegally in Irish waters.  A percentage of them are caught but the bulk get away scot free.</P>
    <P>They are destroying our fisheries because they have no concept of conservation. They will catch a fish which weighs a few ounces, even though it might grow to 20 pounds, and sell it openly on the Spanish market.  Two years ago &ldquo;The Cook Report&rdquo;, an investigative programme on ITV, demonstrated that the Spanish fishing fleet was unscrupulous in what it caught but no one in Spain or the European Commission was capable of standing up to them.  The Basque terrorist organisation ETA intimidated fishery officers, saying that if officials prosecuted fishermen or examined the holds in which undersized fish were held, their lives would be in danger.  These physical threats were shown on the programme; I wonder if the EU Commission saw it.</P>
    <P>We are now expected to cut back our fishery fleet by 40 per cent because of the massive illegal tactics of the Spaniards. Two weeks ago, a senior member of the Norwegian Government told me that, although its referendum on joining the EU was lost by a close vote, it was not because the people wished to protect their fisheries because Norway was getting a good deal from the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that if Ireland had a similar deal we would not have the problems we now face.  The Norwegians made sure that the Spaniards would not go near their fisheries.  He then told me something which is astounding to those who remember the last 30 years &mdash; Iceland was interested in joining the EU at that time, because when it saw the protection Norway was getting, it could see no reason its fisheries would not be protected in the same way.  This shows that, as another Deputy said, we sold out our fishery rights, whereas the Norwegians and Icelandics were promised that they <Col N="2099" /> would hold what they had.  This is not only interesting, it is tragic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support this motion.  We all too infrequently discuss the marine environment, marine resources and our area of ownership.  It may be that for historical reasons we have not grasped the significance, riches and potential of the seas around our coast to the extent we should.  As an occupied country, perhaps we saw the agressor as always coming from the seas.  Even in the way we design our towns, we turn our backs to the sun and the sea.  Pouring effluent into coastal waters is another indication that we do not understand the value of water and air and how we can develop our natural environment.</P>
      <P>The convention is extremely progressive. We are extremely anxious to ratify it and we support the Government in so doing.  A number of Governments were involved in progressing the detailed aspects of the convention along its tortuous route.</P>
      <P>We have 16 per cent of EU waters, 4 per cent of the fish catch and an old and ageing fishing fleet.  At present there are proposals to reduce still further our EU quota.  Although we do not have the capacity to cause over-fishing problems. we are expected to accept this cut, with the disastrous consequences it would have for us.  In this we are also expected to be in tune with all other countries, not least those who caused the problem. Our Casa aircraft have provided the Government with new information about how our waters are being raped, how the Spanish &ldquo;vacuum cleaners&rdquo; over-fish, fish illegally, give wrong logs, use secret holds, etc. When Spanish fishery ships are boarded by the Naval Service, 20 per cent are found to be fishing illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we embrace whole-heartedly the contents of this convention and the rights it gives us, still we gaze almost helplessly at the destruction of a resource, and the EU will ultimately <Col N="2100" /> take a roasting for not protecting it.  Millions of tons of immature fish, estimated at £1 billion to £2 billion per annum, are being taken from our seas by foreign trawlers.  To put this in context, we enjoy considerable benefits from the EU in Structural and Cohesion Funds and in other ways, yet at the same time our membership means we are being deprived of rich resources.  In enshrining in law methods of protection, new facilities for settling disputes, and measures to develop our marine environment and our ownership of it, we should take much more control of what is happening to these resources.</P>
    <P>We must also concentrate on research.  Some 70 per cent of the world consists of seas and oceans but we do not know enough about them.  Our educational institutions, particularly Cork regional technical college and the Marine Institute, are doing work to establish our true resources.  In determining our ownership and what to do with these resources, it is critically important to find the additional funds required to carry out intensive research and to link into universities and research institutes throughout the world in an effort to establish not only the living resources but the other resources which may be of enormous benefit to us in the future.</P>
    <P>With these provisions, I am extremely happy to support this convention and urge the Government to ratify it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who participated in the debate on the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention did not come into force until November 1994 and we will ratify it within two years of its entry into force at international level.  Reference was made to Mr. Mahon Hayes who carried out outstanding work in this area. He has retired from the Department and is a member of the Constitutional Review Committee &mdash; having sorted out <Col N="2101" /> the laws of the sea he is now trying to sort out the Constitution.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Continental Shelf, the territory of the 26 counties is 70,000 square kilometres and the current designated offshore area is 652,000 square kilometres.  Under the convention we could have an additional designated area of 213,000 square kilometres, giving us a potential of 865,000 square kilometres which is nine to 12 times the land area of the Republic.  It is a pity that in debates of this nature we do not have the benefit of audio visual facilities which would ensure a much more informative debate not only for us but for the general public.  It is ironic that unlike county councils we cannot put maps on display during such debates.  I will provide copies of the convention and agreement to members of the Opposition parties.  No maps accompanied the documentation as some of them are the subject of contention. On Deputy Burke's point about China, we have been notified by it of its new designation order and we are in the process of examining the co-ordinates furnished to us.</P>
    <P>On the points about the EU and the common fisheries policy, occasionally it is stated that we have a begging bowl mentality when looking for subsidies and Structural Funds.  Regardless of what we have gained in terms of Structural Funds and agricultural price supports, we have contributed, and will continue to contribute, more than our fair share to the Union and certain member states as a consequence of the decisions made in 1972 to essentially cede competence for the common fisheries policy to the Union.  Hindsight is a wonderful teacher and we have paid dearly for that decision.  While we have 16 per cent of the area we have only 4 per cent of the quota and we will continue to press for a review of the allocation of quotas.</P>
    <P>The areas of competence which have been ceded also include commercial and costoms policy.  We have shared competence in regard to maritime transport, <Col N="2102" /> the safety of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution.  I understand the European Union intends to become a party to the convention in the near future.  Work is at an advanced stage on the preparation of a declaration which concerns the competence of the European Union in regard to matters governed by the convention and the implementation agreement and it will be made pursuant to Article 5 (1) of Annex IX to the convention and Article 4 (4) of the implementing agreement.</P>

    <P>Under Article 1 of the convention the deep seabed is alluded to as the common heritage of mankind and, therefore, the deep ocean floor belongs to the International Seabed Authority.  Nonetheless, when the convention comes into force it will open for us &mdash; as a State we must pursue this &mdash; the possibility of using the resources, particularly those in the extraordinary area of the Continental Shelf, for our benefit.  It will be important to devote substantial investment in ascertaining how best we can use these resources, having learnt from some of the unfortunate mistakes made in this area in the past.  The convention gives us new opportunities which the <Col N="2103" /> Government, and I hope all other governments, are committed to exploiting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 1: In page 3, lines 25 and 26, paragraph (b) deleted and the following new paragraph substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) any deliberate disposal in the maritime area of vessels, aircraft or offshore installations,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Section 1 is to be amended to extend the definition of dumping to include the dumping of offshore installations. Section 4 (1) (a) is to be amended to allow for the continuation of the complete ban on the disposal of offshore installations at sea subject to section 5. Sections 5 (1) (a) and 5 (2) are to be amended to enable the Minister, after consultation with other Government Ministers, to grant or refuse to grant a permit for the disposal of offshore installations.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) (b) (ii) is to be amended to require the Minister, when deciding whether to grant or refuse a permit in respect of an offshore installation, to consider the exceptions to the prohibition of such dumping as set out in the new Part II of the Second Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> Part II of the Second Schedule sets out the exceptions to the prohibition on dumping of offshore installations in accordance with the provisions of the OSPAR Convention as follows &mdash; (a) permits may only be granted in accordance with the relevant applicable decisions, recommendations and all other agreements adopted under the convention and (b) permits may not be granted if the offshore installation contains substances which result, or are likely to result, in hazard to human health, harm to living resources and marine ecosystems, damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate uses of the sea.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 (12) and 5 (13) are new subsections which provide that the granting of permits on a case-by-case basis in respect of offshore installations may only come into operation by way of a Government Order which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Government adopts a precautionary approach in the protection of the marine environment.  In the absence of sound scientific evidence that the dumping of offshore installations do not impact on the marine environment, we must legislate for the complete ban of sea disposal of offshore installations. Contracting parties to OSPAR, with the exception of Norway and the UK, adopted an agreement on a moratorium on the disposal of offshore installations at sea.  However, Norway and the UK agreed informally to be bound by the terms of the moratorium.  We will press in OSPAR for a continuation of the current moratorium; indeed, we will seek to make the current ban obligatory on all OSPAR States by way of having it formally enshrined in the convention.</P>
    <P>I would regard the situation, involving dumping unregulated by the international community, as inappropriate given the irrelevance of maritime borders on the impact of marine pollution. While the Bill extends the limit of Irish control in relation to dumping from 12 miles up to 200 miles, and in some areas up to 350 miles, off the Irish coast, I <Col N="2105" /> would be very concerned about any future unregulated dumping of offshore installations by international communities in areas immediately outside our maritime area.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Bill matters have progressed somewhat within OSPAR.  An internationally sound basis for selective dumping may emerge which allows for an authoritative risk categorisation of installations.  This will determine which installations may or may not be dumped.  It may well include regulatory controls, underpinned by an internationally agreed monitoring and policing regime, which would oversee the identification of offshore installations which could be considered for dumping, the identification of suitable dump sites, preparation of the installations for dumping and the dumping operations themselves.  A special working group of OSPAR experts is currently studying this whole issue.  The EU is also preparing a report in the matter. Thus, while it is our policy to maintain the ban, the alternative of a properly controlled international dumping regime may emerge in its stead.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I propose these amendments to the Bill which will allow for this possible outcome following a review of the complete ban in the future.  These amendments are being proposed to allow Ireland to adhere to future international conventions if it emerges that an internationally accepted regime is adopted for the disposal of offshore installations.  However, I do not foresee such dumping in our maritime area.</P>
    <P>The amendments now being proposed require that the commencement of the new provisions regulating the sea disposal of offshore installations must be debated and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will provide the Legislature an opportunity to revisit the whole issue in the light of the outcome of international scientific investigation.  I can assure the House that a Government Order will only be proposed on the basis of total satisfaction that an internationally agreed <Col N="2106" /> and environmentally safe method of disposal is available.  If it is not available, the ban under section 4 will remain.</P>
    <P>I commend these amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss these Seanad amendments and additional ones agreed by the Minister since the passage of the Bill through this House.</P>
      <P>First I shall refer to the developments under the aegis of the OSPAR Convention to which the Minister of State referred.  On Second Stage I said I foresaw some difficulties in sorting out all our dumping problems bearing in mind the types of alternatives emerging, for example, the option of landfill.  I said then more research was required on international fronts to allow us decide ultimately how we would dispose of certain types of installations.  I am glad some progress has been made in the interim.  I am also assured by what the Minister said that, in the event of such matters having to be dealt with at some future date, such dumping will not take place in Irish waters.  Anything I have read of potential difficulties for communities in terms of suitable dumping sites leads me to the conclusion that it is an enormous international dilemma. There is clear public concern about dumping in our waters.  Substances hidden by the sea can have extraordinary longevity and may well blow up in one's face in the future.  The alternative landfill option is abhorrent to us.</P>
      <P>We must examine this dilemma not only to ascertain the ultimate, most appropriate site for dumping but to ascertain to what extent such problems can be reduced from the outset, thus leading to a commensurate reduction in residual problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the inclusion of offshore installations in section 1, we engaged in some argument about this on Committee Stage.  I believed the offence created in that section did not adequately provide for such contingency, that perhaps ours was to stream-lined a provision. Although the Minister did not accept <Col N="2107" /> my view at that time, I am glad a change has been effected which is probably more appropriate.</P>
    <P>A number of other Seanad amendments are of a quite technical nature. Regardless of its being provided in legislation I assume the Minister can speak to any other Minister he wishes.  It would be a peculiar type of country if he could not do so without that being enshrined in legislation.  If considered necessary, we would have no objection to this.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions of section 6, I take it the additional powers being vested in regional fisheries officers are of an exceptional nature, not for general usage.  I look forward to the implementation of the stringent provisions of this Bill.  I hope they will be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Michael Smith is correct.  When we last discussed this Bill he drew attention to the need for additional international investigation on the dumping prohibition and any options that might be available.  No doubt he drew on his considerable experience in that area, with particular reference to international environmental protection.</P>
      <P>What is in place is a moratorium which, for those signatory countries, is obligatory.  Norway and the United Kingdom, the two countries in the eye of the storm &mdash; with specific reference to their imminence to the North Sea &mdash; are participating voluntarily.  We are anxious to ensure an OSPAR agreement including all of the waters covered by that convention.  We do not want to be confronted by circumstances in which we have domestic legislation in place covering our maritime area, but other sites immediately beyond our maritime area could be resorted to as dumping sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing here is anticipating what may emerge from current discussions within OSPAR.  There is some consideration in progress on a categorisation system of different types of structures, for example, the possibility of a <Col N="2108" /> distinction being drawn between concrete and metal structures.  It may be found more appropriate to dispose of some structures at sea rather than on land.  Any such disposal will be done under the strictest of scientific conditions, after investigation and so on. We need to anticipate that contigency, first, to enable us to play a constructive role in the OSPAR discussions and, second, to have in place appropriate means to implement an agreement should one emerge from those discussions. However, triggering any conditions stipulated in such an agreement will require an Order to be debated and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, thus ensuring transparency about the eventual outcome.  This matter is currently under discussion at OSPAR and we need to make provision to anticipate the outcome.</P>

It is normal practice for my Department to forward copies of permits to members of the public on request.  However, in line with the Government's policy on access to information on the environment, I agreed with Senator Daly that details of permits should be made available to as wide an interested public as possible.

    <P>On Committee Stage in the Seanad Senator Daly proposed an amendment to the Bill providing for the appointment of officers of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards as authorised officers for the purpose of the Act.  The Bill already provided for the appointment of a wide range of technical and scientific experts as authorised officers, including fishery experts from the Marine Institute.  However, I accepted the points put forward by Senators Daly and Fitzgerald that in some cases members of the regional fisheries boards would be best placed to enforce provisions of the Bill in respect of their own regions.  This amendment which was welcomed in the Seanad provides for appointment by the Minister of officers of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards as authorised officers for the purpose of the Bill.  Their authority for enforcement of the Bill will be in respect of their own regions only.  The Bill as it stands requires that officers of the Marine Institute, who are appointed as authorised officers, must have regard to the considerations of policy as the Minister may direct.  The amendment to section 6 (c) being proposed on the advice of the Attorney General is being extended to include officials of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards who are appointed as authorised officers.</P>

      <P>An amendment was passed by this House &mdash; section 11 refers &mdash; to make provision for the Attorney General to prosecute offences committed under the Dumping at Sea Bill because of the international and diplomatic complications that can arise in cases of this kind.  Up to now such offences would be prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Offences under the Dumping at Sea Bill are not like ordinary offences in our jurisdiction.  They may involve relations with other countries. It is important that the Attorney General should be in on the prosecution because he sits with the Government and is aware of the diplomatic and international perspective involved in prosecuting such offences.  Maritime law is a very specialised area of law which is traditionally dealt with by the Attorney General's office.  Amendment No. 13 is consequential on section 11.</P>

    <Title>Report of Task Force on Travelling Community: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Col N="2116" />
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>In my earlier contribution I complimented the authors of the report and the general outline of policy, especially on education and health.  However, there are other aspects associated with the travelling community that bear re-examination. Are halting sites the answer to accommodation needs?  They are not in many cases.  Caravans parked on the side of the road or on halting sites are still caravans, with all their inherent dangers of susceptibility to fire and overcrowding. They are not suitable accommodation for large families.  Halting sites are a stop-gap measure, not a solution to long-term problems.  Housing is preferable and housing for travellers should be provided in a selective manner to induce their integration into the general populace.  However, I do not propose large ghettos as they would spell disaster.</P>
      <P>The problems of illegal parking of caravans, wandering horses, stray dogs, scrap heaps, generators and refuse must be taken seriously and something must be done about it immediately, otherwise our tourism potential will be lost.  Legislation in this area is very poor.  Two High Court decisions have paralysed this House in drawing up definitive new legislation on the problems I have outlined. Likewise, the hands of the Garda Síochána are also tied.  County and urban district councils cannot act as they would like to solve these problems which have become an irritant within urban and town boundaries.  There cannot be one law for travellers and another for settled people.  All must be equal before the law.  New legislation must give county and urban councils authority to act without having to go to court in connection with every minor decision on illegal parking.  The parking of caravans should be prohibited in certain sensitive areas and in areas where they cause danger and harm to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> Anyone reading the daily newspapers will realise that we have a law and order problem.  That applies also to the travelling people.  Recently we have had problems in Tuam, Galway and Ballina.  For too long we have neglected to address the law and order problems in our society.  That is also true of drug trafficking. We must act before it is too late. In some cases travellers are under the impression that they are above the law, that they are untouchable, and anyone who speaks out on these issues is regarded as racist by the media and certain church personnel.  This is far from the truth.  All the settled community requires is that the law be applied in an even-handed way, with due recognition and sensitivity to hardship cases.</P>
    <P>The settled community has become frustrated at the lack of progress in dealing with the problems of the travelling community.  No one wants to take the tough decisions.  However, it is a finite problem and it should be amenable to settlement.  Certainly more dole, more ceoil, will not solve the problem. Perhaps the present report will stir Government to act on the travellers problems while being mindful of the rights of the settled community.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on health issues and education.  Primary care is of the essence, and recording of travellers problems, particularly in regard to sickness, longevity, maternity and the question of intermarriage which has led to the prevalence of inherited conditions among travellers.  On the question of education, all citizens have a right especially to primary education.  Currently, few travellers continue to secondary or vocational education.  We should give them every chance to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Given my right-wing views on certain subjects, I am sure the Minister will expect a right-wing tirade on this.  However, I have always felt that the itinerants are the deprived people of this country.  They are born handicapped. They are born with their hands tied behind their backs into a society that rejects them.  The itinerants here <Col N="2118" /> are possibly the blacks or the Red Indians of America.  They are deprived from birth, born into a society that is hostile to them throughout their lives.</P>
      <P>These people need serious help. Mainly, they need education.  Also, the people of Ireland need to be educated to accept that itinerants have the same rights as every other Irish person and are entitled to the same benefits.  The hostility I have encountered among the settled community against itinerants is often irrational.  Deputy Moffatt, with his medical experience, might be able to offer some psychological reason for that.  Perhaps the settled community feels in some way threatened by them.</P>
      <P>The itinerants, or the tinkers, whatever one likes to call them &mdash; I understand it is politically correct to call them itinerants &mdash; also have a responsibility. As Deputy Moffatt said, they are often schizophrenic on the subject of their rights and duties.  It is sad to see itinerant children begging in every town, in every city.  To see them begging at various stands that they occupy on O'Connell Bridge and 100 yards down the road in Molesworth Street where they take up positions every day under the eyes of the Garda and the political system is very disillusioning and must represent a major shock to tourists.  The fact that they are allowed to do this suggests the vacuum in which we on the political scene have looked at the itinerant problem over the years.</P>
      <P>The failure of central Government to address this problem over the past 40 years has been striking.  Central Government has attempted to foist this problem onto local authorities and councils and has ducked bringing in a national policy to address a problem with which we have lived since the foundation of the State.  It is heartening, therefore, to see the Minister's initiative, and the response from most Deputies in this Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am not fully convinced that the itinerant community play their proper role.  What is missing in respect of their position is the concept of personal responsibility.  Many itinerants <Col N="2119" /> feed off their deprived image and expect one law for the settled community and another for themselves.  Some time ago we had a problem in Dundalk which has had a halting site for at least 25 years &mdash; it was one of the first towns in the country to install a halting site.  I was the closest councillor in Dundalk to it, living about 200 yards away.</P>
    <P>Those itinerants never caused any difficulties for me and I never had any difficulty with them.  In recent times, however, the overflow of itinerants from the Six Counties has come to Dundalk. They were probably signing on the dole &mdash; as most of them were &mdash; on both sides of the Border.  Itinerants from England, driving cars such as Volvos and BMWs and pulling huge caravans, have come to Dundalk and park anywhere they like, to which I object.  The Garda Síochána should have immediate power to remove an illegally parked car or van on somebody else's property. Unfortunately, the Garda do not have that power and must have recourse to the court which is a costly, long drawn out procedure.  On one occasion when Dundalk Urban District Council sought an injunction against itinerants abandoning their cars on the inner bypass road in Dundalk it had to go as far as Arklow at a cost of £4,000.  These people had driven their cars on the footpath and abandoned them, inhibiting local people from using the footpath on a very busy road.  Their Alsatians and ponies and God knows what else were nearby.  This is happening time and time again in every town in Ireland and it is high time it is stopped.</P>
    <P>The itinerant community does not help its own case by engaging in this type of flagrant abuse and denial of the domestic rights of ordinary settled people.  From the evidence of the clan warfare among itinerants in the west, the sense of responsibility, of which I spoke, is missing among their community. The biggest blot on their community is their flagrant disregard for other people's property.  Unless central Government does something to tackle <Col N="2120" /> this problem by introducing meaningful legislation in that regard, a major catastrophe will occur between the settled and itinerant communities.</P>
    <P>Various Governments have sat on the fence but it is time to get off it and do something such as introducing meaningful legislation.  No person should have the right to park on someone else's property, whether it is public property owned by the local authority or privately owned, and give them the two finger salute.  The itinerant community has given the two finger salute to settled communities throughout Ireland.  One of the worst examples of their recklessness was in Deputy Seán Ryan's constituency when a flotilla of caravans, extending for a couple of miles, parked outside Dublin Airport so that tourists and dignitaries were greeted by this spectacle on arrival.  Happily, this has been taken care of.  Similar scenes are repeated all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  He is a man of good public conscience, with the courage to introduce legislation in this area.  I agree with Deputy Moffatt that immediate legislation is needed in two areas.  The first relates to health, as the morbidity rate among itinerant children is unusually high which obviously had to do with the awful conditions under which they live and, in some cases, are required to live. The second, equally important, is education. I said earlier the public needs to be educated to accept that people who have come from such a deprived culture need time to adapt to the settled way of life.  There is no doubt that the perception of itinerant parents of the necessity to attend school is a big deterrent to their children adapting to society.</P>
    <P>Halting sites have been criticised but there are pros and cons and I believe the halting site has a role to play in helping itinerants to adapt to settled life. Ideally, the answer is integrated housing but that is a lovely concept not always practical.  The eponymous John Smith may agree with what I say but will he agree to an itinerant living beside him?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2121" /> People accept the need for a dump but do not want it beside them.  That will pose problems which cannot be solved overnight.  Legislation is needed to assist local authorities to find areas where these people can be accepted and eventually assimilated into the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the points raised by Deputy McGahon who sounded a note of realism in the debate. I welcome the comprehensive recommendations in the task force report, covering all aspects of a traveller's life from accommodation to health, education, employment and so on.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the members who served on the task force and all individuals and groups who, in a voluntary capacity, gave their time and energy to support travellers' welfare.  I fully accept the recommendations of the report which cover comprehensively all aspects of the travelling community's existence and suggests how the various problems which confront them can be tackled.  I agree that all positive actions should be taken to improve the lot of these people who, after all, are our fellow citizens fully entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the report seems to take the travellers' nomadic way of life for granted.  This is likely to remain the position for the foreseeable future.  I am conscious of the many disadvantages this style of living imposes on families, particularly women and children who inevitably bear the brunt of the hardship it entails.  Nomadism makes it difficult for them to avail of satisfactory health and education facilities. It also makes it costly for the State to provide the limited services of which they can avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force could have addressed better ways of encouraging members of <Col N="2122" /> the travelling community to settle and forsake the nomadic way of life in their own interests and those of the wider community.  I am not saying they should be compelled to change, but in coming to terms with modern life change has imposed itself on many sections of the community.  In many cases, encouragement and help from the State was needed to make adjustment acceptable and possible.</P>
    <P>Change will also impose itself on the momadic way of life of travellers.  If the task force had addressed the problem from this perspective, it might have come up with more imaginative recommendations instead of the same old formula of providing more accommodation, particularly halting sites.  This approach failed in the past and I cannot see it, on its own, meeting with greater success in the future.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s Mayo County Council, of which I am a member, received a report which stated there were 48 travelling families in the county for whom it was responsible.  Since then it has housed 82 families.  Despite this progress, according to a recent report, 41 families remain on the roadside and it is projected that this number will increase to 120 by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>It is specified in the main recommendations of the report that there is a need to provide an additional 3,100 units of accommodation by the year 2000 for members of the travelling community, including transient accommodation and halting sites in each county. I cannot see this, of itself, improving the welfare of members of the travelling community or solving the problem unless there is strict supervision of halting sites, provision for their maintenance to a high standard and their occupants educated to accept some responsibility for their upkeep and general appearance.</P>
    <P>Members of the travelling community should also be educated to shoulder their share of the responsibility to build a better relationship with the settled community.  Some form of regulation is needed to control movement between <Col N="2123" /> halting sites.  As things stand, half the members of the travelling community could decend on a particular county, say, Kerry or Mayo, and place an intolerable and impossible burden on the local authority to provide transient accommodation or halting sites, upseting not only the settled community but those members of the travelling community occupying existing halting sites.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the report to the tensions between the settled and travelling communities and the need for the settled community to allow travellers &ldquo;to live life in their own way as law abiding citizens side by side with their settled neighbours&rdquo;.  These often break out in forthright opposition and downright hostility, described as the NIMBY syndrome, particularly when it comes to the provision of accommodation, especially halting sites.</P>
    <P>This attitude is encountered every-where, north, south, east and west and in urban and rural areas.  No settled community can honestly say it is free of it.  The report is a fair analysis of this phenomenon, tracing its origins to the behaviour of some members of the travelling community, and calls for a greater understanding on its part.  Undoubtedly, the attitude of members of the settled community is conditioned by their personal experience of contact with members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>All those interested in improving relationship must recognise the need for an extensive education programme for travellers who must learn to accept that there is no such thing as absolute freedom and that rights are always accompanied by corresponding responsibilities.  It is only when the offending elements of the travelling community accept the need for, and begin to practise, socially and environmentally acceptable conduct as they travel from place to place that the relationship between the two communities will begin to improve.  Anybody who expects otherwise is only fooling themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report in general and <Col N="2124" /> congratulate the Minister and all those connected with it.  It points to the need for a framework of new legislation to see its recommendations through.  I trust that when the Minister is drafting this legislation he will take into account some of the points I have made in this brief contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this comprehensive report.  To some extent, it understates the problems, particularly the problem of alienation.  One may get this impression because there is so much in it that it tends to dilute the overall effect.  It is, however, useful and one on which the Government can work.</P>
      <P>I strongly endorse the attempt to set out a strategy for reconciliation between the settled community and travellers. This is a key question which will have to be addressed on several fronts.  The reports sets out a strategy for improving relationships and resolving conflicts.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy McGahon, I have difficulty in picking the correct and most acceptable term.  When I was younger I was told to use the word &ldquo;itinerant&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tinker&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; apparently is more acceptable nowadays.  Interestingly, a generation ago tinkers were held in higher esteem for their contribution, in rural communities in particular.  There has been a regression since then.</P>
      <P>It has become fashionable &mdash; perhaps this is inevitable &mdash; to attack the local authorities on the thorny issue of halting sites but they are in an invidious position. On the one hand, they are criticised by the Minister and the Department for their tardiness and, on the other, by local communities when they try to provide halting sites.  They are caught in the middle and not protected by a good framework of legislation.  Mistakes have been made and insufficient resources provided on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cite the experience of Clare County Council as an example.  In 1984 it provided a 16 bay halting site at Drumcliffe, near Ennis.  Because it is making reasonably good provision for travellers, it has <Col N="2125" /> been accused in the interim of attracting travellers to the county.  Virtually every Deputy who has spoken in this debate has indicated that the county council of which he or she is a member had a similar experience.  It appears that the number of travelling families in Meath, Louth and Mayo is two or three times greater than the number initially expected to be accommodated.  It seems people are complaining that travellers are being attracted from other counties, but this is impossible.</P>
    <P>When I visited the halting site at Drumcliffe recently five of the 16 bays were occupied.  In most instances, the boundary walls were badly damaged. There were several illegal and dangerous connections to the public lighting system.  Access panels had been removed from the bottom of lampposts to facilitate these connections leaving them visible and accessible to children. The fences surrounding the property had been breached and horses were grazing on adjoining property.  Arising from this, local farmers complained that they were under severe duress.</P>
    <P>The people on that halting site feel that they have been abandoned by everyone, particularly the local community. A number of local residents have taken successful cases to the courts and a recent judgement ordered a partial evacuation and clearance of the site. This will create further problems because the people on the site will be forced to seek accommodation elsewhere. The management of the county council states that it has done everything possible to address the difficulties experienced on the site.  Some of its employees were attacked and a security firm had to be employed at a cost in excess of £60,000 per annum.  In five years, approximately £500,000 was spent on refurbishment, repairs, compensation, legal fees, etc., in respect of that halting site.  This does not represent a good use of taxpayers' money when the end result is a site with only five habitable bays.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to apportion blame in setting out the history of this site.  We <Col N="2126" /> must face up to past events and try to learn lessons for the future.  The halting site in question began life as a state of the art facility.  Undertakings were given to the local community but were not delivered on because no one was in a position to do so.  The effect of this is that anyone living in County Clare who has knowledge of that halting site expects to suffer the same fate if a similar site is established in their area.  It is only natural that residents of adjoining parishes such as Fountain, Kilnamore, etc., which have been mentioned as possible areas for halting sites, are worried about having the same kind of problems visited on them.  They have called on the Minister for the Environment to hold an inquiry in this regard. It would be useful to examine the difficulties experienced on that site in an objective manner to ensure that the problem does not recur.</P>
    <P>In my opinion a 16 bay site is too large and some of the difficulties arose because of this.  There is a need for better on-site management which is very expensive.  This is such a burden on local authorities that the Department of the Environment will be obliged to meet the entire cost over a long period.  Where damage is caused &mdash; very extensive damage was done in this instance &mdash; the tenants or those responsible must be brought to book and charged.  Recommendation DR 45 of the report addresses this issue to some extent, but does not go far enough.  In the long-term, local authorities will have to be given powers to deduct at source, from social welfare payments, etc., costs arising from this kind of damage.  This could equally apply in the case of some local authority tenants.  I am informed that there may be a constitutional difficulty about this issue but it must be addressed.  Everyone must ultimately obey the same rules and there is an onus on the State to ensure that they do.</P>
    <P>The travellers' support organisations in County Clare have been severely criticised.  It was claimed that they supported the provision of halting sites and <Col N="2127" /> subsequently failed to deliver on promised support measures.  I do not accept that this is entirely correct, but there is some justification for such reports. When Clare County Council initially housed many itinerants, it had equally unfortunate experiences.  At at least two sites where group housing was provided for itinerants, a huge amount of damage was done.  In one instance, the housing was abandoned, refurbished and given to the members of the settled community. However, there are other sites which have worked reasonably well.  In that context, it helped that the people entering group housing were better prepared. It was established in advance that the families involved were small and got on well together.</P>
    <P>Two traveller families were recently housed in a local authority estate &mdash; and one settled successfully but the other caused a great amount of difficulty.  The local authority does not have the resources or support systems to overcome the difficulties created by that family.  One of the most visible halting sites in the country was situated on the roundabout at the entrance to Shannon International Airport.  This did not provide a good impression for people arriving in Ireland.  That site is no longer visible but is no less troublesome for being more difficult to see. Due to the experiences local residents had with a small group of the travellers living on that site, everyone in the area is opposed to accommodating them in their communities.</P>
    <P>Any local community required to accommodate a halting site or traveller families in the future must know in advance that a workable and sustainable support system will be put in place.  I do not believe that this is impossible to achieve, but it is vital that the State be seen to support communities where halting sites are situated.  A high level of maintenance and input will be required on such sites for a number of years.  Like Deputy Morley, I have a difficulty with the nomadic lifestyle outlined in the report.  I agree with the minority report <Col N="2128" /> in this regard.  I also have grave concerns about the suitability of caravans as long-term accommodation for families.</P>
    <P>They are quite unsuitable.  The provision of £200 million for transient sites should be the final step.  There is much work to be carried out before that stage is reached.  The right to travel may have to be connected to an agreement that the local authority area being visited will be notified in advance to enable it to provide some kind of accommodation. An accommodation agency is mentioned in the report.  At first glance this seems superfluous, but there may be a role for it.  The report does not go into this matter in great detail, however, and I did not obtain a sense that there is a need for such an agency.</P>
    <P>The number of families &mdash; 1,000 &mdash; living on the roadside is much larger than I thought.  This problem must be addressed in the near future on an ongoing basis.  One of the reasons that there is such a lack of success is that local authorities are caught in no man's land between the Department and local communities.  In that regard, the establishment of the interdepartmental working group, which may be able to address the problem, will be very helpful.  The travelling community is also referred to in the social housing document.  There is a need to increase the pace suggested in that document, because this issue must be dealt with quickly.  The document also fails to address the fact that local authorities have been more or less abandoned.</P>
    <P>The report makes 167 recommendations on education which generally are very good.  From my experience in teaching, it is most beneficial that itinerant families live in one community and have their children attend the school there.  This provides an element of continuity in their education.  The transient lifestyle militates strongly against this. We must utilise the resourcefulness of travellers and encourage them to play an active role in their economy and the economy in general.  Some travellers have achieved this with enormous success. The most disturbing element of the <Col N="2129" /> report is the health analysis.  It is clear, from the low level of immunisation of children and women's health issues outlined in the report, that fundamental rights have been denied.  I strongly support the 33 recommendations relating to health.  The positive role played by many traveller women is somewhat understated.  In my opinion, they perform heroics in very difficult circumstances. They are a key element to future progress in the area of traveller support and housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I compliment the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for initially setting up the task force; the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, the first chairperson of the task force; and Senator Mary Kelly who took over the position of chairperson from Deputy McManus and brought this report to fruition.  I thank in particular the representatives of all the groups who made submissions to the task force including members of the travelling and settled communities as well as voluntary organisations who willingly gave their time and energy during the preparation of the report.</P>
      <P>It is true that the vast majority of the settled community are appalled at the prospect of a halting site being located near their homes.  The arrival of a group of travellers in an area usually provokes panic among the community and a flurry of telephone calls to the local public representative to have them removed.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for this attitude is the investment people make in their homes and the sacrifices they believe they have made in providing a good home for themselves and their families. That is a clear indication of the extent of the problem that must be addressed at national and local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This comprehensive report deals with a number of issues including the relationship between travellers and the <Col N="2130" /> settled community, the culture of travellers, discrimination, accommodation, health and access to health services, education and training, the traveller economy, traveller women, travellers with disabilities, the need for a co-ordination of services by the statutory bodies and the whole area of sport, recreation, culture and the arts for travellers.</P>
    <P>This report is the most comprehensive examination of the travelling community ever carried out in the history of the State.  That is extraordinary given the number of reports that have been published in that time.  The settlement of travellers is a thorny issue.  Most Christian people believe the traveller issue must be resolved but they do not want travellers living near them.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority since 1983, originally Dublin County Council and, since 1994, Fingal County Council.  In that period the council has endeavoured to put in place a number of plans to deal with the ever increasing problem of the settlement of travellers.  On 10 April 1984 Dublin County Council approved the provision of 14 sites for the accommodation of traveller families in the county.  There were 109 traveller families living in Fingal at that time and each site was designed to accommodate a maximum number of ten families.</P>
    <P>The council was informed at that time that one of the benefits of building sites which could accommodate ten families was that a caretaker <i>in situ</i> would be provided.  I will refer later to what I believe to be the most appropriate site for accommodating travellers.</P>
    <P>Following the local elections, that programme was replaced in March 1986 by a new proposal to construct two sites, each to accommodate not more than five families in each electoral area.  It was felt that every area should accommodate its fair share of traveller families.</P>
    <P>Arising from a report which highlighted the increase in the number of traveller families in County Dublin, a revised programme was adopted in <Col N="2131" /> 1992.  That decision was made following a great deal of controversy in the general areas of Blanchardstown and Mulhuddart where traveller families had located themselves on private property, roadsides, access roads to industrial estates and sites identified for a town centre.  That controversy arose for the simple reason that there were no official halting sites in these areas.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council decided to put in place a temporary halting site in Mulhuddart to accommodate approximately 140 families.  Can anyone envisage a halting site accommodating 140 families?  I regarded it as a type of corral and I was totally opposed to the proposal. That case eventually ended up in the courts.</P>
    <P>There were two sides to this problem. The traveller families had to be accommodated but the people living in these areas did not understand why they should be required to resolve the problem. I use the word &ldquo;problem&rdquo; because that was the term used at the time.  A new programme was put in place to provide accommodation for up to two families per site.  By 1992 the number of traveller families in Fingal has increased to 134.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that progress was made in regard to dealing with this issue.  In 1995 approximately 194 traveller families lived in the Fingal area according to the official census taken on 22 November 1994.  On the basis of those figures, a new plan was drawn up by the council and it was agreed to set up subcommittees in each area.  This was a new approach to the problem.  Instead of the council making an overall decision, each electoral area was required to provide two to three additional halting sites or group housing sites.</P>
    <P>The report on the plan, which was presented only last week, had been approved by the council but since then there has been a great deal of opposition to it.  It was decided, therefore, <Col N="2132" /> that if more suitable sites can be identified, the plan may be changed before July of this year.</P>
    <P>That is an outline of the efforts made by Fingal County Council to accommodate travellers.  In November 1995 there were 19 families in standard housing, ten in group housing and permanent halting sites, 103 in temporary halting sites and 68 in unauthorised halting sites, an increase of 39 per cent from 1993 to 1995.  This is a further indication of the problem as traveller families move towards the greater Dublin area which can be viewed in the context of a report in a recent edition of the <i>Evening Herald</i> stating that in the Fingal area there were 68 families; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown 30 families; south Dublin 71 families; and in Dublin Corporation 74 families, all on unofficial sites.  This is an indication of the extent of the problem. On the basis of this report how do we propose to deal with it?</P>
    <P>I suspect, from listening to other councillors who are sympathetic in their endeavours to resolve the problem, that they are becoming disillusioned.  I doubt if any proposal for a halting site or a group housing scheme has ever been acceptable to the local communities, irrespective of the distance from the settled community.  The ESRI report of July 1986 states:</P>
    <P>The Irish travellers are caught up in a vicious circle.  The more squalid and unsanitary their living conditions the more despised and outcast they become.  The more unpopular they are the fewer services are provided for them by the community and they are pressurised to move off.  The fewer services that are provided the worse the living conditions become.</P>
    <P>The relevant issues are the numbers of children, their health and the health of the mother.  I am pleased that under the task force plan every local authority, not just those in Dublin, has to prepare and accept a five year plan to accommodate travellers in their county area.  On the basis of the recent figures Dublin local authorities are of the opinion that <Col N="2133" /> this is a deliberate ploy by other councils throughout the country not to meet their obligations and to pass them on to Dublin.  Having listened to some of my colleagues this afternoon I realise and appreciate they have their problems too.  This will be an ongoing problem and difficult to resolve.</P>
    <P>The settlement of travellers is the most emotive issue discussed at local level throughout the length and breadth of the country.  With the minimum of notice literally hundreds of people will cram various community halls to oppose any proposed site.  The anger boils over on any person, politician or otherwise, who makes a case in favour of travellers. Councillors who voted for sites a fortnight ago are now saying they are totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>If this issue is to be successfully resolved it will require a commitment by the settled community and the travellers themselves.  The travellers will also have to take on board the views of settled communities.  We are all aware of the difficulties in any estate.  There is no perfect estate anywhere.  There are problem people and people whose children may have been involved in robberies or fights and that is accepted.  There is a perception that certain groups of travellers have to adhere to the standard lifestyle.  The addendum to the report states that Government policy should include consideration of alternatives to the nomadic way of life in view of:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the disadvantage of the current lifestyle of the traveller community;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the changing pattern of work opportunities available to the traveller community;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the increasing conflict with the settled community which arises mainly from the consequences of the nomadic lifestyle;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the inordinate cost to the Exchequer of catering for this way of life.</P>
    <P>These are issues the travellers will have <Col N="2134" /> to address.  They must have the support of the social services, the Government, the Departments and the local authorities but they will also have to acknowledge the particular problem that has to be resolved by the settled community and themselves.</P>
    <P>Funding for the construction of halting sites is met in full by the Exchequer but there is a major problem in relation to maintenance.  People looking at unofficial sites see litter, cars and so on and ask if that is what will be in their communities. To date no funding has come from central Government for maintenance purposes.  The report of the task force recommends that 75 per cent of funding would come from central Government but I would like to see 90 per cent of the funding coming from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The powers will need to be strengthened to prevent other travellers congregating beside official halting sites. People in official halting sites do an excellent job and try to portray a good image.</P>
    <P>To show we are moving in the right direction, in Moyne Road, Portmarnock, a permanent halting site for ten traveller families was opened recently by Fingal County Council.  It provides all the mod-cons with each bay containing a service block with the normal family requirements of a toilet, shower, electricity, heating, washing machine, sink, a patio area and a space for two caravans for each family.  The local community welcomed the halting site; the parish newsletter said it looked very well and suggested people go to see it. Members of the settled community should visit the modern halting sites to see the efforts made.</P>
    <P>I compliment the task force.  Much work remains to be done but, I hope the settled community and the travelling community can benefit from this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a good country in which to speak one's mind because one, may be accused of making inflammatory or misleading statements.  It is time we became adult in our outlook <Col N="2135" /> rather than deliberately misleading. This is a major problem.  One can have as many abstract solutions as one wishes but unless people express their views clearly and honestly there is no hope of solving this difficult problem.</P>
      <P>There were not any problems with travellers in County Waterford until about 15 years ago.  In a report on the travelling community published around 1980, County Waterford was referred to as being extraordinary in that there were no problems because there were no travellers in the county.  There was one travelling family but its roots were in the settled community.  Indeed, the remainder of that family is still in Waterford.</P>
      <P>However, the problems have arisen in the past 15 years and culminated in an extraordinary statement by a county councillor a couple of months ago which was born out of frustration.  It reflected a point of view held by a considerable number of people in the community, particularly in rural areas, because of the activities of a minority of travellers. It is unfortunate but it is the case.</P>
      <P>From time to time I asked questions in the House which I felt were pertinent and attempted to help solve the problem. However, I have been criticised for asking them.  I asked about the number of traveller families in the country in 1960, 1975 and now &mdash; a period of over 30 years.  There were about 1,000 traveller families in 1960, about 1,700 in 1975 and more than 3,000 in 1991, the latest year for which figures were available. There has been a considerable increase which has brought with it an increase in the number of problems.  There has not been an honest or adequate attempt to solve the problems created by this threefold increase over 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just the number of families but the size of those families that causes problems.  One could attempt to solve the problem with better educational facilities and birth control.  Many people in the travelling community would not be aware of birth control devices and methods.  A group of unmarried <Col N="2136" /> mothers appeared on the Pat Kenny radio programme last week and some of them admitted they knew little about contraception when they become pregnant. The situation could be improved with education on birth control which would be simple and laudable.  I know some traveller families which have as many as 12 or 13 children.</P>
    <P>In another 30 years time there will be another tripling of the number of families and that will create even greater problems.  People should take a logical overview of the situation with a view to solving it.  It will not be easily solved but we should size up the problem to see how it should be solved.</P>
    <P>The task force report advocates the provision of more halting sites but I do not believe that is a solution.  The solution is the rehousing of travellers in permanent homes.  However, we cannot build huge estates for traveller families; they will have to be assimilated into settled communities.  In rural areas single or double houses will have to be built for them.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 years two disastrous halting sites were built in my constituency. There are a number of travelling families who are excellent, well behaved people.  However, the transient traveller family is likely to be troublesome.  I was approached recently by a traveller with a family of eight who has been living on a halting site outside Dungarvan for the past eight years.  He was happy there until two years ago when the urban council increased the number of bays in the halting site from seven to 11.  When the existence of extra bays became known the number of families who came to the halting site increased greatly.  On some days there were as many as 20 or 25 families being accommodated in a site with space for 11 families. One can imagine the disturbance, filth and vandalism to which the overcrowding gave rise.</P>
    <P>This man told me that after eight years at the halting site he was going back on the road.  He felt he would be happier camping on the grass margins of <Col N="2137" /> roads rather than living in the atmosphere he had to endure at the site because of the disturbance caused by the transient families.</P>
    <P>Halting sites should have a fixed number of bays which should be strictly controlled. Many problems derive from sites becoming grossly overcrowded and unkempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing aims of Rural Resettlement Ireland have my full support. Since 1992, my Department has approved grants totalling £215,000 towards the administrative and general <Col N="2138" /> expenses of RRI in respect of its housing related activities, including £60,000 this year.  RRI has also been granted approved body status for the purposes of the voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes.</P>
    <P>Households moving under the RRI programme may be eligible for local authority house purchase loans or shared ownership, and the deposit requirement under the latter scheme has been eased in these cases.  In addition, the mortgage allowance and improvement works-in-lieu schemes can be used to assist families wishing to resettle in a rural area.  The mortgage allowance scheme is already available to persons surrendering a local authority dwelling and I have no proposals for an additional `surrender' grant.</P>
    <P>As there are considerable reservations about the viability and practical operation of a revolving fund, I have no proposals for the introduction of such a fund for the purchase of houses by RRI. However, agreement, in principle, has recently been reached with the Bank of Ireland, the Housing Finance Agency and RRI on a new pilot house purchase loan scheme which will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging that the Department approved grants totalling £215,000 towards the administrative and general expenses of Rural Resettlement Ireland, I am sure the Minister of State will accept that the organisation had to fund the balance of more than £100,000.  Some of its members travelled to America to raise that funding.  I am somewhat disappointed with the Minister's reply.  My question referred to the operation of a revolving fund and a surrender grant scheme, neither of which the Minister of State agreed to implement.  Will she reconsider her decision?  The surrender grant scheme would benefit not only the rural resettlement programme but would help create vacancies in urban areas, particularly in Dublin.  Is the Minister of State aware that Dublin Corporation, and I am sure other local <Col N="2139" /> authorities, spend up to £60,000 buying houses on the open market?  Does she believe a surrender grant scheme would assist the rural resettlement organisation and local authorities to create badly needed house vacancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>A special arrangement, involving a £1,000 deposit, has been entered into for the shared ownership scheme and the rural resettlement programme which will enable people make the move.  In the past surrender grant schemes caused great upheaval in local authority estates.  The current policy is to encompass acquisition with new build and this is working satisfactorily. Genuine difficulties would arise in operating a revolving fund scheme. While I appreciate the Deputy is committed to the principle of rural resettlement, to get involved in property acquisition one requires certain skills, resources and income.  Some families making the move might not be able to afford the cost of acquisition and house improvement.  Many considerations, such as capital acquisition tax and the tax status of Rural Resettlement Ireland, have not been fully examined. However, a new pilot house purchase loan scheme has been successfully negotiated between the Bank of Ireland, the Housing Finance Agency and Rural Resettlement Ireland. If this scheme is satisfactory it should be expanded.  It is a novel arrangement between the organisations concerned and I compliment Rural Resettlement Ireland for embarking on the project.  I hope to announce the scheme shortly because people have been waiting for some time for a loan scheme to come into operation. The Deputy should acknowledge that improvement which will assist people who embark on this welcome programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new house purchase loan scheme but I am sure the Minister will accept that Rural Resettlement Ireland will have to produce £6,000 or £7,000 for each <Col N="2140" /> house.  While the 1980's surrender grant scheme was not very popular &mdash; we are all aware of its shortcomings &mdash; I am talking about a targeted scheme which could provide the seed funding for the rural resettlement group when the new scheme gets off the ground.  One can always suggest reasons for not doing something, but I have put forward positive proposals for proceeding with a surrender grant scheme.  Will the Minister of State reconsider my question prior to making her announcement about the new house purchase loan scheme? Members of Rural Resettlement Ireland cannot visit America every few weeks to raise £6,000.  A surrender grant scheme would complement the new scheme which is to be announced shortly.  What Department has responsibility for the problem of depopulation in rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important question.  Rural resettlement involves much more than the question of housing, many other rural renewal factors must be taken into account.  The Department of the Taoiseach has a major role to play in regard to the broader question of rural resettlement. Much of the responsibility in that regard is outside the brief of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy must recognise that two significant changes &mdash; one of which has already been made and the other is about to be made &mdash; have been proposed for providing loans for house purchases. The loan scheme was devised in consultation with Rural Resettlement Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>From where does the £6,000 come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme was spearheaded as a response to the demands of Rural Resettlement Ireland.  Obviously, a number of factors must be considered. Rural Resettlement Ireland has operated successfully to date and we have assisted them to a considerable extent. In 1992 it received only £10,000 in grant aid whereas in 1996 it received £60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2141" /> Therefore, grant aid for administrative purposes has increased significantly. This important loan scheme involves Rural Resettlement Ireland and, to a greater extent, the Housing Finance Agency and the banks.  It is an important step forward and one we should all welcome.  I acknowledge the Deputy's welcome for the scheme, which is the way forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The Ministerial Group on Sellafield and the Irish Sea was established by the Government to co-ordinate and monitor measures in pursuit of commitments in the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which are the responsibility of a number of different Departments. The group is chaired by the Minister for the Environment and has representatives at Minister of State level from the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications, Foreign Affairs, the Marine and the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senior officials from these Departments and the Department of the Environment attend the meetings, as do senior representatives of the Attorney <Col N="2142" /> General's office, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The ministerial group has met on three occasions under the chairmanship of the Minister for the Environment and will continue to meet, as necessary, to monitor work which is being actively pursued by the Departments concerned on matters coming within the supervisory role of the group.  These matters include the safety of the British nuclear industry generally and of Sellafield, the THORP reprocessing plant and magnox reactors in particular.  The Government is concerned about the safety record of these installations and the continuing threat they pose to the health and safety of Irish people and our environment. Magnox reactors are operating beyond their design life and the Government has called on the UK authorities to arrange for their early de-commissioning; opposition to the proposed development of a rock characterisation facility at Sellafield, preliminary to the construction by NIREX of an underground nuclear waste storage facility.</P>
    <P>Last January the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications made a submission on behalf of the Government to the public inquiry in the UK which is investigating the proposed facility.  The submission outlined the Government's concerns and called on the inquiry to recommend against the NIREX proposal; a further assessment of the possibilities for legal action against the Sellafield-THORP facilities.  This is being conducted by the Attorney General in co-operation with the other Departments concerned.  Consideration is being given to the scope for action under the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from land-based sources and the more recent OSPAR Convention which Ireland will ratify this year.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sustainable case for it can be shown to exist based on sufficient evidence of environmental or public health impact; the possibility of a review and update of the <Col N="2143" /> Euratom Treaty to place greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects.  The Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the other Departments represented on the ministerial group, are currently preparing proposals for appropriate amendments to the Treaty; an initiative taken by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, within the International Maritime Organisation, seeking to strengthen the code of practice governing the carriage by sea of irradiated nuclear fuels.  An Irish resolution seeking to have matters covered by the present code extended so as to cater for route planning, advance notification of shipments to coastal states, contingency arrangements in the event of emergencies and other appropriate considerations was accepted by the IMO and is being addressed by that organisation's marine safety and marine environmental protection committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the changes made by the Department of the Marine. Considering the emphasis on the Irish Sea and Sellafield in the programme for Government, is the Minister happy that the committee has met on only three occasions in the last 18 months?  She said that the group is monitoring work. I would like to know what work is involved.  There is a lot of padding in the Minister's reply.  What is the legal opinion which has been sought for the last 18 months?  There seems to be no real action and the matter does not seem to be a priority for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.  The amount of work outlined is considerable.  I can expand on the work carried out by the various Departments if the Deputy wishes.  There has been great co-operation and co-ordination in terms of the various aspects in the Government programme for renewal and the work is being monitored by the committee.  The Deputy does not <Col N="2144" /> appreciate that the function of the committee is to ensure co-ordination of work carried out at departmental level. The programme of work is agreed and is being carried out.  Achievements have been made, one of which was referred to by the Deputy relating to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, who made a major change in policy at the International Marine Organisation conference.</P>
      <P>There are other areas in which work is proceeding &mdash; for example, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has contacted the UK Minister to outline the deep concerns of the Government about the inadequacy of safety measures.  The Minister of State at that Department presented a well thought-out submission on the proposal for the underground facility.  The fact that the committee ensures that each Department works within its own area of responsibility and acts effectively in terms of co-ordination is an indication that it is working.  More has been done in the past 18 months than in the past 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely disagree with the Minister's last statement.  She did not answer my question relating to legal opinion.  I welcome the fact that a submission was put forward and change was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, but very little work is being done.  The Minister said that a Minister contacted his counterpart in England, but there is very little emphasis and follow through on this matter. As an Opposition party we objected through one of our MEPs before the Minister contacted the UK Minister. Local authorities along the east coast also object at various levels.  When the Government was formed there was great emphasis by various Ministers on what they would do, but very little has been done.  When will the legal opinion be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Opposition, a co-ordinated interdepartmental approach is being adopted <Col N="2145" /> by the Government to this issue, which is of significant importance, and that has proved to be effective.  Nobody under-estimates the difficulties involved.  I welcome the Deputy's acknowledgement of the work done by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and other Ministers.  The legal advice will be available when it is ready.  Much assessment is being carried out.  The options under consideration include possible recourse to arbitration under the existing Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from land-based sources and there is scope for action under the most recent OSPAR convention, which Ireland will ratify later this year.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent statement by a Teagasc farm environment adviser that Ireland's rivers are threatened with an environmental timebomb in view of heavy rainfall boosting silage effluent to an alarming level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12273/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Silage making, if not carried out in accordance with good farm practice, can entail risks to river water quality.  Much work has been done in recent years to promote understanding of these risks in the farming community and to establish suitable arrangements for prevention.  Local authorities and the agricultural advisory agencies have carried out extensive farm inspections.  Initiatives to promote environmental awareness by a range of agencies, including farmer representative associations, have also given important assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been substantial investment in recent years by farmers, with EU and State support, in installing and upgrading storage facilities for silage and the management of farm wastes. This is reflected in the general reduction in the number of fish kills attributed to agriculture since 1987 when the sector <Col N="2146" /> accounted for 85 incidents out of a total of 122.  In 1995, agriculture was directly responsible for 19 fish kills, including ten caused by silage effluent, from the total of 85 recorded.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are regularly reminded by my Department of the need for intensive efforts at pollution prevention, and extensive powers are available to them under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, for this purpose.  Earlier this week, the Minister issued a statement calling for greater vigilance on the part of all concerned with the handling and disposal of wastes of different kinds to safeguard against water pollution during the sensitive summer period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Sadly, there was a major fish kill on the river Lee this morning &mdash; hundreds of young salmon and trout died as a result of a slurry run-off.  What steps will the Minister take to ensure that the culprit in this case is prosecuted? The text of my question mentions that, three weeks ago, a senior Teagasc farm environment adviser warned that Irish rivers were threatened with an environmental time bomb this year.  On foot of that warning, what specific measures did the Department authorise to avert a summer of frequent fish kills this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's regret and deep concern about the fish kill in Cork, which is a serious matter.  I have been in contact with the local authority, I understand it has already embarked on a certain amount of remedial work and is considering further action.  I have also asked it for a full report of its deliberations.  The Minister underlined the importance of constant vigilance when issuing a statement which pointed out the negative effect of carelessness and irresponsible acts.  A small number of people can often have a major impact on the environmental life of our rivers and lakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have considerable powers to take legal action and send out notices if they think there is a risk or threat of damage to lakes or rivers.  In relation to Deputy Dempsey's interjection, it is important to point out that queries about the REPS relate to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, not the Department of the Environment.

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some improvement in the overall status in recent years but that should not give grounds for complacency.  What happened yesterday is an indication of how irresponsible people can cause havoc.  In this instance I understand the local <Col N="2148" /> authority acted swiftly but it serves as a warning, first, that people should be vigilant about the dangers and second, that irresponsible people cannot continue to dispose of waste in a fashion which affects rivers and lakes without running the risk of paying the price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to provide the Deputy with follow-up information.  It is worth nothing there was a series of fish kills last year and that the unusual weather conditions and low water levels added considerably to the problem.  This is one reason the Minister again took the initiative to warn people of the need for constant vigilance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;however, one must be conscious that the Minister made his statement to alert people that vigilance was needed, to reinforce the message that the law and controls are in place and that local authorities have powers, not just to take action when an offence is being committed but also when there is a risk or threat of danger. That is an important point because we must all support local authorities in <Col N="2149" /> their work and they have powers which they can invoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has assured us the law is in place.  Why is it not implemented effectively?  If it were, one would imagine there would be a reduction in the number of fish kills.  Is the policing mechanism not sufficiently well resourced, or is there another reason? If the Minister for the Environment does not know the answer, the Department stands accused of gross complacency in the face of what has happened to our rivers and freshwater lakes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have a range of statutory powers available to them under housing legislation in relation to <Col N="2151" /> the management of their dwellings.  It is the responsibility of each authority, as part of its housing management operations, to take the steps it considers necessary to deal with tenants involved in anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Dwellings are let by housing authorities subject to the terms of letting agreements drawn up by the authorities in accordance with the Housing Regulations, 1980.  The agreements must, under article 83 of the regulations, include a condition that a tenant shall not cause any nuisance or be guilty of, or permit, any conduct likely to cause annoyance or disturbance to neighbours. Adequate legal powers are available to the authorities to take action where there is a breach of a letting agreement.</P>
    <P>Legislation, which is kept under review in consultation with local authorities, is only part of the solution to anti-social behaviour.  Equally important is the management of their estates by local authorities.  That is why a range of initiatives and incentives have been introduced by my Department to assist them to improve their performance in this crucial area.</P>
    <P>While good estate management practices by local authorities have an important role to play in overcoming anti-social behaviour in housing estates, including drug-related issues, incidents of this nature are primarily a matter for the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has again attempted to place the onus for this issue on local authorities.  Has she made regulations on the management and control of local authority houses under section 58 of the 1966 Act to prohibit people engaged in drug dealing from becoming tenants and to allow local authorities to evict such people?  The Minister has specific power under this section to make these regulations mandatory on local authorities and will she do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have <Col N="2152" /> power to invoke the provisions of an encompassing section which states that the tenant shall not cause any nuisance or be guilty of or permit any conduct likely to cause annoyance or disturbance to his neighbours.  That is a broad description of the reasons action can be taken by local authorities to deal with tenants.  In Dublin Corporation. cases which have been taken against people guilty of anti-social behaviour have been successful, while other local authorities are developing similar approaches to deal with the drug problem.</P>
      <P>I take very seriously the proper management of housing estates.  A housing management group is working on this issue and will report to me shortly.  I have also embarked on a series of estate management programmes on a pilot basis.  I am committed to the principle of the good management of estates which is part of the solution to dealing with anti-social behaviour of whatever type.  However, I am under no illusions about how difficult it is to deal with this problem or about the need for integrated action in conjunction with the Garda.  My Department and the Department of Justice are represented on the national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea. This integrated approach has been developed by the Government in recognition of the seriousness of the problem of drug abuse.  I will continue to develop good estate management and good management of tenancies in an effort to combat this real problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that she will not take action under section 58 of the 1966 Act.  Will she take action under section 111 of the Act which allows her to intervene in cases where local authorities are not taking action? With one or two notable exceptions, it is clear that local authorities are not taking action in this area. The Minister could send out a strong signal to local communities and law <Col N="2153" /> abiding residents of estates if she intervened under section 111 of the 1966 Act.</P>

      <P>I take this issue so seriously that I set up a group of senior people, including county managers, public representatives and senior officials in my Department, to look at it. Intervention by me on a case by case basis would not serve any worthwhile purpose.  What is required is good estate management by local authorities who would work in partnership with residents. That is the most effective bulwark we can erect against drug abuse and crime in local authority estates.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of dealing with this problem or believe there are instant solutions to it.  We must build a partnership between residents and local authorities so that estates are effectively managed.  I am doing this speedily when one considers that I have not yet received the report of the group who engaged in wide-ranging consultations with the various bodies involved in the development of good estate management.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's deep concern and sense of frustration about this issue.  Drugs are a problem not only in Dublin and Cork but in most areas.  I am concentrating considerable effort in dealing with it and am interested in cases where proper estate management has produced results.  In the Ard Bhaile estate in Cork good management is delivering commendable results.  I share the Deputy's concerns but I do not want to leap ahead of the work being done.  It is a question of learning what action works. I am not looking for glib answers to the problem as the solution is not an easy one.  However, it is important to build partnership between local authorities and tenants on the basis of good management and to ensure that local authorities use their powers where necessary and set up and finish tenancies properly and with full information.  I support the approach taken by Dublin Corporation which is the key to the way forward.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy will submit particular views or points to me, I will consider them very seriously.  We have taken many submissions to the housing management group, which first arose when we presented our Estimates to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  I ask that anybody with views on this issue submit them to me.  I advertised in the media asking that submissions be sent to my Department.  I do not think the Deputy submitted any at that time but I will welcome his doing so now if he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that her Department must give local authorities the requisite tools to undertake the task?  When she speaks of a partnership with residents and tenants, does she agree that the message needs to be conveyed to these people that we are serious and will take a tough line? While holding out carrots may be fine, there is need for using a little more stick.  The Minister also spoke about the powers of local authorities which, while appearing broad on paper, are proving almost impossible of enforcement in the courts.  Surely the Minister must recognise that rules and the law must be changed, that she cannot expect people to give evidence in court against their neighbours.  She must recognise that it does not work like that.  There is much fear and intimidation involved.  Would the Minister please devise some new powers to enable a county manager or whoever to go into court and say he believes the tenant in such and such a house is a drugs dealer?  He should not have to bring 20 neighbours into court to prove they had seen him selling drugs on the street.  If the Minister will vest more powers in local authorities, she will get greater co-operation in this partnership about which she speaks.</P>
      <P>When we finally evict the few people we want evicted, will the Minister of State make representations to her party leader to ensure that those evicted cannot then apply to their local health clinic and obtain a weekly rent allowance of a couple of hundred pounds to rent a house in a private area?  We must take cognisance of the fact that we are giving the wrong message.  Will the Minister adopt a tough line and do something constructive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have already embarked on the process of transferring the administration of social welfare allowances to local authorities.  This is quite a complex move which will take some time.  It is a very important one because it will overcome the difficulty he mentioned, that of two different Departments dealing with what is essentially a housing provision. The Government's commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> is significant in regard to housing.  When that transfer occurs, local authorities will determine all the various options in relation to housing provision, including rent allowances.</P>

      <P>While on the surface it might not appear so, I can assure the Deputy it is complex.  It will have a significant beneficial impact on local authorities, streamlining overall housing provision, whether local authority or other, right across the housing spectrum, including for the first time rent allowances.  I want to ensure it is done properly.  There are many dimensions to this question but at the end of the day this transfer will ensure that rent allowances are administered by local authorities, where they belong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers available to Dublin Corporation and local authorities generally are slow, cumbersome and yield little or no success.  There has been only one eviction from a notorious <Col N="2157" /> flats complex, involving drugs.  The person evicted was rehoused immediately by the Eastern Health Board around the corner.  That is the reality and is a totally ineffective response to the drugs problem being experienced in inner city flat complexes.  Does the Minister agree that a more immediate, urgent response is warranted on the part of her Department? Have there not been numerous discussions between departmental and Dublin Corporation officials on this issue? Is it not the case that, whenever a private landlord seeks the eviction of a tenant who is not protected, he experiences no difficulty whatever in securing that eviction but whenever a local authority such as Dublin Corporation seeks to get rid of a problem tenant or drugs dealer for very good, social reasons, it is at the mercy of the courts and, in many instances, fails to secure such evictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Eviction proceedings are taken in court, whether involving a private landlord or local authority.  The housing management group is discussing this and other related questions with regard to estate management.  We could get totally hung up on this aspect and not examine all the various elements involved in combating this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot comment on the particular incident to which the Deputy referred. I was responsible for having initiated a co-ordinated strategy on homelessness between the Eastern Health Board, Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities in the greater Dublin area, something to which I can rightly refer whenever there is a breakdown of liaison between the health board and Dublin Corporation.  If he wishes, the Deputy can let me have details of that incident.  In regard to emergency accommodation, the problem until I took that initiative was that of a constant gap between two statutory authorities, recognised by those authorities as well as by the voluntary sector.  For the first time, we now have a proper, co-ordinated approach.  An administrator is about to be engaged to co-ordinate <Col N="2158" /> these services.  That is the appropriate arena within which to raise the Deputy's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Increased car numbers of the order indicated, with significant reductions in air pollution from stationary sources, make road traffic a relatively greater contributor to air pollution in Ireland than in the past.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency report on the state of the environment in Ireland identifies road traffic as potentially the most serious source of air pollution, especially in urban areas.  The agency predicts that vehicle emissions will continue to increase over the next five years before corrective measures, such as the compulsory fitting of catalytic converters to new cars, begin to bring about significant reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 109 of 28 May 1996, national policy in relation to CO 2 abatement recognises the likelihood of continued increases in CO 2 emissions from transport in the medium term and that measures in this <Col N="2160" /> area will play a key role in containing overall emissions.  Important measures in this context include: implementation of the Dublin Transportation Initiative; improvement of public transport infrastructure; extension of vehicle testing requirements; and support by Ireland for EU measures to reduce CO 2 emissions from vehicles.</P>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Transport, 25 per cent of total investment will be directed at the improvement of public transport infrastructure. Particular emphasis is being placed on the improvement of public transport in the greater Dublin area as the largest urban centre and the area offering the greatest potential for alternatives to road-based transport.  Compared with a &ldquo;do minimum&rdquo; approach, implementation of the DTI recommended strategy is projected to secure a 5 per cent reduction in CO 2 emissions by 2001 and an 11 per cent reduction by 2011.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming national sustainable development strategy will address sustainable transport in the context of providing a framework of objectives and policies for achieving sustainability in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Will he indicate the plans in place or in preparation to evaluate the impact of an increase in the volume of traffic of 5 per cent per year and 20 per cent during the past five years?  Are plans in place to evaluate that impact other than those indicated by the Minister of State?  Will he agree that the significance of the statement in the Environmental Protection Agency report on the state of the environment supports the urgent introduction of MOT testing which appears to have been postponed until after the next general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we can introduce measures to solve the problem, we must quantify it and I will outline the extent of the problem.  The transport sector is <Col N="2161" /> the largest consumer of energy, accounting for 31 per cent of total consumption. The increased demand for transport infrastructure to cater for the larger number of vehicles has had a major impact on other land uses, including landscapes, habitats and biodiversity. Traffic congestion in urban areas will result not only in increased air pollution in terms of CO 2 emissions and other pollutants, but in a higher level of noise pollution.  The disposal of an increased number of old cars will give rise to problems concerning batteries, tyres and metal.  Another problem is the risk to human life posed by more congested roads.</P>
      <P>Those problems may be tackled by complying with the European Union directives.  Ireland supported the development of a future strategy.  The Commission is expected to propose new directives shortly.  If they are introduced in the lifetime of our Presidency, in line with our commitment, we will implement as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>A directive providing for car testing has been in place since 1991 and if it must be complied with by 1998, some 700,000 cars over four years old will require emission checks.  That is the scale of the problem and the Government is considering this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that information.  The acceptable limit of CO 2 emissions was nearly exceeded on two occasions in College Street in the city centre.  The lower guideline values were exceeded every year for the past number of years in College Street.  I accept that the Minister of State may not have information on that area, but will he indicate if plans are in place or under preparation to tackle specific problems, like that one, while the bigger plan is under consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years work in the laboratories operating under the local authorities has increased and I am sure Dublin is no exception.  Dublin Corporation, the local authority responsible for <Col N="2162" /> Dublin city, monitors air quality daily. Identifying the levels of pollutants is one issue, but tackling air pollution is more important and difficult.  I outlined the proposals Ireland intends to implement in the years ahead to deal with the level of pollutants.</P>

I presume that the new consultation procedures proposed for major industrial developments, such as those promised during the week for the Dublin light rail system, will also apply to other important recommendations of the DTI, such as Dublin Port tunnel?

Does the Government have any plan to curtail emissions from buses? The least the State could do is to set a good example in terms of its transport fleet.

      <P>State grants for non-national roads in 1996 amount to £146.86 million, which represents an increase of nearly 40 per cent on the base provision for 1995.</P>
      <P>When the restoration programme for non-national roads was initiated last July, an additional £20 million was provided to fund it in 1995.  That special provision has been repeated in 1996, and an additional £20 million has been added.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth pointing out to the Deputy the position in Cavan County Council as regards non-national road grant payments, excluding the LIS payments.  For example, the 1987 figure of £1.366 million was increased to £5.947 million by 1996, which represents a major improvement.  Under the 1995 restoration programme Cavan County Council improved or restored 39 kilometres of regional and local roads under 27 schemes.  However, the following is the estimate for 1996: more than 300 kilometres of regional and local roads, involving almost 140 schemes, will be improved or restored using restoration programme grants of £3.209 million. Work will be carried out on 10 per cent of the Cavan non-national road network this year.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's view given the long history of road problems in County Cavan which were brought about as a result of a lack of investment by previous Governments.  I do not think the Deputy can say that this Government is not living up to its obligations in this regard.  The commitment made is realised in real funding terms. We have a ten year programme but at this stage we do not know the total national cost.  Consultants have been employed to review the payment restoration programme and road works throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problem in County Cavan and the Government has made a serious commitment to solving it.  I can appreciate that this will never be enough from the point of view of a local Deputy, but even he should recognise that the Minister for the Environment has made a serious commitment to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>The 1982-87 Fine Gael-Labour Government did not give an allocation to Cavan County Council for non-national roads, and that is when the real deterioration set in.  Fortunately, successive Fianna Fáil Ministers from 1987-94 gave substantial increases each year.  The Exchequer allocation to Cavan County Council for 1996 for regional and county roads represents an increase of only 5 per cent on what was allocated by the former Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, during a two year period when public expenditure rose by more than 10 per cent.  We are not getting the level of increase we need.  Will the Minister give an assurance that she will favourably consider the allocation of a supplementary estimate to Cavan County Council to carry out repairs to roads that are impassable and are causing severe hardship to many communities?</P>

      <P>I give the Deputy full marks for representing his county, but he has to recognise the evidence. Additional works to those I mentioned will be carried out in 1996 by Cavan County Council using grants, other than restoration programme grants, together with its own resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there will have to be increased funding for county and regional roads as a result of the additional mileage that has been put in place with the assistance of Cohesion and Structural Funding and which will require maintenance?  Does she agree it is inevitable that the level of funding will need to be increased in order to maintain the roads?  In effect, we have to run to stand still in terms of maintaining the road infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that we cannot put a figure on the programme at this stage and that is why the study is being carried out.  Obviously, local authorities have a good idea of their needs but to work out the requirement on a national basis requires a full <Col N="2167" /> study.  While we may not have the final bill at the end of the day, the clear evidence is that we have increased the funding and the work is proceeding. The increase in the number of kilometres of road in County Cavan that will be improved this year represents a considerable improvement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 9, 13 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has already approved detailed proposals for comprehensive new legislation to deal with litter pollution.  Drafting of the Bill is proceeding urgently with a view to early publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Bill will contain a range of measures to improve the administration and enforcement of litter prevention and control.  Examples of intended new enforcement measures include a power for local authorities to impose special litter control requirements on the proprietors of specified classes of premises which are particularly associated with litter creation, and power to require organisers and promoters of major <Col N="2168" /> events to undertake litter management arrangements.</P>
    <P>The proposed new legislation represents an important element of the Action Against Litter initiative which is also directed at promoting public awareness and education, improving local authority performance, and establishing co-operation with the business and voluntary sectors to prevent and control litter.</P>
    <P>Information on the numbers of litter wardens employed by local authorities is set out in a table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The Government decided to bring in new legislation <Col N="2170" /> because the current legislation is deficient.  Is it not extraordinary that the Government should undertake a major PR campaign about litter when the legislation in place is deficient?  Is it not also extraordinary that, although it will publish a Bill, the Government does not know when?  Would it not be better to introduce the legislation and then have the PR campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary question.  I would have thought the Deputy would agree it should not be necessary to have penalties to ensure that people live up to their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>We all have a responsibility not to create litter.  It will be a sad day when we have to wait for legislation to be in force before anybody thinks a little about how irresponsible it is to throw litter around.  Every one of us can participate in reducing the problem of litter.  An awareness campaign can be extremely effective in educating the public about the problems litter creates and the cost &mdash; many people are not conscious of how high the cost is.  It is clear that people can play a major part in reducing litter without ever appearing in court if they simply think and act. Educating and making people aware of that responsibility is a critical part of the litter initiative.</P>

      <P>Litter is a problem in Ireland and new legislation is necessary to tackle it.  It is putting the cart before the horse to tackle it with a good PR campaign and not bring in legislation until later.  It makes no sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a public awareness element to this.  The general scheme of the legislation was approved by the Government in May 1996.  The Bill is being drafted in the parliamentary draftsman's office.  I do not know whether the Deputy wants me to outline the nature of the Bill but, if so I will be happy to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>What everybody in this Chamber wants is effective legislation. That is something we can ensure will be put in place.  As to the elements of it, it will lay down certain requirements of local authorities and give them powers that will be a major improvement.  The current Act is certainly not adequate to meet the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is simply denying that people make choices when it comes to whether they will add to the litter problem or be part of the solution. It is irresponsible of him to adopt that blinkered approach where he sees the solution simply in terms of introducing legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would fail in his duty if he simply waited for legislation to be produced and did not take the proactive approach that he has to ensure that people are fully aware of the real and serious cost to the Irish nation of the litter problem.  The fact that he has taken this initiative is a good thing and will help to reduce litter. When the legislation is in place that will also assist in the battle against litter and ensure that legislation is more appropriately geared to needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My question deals with enforcement.  I find it remarkable that we are engaging in a PR campaign <Col N="2172" /> before amending the legislation.  It would be much more effective if, as part of the PR campaign, we had the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister briefly outline what is contained in the legislation that will ensure its enforcement?  It is extraordinary that we have legislation in place, that 73 out of the 87 local authorities have no litter wardens, and there have been only 133 litter convictions in 1995. What enforcement measures will there be and how will they be financed?  Will it be left to the local authorities to put up the finance?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities will be required to prepare litter management plans.  These will represent strategies for litter prevention and control on a sustained basis and to a consistent level of performance.  A general policy role will be established for the Minister for the Environment in relation to litter control.  The Minister will also be required to issue guidelines on best practice to local authorities.  There will be provision to make organisers of major sporting and leisure events responsible for litter clean up, power to issue on-the-spot fines will be extended to the Garda Síochána, and litter wardens will be able to request assistance from the Garda.  Maximum fines will be raised to £1,500, and local authorities <Col N="2173" /> will be able to keep the proceeds as well as recovering the cost of instituting prosecutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to call for brief questions Deputies Quill, Ahern and Sargent, and to ask the Minister to answer the three questions together.  I ask for brevity in view of the fact that our time is exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said the publicity campaign, which is costing £0.4 million is proving effective.  What evidence does she have to demonstrate that it is proving effective?  I have not seen any evidence of litter reduction on the streets of any of the cities in which I live.  If she has evidence I would welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the new legislation will deal with the problem of dog droppings and irresponsible dog owners?  The Minister did not mention the number of wardens &mdash; Dublin city has two, one of whom is about to retire and will not be replaced because the legislation is useless.  Will the Minister of State accept that hundreds of litter wardens could be employed on a commission basis under the litter legislation?  This would have the effect of reducing the numbers on social welfare.  She made the comment that she supports the throwing of confetti. Lest she sent the wrong signal that she likes littering the streets, will she clarify her position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that legislation is required and long overdue?  Will she ensure that it will be more cost effective to prosecute those who infringe the legislation than to clean up?  It seems that currently it is more cost effective not to prosecute and that is the reason the number of prosecutions is low.  Will this change under the new legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that <Col N="2174" /> the advertising campaign, with the other measures, will be effective.  It is not possible to monitor its impact early on as it takes time for people to recognise the message they are being given.  It is part and parcel of the overall strategy upon which the Minister has embarked.</P>
      <P>On the issue of dog droppings, I cannot answer the question put because I do not know what the definition of &ldquo;litter&rdquo; is.  I do know, however, that one can buy biodegradable confetti.  I am a romantic at heart and believe it is possible to follow various customs without destroying the environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good day out for the mother-in-law.  There is scope for the appointment of more litter wardens. The Bill should be of help in that regard.  Litter wardens can be extremely effective.  Even allowing for the deficiencies, a good litter warden can make a real difference.  There are 22 full-time and 60 part-time litter wardens.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to Deputy Dempsey, the maximum fine will be increased to £1,500 and local authorities will be able to keep the proceeds as well as recover the costs of instituting proceedings. That will be to their benefit.  I accept the point that there has been a tendency in the past for local authorities to clean up rather than go to court.</P>

    <Title>Report of Task Force on Travelling Community: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was referring to a question I tabled two years ago relating to the number of travelling families.  In round figures there were 1,000 travelling families in 1961, 1,700 in 1974 and 4,000 in 1993.  Will the Minister take note of these figures? They are extremely illustrative and tell a tale &mdash; that the travelling community is growing at an enormous rate, way in excess of the rate for the settled community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing outrageous in stating that there is a need to place more <Col N="2248" /> emphasis on education and birth control. Too many people talk out of the side of their mouths on issues such as this.  We need to get our facts straight and objectives correct.  Many excellent and wonderful people are doing some tremendous work, either on a fixed or voluntary basis, in helping travellers to educate their children whether in regular or special schools.  I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not denigrating travellers when I say that their numbers are creating a problem.  I cannot stand dishonesty.  Because people are not sufficiently well educated in birth control methods to keep numbers under control the problem will get worse.  We must do what is necessary.  This is in everybody's interests, both travellers and the settled community.  There is no point in shilly-shallying.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the bulk of the members of the travelling community are good decent people born into misfortunate circumstances.  Given this background they are doing an excellent job.  In this regard the report does not get down to basics.  Halting sites are not the solution to the accommodation problems of the travelling community. The provision of a mixture of halting sites and a certain number of local authority houses will not provide a solution. The straightforward solution is that travellers must be integrated into the community.  This might be achieved by housing them in established housing estates or in rural developments comprising one or two houses &mdash; a development of four houses might be acceptable, but not a major development.  The provision of halting sites is a partial and unsatisfactory way of attempting to solve this problem.  I have had firsthand experience of this issue in my locality, as have other Members.</P>
    <P>This may not be a popular statement, but the movement of travellers should be regulated.  There should be a designated officer or officers in each local authority area to whom travellers must <Col N="2249" /> report if they are about to move from one halting site to another.  Halting sites are an interim measure and the ultimate measure is the provision of local authority housing.  However, travelling families should not be allowed to leave a halting site unless there is a vacancy at the location to which they propose to move.  The unregulated movement of travellers, often in large convoys of up to 60 families, creates huge difficulties for towns, villages and rural communities and it cannot continue.  There should be a permit or licensing system whereby people should only be allowed to move if accommodation is provided on a licensed site.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this point was made during the course of the debate, but much of the aggravation and agitation occurs because a travelling family or an entire group of travelling families arrives on the doorsteps of the settled community.  These families have no sanitary or other facilities and do not have access to a location to stable any horses they may own.  It is obvious that conflicts will flare up as a result.  Regulations must be introduced.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed and alarmed at the aspect of wishful thinking in the report. I do not wish to inhibit anyone's rights, be they travellers or members of the settled community, but movement must be regulated and should only occur when spaces become available on serviced sites.  This will provide the solution to many of the current problems. Why do these problems exist?  Why do councillors and members of the public make irrational and inflammatory statements? It is because of the agitation, confrontation and conflict that occurs.</P>
    <P>Illegal parking should not be permitted. In this context, I asked the Minister for the Environment about the powers of local authorities, health boards and the Garda Síochána.  He informed me that local authorities have ample powers to move people who have parked illegally.  That is not the case.  I openly <Col N="2250" /> contradict the Minister for the Environment and challenge him to state otherwise.  I have contacted senior officials of the local authorities in my area who inform me his statement is a joke.  They do not have any powers to move these people on and cannot prevent them parking illegally.  Sometimes they spend weeks and months trying to coax such people to move on.  It is completely unacceptable that up to 50 travelling families can camp in front of a private house or housing estate.</P>
    <P>Movement should only be permitted when people are travelling to a site under the control of a local authority. We should not tolerate any illegal parking, or any movement which does not result in travellers arriving at a place with proper facilities.  I ask the Minister to take this point on board.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim should be to house every travelling family as halting sites are an unsatisfactory intermediate measure.  It is unacceptable that travellers are permitted to enter overcrowded halting sites and cause problems and they are allowed to park outside private houses.  That is the essence of my contribution.</P>
    <P>Controls, advice and housing are all necessary.  Halting sites are not the answer.  Illegal parking causes many problems between travellers and the settled community.  The entire system must be regulated and cannot continue in its present form.  The Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community does not address the existing problems in the correct manner, it does not advocate a solution and continues to support a system which is not working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting, informative and valuable debate and I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Historically, discussions relating to the interaction between the traveller and settled communities frequently assume a bitter and antagonistic <Col N="2251" /> note.  Myth masquerades as fact and people and communities often adopt polarised positions.  Seeds of bitterness are sown which are very difficult to eradicate.  On the whole, this debate was different in that there was, to a large extent, and absence of rancour among Deputies and candour was displayed on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>There was a reasonable consensus on the significance of the report for mapping out a strategy which would, in time, prove effective for removing the sense of exclusion and of disadvantage which travellers experience.  There was also consensus on the need for a response from government, at central and local level, and society in general to the report and on the need to support the Government's five year strategy produced and put in this report, notwithstanding the high cost factors involved. This positive response encourages me to believe a new era of better relations between the settled community and travellers to which I referred in my opening statement is now realisable.  We have commenced the process of laying firm foundations for the removal of the root causes of the problems which the traveller and settled communities experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The honest and forthright nature of comment and analysis by the task force, and the clarity with which it presented them in the report, in no small measure contributed to the consensus among Deputies.  However, I sound a note of caution.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, rightly stressed that the provision of accommodation for travellers, although at the heart of the solution to these problems, will not of itself resolve the issues concerning travellers and their relationships with the settled community.  She said: &ldquo;Providing accommodation is not the end of the story when it comes to true equality between our communities, but without <Col N="2252" /> accommodation the story cannot begin&rdquo;.  People must be open to a change of attitude and be prepared to work patiently and continuously over many years to create an environment which will lead to harmonious relations between the communities.</P>
    <P>The provision of housing for travellers, the creation of educational opportunities for traveller children and the improvement of the health care facilities available to travellers, all of which are encompassed by the Government strategy, are essential ingredients to the process. These programmes can be brought to a successful conclusion within a time-scale and with legislative measures, such as those I referred to in my opening statement, which relate to housing, employment and discrimination.  Work on the improvement of relationships between the settled and traveller communities and on the creation of a climate of greater inclusiveness and tolerance among people generally will have to continue long after these administrative and legislative programmes have been completed.  In their contributions to the debate, many Deputies echoed in some form or another the caution expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy McManus.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke at length on the importance of education to the position of travellers in preparing them for participation in society and the environment prevailing at the end of the 20th century.  As Deputy O'Rourke rightly pointed out, the section of the report which deals with education is by far the longest.  That is evidence, if evidence were needed, of the central role education must play in achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement I alluded to the initiatives my colleague, the Minister for Education, is taking in response to the report.  Some Deputies &mdash; Deputy Martin in particular &mdash; appeared to have serious reservations about their adequacy and Deputy Martin illustrated <Col N="2253" /> his statement with specific instances of apparent deficiencies.  I appreciate and am heartened by the concern shown by the Deputy and I welcome this opportunity to provide clarification on some of these issues.</P>
    <P>The vocational education training opportunities scheme, generally referred to as VTOS, is designed to help long-term unemployed persons avail of educational opportunities such as taking the junior certificate, leaving certificate, City and Guilds courses and so on.  They continue to get an allowance equivalent to their social welfare payments while on the courses.  Five thousand places were available in 1994 and in 1995.  In 1995 the Minister for Education announced a cut of 1,000 in the number of places available for 1996.  She subsequently reversed that decision, however, and restored the number of VTOS places on offer to 5,000.</P>
    <P>I understand that while the Minister for Education does not propose to establish a traveller education unit in her Department, it is her intention to establish an internal committee comprised of representatives from all the areas in that Department dealing with travellers, including the inspectorate and the national education officer for travellers.  This committee will regularly meet traveller representatives.</P>
    <P>In relation to pre-school education, the Department of Education has been involved for many years in the provision of pre-school education for traveller children.  The early start scheme, a pilot scheme for pre-schools in disadvantaged areas, has been in existence for the past two years.  That scheme is very well resourced both in terms of staffing&mdash; one teacher and one child care assistant for each group of 15 children &mdash; and funding.  A traveller child living in proximity to a school where an early start class has been established has as much right to be enrolled as any child from the settled community.</P>
    <P>In relation to school attendance, a <Col N="2254" /> task force on truancy was established by the Minister for Education in 1995 and is expected to report to her in the near future.  We are all aware that education is dear to the heart of most parents and in this regard traveller parents are not any different from other parents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne had some words of criticism for the Department of Health and the health boards.  I refer him to the Government response to that section of the report which refers to traveller health.  The Government is committed to strengthening health services for travellers. In April 1994, the Minister for Health launched a health strategy which, <i>inter alia,</i> addressed the particular health needs of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>A consultative process is taking place in the Department of Health and with the health boards in relation to the recommendations of the task force.  It is proposed to consult the relevant organisations representing travellers in this process, the end process of which will be a draft policy document specifically on traveller health.  As I said in my opening statement, the Minister for Health sees the proposed policy document as providing a blueprint for action by the health boards and other service providers.</P>
    <P>The concern expressed by a number of Deputies for traveller women and the particular difficulties with which they must contend will be addressed in the policy document on travellers' health which is promised in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the forthcoming equal status legislation, I assure the House, and Deputy Keogh in particular, that there is not any lessening in the level of Government commitment to this legislation. It has particular significance for travellers, and the absence of statutory rights in areas such as education, the provision of goods and services and the disposal of property is a significant factor in the level of social exclusion they experience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2255" /> As I said, the Equal Status Bill is currently being drafted and I hope to publish it later this year.  It is unfortunate that a number of years ago the Government, of which Deputy Keogh's party was a member, voted down a Private Members' equal status Bill which I introduced in 1990.</P>
    <P>I set out the strategy to which the Government agreed to give effect to the recommendations of the task force.  The Government did this only after careful consideration and analysis of the report had been carried out by a committee of experts, representing the various Government Departments, which will be required to implement that strategy and to oversee the various action programmes involved in its implementation. Naturally, this required time and Deputy Woods chose to represent this passage of time as Government inaction. I cannot agree.  The welfare of travellers and their relationship with the settled community for years to come &mdash; perhaps for a period well into the 21st century &mdash; is at stake.  This is something we cannot treat lightly.</P>
    <P>Deputies in their contributions referred to previous attempts to resolve difficulties surrounding the implementation of plans to alleviate the plight of travellers and to attend to related matters. These met with only limited success and in some instances with strong opposition leading on occasion to the plans and initiatives in question being abandoned.  This must not be allowed to happen in relation to the task force report.  Unlike Deputy Woods I see the period which elapsed between publication of the report and the debate as representing an investment in the process leading to the successful implementation of the Government's strategy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy that the creation of halting sites is not the sole solution to the difficulties being experienced by travellers and the settled community. It is, however, a necessary part <Col N="2256" /> of the solution.  Many travellers cannot as yet adjust to living within the four walls of a house and to compel them to do so would not be a practical proposal and would serve only to aggravate the situation.  The use of serviced and adequately managed halting sites should be seen as a proper and necessary step in the settlement process for travellers, it has regard also to the needs of the settled community.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Deputy Deasy and disagree with him when he suggests that the movement of travellers should be controlled.  I would remind him that travellers like other people are citizens of this country and their rights are guaranteed by our Constitution and laws.  Some travellers are criminals and some members of the settled community are criminals.  Whether travellers or members of the settled community they have to be dealt with in accordance with the law.  Deputy Deasy talked about contraception and spoke inappropriately in my view about the fact that some traveller families have large numbers of children.  That is their lawful right under the Constitution.  Many members of the settled community also have large families and that is a matter of choice for them.  Education about contraception is rightly dealt with across the board, not particularly for travellers but for all members of the community, travelling and settled.  I disassociate myself from the suggestion by Deputy Deasy that the movement of travellers should be controlled and from some of his other suggestions also.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the members of the task force for their commitment and dedication to the task they undertook and for the excellence of the report.  It will be an invaluable source document for administrators, legislators and all concerned citizens for years to come to enable us to build a secure foundation stone for travellers and members of the settled community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise the issue of primary schools staffing schedules and the Minister of State for attending to reply. There was a general welcome for the announcement by the Minister for Education that no two teacher school would lose a teacher under the present staffing schedule for primary schools.  This was welcomed in the west where 12 schools will not be reduced to one teacher schools, four of which are in my constituency of Galway East, four in Mayo, two in Donegal, and one in each of counties Sligo and Clare.  Also, one school in each of counties Cork, Tipperary, Wicklow and Carlow will not be affected.  A total of 16 schools will retain two teachers.  The obvious anomaly here is that if a school is to retain two teachers it must have 25 pupils.  I know of a two teacher school with 15 pupils and a one teacher school with 20 pupils. That is inconsistent and illogical.  A one teacher school would not be treated in the same way as a two teacher school.</P>
      <P>There are in the region of 140 primary schools which have either one teacher or are island schools &mdash; I understand the department group them in that way.  It is extremely difficult for one teacher to teach all classes in such a school.  The most important item of technology they have is the telephone which enables them to seek assistance if a child becomes ill or they need help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this trend continues and we freeze the pupil teacher ratio and allow schools to lose a teacher every year, eventually the one teacher schools will close.  This would be regrettable especially in the west where a Minister of State has been appointed with responsibility for western development.  We should hold on to what we have and seek new developments. The Minister should examine the staff schedule.  Unfortunately, she has effectively frozen the pupil teacher <Col N="2258" /> ratio for retention of primary teachers. At a very minimum I suggest the Minister alter the staffing schedule for assistant teachers.  If this were done over two years jobs and schools would be saved and teachers would not go on the panel.</P>
    <P>When a teacher leaves a panel it is virtually impossible to get that teacher back.  Given that the Minister has the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the education research centre report I hope priority will be given to smaller schools in rural, remote and isolated areas and that staffing of national schools would be addressed. Staffing a national school for a particular year is based on the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  This will be a major concern for boards of management as we approach September.  The songwriter Mick Hanley, who used to talk about childhood memories of going to school said: &ldquo;All I remember is dreading September and school&rdquo;.  Children no longer dread September.  Certainly the boards of management are dreading September for fear that they will lose a teacher, that the teacher will not come back to their school from the panel and that their school will be undermined.  Will the Minister of State clear up some of the anomalies concerning the Minister's announcement and give priority and resources to the smaller schools in rural Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this issue.  It will not be possible to allocate an additional teacher to all existing one teacher primary schools.  The House will be familiar with the Minister's very substantial commitment towards alleviating the handicap of education disadvantage.  As part of her programme in this area, the Minister recently announced an additional significant initiative aimed at breaking the cycle of educational disadvantage in targeted areas of particular <Col N="2259" /> need in accordance with the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the education research centre report.  There is particular reference to the allocation of additional teaching resources to the most disadvantaged schools in the primary system, both urban and rural.</P>
      <P>For urban schools a targeted programme of supports will be made available to 25 selected large schools in designated areas of Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  One of these supports will be a new maximum of 15 pupils in junior classes. For rural schools a special initiative will focus on schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly in schools in rural areas serving dispersed populations. Supports will be made available to 25 clusters of schools in this category, each cluster having a combined enrolment of 300 to 350 pupils.</P>
      <P>Implementation of this programme will obviously require considerable resources.  The Deputy will be aware of the extreme limitation on resources which seriously restricts scope to introduce creative and ambitious programmes. Notwithstanding these limitations, the Minister has embarked on a programme which is both creative and ambitious and which has as its primary aim crushing the handicap of education disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, resources will be used to extend the substitute supply panel scheme.  This scheme, which the Minister initiated in 1993, provides cover for teachers on absences of short duration.  It is widely acknowledged by the education partners that this scheme has been very successful. Therefore, it is appropriate that expansion of the scheme should be undertaken as resources permit.  Unfortunately, in the circumstances there is no additional scope to allocate extra staffing to existing one teacher primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the tragic death recently of Caroline Daly, who died alone in a prison cell five hours after being committed there, should be discussed.  I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue and express my condolences to her family. Her death raises questions which we should consider in detail.  The death of this young woman is a poignant reminder of the experience of women, many of whom are disadvantaged and who, on a continual basis, are in and out of the women's prison.</P>
      <P>I have a number of concerns which date back over a long period about the standards, conditions and appropriateness of the women's prison.  Improvements have been made but the women and staff are in old and unsuitable buildings. In the contacts I have had with the staff in the women's prison I heard of their efforts to help them while in prison and afterwards.</P>
      <P>The imprisonment of Caroline Daly for a petty crime raises many questions. Was this an appropriate response to a young heroin addicted woman desperate to get money to feed her habit?  Was a single prison cell the place for her to be kept?  If a more developed methadone maintenance programme had been available to her or if there had been more developed community services able to provide timely responses, could she have dealt in a better way with her addiction and not ended up in prison?</P>
      <P>We often read of the lack of prison spaces, but it is ironic that this young woman should end up in a single cell on her own when so many hardened criminals are released after a short period because of a shortage of places.  Her death reminds us of the disturbing evidence from other jurisdictions that when women come to the attention of courts they are dealt with in a more punitive way.  We must guard against this and monitor sentencing practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This woman's death also raises the question of the availability of treatment <Col N="2261" /> of drug addicted prisoners in our prisons. There is an ambivalence and uncertainty in our approach to prisons. On the one hand we want to see determined criminals being dealt with more strictly, punitively and thoroughly.  Yet, on the other hand, we know we need a prison system in which standards are effective, prison staff supported and reasonable standards of accommodation and services apply.  There should be an independent inspectorate of prisons and I ask the Minister to consider the idea.</P>
    <P>Referral to prison was not an imaginative response to this young woman. Effective earlier responses and investment in programmes are needed which help young people to avoid drugs or to regain control of their lives.</P>
    <P>The prison service and justice system have been overloaded for many years. To her credit, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, had begun to overhaul the criminal justice and prison systems in the short time she has been in office. The task is immense.  Caroline Daly's death is another indication that we should take the treatment of drug addicts seriously and embark on a real programme of prison reform.  A proper women's prison is needed with appropriate facilities to help tackle the problems which cause most of the women to engage in relatively minor crimes.  We also need an independent inspectorate of prisons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express on behalf of the Minister for Justice her deep concern at any loss of life in the prisons and particularly death by suicide.  Every such death is a tragedy, not just for the family, relations and friends of the deceased, but also for the prison service.  The Minister would like to take this opportunity to extend her sympathy to the family of the deceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an elaborate strategy in place for the prevention of suicides in prisons <Col N="2262" /> and the Minister intends to do everything she can to support such strategies. However, unless there is to be a total denial of personal privacy to prisoners at all times, the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be precluded any more than in the wider community.</P>
    <P>The Minister is reviewing the preventive measures in place to deter suicides. I understand that 50 of the 57 recommendations of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths which reported in August 1991 have been or are in the course of being implemented.  The report of the advisory group is available in the Dáil Library.  All deaths in custody are the subject of a public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest.  The circumstances of each death in custody are also examined by the suicide awareness group in each prison.  These examinations cover the background and circumstances of each death.  The objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken in future to contribute to the prevention of tragic deaths of this nature.  This is an important mechanism for absorbing the lessons to be learned in each case.</P>
    <P>There are also procedures in place for identifying and monitoring offenders at special risk.  Such offenders are usually placed under special observation. However, we cannot escape the fact that where an offender is determined to take his or her life and frequently there is no prior warning of any such intent, the scope for prevention is limited.  The advisory group itself acknowledged in chapter 4 of its report that it has to be accepted that if a person is sufficiently determined to take his or her own life it is virtually impossible to prevent it.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the death of the young person who is the subject of this Adjournment debate. Caroline Daly was committed to Mountjoy Prison on the night of Wednesday, 22nd May 1996 at 10.30 p.m.  She was remanded in custody to appear at the Dublin District Court on <Col N="2263" /> Monday, 27 May at 10.30 a.m. and was allowed to make a telephone call to her friend immediately on her committal. She was escorted from the main gate of the prison to the women's prison by a female prison officer, who has advised that the deceased was calm and appeared to be in good form during all stages of her committal.</P>
    <P>On her arrival in the women's prison, officers spent some time talking to the deceased and informed her that she could have a visit the following day.  She then changed into prison issue night wear and appeared to be coping well with her situation.  The officer who was on night duty in the women's prison on the evening in question checked the deceased on a number of occasions during the night and recalls that during the check at 1 a.m. she was in her bed reading a magazine.</P>
    <P>Shortly before 1.30 a.m. the officer again checked the cell and found the deceased hanging from the bars of the cell window.  She immediately alerted a senior officer who unlocked the cell and cut the sheet which was tied around the deceased's neck and secured to the cell bars.  Staff immediately tried to revive her and help was summoned from the main prison.  An ambulance was also summoned.  A medical orderly rushed to the women's prison and immediately commenced cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. He failed to get a response but continued his efforts until the arrival of the ambulance.  The deceased was taken to the casualty unit at the Mater Hospital where she was pronounced dead at 2 a.m.</P>
    <P>The death of the unfortunate young girl will be the subject of a public inquiry in the form of an inquest.  The circumstances of the death have also been examined by the suicide awareness group in Mountjoy Prison.  The prison governor has advised that he examined the circumstances surrounding the death and is satisfied the staff made <Col N="2264" /> every effort to help the deceased to cope with her first experience of prison. The Minister is also satisfied there is nothing more that could have been done to prevent this tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has established a national steering group under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor to oversee the local suicide awareness groups in the various institutions.  The group will include in its membership some of the most experienced representatives of prison management, staff and medical practitioners who are now involved in prison management.  The group will be assigned the task of reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths published in 1991.  The group will also provide a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups within the institutions and diseminating significant findings or lessons learned throughout the prison system.  Trends in prison suicide in other countries and their prevention will also be monitored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will recall that last month a member of the travelling community received a five year sentence for stealing £31 worth of goods, including briquettes and potatoes. Attempts were made to justify the sentence on the grounds that the man concerned had prior convictions and had &ldquo;put the courts to a lot of trouble&rdquo;. Drug pushers regularly receive sentences of two years or less.  In 1994 a survey showed that of the 54 men found guilty of sexual offences during the previous 12 months, 11 received non-custodial sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a widespread perception that the courts treat crimes against property more severely than crimes against the person and some recent sentences handed down by our courts only serve to enhance that perception.  Sentences are often arbitrary, in many cases <Col N="2265" /> depending on the judge's mood.  We know from media reports and anecdotal evidence that judges may hand down heavy sentences if they are in a bad mood and lenient sentences if they are in a good mood.  Unfortunately, however, we do not have reliable statistical data with which to construct an accurate picture of current sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>Despite the current social, political and media preoccupation with increasing crime levels, in particular violent crime, the crime debate is still conducted in the dark.  We simply do not know the relationship between the average prison sentence for different offences or the range of sentences handed down for similar offences.  We do not even know the relationship between sentences for crimes against the person and crimes against property and there has been scant analysis of recidivism rates. However, we know there is a public perception that sentencing policy is similar to a lucky dip draw.</P>
    <P>Concern about arbitrary sentencing policy and the absence of reliable information is not a new phenomenon.  A plethora of reports and recommendations have been compiled to address these issues, most of which are gathering layers of dust in Government offices.  For example, 11 years ago the Whitaker committee of inquiry into the penal system highlighted the over-reliance by the courts on imprisonment and custodial sanctions.  In 1993 the Law Reform Commission produced a consultation paper on sentencing which proposed a number of provisional arrangements. It recommended the establishment of a statutory sentencing policy which would base sentencing on a just desserts approach and highlight the matters which the courts should disregard when imposing sentences.  Furtheremore, it recommended that judicial studies &mdash; God forgive us for suggesting that judges should go back to school, even though it might help with sentencing policy &mdash; on sentencing should be organised and that a national bureau of sentencing data should be established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2266" /> Those recommendations, together with the Whitaker recommendations on non-custodial sentencing, should be implemented as a matter of priority. Unless public concerns about sentencing are addressed, public frustration will lead to calls for mandatory sentences, a policy that has proven extremely problematic in the United Kingdom and which I would not like this Parliament to implement in this jurisdiction.  I look forward to the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for affording me an opportunity to reply to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It is not part of the functions of the Minister for Justice, and indeed it would be in appropriate for her to do so, to seek to pass judgement on sentences imposed by the courts in individual cases.  In that context it must be borne in mind that in reaching a decision in the case in question, the judge exercised his judicial functions.  Under the terms of the Constitution these functions are exclusively reserved to our judges.  It is therefore not open to the Minister to comment on a particular case.</P>
      <P>As regards consistency of sentences under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  It enables the judge to exercise his or her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence, assessing the culpability, the circumstances of the accused and so on. There is a statutory provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i> the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of their jurisdiction and, while there is no similar provision in the case of judges of the other courts, it is understood they hold similar meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main responsibility of the Minister for Justice in this area is with the legislation governing the sentences <Col N="2267" /> which may be imposed by the courts.  In this context the House will be aware that in 1993 the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper on sentencing.  This was a very detailed document which addressed a wide range of issues on sentencing policy generally. For example, it discusses the features of a coherent sentencing policy, including the role which various aggravating and mitigating factors should have, how a person's prior criminal record might influence sentencing and the need for reasons to be given why a particular sentence is being imposed.</P>
    <P>The final report of the Commission, when it becomes available, will provide a solid background against which these issues can be addressed.  It is expected it will represent the most thorough analysis of sentencing policy generally since the foundation of the State.  It is understood the Commission has done a substantial amount of work in this area and the Minister is anxious that its report be available as quickly as possible.  It will then be examined with a view to putting proposals to Government on its recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Telecom Éireann strategic alliance process is on the point of collapse.  Yesterday's warning from the company's trade unions about the strategic alliance process not being taken on board is extremely ominous. The Minister has treated the unions with contempt given that they are the key players in the alliance.  They have been unwavering partners in the process and do not deserve to be treated in this manner.  In an article in one of today's newspapers their leader described the Minister's treatment as betrayal.  Unfortunately, this approach in dealing with the Telecom Éireann process is typical of the procedure in other State companies. Due to the policy fumbling of the Minister and the Government, eight of <Col N="2268" /> the ten top world telecommunications players have pulled out of the race and the remaining two want to pick up Telecom Éireann for a song.  The company's latest records show it is probably worth £2 billion, but the remaining players have offered only approximately £300 million for 35 per cent of it.  That is a knock down price and such a sale will be vigorously resisted by my party.  One of the players does not even have the strategic capability for such an alliance.</P>
      <P>In a fit of desperation, and because the Minister knows KPN-Telia has him over a barrel, he appears to have dispatched the Government advisers, Morgan Stanley, to find a partner for Teledanmark. Rumours abound that a partner has been found, but this seems to be a marriage of convenience.  Given that 80 per cent of strategic alliances fail, one would certainly have to question the solidity of a consortium put together at the last minute in this fashion.</P>
      <P>For some time I have been very critical of the Minister's handling of this alliance process.  It is wrong for him to try to achieve the deal without allowing for debate or consultation in this Chamber.  The Minister has consistently refused to make available consultants' reports on Telecom Éireann and to properly answer parliamentary questions. Telecom Éireann unions and staff have been kept in the dark &mdash; for example, they have not been told how many redundancies are being negotiated as part of the deal or who their new bosses are likely to be.  They are justified in feeling betrayed.  The Minister and his Government colleagues are wrong not to give them straight answers about the employee share ownership plan.  I have been saying for several months that this strategic alliance process is in a shambles, and this latest warning from the trade unions represents the last straw for the plan.  I urge the Minister to call off this shambles and start again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan protests too much.  I have seen a statement by Mr. David Begg, General Secretary of the Communications Workers' Union, regarding the union's proposals for employee shareholding in Telecom Éireann.  As the House is aware, the Government last year approved a mandate for the negotiation of an equity-based strategic alliance involving the sale of up to 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann to a suitable strategic partner. The Government also indicated that subject to certain conditions it was willing to consider setting aside up to 5 per cent of the share capital for an employee shareholding scheme.</P>
      <P>The impetus for this mandate is that Ireland needs a first class telecommunications sector to underpin further economic development and job creation.  It is the Government's objective to achieve a telecommunications sector for Ireland which is in the top quartile of OECD indicators of price competitiveness, quality and availability as soon as possible.  Telecom Éireann, as the major player in the market, has a key role to play in the Government's strategy to achieve this objective.  Telecom Éireann must complete its transformation from a domestic monopoly into an integrated customer-focused operator, offering the full range of advanced services in a competitive, global marketplace.</P>
      <P>This morning I chaired a meeting of the customer service group in Telecom Éireann headquarters in St. Stephen's Green, at which details of the customer charter and all the internal responses necessary to ensure the charter is a reality were delivered by Telecom Éireann.  The formation of an equity-based strategic alliance with a suitable Telecom operator is a key facilitator in the implementation of this strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This transformation crucially involves Telecom Éireann staff, who have a key <Col N="2270" /> role to play in the future development of the company.  It was in recognition of this role the Government decided in principle to contemplate an employee stake of up to 5 per cent, in the equity of the company.  The strategic alliance process, which is based on the terms of the mandate, is now at an advanced stage involving detailed discussions with potential partners.  The Minister, Deputy Lowry, hopes to be in a position to put proposals to Government on a strategic alliance before August.  It is expected such proposals will include the principles which will underpin employee shareholding in the company.  It is envisaged the details of such a scheme will be developed after the alliance is put in place.</P>
    <P>The potential partners accept the concept of employee shareholding set out in the mandate.  It is reasonable to expect the strategic partner will wish to play its part in co-operation with the company's staff in the development and implementation of an employee shareholding scheme.  It will wish to explore and clarify the contribution that an employee shareholding scheme can make to the future development of the company.</P>
    <P>The union's statement follows many contacts the Department has had with Mr. Begg in connection with the alliance process in the past few months.  It was made clear to Mr. Begg at these meetings that the Government decision of July 1995 on the mandate for strategic alliance negotiations stood and that it was not possible to depart from it.</P>
    <P>During most of these meetings, the general secretary's approach was of an exploratory nature.  Specific details were not set out in respect of many of the more important elements of any employee shareholding plan.  It was only last Friday week that share purchase proposals of a general and outline nature were first put to the Minister, Deputy Lowry, in writing.  He has been giving careful consideration to Mr. <Col N="2271" /> Begg's ideas and has consulted Government colleagues.  Mr. Begg was informed that important issues raised by this correspondence required detailed analysis and the Minister would revert to him as soon as that was done.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Lowry has had many contacts with the general secretary of the CWU in connection with the alliance process.  Mr. Begg has had open access to the Department's senior officials at all times since the launch of the alliance process.  Furthermore, the Telecom unions have had extensive access to the alliance process since December 1995.  There have been 16 meetings of a strategic consultative group in the company consisting of management and union representatives which have been fully briefed on all key aspects of the alliance process.</P>
    <P>The ideas put forward by staff representatives will receive careful consideration. The Minister will seek to have a better understanding of what the employees have in mind, particularly in areas such as funding, shareholding rights and governance mechanisms.  In a context in which company operations will require extensive restructuring through discussion with staff and unions, proposals in regard to employee shareholding must be carefully considered by all shareholders, including a strategic partner.  For that reason, such detailed discussions should take place once the strategic partner is in place.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann faces a rapidly <Col N="2272" /> changing environment, involving not only major technological developments and a more demanding customer but also the onset of full competition in the telecommunications sector.  Already Telecom Éireann is subject to competition in some areas but when full competition arrives it will have to be in a position to effectively compete in the domestic and international sectors by offering cost-efficient services that meet the needs of the market.  This will require completion of the transformation of its cost and debt structures, the further development of its range of services and the implementation of change in its business processes.  There is only a short period of time for these changes to take place, given that full competition will be permitted by January 2000.  It is in the best interests of Telecom Éireann staff, as well as the company, its shareholders and its customers, that these changes are made successfully.  This can only be achieved in a spirit of co-operation, recognising that all parties have the same goal.  The Minister is confident that the Telecom Éireann unions and staff will work positively with the Government, the company and the strategic partner to make the necessary preparations for the competitive marketplace. In this context the Minister is satisfied the best way to address employee concerns on shareholding is through discussion and by agreement with all shareholders.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 18 June 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 16 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2177" /> The national strategy for travellers' accommodation, which I announced on 27 March last, is the Government's comprehensive response to the recommendations on the accommodation of travellers contained in the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  Details of the strategy, which take account of all of the problems encountered to date in providing suitable accommodation, are set out in the reply to Questions Nos. 16 and 82 on 27 March last and in my statement to the Dáil on 23 April on the report of the task force.</P>
    <P>Local authorities provide accommodation for travellers through the letting of houses from their existing or new stock of houses, the allocation of houses in traveller group housing schemes and the provision of serviced bays in halting sites.  At this stage, it is not possible to estimate how many traveller families will be accommodated by local authorities in 1996.  The outturn will depend on progress in completing those group housing schemes and halting sites which are currently under constructions, and the number of local authority houses which become available for letting to travellers families.</P>
    <P>As regards future years, I am confident that implementation of the national strategy will ensure an adequate response by local authorities to the accommodation needs of travellers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 32 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>EC Council Directive 91/328 of 21 June 1991 requires those member states, including Ireland, which do not already have a system of periodic roadworthiness testing of cars to have such a system in operation by 1998.  This system would apply to cars over four years old, including imported used cars.  Pending approval by the Government of specific proposals in the matter, I am not in a position to say what the detailed arrangements for testing will be.</P>
      <P>While concerns have been expressed that defective used cars are being imported into Ireland, there is no evidence available to me or my Department that this is widespread.  Commercial suppliers of motor vehicles, whether new or used, are obliged under specific road traffic regulations to ensure that such vehicles comply with the requirements relating to construction, equipment and lighting.  Enforcement of these and other road traffic regulations relating to motor vehicles generally is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Forbairt is at present designated under the relevant regulations as the authority responsible for testing the smoke content of fuels.  The Forbairt facilities for <Col N="2196" /> this purpose are located in Dublin.

      <P>The Department is also undertaking its review of the operation of smoke controls for the 1995-96 heating season. Preliminary indications are that smoke levels in Dublin remain at their much reduced levels and that appreciable reductions in smoke concentrations have also resulted from the first full year of operation of the Cork coal ban.</P>
      <P>Possible improvements of the administration of the coal ban and the question of its extension to other urban areas will be considered in light of the completed review.</P>

      <P>This year, my Department is providing £121.8 million for water and sewerage services, an increase in real terms of 10 per cent over the 1995 outturn.  This represents one of the largest investments in these services ever undertaken.  While a significant part of the programme is directed at the larger urban centres where the needs of industry, tourism and the domestic sectors are most acute, it also contributes substantially to the provision of services in small towns and villages.  Of the 50 new schemes scheduled to commence construction under the main water and sewerage programme in 1996, some 15 of them with an overall value of over £28 million will provide new and upgraded sewerage facilities at various small towns and villages around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the projects financed under the main programme, my Department's small schemes programme is <Col N="2197" /> aimed specifically at meeting the urgent water and sewerage needs of small towns and villages.  This year, up to £4 million has been set aside for these schemes and so far, a first tranche of 30 schemes, 15 of which are sewerage schemes, has been approved.</P>
    <P>A further £4 million, co-funded by INTERREG II, is being provided for the provision of additional small water and sewerage schemes for towns and villages in Border counties over the period 1995-99.  Some 50 such projects, 25 of them sewerage schemes, have been approved for construction.</P>
    <P>This year, a new sub-programme, costing over £3 million, was introduced to provide improved water supply at three resort centres and improved sewerage services at six resort centres. These are, for the most part, small seaside towns, and the schemes will facilitate tourism and other development locally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's record in relation to blue flag awards to beaches compares very favourably with the rest of Europe. Statistics compiled by the Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe &mdash;FEEE &mdash; which operates the scheme, indicate that 50 per cent of Irish beaches were awarded blue flags in 1996 compared with the European average of only 12 per cent.  The next most successful country was Portugal where 34 per cent of beaches obtained blue flags.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the award of blue flags are determined by FEEE and relate to water quality, facilities for visitors, beach management, including litter control, and environmental information and display facilities.  As far as water quality is concerned, FEEE seeks to emphasise and recognise bathing areas achieving standards of excellence, assessed on the basis of guide values for certain parameters contained in the directive on the quality of bathing water.  These values are up to 20 times more stringent than the mandatory standards set in the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifty-nine blue flags were awarded to Irish beaches in 1996 compared with 66 last year.  I understand that the reduction in awards was due to beach management problems and difficulties in relation to the water quality requirements of the scheme.  I also understand that the local authorities for the beaches <Col N="2201" /> concerned have attributed the situation in relation to water quality to variable weather conditions or explicable results obtained on a few sampling dates.  These exceptional results generally occurred in areas removed from the influence of sewage discharges.</P>
    <P>Applications for blue flags are usually made by local authorities and it is primarily a matter for them to ensure that the criteria in relation to beach management and water quality are satisfied. Extensive powers are available to local authorities under the Litter and Water Pollution Acts to deal with any activities which may compromise their ability to observe these criteria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>Section 26 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, empowers planning authorities to attach conditions to planning permissions, while section 26(2) contains specific provision for conditions requiring contributions towards expenditure already incurred, or to be incurred, by the planning authority in respect of works which have facilitated, or will facilitate, the proposed development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2202" /> Decisions on the attachment to planning permissions of contribution conditions, and on the amount of contributions required, are matters for the relevant planning authority in the first instance.  Such conditions can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála, which can, where it considers it appropriate, give to the planning authority directions relating to the attachment, amendment or removal of conditions to which the appeal relates, or of other conditions.</P>
    <P>The principle of requiring a developer, in appropriate cases, to contribute to the cost of services facilitating a proposed development has been established since the inception of the present planning code over 30 years ago, and I see no reason to depart from that now. Planning contributions, in some cases, make it possible to permit development to take place sooner than might be the case if the necessary services had to be provided solely out of public expenditure.</P>

      <P>Monthly returns relating to road accidents are received from the Garda some weeks after the end of each month. These returns show that 437 people died, and 12,673 were injured, in road accidents in 1995.</P>
      <P>The figure for reported injuries shows a major increase in both the corresponding returns for 1994 and the provisional returns supplied by the Garda for 1995 which have been previously quoted. This is primarily a result of an increase in the reporting level of injury accidents brought about by a rationalisation of the road accident reporting system.  The National Roads Authority has advised, in the context of the preparation of its report Road Accident Facts 1995, that when the data relating to injury accidents is adjusted to take account the increased reporting level, only a small increase in injury accident occurrence was revealed.  That report will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>The increase in road casualties in 1995 is a matter of great concern, especially as the increase did not reflect the trend over the previous few years. An analysis of fatal accidents carried out at my request by the National Roads Authority in relation to the last six months of 1995 suggests that excessive speed and drink were major contributory factors, that a significant number of young road users were killed, and that motorcyclists and pedestrians accounted for a disproportionately high percentage of deaths.</P>
      <P>Provisional returns for 1996 indicate that the number of road deaths to the end of May total 158.  This compares with a total of 139 for the same period in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a full assessment of road safety policy, a new national road safety campaign was launched last month with an emphasis on ensuring that all of the agencies involved &mdash; my Department, the Department of Justice and the Garda; the National Roads Authority; <Col N="2206" /> the National Safety Council; and the local authorities &mdash; work together with the road user to increase the effectiveness of their enforcement, education, engineering and encouragement measures.  Measures to be implemented in the coming months, all aimed at improving the level of safety on our roads, include the introduction of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences; a new approach to road safety engineering; new TV and radio advertising campaigns; and a theory test for the new applicants for driver licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Difficulties in relation to the recycling of paper are being experienced at present in Ireland and many other countries arising from a significant reduction in the demand and price for waste paper.  I intend to consult with other EU member states and the European Commission regarding possible international action to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>Kerbside Dublin is continuing to collect certain paper products such as cardboard and other higher grade paper. The collection of lower grade waste papers such as used newspapers by Kerbside Dublin and other agencies has declined arising from recent reductions in the market value of such paper.  Some collection agencies are, however, maintaining collection banks in place or reserving collection sites, pending recovery of markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased demand for recycled paper will be supported in Ireland by guidelines being finalised in my Department for environmental management by Government Departments.  A study commissioned by my Department and National Newspapers of Ireland is also <Col N="2207" /> being completed by Teagasc on the use of shredded newspaper as bedding for dairy cows.  These and other appropriate national measures to support waste recycling will be pursued by my Department in the context of the further implementation of the national strategy on recycling and of the Waste Management, Act, 1996.</P>

These include further development of the local authority housing programme, with an appropriate level of funding, as the mainstay of the response of social housing needs; securing the target of 7,000 social housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo; annually; the continued development of the voluntary housing sector, with improvements in the terms of the schemes under which the sector provides social housing; modification of the eligibility criteria, including increased income eligibility, for the various social housing schemes to make them more effective in meeting needs; continued development of the shared ownership scheme; implementation of the new Government strategy aimed at meeting the accommodation needs of the travelling community, preparing the necessary supporting legislation and, through the new special unit which has been established in my Department, overseeing the preparation, monitoring, implementation and co-ordination of the local programmes; an initiative aimed at securing better co-ordination and delivery of services for the homeless, including outreach services, in the Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare areas; ensuring that toilet and bathroom facilities can be provided for all local authority tenants who want them by 1 January 1998; arranging for a review of the remedial works scheme in consultation with local authorities, and considering specially the refurbishment of older local authority housing stock in this context; introducing a new registration system of private rented dwellings as a final element of a charter for rented housing; establishing an interdepartmental committee to consider the issues arising in the proposed transfer from health boards to local authorities of the administration of rent and mortgage supplements, currently paid under the supplementary welfare assistance scheme; introducing further measures to improve the management of local authority housing estates through the <Col N="2212" /> development of the authorities' management skills and through increased tenant participation in the running of estates; the establishment of a housing management group to recommend measures to put housing management practices of local authorities on a sound professional footing throughout the country; the introduction of a new scheme of grants to local authorities towards the cost of selected practical pilot projects in housing management; introducing a new tenant purchase scheme which is more affordable for tenants, including a shared ownership option; introducing a new sub-programme for extensions to local authority houses in lieu of rehousing; raising standards of new apartments by increasing the minimum floor area for new house grant purposes to 38 square metres with effects from 1 April 1996; promoting the development of comprehensive housing information and advice services by local authorities; introducing an award scheme to promote good design in local authority housing; increasing the thatching grant to £2,400 generally and £3,600 in the case of offshore islands; setting up arrangements for joint funding under the capital assistance scheme and from health boards for certain housing projects for the mentally handicapped which previously could not go ahead; directing housing authorities to undertake an assessment of housing needs in their areas to establish the need existing at 29 March 1996, including a thorough assessment of the needs of homeless persons; pressing housing authorities to assign a high priority to energy conservation within their housing programmes and to develop and implement an effective energy conservation programme for their housing stock.</P>
    <P>In the urban renewal area, my achievement to date include initiating a wide ranging review by consultants of the urban renewal tax incentive scheme, including the impact of the scheme in economic, social, architectural and urban design terms; implementing successfully the Urban and Village <Col N="2213" /> Renewal Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, including the issue of guidelines to local authorities; designation of additional areas in Bray, Clonmel, Cork, Dublin, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986 and of a new area in Cobh; issue of guidelines to local authorities aimed at improving the standard and mix of apartments being provided in the urban renewal designated areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to progressing the range of measures which I have already set in train, priorities for the future include continuing to ensure adequate resources for the social housing programme in relation to needs; securing commencement of a comprehensive redevelopment of the Ballymun flats complex; introducing a new pilot house purchase loan scheme involving Bank of Ireland, the Housing Finance Agency and Rural Resettlement Ireland; in the context of the EU Presidency, a successful outcome of the meeting of EU Housing Ministers in Dublin in October next on the theme &ldquo;Housing of Socially Excluded People&rdquo;; evaluating the future of the urban renewal tax incentive scheme in the light of the review which is due for completion later this year.</P>
    <P>The range and extent of my responsibilities are significant, whether measured in economic or social terms.  I believe I have achieved much in a relatively short time and it is my firm intention to build on progress already made, particularly in regard to meeting the accommodation needs of the socially disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993 provide for the payment to housing authorities of grants in respect of necessary works of adaptation to accommodation for occupation by disabled persons. The scheme is administered by the housing authorities who decide the level of funding to be provided for the service in their area and the relative priority to be afforded to individual applicants. Authorities are recouped 50 per cent of their grant payments, up to a maximum of £4,000 per case, by my Department. I am satisfied that local authorities generally are providing a reasonable level of service in terms of processing applications, the level of grant being paid and the discharge of claims for payment and I have no proposals at present to amend the regulations governing the scheme.</P>

      <P>The needs of coastal areas generally are taken fully into account in the allocation of funds under the water and sewerage programme.  The 1996 work programme announced last January, includes 14 sewerage schemes to the value of £230 million which are under construction or due to commence construction this year. In addition, £3 million was committed from the 1996 programme under the resorts initiative announced in March this year.  Sewerage schemes in six coastal resorts throughout the country will be funded under the initiative this year.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 28 on 9 May last, Waterford County Council has submitted a report outlining the case for a study for a sewerage scheme in Ardmore.  However, due to the level of existing commitments and the number of high priority schemes for which funding must be provided, it was not possible to include these proposals in the current year's work programme. The position will be reviewed when the programme for next year is being determined.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="2220" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The Building Control Act, and the building regulations made under the Act, prescribe detailed fire safety requirements for new buildings and for material alterations or changes of use thereto.  Technical guidance documents, which accompany the Regulations, contain comprehensive guidance on matters such as means of escape &mdash; including the provision of smoke alarms &mdash; internal and external fire spread, and access and facilities for the fire brigade.  The guidance documents are at present at an advanced stage of review within my Department.  It is intended to publish a complete set of revised documents later in the year.  These will expand and improve the minimum standards of many aspects of new buildings, including the level of fire detection and window design in new housing.</P>
      <P>As regards housing generally, while the individual householder remains ultimately responsible for ensuring fire safety in the home, better awareness of the dangers of fire can help to prevent and minimise the incidence of house fires and their effects.  The National Safety Council is responsible for the promotion of fire safety awareness, as well as road safety and water safety.  A grant of £620,000 is provided in my Department's Estimates for 1996 towards the administration and general expenses of the council and substantial additional funds are received by the council from the insurance industry and other sources; the allocation of the funds available among its various services is a matter for the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. It has developed a number of initiatives to highlight the danger of fire in the home, to educate the householder in preventative measures and to promote the installation of smoke alarms. In both 1994 and 1995, the council administered a special scheme under which alarms were installed in the homes of elderly people on a pilot basis <Col N="2221" /> in targeted areas around the country; special grants were made available by my Department to the council for this purpose.  Local authorities have also been asked by my Department to consider providing smoke alarms in their rented dwellings.</P>
    <P>With regard to statistics on fire deaths, information supplied by fire authorities for 1994, the latest year available, indicates 41 fatalities in house and flat fires attended by fire brigades. Figures in relation to 1995 are being compiled at present.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation of commercial property is net annual value i.e. the rental value of the property.  Under the Valuation Acts any improvements, alterations or change of use that affects the rental value of a property must be taken into account in assessing the rateable valuation.  The provision of a new shop front might or might not lead to a change in the rateable valuation.  Any ratepayer dissatisfied with a valuation assessment has a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, in the first instance, and, subsequently, to the independent Valuation Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue <Col N="2224" /> hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board concerning this case and have been assured that the application was considered on hardship grounds.  However, as the person's income was substantially over the standard income guidelines the health board considered that the applicant would not be entitled to a medical card on hardship grounds.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to all in-patient public hospital services subject only to modest statutory charges and to out-patient services free of charges.  They are also entitled to a refund of expenditure, including that of dependants, over £90 per calendar quarter on prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must receive one and I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the recent reports on phthalates in baby milks referred to the possible effects of these substances on fertility, especially among males.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Food Safety Advisory Board, has reviewed the available data relating to the survey carried out by the Food Safety Directorate of the UK Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the levels of phthalates in baby milks on sale in the UK.  As part of this review, the levels recorded for the two types of phthalates thought to have oestrogenic effects were considered.  All the available information suggests that the levels are so low as not to pose a risk to health.</P>
      <P>Despite the reassurance offered by this information, and having regard to the understandable public concern about the issue, my Department has asked the health boards to arrange to have samples of baby milks on sale in Ireland analysed.  The Food Safety Advisory Board will review the results, when available, and will be asked to advise on any action deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>My Department is, meanwhile, keeping the matter under continuous review.</P>

      <P>An application was received from Galway County Council in December 1994, under the EU co-financed scheme, for a grant of £75,000 to carry out a feasibility study to evaluate this project.  The project was not selected for funding in 1995 and the council did not put forward an application for funding in 1996.</P>
      <P>It is open to the council to consider whether to resubmit the proposal for funding in 1997 under the EU co-financed grants scheme.  The selection of projects under this scheme is made on the basis of compliance with the strict EU eligibility criteria governing the scheme, the priority attaching to different projects, the needs of different areas and the limited funds available.  In this connection, I am advised that a recent review of this project, carried out on behalf of the county council, concluded that the project cannot be considered economically feasible.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995, provide that a licensing authority must give notice of its intention to make a determination to grant new taxi licences, or wheelchair accessible taxi licences, in one or more newspapers circulating in its functional area. The notice must indicate a final date for receipt of written representations which must be at least one month after publication of the notice.</P>
      <P>Licensing authorities must also consult with the Garda Commissioner and any other local authority where part of the latter's functional area forms part of the taximeter area.  Before making a decision in relation to the proposed determination, a licensing authority must consider any representations and observations which it has received.</P>

      <P>Provisional figures compiled by the National Safety Council indicate that there were 77 accidental water deaths in 1995.  No more recent figures are available in my Department.  The promotion of water safety is a function of the local authorities and the National Safety Council.  The role of the local authorities includes making by laws for the regulation of bathing and bathing places, the employment of life guards, the provision of equipment and appliances for life saving and arranging for instruction in swimming and life saving.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council actively promotes the dissemination of information on water safety, liaises with the Department of Education on water safety matters for school children, issues guidelines for local authorities on water safety matters and through local committees, organises and supports swimming and life saving courses.  More than 80,000 persons were awarded certificates for attendance at such courses in 1995.</P>

      <P>The manufacture of artificial fertilisers is a licensable activity under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  It is, accordingly, a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency to determine appropriate pollution controls in respect of all emissions and discharges from activities of this kind, which impact on the environment.  The agency may not grant a licence unless it is satisfied, <i>inter alia,</i> that best available technology not entailing excessive costs will be used so as to prevent, or eliminate, or where that is not practicable, to limit, abate or reduce an emission from the activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the fertiliser manufacturing process which gives rise to fluoride by-product waste is no longer used in this country.  Fluoride levels in surface waters intended for the abstraction of drinking water are monitored by sanitary authorities.  Results are significantly below the limits set in the European Communities (Quality of Surface Water Intended for the Abstraction of Drinking Water) Regulations, 1989 which give effect here to Council Directive <Col N="2234" /> 75/440/EEC.  In order to achieve the optimum level for the prevention of tooth decay &mdash; one part of fluoride per million parts of water in accordance with the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960 &mdash; it is necessary for sanitary authorities to supplement naturally occurring fluoride levels by the addition of fluoride to drinking water supplies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the case made by the school in question in support of its application for a remedial teacher service in 1995.  The needs of this school were considered when 55 remedial posts were allocated at that time.  Unfortunately, the needs of the school were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant its inclusion on that occasion.  I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs <Col N="2237" /> can be addressed within available resources.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
    <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question. However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>The latest data on road accidents prepared by the National Roads Authority shows that, in 1994, the number of motor vehicle accidents of all types increased by 4 per cent over the 1993 level.  For young drivers in the 18 to 34 years age brackets the NRA statistics also show that they represented over 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal accidents in 1994.</P>
      <P>The analysis provided by the sixth report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board showed that claims frequency declines as age of policyholder increases for all types of cover.  The analysis also showed that, in terms of relative claims costs, the 17 to 24 year old policy holders are a worse risk than those aged 25 to 30, who in turn are a worse risk than those aged over 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has indicated that the preliminary findings of the draft consultancy report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland <Col N="2240" /> provides further evidence of the high cost of claims associated with the young driver.  For example, I understand that the analysis demonstrates that the average cost of an insurance claim for a 17 to 24 year old driver is over twice that for a 36 to 40 year old driver and, based on claims estimates, the figures indicate that the younger age group is responsible for over three times the claims costs applicable to the 36 to 40 age group.  The relative cost of premiums for the young driver would tend to reflect that overall differential</P>

      <P>Any applicant who presented cows under the 1995 suckler cow premium scheme which belonged to a meat breed or born of a cross with a meat breed and who already had declared these breeds on the application form were not penalised. These animals were not paid on but deleted from the claim because the EU Regulations governing the suckler cow premium scheme specify that only &ldquo;cows belonging to meat breeds&rdquo; are eligible for the scheme and consequently could not be paid premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, applicants who in 1994 declared cows as not belonging to meat breeds but in 1995 declared the same cows as belonging to meat breeds were <Col N="2242" /> inspected.  If the animals presented at the inspection did not belong to a meat breed as declared then those applicants were penalised.  The number of farmers penalised for this specific reason under the 1995 suckler cow premium scheme was 554.</P>

      <P>Connemara ponies qualify for assistance under a comprehensive range of measures at present in place and I have no proposals to introduce any new grant schemes for them.  Connemara ponies are eligible for assistance under the following schemes which were introduced under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99: quality stallion purchase scheme, quality brood mare retention scheme and stallion performance testing scheme.  A number of grants will be allocated specifically to Connemara ponies under the quality brood mare retention scheme.</P>
      <P>Owners of registered Connemara mares in disadvantaged areas may also be eligible for headage payments.  Eligible applicants qualify for payments of £70 for each of the first eight mares and £66 for each of the next 22 mares i.e. possible payments up to a maximum of £2,012.</P>

      <P>The anticipated total final cost of the consultancy is expected to be of the order of £3.5 million including estimated expenses but excluding VAT.  The basic fee has been fixed at an agreed amount and is being paid on a monthly basis for the duration of the consultancy but subject to the overall maximum fixed fee. When the alliance deal is completed the balance of the fee, if any, owing to the advisers will be paid.  The consultancy contract includes no provision for a &ldquo;success fee&rdquo;.  The total of fees and expenses invoiced to date is £1,441,077 (excluding VAT)</P>
      <P>In the event that an alliance deal is not finalised and that the contract with the Government's advisers is terminated, the State would be liable to pay fees and expenses accrued up to the date of termination of the consultancy contract.  The advisers may however, in certain circumstances, be entitled to recover the full fee under the contract in the event that an alliance deal is concluded within one year of termination of their contract.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to a question put down by the Deputy on 28 May 1996 I have no function in relation to the creation or filling of any positions in State bodies under the aegis of my Department apart from making appointments to the boards of these bodies.  I am not aware of any reason I should investigate any such appointments, or of conflicts of interests arising. The other issues referred to by the Deputy are operational matters for the State bodies, in which I have no function.</P>
