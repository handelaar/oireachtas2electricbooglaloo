      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12 and 13, Financial Resolutions re Finance Bill, 1996; No. 15, Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996 [Seanad] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 16, Metrology Bill, 1996 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 17, Statements on the Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 12 and 13 shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair; and (2) Private Members' Business shall be No. 28 &mdash; motion re Dublin Light Rail, and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the criminal insanity Bill will be brought forward, as stated yesterday by the Minister for Justice.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House and the public that those who are not covered &mdash; we all understand the difficulties with retrospective legislation and I am not asking for such legislation &mdash; those whom the advisory group considers could create difficulties for the public, will be dealt with by way of Protocol or some other arrangement?  There is grave concern about some of the cases that may be outside the remit of the legislation.  Is the Taoiseach, the Attorney General or the advisory committee considering this matter and will provision be made in the legislation to cover those cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is concerned about and considering very carefully all these matters.  Protocols cannot override pre-existing statutory or common law rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will these cases, some of which are imminent, be dealt with in the legislation or will they be dealt with in advance of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is being considered on an ongoing basis in light of current concerns and that is done independently of any prospective legislation. It is important to recognise that it is not possible to affect pre-existing statutory rights retroactively by statute or Protocol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Bill on criminal insanity was moved in this House almost two years ago but was voted down.  We should learn lessons from that and be less keen to vote down Private <Col N="815" /> Members' Bills.  On the ongoing controversy surrounding Goldenbridge orphanage, does the Taoiseach accept it is not good enough that the only inquiry into this case has been carried out by RTE?  Is there an official inquiry into this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an appropriate matter for the Order of Business. The procedures for the Order of Business provide for answers in regard to promised legislation and there is no promised legislation on that issue.  In a matter of such importance affecting the lives of so many people, an off-the-cuff approach should not be adopted.  It is important that careful consideration be given to any suggestion on this matter. Raising the issue, therefore, on the Order of Business without notice is not necessarily the best way of approaching it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised on the Order of Business a number of weeks ago and, as the Taoiseach knows, many matters of public interest are raised on the Order of Business.  Last week, I raised the issue of the bomb in London and the Taoiseach responded on that occasion.  If a matter is in the public arena and if there is a major controversy surrounding it, it is important that there is some official response from the Government and that we do not leave the entire response to the media.</P>

      <P>Is the Government deliberately taking an anti-European attitude and why is the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications or the Minister of State not prepared to attend the European transport conference in Kilkenny next Friday at which a major initiative will be launched <Col N="816" /> and which will be attended by other European transport Ministers?</P>

Many people had put a great deal of effort into the preparation for these games.  Does it remain the wish of the Government that these games be held in some other country?</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach had time overnight to consider the request made from this side of the House yesterday that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications give a comprehensive report to the House on all matters relating to the allocation of the second mobile telephone licence, particularly those aspects regarding the European Union?  May we arrange a debate for this week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the matter.  The Minister has already reported extensively and repeatedly to the Dáil on this matter.  He is, however, happy to come before the Dáil and give this information again next Tuesday, if that can be agreed on the basis suggested by the Deputy.  The Minister is also willing to provide a short period for him to answer questions after he has made his original statement.  I want to stress two points.  The Minister has already reported extensively to the <Col N="818" /> House on this matter and has answered all questions put to him within the limits of the confidentiality arrangements entered into and agreed before the process opened.  It is important for people to recognise that this confidentiality must be respected both from the point of view of the successful and the unsuccessful bidders.  It would not be appropriate for information affecting individual bidders to become a matter of public discussion and knowledge.  That would be unfair to the bidders concerned and would represent a retrospective change in the conditions upon which they made their original bids.  The Minister will not answer questions nor will he voluntarily disclose information that contradicts the confidentiality arrangements freely entered into by those who participated in this competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  We will honour the arrangements to which I referred.  I am not particularly interested in the confidentiality aspect of this matter.  I fully understand what is written in contract law and what must be followed in that regard, but the allegations and innuendo relate more to what happened in the European Union and the relationship between the Minister's office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last spoke to the Bill, I wanted to set the record straight, particularly for the people in my constituency, in regard to the misinformation and misleading reporting in the local paper by a reporter who has since left the staff of that paper and attempted to gain a place on the Labour ticket in North Tipperary.  That puts into perspective his &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1994, it was claimed that the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, were responsible for keeping Irish Steel open.  I have no doubt they worked extremely hard to ensure Irish Steel did not close but I am aware also that they caused a great deal of concern <Col N="820" /> and dissension among the workforce because of their attitude towards the redundancy payments and the timing of same.  If they had been the people ultimately responsible for the decision on the payment of those redundancies, the workforce in Irish Steel would have voted against the package.  Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Leader of our party, entered the fray and decided that the redundancy payments were to be made within a reasonable time.  His word was welcomed and accepted by the members of the unions when I gave them the news.  That decision by Deputy Ahern paved the way for acceptance of the package.  Since then there has been a culture shock for many people in the Irish Steel area as they realise that if they had not changed many of the work practices which had been in operation for many years future prospects were nil.  Many of the workers say it is different now but they realise there was a need for change in work practices to meet the changed world economy, especially in the steel business.</P>
    <P>The management and staff work well together.  I hope they will continue to do so and that when the final deal is signed and Irish Steel is taken over by ISPAT new markets will be found in niche areas because the commodity market is overloaded.  When we consider the cost of production in eastern Europe, in the Far East and so on, it is clear that any western European country will have great difficulty in fighting in the commodity market.  My hope for the future is that there will be a place for Irish Steel in view of the amounts of money that have been put into that industry during the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise two points that are a cause of concern in the area, one of which we are all familiar with.  Everybody from the Minister and the civil servants to the public representatives in the constituency are aware of queries regarding the re-adaptation aid.  I am aware of the negotiations that have been taken place over a protracted period. The people who are waiting are getting more concerned day by day that <Col N="821" /> they will not receive the re-adaptation aid.  Perhaps the Minister will give an indication of what is happening and if it will be paid in the near future.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of a letter I received from the Minister dated 14 June 1995, in reply to my letter to him related to the Cobh and harbour area response group task force which was set up with a view to off setting the economic and employment effects of the restructuring of Irish Steel.  It stated: &ldquo;I have recently received the recommendation of the task force and I will be examining these recommendations in the near future&rdquo;.  I will be most interested to hear the findings of the task force.  Will the Minister be in a position to publish these recommendations in the near future?  As I said the last day, the one disappointment I had with the task force, which was supposed to cover the Cobh and harbour area response group &mdash; I had no objection to the people who were appointed &mdash; was that not one person was appointed from the Cobh area and the east Cork section of the harbour which spreads from Cork city to Roches Point and takes in Midleton, Whitegate and Aghada, except an RTE reporter from Cork.  However, there were no business people from the whole east Cork area.  Has the task force report been shelved and, if so, will the Minister tell us and let us get on with it rather than keeping us in suspense by saying he is reviewing the matter?</P>
    <P>I am pleased Irish Steel has not been closed and, because of the restructuring and the deal with ISPAT, I hope it will continue for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Michael Ahern's contribution, despite the fact that there has been almost a two week gap in the debate.  Having lived through the uncertainty of Irish Steel &mdash; before I was elected to this House &mdash; and the successful conclusion of the deal &mdash; after being elected &mdash; it is incredible that during his contribution he found it impossible to say a good deal was done.  To hear somebody cast further doubts on a good <Col N="822" /> deal which is now almost 12 months old will cause further worry and fears for the people in Cobh and Irish Steel.  They should not have to endure those unnecessary fears because they had an incredibly bad time while arriving at the solution.  I assure them as I am sure Deputies from Cork city and county wish to assure them, that all the negotiations and co-operation were not in vain.  We are now merely discussing the finality of putting in place the deal which was arrived at in relation to ISPAT.  When people speak in the House they forget that those directly concerned are listening and will worry if they hear any note of caution.</P>
      <P>It was a good deal and was arrived at with the co-operation of the workforce. The management package was the result of enormous effort by Government Departments, Pat Dineen and the unions involved.  At the end of the day they came to an agreement which was turned down by the UK Government and had again to be fought for.  The announcement last year and the deal concluded with ISPAT marked the beginning of a new era for Irish Steel and the region.  Deputies from Cork city will rightly say that many people will benefit apart from those working in Irish Steel and in the Cobh area.  Representations came from all areas and the unions were extremely concerned.  This was the first sign of modern thinking I had witnessed in relation to co-operation in how to solve an industrial problem which was outside our control.  It was done very efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The uncertainty which has hung over the future of Irish Steel since the early 1980s has had an adverse effect on the economic confidence and activity not only in Cobh but in the region.  From time to time the anxiety lessened and Cobh came on in leaps and bounds.  It had its heritage centre and environmental schemes.  Everyone admits Cobh is a beautiful, thriving town.  The Cork area has had to contend with multiple job losses in the past decade.  However, with the welcome development of 200 dockside jobs, this Government is having <Col N="823" /> some success in reversing the trend. Cobh has always had a thriving harbour industry as well as Irish Steel, the loss of which would have been the final straw for the area.</P>
    <P>ISPAT, with a reputation that is second to none, will be able to make Irish Steel a viable industry. It will harness the commitment of the workers which is no longer in doubt and find a niche market for its products.  There are already indications that the company is heading into a new era.  Great credit is due to this Government, in particular to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who with their officials worked tirelessly not only to secure the ISPAT deal but also to secure UK agreement for the aid package.</P>
    <P>The decline in employment in Irish Steel from 1,000 two decades ago mirrors a similar decline in other European plants.  It was obvious for some time that cost reductions and restructuring measures would have to be implemented if the company's long-term future were to be guaranteed.  It was also obvious to Democratic Left that the price for this would have to be a guarantee for the future of the workforce who bent over backwards to put together this deal.  This was the first time I witnessed successful modern union/management co-operation.  Other industries should learn from this.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left is not prepared to accept a US style down-sizing ethos which views workers as expendable and merely incidental to the business of making money.  The Government has overseen the transfer to Irish Steel from State to private ownership in a manner that will ensure the protection of the workforce.  The ISPAT deal heralds a new era of constructive partnership between the semi-State sector and overseas companies which have the ethos and track record to make a significant contribution to Irish industrial development. We should not be fearful of this. We did not know a great deal about <Col N="824" /> ISPAT before it became involved in the Irish steel industry but we now know that companies with good international records are prepared to work as efficiently here as in their own countries.</P>
    <P>In seeking to secure agreement for the aid package that would guarantee the future of Irish Steel, the Government had to overcome persistent objections from the UK, which put forward the strongest, most persistent and arrogant objection I have ever witnessed from one EU country opposing a package in another.  The restrictions on production and export imposed by the EU are due mainly to UK fears that a rejuvenated Irish Steel might pose a threat to British Steel.  That marks the respect with which ISPAT is held in the steel industry.  British Steel and the UK Government are well aware of ISPAT's reputation and know it can and will make Irish Steel a viable industry.  This was a peculiar decision of the Tories who continually promote free competition, deregulation and non-interference in the market.  They sought to impose conditions designed to render Irish Steel uncompetitive, but I have no doubt the company will overcome those restrictions and carve out a distinctive and profitable niche for itself in European and world markets, where ISPAT has a good track record and the right connections.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that the problems encountered by Irish Steel in recent years are part of a wider difficulty confronting the European steel industry in general.  Democratic Left has long argued for the formulation of a common European industrial policy which would control State aids to the richer central regions of the European Union.  This has been the case for the agriculture industry since the end of the Second World War and, despite what we would like to believe, agriculture is a minority industry.  Many jobs are under threat because of the current difficulties in the agricultural industry and the entire EU thinking process is concentrated on solving those problems and <Col N="825" /> bailing farmers out of their present difficulties. Solutions will be found. However, there is not a similar level of concentration in the EU on creating, supporting and protecting jobs in the industrial sector.  We should readjust our thinking and concentrate on areas in which jobs can be created.  We should adopt policies that provide equal protection, support and resources for the agricultural and industrial sectors.  This is a rational and logical argument, not an urban versus rural one.</P>
    <P>How do we propose to solve the major unemployment problem of, for example, Cork North-Central?  There is an 80 per cent unemployment rate in six areas in the country and, apart from some Government measures, the EU does not have a centralised plan to deal with such problems.  However, it can plough vast amounts of money into other areas.  How can I explain to the unemployed, low waged or those earning a reasonably good wage in Cork North-Central that on average they pay £20 per week to support farmers?  Agriculture is a minority industry, and argument regularly made by the IFA who continually inform us about the number of people leaving the land.  Why have we not listened?  Why is the agricultural sector still getting more attention and funding than other sectors?</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that it no longer employs 1,000 people, Irish Steel is vital to the Cork region and the deal that has been secured will guarantee jobs for the workers.  The collapse of Irish Steel would have wreaked havoc on the lives of many families.  Now that we have a problem in the beef industry, which is not of the PAYE workers' making but which they need to be concerned about because it involves a consumer product, there is total co-operation within the EU.  In regard to Irish Steel, further barriers were put up.  Why is there never such co-operation when it comes to industrial policy and the industrial sector? Why do politicians not realise that the major sector in this country is the sector seeking to provide employment in industry?  When are we going to put <Col N="826" /> the type of thinking, resources and concentrated effort into the industrial sector that is now being put into agriculture? We will have it when the industrial sector gets its act together and starts employing people to make its arguments in the same way as farmers do.</P>
    <P>The development of a common industrial policy is vital to regional development and to ensuring that jobs are created and maintained on the periphery rather than concentrated in the centre. We should not lose sight of the fact that the European Union has its origins in the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community after World War II.  Nearly half a century ago the founding fathers of modern Europe recognised the centrality of coal and steel in securing the Continent's economic development.  That has not greatly changed.  Our problem is that we are on the periphery and it is necessary to discriminate in favour of peripheral countries like Ireland who need extra help and who are at present being represented by groups in Europe who keep telling the commissioners and the parliament that our major industry is agriculture. It is not.  Urban unemployment is the problem.  It is a problem of neglect, of deliberate inaction, and we need to start talking about that.</P>
    <P>Competition and intervention are not mutually exclusive.  The challenge facing us is to develop a common policy which will ensure that location is not a bar to competition and which enables all industries to compete on a level playing pitch.  That is not what happened regarding Irish Steel.  Irish Steel, from now on, will not be playing on a level pitch.  It will be playing with a handicap imposed by the EU at the behest of Britain.  We only just got that deal through.  Were it not for two of the more capable Ministers in this House we probably would not have done so.  It appeared, from time to time, that there were people who, because they were on the Opposition Benches, would have preferred Irish Steel to close rather than save jobs.</P>

      <P>The deal that was done for Irish Steel was of benefit to the workers, to the management and to the region.  It is a deal that will secure their future inasmuch as anything can be secured today.  It is the best deal that could have been done, and it was done quietly, with great force, with great passion and with a dedication that I have seldom seen in relation to the Cork region.  It is hoped that that kind of dedication and concern in relation to the Cork region will continue because we need to have commitment to a region that has been much neglected over the past few years.  For whatever reason, when companies were closing there was no urgency to save them and secure jobs.  Sometimes there was just a headline in the paper.  What we should be looking at is the misery of people's lives.  No effort should be spared to ensure that jobs are protected.  This was a good deal.  It would have been better had we not had restrictions imposed. Nevertheless, it was the best in the circumstances. I wish Irish Steel, ISPAT and the people of the Cork region the best of luck in the future.  I am sure that with our support they will do extremely well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their contributions to the Second Stage debate on the Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996.  The Government's plan to sell off the shares of Irish Steel Limited to ISPAT has the support of all parties in the House, which is an indication of the good will towards the Irish Steel and its future development under the control of ISPAT.  During the Second Stage debate on 3 April and again today a number of Deputies raised some important points which I would like to respond to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> Deputy Ned O'Keeffe referred to the explanatory and financial memorandum accompanying the Bill which states that the shares of Irish Steel Limited will be sold to ISPAT Mexicana.  Deputy O'Keeffe has been under the impression, from previous statements and publicity, that Irish Steel shares would be sold to ISPAT International. An explanation of the relationship between ISPAT International and ISPAT Mexicana is therefore called for and should allay any fears the Deputy might have on this point.</P>
    <P>Following a restructuring of the ISPAT Group in recent years, ISPAT International was formed to represent the non-Indian ISPAT companies under the direction of Mr. Lakshmi Mittal. ISPAT International is owned and controlled by Mr. Mittal who runs it from Jakarta in Indonesia with a 30-strong head office team with a strong financial control mandate.  There are five major companies within ISPAT International &mdash; ISPAT Mexicana of Mexico, PT ISPAT Indo of Indonesia, Sidbec Dosco (ISPAT) Limited of Canada, Caribbean ISPAT of Trinidad and Hamburger Stahlwerke of Germany.  ISPAT International co-ordinates and integrates the activities of all the units in steel making, research and development, human resource development, centralised purchasing, global marketing, integrated finance etc.  ISPAT Mexicana is the largest company within ISPAT International in terms of assets and turnover. In 1995 the assets of ISPAT Mexicana represented approximately 70 per cent of all the assets of the ISPAT International Group and its turnover in 1995 represented approximately 30 per cent of the turnover of the group.  In the light of the above information, Deputy O'Keeffe will appreciate that ISPAT Mexicana was the appreciate vehicle for the purchase of the Irish Steel shares and I can confirm that it was Mr. Mittal who signed the agreement for the sale of all the Irish Steel shares on 6 September last on behalf of ISPAT Mexicana.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> Deputy Ned O'Keeffe also referred to the fact that the guarantees by ISPAT in relation to employment and production relate to a five year period only and wondered what will happen thereafter.  As the Minister for Enterprise and Employment made clear in his Second Stage speech on 3 April, the future of the Irish Steel/ISPAT project should be bright but future success cannot be taken for granted and will have to be worked for.  The international steel industry is extremely competitive and the Irish Steel/ISPAT project will have to compete vigorously in that environment.  There will be difficult years ahead mainly because of the cyclical nature of the steel industry, to which Deputy Ned O'Keeffe referred at some length in his contribution.  However, if all the elements of Irish Steel pull together towards established objectives, the probability of success will be increased.  It will be up to the ISPAT organisation, the new management of Irish Steel, the workforce of the company and the unions to ensure that Irish Steel continues to play an important part in the economy of the local Cork area.  It follows that, in future, Irish Steel will have to survive by itself and develop outside the State sector.</P>
    <P>The position concerning the penalty clause is that, under the contract signed on 6 September last, which will be the subject of a supplemental agreement to be signed on or about 30 April &mdash; mainly to take account of the restrictions on production and sales necessary to overcome United Kingdom objections at European level &mdash; ISPAT will give a contractual commitment to employ a minimum of 300 full-time workers in Irish Steel for the first five years of its ownership of the company. The contractual commitment with ISPAT also provides that it will pay the State specified liquidated damages in the event of the number of full-time workers falling below 300.  The original figure was 331 but, because of the restrictions imposed on the Irish Steel/ISPAT project to overcome <Col N="830" /> United Kingdom objections, that figure had to be revised downward.</P>
    <P>In both Houses the Minister for Enterprise and Employment stated that of the five parties identified as being interested in purchasing Irish Steel, all save one were interested in purchasing 100 per cent of the shares only.  All the options in relation to the sale of the shares of Irish Steel Limited to private concern were considered by my Department, the Department of Finance, IBI Corporate Finance Ltd., as the State advisers and by the Cabinet subcommittee formed to oversee the sale process. All recommended that negotiations be opened with ISPAT for the purchase of all Irish Steel shares.</P>
    <P>When the sale of the Irish Steel shares to ISPAT is finalised, the new company will operate as a commercial entity.  Its activities will not be monitored by my Department except as provided for in the agreement, for example, details of permanent employment at the plant for the five year period to which I referred will be obtained in the context of the penalty clause; details concerning the implementation of the investment programme by ISPAT of £20 million over a six year period will be monitored and, as long as the Government guarantees in relation to loans provided to Irish Steel by ACC Bank plc and the European Coal and Steel Community remains in place, the Irish Steel/ISPAT project will be obliged to submit detailed financial accounts to my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe also referred to the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question on 25 January 1996 when he mentioned a potential further Exchequer cash contribution of £2.445 million in respect of possible residual costs and financial claims arising from the activities of Irish Steel in the past.  I confirm that the matter was discussed by the State negotiators with Irish Steel/ISPAT when it was agreed to provide Irish Steel/ISPAT with an up-front cash payment in lieu of indemnities in respect of possible residual taxation and other costs and financial claims arising <Col N="831" /> from the past.  The Minister gave this information to both Houses in the debates on the Irish Steel Limited Bill and the amount of £2.445 million is incorporated in the State's contribution of £20,273,500.  The amount of £2.360 million provided in the latter figure for the funding of necessary environmental and other remedial work by Irish Steel/ISPAT relates to the installation of a metal recovery plant in connection with the management of the tiphead, to the construction of a retaining wall for the tiphead, to the treatment of sewage and scale water discharge and other remedial matters for the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mulvihill and Michael Ahern raised the issue of re-adaptation aid from the EU Commission for certain workers of Irish Steel made redundant in 1994-95.  As the Minister for Enterprise and Employment mentioned in the House on 27 February and 26 March last, his Department received a communication from the European Union Commission in Brussels confirming that the Commission had approved grant aid &mdash; under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty &mdash; amounting to ecu 376,806 for 194 workers made redundant in 1994-95.  A number of aspects of the Commission's decision, and the conditions attached thereto, have to be clarified by my Department before any payment can be made by the European Union Commission.  My Department has been in touch with the Commission but it will be some months before all such matters are clarified.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mulvihill, Bradford and Michael Ahern also raised the matter of the publication of the Cobh and Harbour Area Response Group.  As the Minister mentioned to the House on 28 February last, he has received its report and recommendations.  As not all its recommendations could be implemented solely by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, it was necessary to consult the Ministers for Finance, the Environment, Defence, the Marine and Transport, Energy and <Col N="832" /> Communications on their possible implementation.  In recent months progress has been made in establishing the position of various Departments on the recommendations of that response group on which the Minister for Enterprise and Employment expects to make an announcement early next month.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Lynch will forgive me if I do not now follow her down the road of a major discussion on industrial policy. The objective is to conclude discussion on this Bill.  I want to thank especially Deputies Ned O'Keeffe and Quill and their parties for their co-operation in facilitating its passage today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> In page 3, line 16, after &ldquo;company&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which is ISPAT International&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the remarks of the Minister of State about Indonesia and Jakarta as being the headquarters of a subsidiary company and about other subsidiaries in Mexico, Canada, Trinidad and Germany, I consider my argument justified.  Why was the Canadian or German subsidiary not chosen? Bearing in mind that we are always concerned with having a stable economy and minimising uncertainty, it is obvious that there is merit in my argument, that the parent company should be the sole owner of the operation.  On a mere geographic basis I am now convinced that my fears may well be justified.  I have never been a believer in any operation being hived off to a subsidiary, especially in the case of international business.</P>
    <P>While our steel business is relatively small, exporting something in the region of 85 per cent of production at Cobh, I must express my concern at the amalgamation. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on why departmental officials in the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment saw merit in amalgamating our operations with a company with headquarters in Indonesia, whereas subsidiaries in two other more progressive countries like Canada and Germany were not considered more appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why Deputy Ned O'Keeffe wants clarity on this seemingly important question.  As a businessman of some stature, he understands better than most in this House the nature of an international company. The entire attraction of this particular company was its international reputation in the marketplace.  It was the recommendation of those looking at the alternatives open to us at the time we made the decision to sell.  Whereas we may have had certain preferences &mdash; which may not have been unlike the preferences articulated by Deputy Ned <Col N="834" /> O'Keeffe just now &mdash; the company is structured in such a fashion that its very extensive assets, something in excess of £3 billion, are vested in the various operational companies and 70 per cent of that entire asset holding is vested in this company, ISPAT Mexicana.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe understands the difficulty and the amount of time and effort that went into securing this agreement but at the end of the day we really were not in a position to dictate to an international company how it structures its affairs.  Whereas we may have had our own preference, the fact is that 70 per cent of the assets are held by this company and it has been deemed to be the appropriate company on which we will be given this negative pledge that is the subject of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's amendment.  I hope that reassures the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that ISPAT International is highly capitalised and looks to be a wealthy company.  Were its other subsidiaries considered?  As the Minister knows, it is quite easy to close down a subsidiary while the main company continues to operate.  I make this point because the economies of countries that can be destabilised are not strong.  Were efforts made to enter into an agreement with other subsidiaries of the parent company such as the Canadian or German subsidiaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The honest answer to Deputy O'Keeffe's question is yes, we did look at the alternative subsidiaries and a number of points need to be made about that.  First, none of the subsidiaries has assets commensurate with ISPAT Mexicana, which is by far the predominant operating company in the group.  Second, our preference was the Canadian subsidiary, although it is not nearly as substantial as ISPAT Mexicana, but it did not prove feasible for a number of reasons to persuade the purchasers to agree to it.  We did not examine too seriously the German subsidiary because of the entitlements between the <Col N="835" /> German company and the European Union and we were advised that was not the road to go down.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see why a company that has 70 per cent of its assets vested in the Mexican subsidiary ought not be acceptable, having regard to the track record and reputation of the international group in this business, which is what attracted us in the first instance.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, there are five or six different elements comprising that payment of £15,028,500. This was dealt with on Second Stage and I do not interpret the Deputy's question as asking me to go through them again.  The nub of the reply he is seeking is that if we can conclude this agreement as hoped around 30 April 1996, the moneys will be paid over immediately on completion.</P>

      <P>Pension fund funding may be very contentious and in recent times we have seen that <Col N="836" /> employees have been victims.  The section states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may pay the sum of £628,000 to the trustees of the staff pension fund and on receipt thereof the said trustees shall pay the said sum into that fund.</P>
      <P>Are there any outstanding moneys owed to the pension fund or is it up to date?  Is the Minister happy with the information he has on the fund?  There may be a day when things will not be favourable to the company and I do now want to see the employees in my constituency being denied their maximum entitlement because of a shortfall or difficulties that may prevail in the international company which would not have the same commitment as a wholly owned Irish company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I would go so far as to say that it is not unusual but it certainly happens that deficits in pension funds are occasionally uncovered which are to the detriment of the employees concerned.  I do not think that is necessarily the case here.  The due diligence process threw up this sum and there is nothing unusual in the fact that there are arrears in the context of the workforce.  It is not really that serious a matter.  The requirement is that it be made good and this was done as a result of discussions with the trustees who are quite separate from Irish Steel ISPAT.  As I understand it, the moneys relate to the non-staff element of the workforce.  I believe this sum makes up the deficit identified and the trustees are satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>There can be weaknesses in the reporting system and &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; are much abused words in the business sector, especially when mergers, amalgamations and rationalisations take place.  This company is transferring from the public to the private sector and all State control is being lost.  My fear is for the approximately 400 people employed there.  Should anything happen, what security have they with regard <Col N="837" /> to the funding of their pensions and what commitment is there as a result of international involvement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing different in this case from the regime that applies generally for the establishment of pension funds for employees in the private sector.  The task in this case was to make good an identified deficit.  What manner of pension scheme continues thereafter &mdash; I have no advice that it will change from the existing pension scheme &mdash; is a matter for the workers and management at Cobh.  Usually these matters are managed by a pension fund company and have little to do with local management other than the transfer of the cheque.  Not all companies do that on the appointed day, but it is usually reconciled at the end of the year.  In this case, pension contributions are being managed by a pension fund outside the company and there ought not to be any difficulty arising from that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;A consultation process shall be established by the Minister between the purchaser and representatives of the staff of Irish Steel to ensure that the workforce are kept informed of developments in relation to the mill.  The Minister shall retain the right to appoint representatives to the consultation committee which will be established by agreement between ISPAT International and the group of unions at Irish Steel.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment must be accepted.  It is important for the security of the workforce and the company that consultation and information are available at all times on an easy going basis, rather than <Col N="838" /> obliging the workforce to force information from the company.  Some type of arrangement should be put in place.  I expect to have the Minister of State's support for this amendment.  He understands good labour relations and business practice.  The amendment is attractive and reasonable and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When the sale of Irish Steel shares to ISPAT is finalised the new company will operate as a commercial entity and the activities will not be monitored by my Department except as provided for in the sale and purchase agreement.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to become involved in a consultation process such as that suggested by the Deputy.  I have mentioned previously the importance of good industrial relations for the future success of the Irish Steel/ISPAT project, and a voluntary consultation process between the new owners and their management and the workers and their unions on the lines suggested by the Deputy would be beneficial and might be pursued by the unions and workers with Irish Steel/ISPAT.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the good sense of Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment is accepted.  I heard his constituency colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, refer to the culture shock that might occur in Cork when this agreement is completed in the near future.  There may well be such a culture shock, which makes the good sense of Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment all the more valuable.  However, there are good procedures in place at present. According to the main trade union concerned, they will be in place on a voluntary basis under the new management. That is the way it must be done; we could not intrude into the affairs of a private company and dictate what type of consultative process ought to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the purchase agreement there are specific matters in which the Department will be involved in terms of supervising their implementation.  However, <Col N="839" /> in the matter of industrial relations we could not impose a system of consultation on the company.  Such a system will work equally effectively on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage a consultation committee being set up in his Department to keep the financial structure in place and to protect the Department's investment of about £35 million?  I understand the Minister will have a say for five years in the company.  The State investment represents a substantial amount of taxpayers' money and they are entitled to some protection.  Would the Minister consider having representatives from his Department on such a consultation committee?  In other words, it would be a subsidiary of the Irish subsidiary with a board comprising representatives from his Department and from the company. If necessary it could have an independent chairman.</P>
      <P>I am trying to be helpful.  I do not want to come back to the House in two years time for another battle about Irish Steel.  I am concerned about the involvement of a large multinational company. We are small fry and this company has a turnover of billions of pounds.  I welcome its arrival in Ireland and its involvement in Irish Steel.  However, I am obliged to protect the taxpayers, the employees who are my constituents and the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to nothing Deputy O'Keeffe has said.  However, the notion of enshrining the concept of consultation in respect of a private company in legislation is not feasible.  The procedures applying at the plant are better than consultation and are likely to continue to be better.  It would not acknowledge the Irish political and industrial relations culture if I were to give Deputy O'Keeffe the impression that should anything go wrong in the future &mdash; I hope nothing will &mdash; the doors of the Department of Enterprise and Employment would be permanently <Col N="840" /> closed against the representatives of the workers or the management.  The Deputy would be disinclined to believe me.</P>
      <P>I do not see a difficulty in this matter. There are good relations between senior officials in the Department, the trade unions concerned and the management. Many hours were spent behind closed doors hammering out this agreement. The environment Deputy O'Keeffe advocates already exists and, I hope will continue to exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the spirit of the Minister of State's comments but I must look to the future.  We live in an age when things change rapidly and we are dealing with an industry that is cyclical in nature.  It has its ups and downs and will continue to have them.  The Minister of State is more familiar with the economic statements of Adam Smith than I and he has been involved in the trade union movement.  He has seen what can happen to businesses and to all those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions have taken a very responsible stand in this matter.  I know Jim O'Connell and Anne Egar, the two trade union representatives involved, quite well and I know Jim O'Connell of MANDATE exceptionally well.  They have been most responsible and willing to defend the employees and to ensure that the company was restructured. Many sacrifices had to be made.  I do not see why some effort cannot be made to set up a consultation committee made up of representatives from the company, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the unions to protect a State investment of taxpayers' money. My demand is reasonable and should not fall on deaf ears rather it should go beyond here.  I have experience of the private sector.  I admire the leadership shown by the trade union movement in this area.  It could have adopted a different approach, but by implementing the measures it and others suggested it faced the charge and defended the workers, the industry and its future.  It co-operated with all those involved.  I <Col N="841" /> pay tribute to Jim O'Connell of MANDATE and Anne Egar of SIPTU for what they achieved.  It is not a major demand to request that a consultation committee be set up even on a voluntary basis, if it cannot be established by statute, to assist in protecting the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>That, rather than establishing the theoretical framework, is arguably more relevant to this debate.  I accept what Deputy O'Keeffe said about the role of Anne Egar, SIPTU and MANDATE in facilitating this resolution. I would be doing Anne Egar and her union colleagues a disservice if I were to hold out the prospect to them of a committee as somehow being helpful and encouraging that they maintain the umbilical cord with Kildare Street.  I am not sure that is the best way forward for this company.  I believe the best way forward is to establish procedures to facilitate direct consultation at local level between the management and the unions to protect the future of this plant.  I believe that will happen and it will be the most effective way of ensuring what Deputy O'Keeffe wants to achieve.</P>

      <P>The opposite is the case.  The continuation of the repayments on the two loans concerned is at issue.  If the new Irish Steel/ISPAT organisation fails to discharge those responsibilities, arrangements are made in the Bill to ensure that the moneys concerned will be passed over to the State in the event of it having liability to discharge those loans.  It is merely a prudent provision to ensure that in the event of unforeseen circumstances or something going badly wrong the Minister concerned is able to discharge those two loans.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party I wish to say that the enactment of this Bill will mark a major milestone in the troubled history of Irish Steel.  It has been privatised successfully and is now a commercial body that will have to make its way in the world, and I have every confidence that it will.  That reflects the spirit adopted by those, in this House, who have been involved in one way or another in the transaction in the past number of years.  We must approach this matter with confidence and wish the new company well.  This major change was not brought about without growing pains.  It was the outcome of many generous, long and difficult negotiations, particularly between the management and the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the independent chairman, Mr. Pat Dineen, who steered the transaction through some of its most difficult stages and who did so with great patience, intelligence and goodwill. I also pay due tribute to the unions. Anne Egar of SIPTU and Jim O'Connell of MANDATE were already praised by Deputy O'Keeffe and the Minister and that praise is well deserved.  Irish Steel was marked by old work practices and lines of demarcation that were almost cast in tablets of stone. It required a major cultural change to adopt new work practices and to introduce the new procedures now in place. That was a long, painful and difficult <Col N="844" /> process.  Great credit is due to the workers who responded to the leadership given by their unions.  They made sacrifices and played their part in bringing about these changed practices and procedures.  It was because that happened the Government was put in a position where it could seek a purchaser for Irish Steel.  That is the sequence of events.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation of the work done by Pat Dineen, Louis Buckley, others in management and, in particular, the unions and workforce in bringing about this situation.  I pay due and full tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  Let us not forget that he played a major role in the earlier part of this transaction and negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is a great relief that the industry has been saved, but we must not forget that to save it a number of jobs have been shed and lost.  I clearly remember a time when there were 1,000 people working in Irish Steel, many of them from my constituency.  I am slow to cite figures, but the size of the current workforce is about 346.  That presents us with a number of challenges.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mnentioned the re-adaptation payments expected by those made redundant in 1994 and 1995. I urge him to work hard to bring whatever bureaucratic measures have to be taken to a successful finalisation.  Those made redundant have an expectation that the payments will be made sooner rather than later.  Unless and until that is done we cannot say that the transaction has been brought to a successful conclusion.  I ask the Minister of State to apply his energies to ensure that the Government is in a position to make the payments.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on the Cobh region should be finalised as quickly as possible and its recommendations acted upon.  The putting in place of this transaction of necessity involved the shedding and loss of jobs.  There is an obligation on all of us to make up for <Col N="845" /> that shortfall which is still being felt in the region.</P>
    <P>While we have every good reason to be confident about the outcome of this deal and grateful that Irish Steel seems to have been put on a fine and firm commercial footing, a recent survey in my constituenty of Cork North-Central carried out by a reputable social scientist confirmed that in the past 12 months there has been a 2 per cent reduction in the number of jobs in the constituency. This goes against what appears to be the national trend.  In congratulating ourselves this morning, therefore, there is little scope for complacency and we must use all our energies to address this problem.  It is frightening that a constituency which already suffers from higher than average unemployment should in the past 12 months have experienced a 2 per cent reduction in the number of those employed.</P>
    <P>Those are the tasks we face &mdash; the finalisation of the re-adaptation payments, the implementation of the feasible recommendations of the task force and addressing the high level of unemployment in the area.  A good day's work has been done for Irish Steel and I repeat my congratulations to all those who worked in close co-operation to bring about this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for taking and concluding all Stages of this important legislation which will affect the lives of many people in my constituency. I am glad we have reached finality.  The steel business is and will always be a difficult one.  Like any commodity business, it has encountered difficulties and created problems during the years.  I have no doubt that there are difficult days ahead and we may have to come back to the House again, but I wish the company, now fully privatised, every success in its new environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was difficult for the Minister of State to swallow the bitter pill of total privatisation on which he holds strong views.  I do not have the same difficulties. I am great believer in privatisation <Col N="846" /> which is the way forward for many of our State companies.  It is a source of finance for the Exchequer and gives people an opportunity to invest.  We have many viable State companies and should consider the issue seriously.  Now that the Minister of State has accepted the principle of privatisation &mdash; we will sort out the problem for him on another day &mdash; I am a litle nervous about what is to come in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Exports account for 85 per cent of the company's business.  This makes it all the more vulnerable.  It is small in the Irish context and deserves all the support it can get.  I have paid tribute to all involved, particularly in the trade union movement.  The company is of enormous benefit in the Cobh area in terms of the service industry and we are well aware of its difficulties.  The area has suffered during the years.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Deputy there have been many tragedies in the industrial sector in the Cork region.  We lost the Verolme Dockyard which is to be reconstituted in a restructured form with a smaller workforce.  I wish it well. We also lost Ford and Dunlop, two flagship industries, with the result that we have no motor assembly or manufacturing industry.  Neither is there any tyre manufacturing industry in Cork or the Munster region.</P>
    <P>I feel envious when Ford sets up manufacturing outlets in other parts of the European Union and throughout the world but does not feel duty bound to establish such a unit here.  We are in an age of specialisation.  It manufactures various models of cars in different countries and I fail to understand why it cannot manufacture a single model here, given that we have a well educated and honest workforce.  That is what manufacturing industry needs.  We have those ingredients as well as the required capital and land.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback by Deputy Kathleen Lynch's statement about Fianna Fáil.  The party was unanimous and there was not a single dissenting voice from 1993 onwards.  Deputy Bertie Ahern was prepared when Minister for <Col N="847" /> Finance to make funding available, practically as a result of the efforts of a deputation that he received.  He was succeeded as Minister for Finance by Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  Deputy Mary O'Rourke, my party's deputy leader, has continuously fought the battle, whether at Question Time or the Adjournment debate, to highlight what should be done for Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>I resent the statement, made by a Deputy who has not been here a wet day and who has lectured us on agricultural and other matters, that Fianna Fáil delayed the Bill.  I am sorry that she is not present in the Chamber.  She should be more cool in her comments and more practical.  There is no blame attaching to anyone on this side of the House which offered its full co-operation.  A number of other points have been made.  I do not understand why there should be any secrecy about the report of the task force.  It should be published.  This Government stated it would be as transparent as a pane of glass but it continually hides reports.  The report should be debated in the House and in Cork County Council.  It is obvious that there is little or nothing in the report, otherwise it would have been debated.</P>

      <P>Many questions were raised on the re-adaptation money.  I do not wish to have a row with the Minister but this matter has been going on for too long.  It first came to notice on 20 February when Deputy Mulvihill leaked it to <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> It was a good leak and he probably got his information from a Minister. However, nothing has happened since <Col N="848" /> then and I appeal to the Deputy to obtain further information to leak.  The money might be paid then.  I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill forward. He did everything possible and I wish the company and everyone concerned well.  I hope it will have a viable future.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies opposite for facilitating the finalisation of this important Bill.  I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that never was a bitter pill quaffed down with more relish and it has caused me little grief.</P>
      <P>The options facing the Government were painful.  The matter has been the subject of criticism which had little regard to the options confronting us.  It is indisputable that it is an expensive deal for the taxpayer but there was no alternative before Government that was not as or more expensive than the deal concluded.  It is easy for those who write a column in a newspaper once a week and do not need to be paid on the basis of productivity to say &ldquo;if I were you I would not start from here&rdquo;.  Perhaps we would not have taken a particular option if we were starting from a different point but we had to deal with matters as we found them and the options were painful.</P>
      <P>The decision is a good one.  A major international company with a track record in the business is holding out the prospect of revitalising the industry which will benefit the region and the workers.  That is a good day's work.  It is true that the workforce have suffered in this exercise.  It is a difficult job and not one that would be sought after by some of the commentators who choose to deride it.  In so far as one can assure anything in a difficult environment and a cyclical business, the outcome represents the best option open to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard what Deputies Quill, O'Keeffe and others said about the re-adaptation payments.  We are concerned about that matter and have been looking at it.  It is not clear and it is not automatic.  It will be two or three months before we have <Col N="849" /> the necessary clarity.  We are adamant about the rights and wrongs of the matter and about our expectations.  We hope we will have a positive conclusion but it will be some three months before that happens.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to intrude on the love bombing between Deputies Lynch and O'Keeffe but it is fair to say that Deputy O'Keeffe and his party have facilitated this necessary restructuring of Irish Steel and I appreciate their support.  No more than discussing with Deputy Lynch the merits of industrial policy, I do not propose to comment on the survey in Deputy Quill's constituency to which she referred.  I have not seen it and am not questioning it.  I would like to see it.  If it is true it runs counter to the national average.  That is possible as jobs are being created in certain sectors and at certain levels of the economy while they are being lost in others.  That analysis gave rise to a report published by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, last week on the necessity for labour market interventions in the profile areas Deputy Quill predominantly represents.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Bruton, the principal Minister concerned, and his predecessor, Deputy Quinn.  I especially acknowledge the extraordinary effort made by the senior officials in my Department.  The hard, tedious, detailed work was done there over a prolonged period.  Unfortunately they do not qualify for overtime but almost as much money was spent on overtime in trying to secure the deal as the deal cost.  I wish the company and workforce a bright future in line with the new arrangements.</P>

    <Title>Metrology Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on 14 March that we are quick off the mark when we <Col N="850" /> look for financial aid from Europe, and rightly so.  However, our case would receive a more sympathetic hearing if we did not delay so long in dealing with non-financial European matters.  Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to pass this on to his Government colleagues. The principal proposal in the Bill is that within Forbairt there should be a legal metrology service with a chief officer known as the Director of Legal Metrology.  The position may be filled by open advertisement.  The Bill further provides that the board of Forbairt will appoint the director, with the approval of the Minister, for a specific duration with a remuneration specified by the board and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  There appears to be an overlap between Forbairt and Forfás; perhaps the Minister will clarify this.  It seems that all future staff will come from Forfás under Forbairt terms and conditions.  The staff will report to the Director and the Chief Executive of Forbairt as set out in section 2 (1).</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, my party is concerned about the proliferation of bodies officially promoting enterprise. As their number now exceeds 80, I question the principle of putting the new metrology service under the umbrella of Forbairt.  If it is to have its own director, why does it need to be part of that body and why must it be located in Dublin?  The Bill and the explanatory memorandum do not refer to the location of the proposed office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not specify what will happen to people who will not voluntarily transfer to the new unit.  I support the concept envisaged in the Bill of staff dealing with weights and measures in Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council with the existing small staff in the quality control section of the Department of Enterprise and Employment and Garda inspectors dealing with weights and measures being voluntarily transferred to the new section.  These transfers are to take place under conditions no worse than existing conditions including pension rights and entitlements.  The Garda <Col N="851" /> inspectors involved have expressed grave concerns and dissatisfaction about the proposals and I will table amendments to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>A problem may arise in that the six people coming from Government Departments, the six people coming from Dublin Corporation and the 20 members of the Garda Síochána involved in weights and measures already operate under different pay scales and conditions.  Their retirement ages vary from 57 to 65 years.  What scale or grade will apply to new recruits?</P>
    <P>I strongly believe in the concept of centralising this service.  I believe equally strongly that it should be located outside the capital.  Successive Governments have decentralised the public service away from Dublin.  It appears that the new office will be started in Dublin and later transferred. While worthwhile, this will involve disruption and transfer costs.  Bearing in mind the size of the office, an ideal location would be Mallow or Athlone.</P>
    <P>Existing regulations are enforced efficiently and regularly, particularly in respect of the licensed trade and meat plants.  Does the Minister intend to make the new office self-financing?  To what extent will existing charges have to be altered to make it so?  People in trade are concerned about the outcome.</P>
    <P>I have read the old weights and measures legislation and District Court reports and I am not aware of any infringement of the regulations.  Could this be due to a lack of resources or technology?  It would be nice, but difficult to believe, that everybody is behaving properly in this area.  The enforcement and effectiveness of this legislation will depend to a great extent on the director appointed.  It should be a requirement of the position that the candidates hold a suitable third level qualification.  Why must the director be an employee of Forfás?</P>
    <P>My main concerns about the Bill relate to the people working in this office.  The director should be suitably <Col N="852" /> qualified.  Serious consideration should be given to the Garda members who refuse to transfer to the new service.  The office should be located outside Dublin. While I believe it should be self-financing, I would like to know the additional costs which may be imposed on people in business and trade.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the proposed legislation and I am happy to work with the Minister in improving the Bill.  I ask that there be further consultation with the members of the Garda Síochána involved and the existing weights and measures staff because they are not satisfied.  I have received several representations from them to this effect. Many of them have only a few years of service remaining and they should be given consideration.  They have given loyal and unstinting service and there have been very few infringements and court cases in the weights and measures area.  It is obvious their work was excellent, they knew their business and worked closely with trade.  They should be given recognition and sympathy during the changeover and I will table amendments dealing with this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill implements an EU directive, which is important.  However, some directives do not improve the situation and in some cases may disimprove it.  I am talking specifically about BSE.  If there had been high standards in the feed industry, we might not have had the problems in the late 1970s and early 1980s when standards were reduced, probably as a result of the EEC.  There are many good things in this country and we should not dilute them or implement EU directives.  We should take what is good and reject what is bad. We should not always have to accept EU directives in their entirety.  We should have a similar system to the one in the US, where states can interpret directives from the federal Government. The problems which arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s had grave effects on our economy, the farming community and the business sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated during <Col N="853" /> the debate so far, two main issues are being addressed &mdash; outdated legislation and the fragmented organisational structure.  Traditionally, legal metrology was seen purely as a consumer protection measure.  However, in recent decades there has been a decisive shift in that greater importance is now being given to its impact on industry.  With the proliferation of mass production, it has increasingly been accepted that the interests of consumers can, to a large extent, be protected by confidence in the measurements of manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services.  There is still a need for a third party system of verification to guarantee consumer protection. This will continue to be provided by a regime of inspections to ensure confidence in measuring instruments in use and in the quantities of goods offered for sale.</P>
      <P>There are numerous examples of accuracy in trade measurements which benefit the consumer and trader.  In the agricultural sector the accuracy of milk meters and weighbridges, to which Deputy Ned O'Keefe referred, is seen as vital to farmers and agri-businesses. Equally, accurate meters in oil delivery trucks and petrol pumps create the confidence of oil delivery companies, many of which are small businesses and the ultimate consumer.  Traceability of measurements to national measurement standards is a prerequisite for quality system approval in manufacturing.  In the packaged goods sector a system of average fill of packages rather than the minimum fill system operated prior to 1980 facilitates the manufacturer, the packer and the consumer.  Arising from the advances in technology in the sector, increasing emphasis is placed on the technical competence of field staff.  This will be given particular attention in the new service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Ned O'Keeffe for his valuable contribution.  With regard to the recommendtaions of the 1970 Conroy Commission on the civilianising of the Garda weights and measures function, efforts to reorganise the service were made in the late 1970s and the <Col N="854" /> mid-1980s but, for various reasons, including inadequate resources, they were not successful.  I am sure the House shares my surprise at reports of dissatisfaction among members of the Garda Síochána with the transfer arrangements.  I say &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; because agreement on the terms of transfer was reached with their representative association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, through the recognised negotiation procedures, the Garda Síochána conciliation council, last January.  In recent weeks clarification on a number of points raised by the Garda is being considered.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer specifically to the question of secondment of gardaí to the new service.  That is primarily a matter for the Department of Justice which has been consulted as a result of representations made to me by a number of Deputies including my colleagues Deputies Eric Byrne and Ned O'Keeffe. The formal position of the Department of Justice, as communicated to me in recent days is:</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of transfer to the new service have been negotiated and agreed with the AGSI at the Garda conciliation council.  The question of secondment was ruled out early in these negotiations.  One of the main reasons for this was due to the fact that these sergeants would remain subject to the Garda Síochána Acts and Regulations and answerable to the Garda Commissioner, yet he would have no control over their day to day activities.  The Department of Justice does not propose to review the position regarding secondment to the new service.</P>
    <P>I wish to correct any misunderstanding which may exist in regard to the origins of the Bill.  It does not give effect to EU law.  The restructuring has been an objective, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, since the Conroy Commission reported in 1970.  However, because of the lack of resources down through the years the facilities necessary to operate the service to modern standards had not been <Col N="855" /> provided, hence a worthwhile restructuring only became feasible when resources were applied to effect a modernisation of facilities.</P>
    <P>Recognising the unequal competency levels between metrology services throughout Europe, the European Commission launched a funding programme aimed at modernising metrology infrastructures known as the Prisma OP.  The time limits set under this programme effectively determine the timing of the modernisation programme here.  Purchase of new equipment and provision of new facilities, including buildings, commenced in late 1992.</P>
    <P>In addition to modernisation elements, the programme entailed negotiation with staff interests on the transfer of existing staff to the proposed new service and the enactment of necessary legislation to give effect to a new structure.</P>
    <P>It would have been quite wrong to proceed with the modernisation without addressing the fundamental organisational and legislative deficiencies of the service.  All the equipment purchased is in good order and will be fully utilised when the new service is established following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Unification of the organisation and its modernisation, as well as locating it within the existing Forbairt metrology structure, will ensure a much improved structure to industry, particularly small industry, and consumers.  I am sure the debate on Committee State will afford ample opportunity to deal with all the issues involved and I look forward to a constructive discussion with Members of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy.</P>
    <P>On Deputy O'Keeffe's queries about the director of legal metrology and the overlap with Forbairt and Forfás, the staff concerned will be employees of Forfás.  The legal metrology service will be part of the National Metrology Laboratory in Forbairt which I had great pleasure in opening last week.</P>

      <P>Fees will be charged for the services provided by the legal metrology service. However, because of its infrastructural nature it is not envisaged it will operate on a purely commercial basis.  This would require increases which could place fee levels beyond the capacity of many small traders.  So, essentially a balance will have to be struck between the fee income that undoubtedly will be raised and whether in all cases what would be considered commercial fees will be charged.</P>
      <P>As regards the points raised concerning staff negotiations and the role of the Garda, the sergeants concerned will, of course, retain what they have on a personal basis for the remainder of their service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>: I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  It is the first time since I came to this House that we <Col N="857" /> have had an opportunity to debate and put on record our views on how the travelling and settled communities should work together in future.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion, particularly in the last week or ten days, about the travelling community.  Councillor Paddy Kenneally's comments certainly caused a storm in Waterford and I do not agree with his sentiments.  I am glad that he has withdrawn the remarks and apologised for making them.</P>
      <P>However, it is hard to take the hypocrisy and double-speak we have had to listen to and read from newspaper editors and certain sections of our society. Not many newspaper editors or others who criticised Councillor Kenneally's comments have halting sites or travelling people living close to their homes. Last year I was involved in an area where travellers were sited.  Certain sections, including local newspaper owners, were to the forefront in having them shifted and moved on.  Some tough decisions were taken and the travellers were not made welcome.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks some people in my own town of Enniscorthy were critical of statements made by Councillor Kenneally, yet a year ago the same people were marching to oppose a halting site or houses for travellers there.  This type of double-speak and hypocrisy makes me sick, as I am sure it does other Members.  The usual attitude of people is to be sympathetic to the travelling community as long as they are in someone else's back yard.</P>
      <P>I worked for a period as a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment where I was involved with the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, in trying to make funds available for halting sites and other accommodation for travellers. In Enniscorthy a unique pilot scheme of houses has just been completed for travelling families who have now moved in.  This type of scheme should be considered by the Department of the Environment around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in favour of halting sites, they are not the real answer.  However, <Col N="858" /> the type of housing scheme devised by Wexford County Council, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, has proved successful.  There was a major demand and 22 travelling families applied for the eight houses.  As a result many were disappointed and are now making representations to me and other politicians in the county to develop a similar scheme adjacent to Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>I come from a county which some people describe as the home of the travelling family.  There has been a tradition for many years in Wexford &mdash; some people say it goes back to the battle at Vinegar Hill in 1798 &mdash; that travelling families parked at the bottom of Vinegar Hill.  About 20 people have been rehoused in that area by the county council and 29 have purchased their own houses.  There has been substantial rehousing of travelling families in the Enniscorthy area in recent years. Although some difficulties have arisen down the years, Wexford County Council, Enniscorthy Urban District Council and, more important, the local community must be complimented on accepting the integration of travelling families into the community.  Local communities and travelling families must be encouraged to work together so that those families become part of the community.</P>
    <P>For too long it has been left to the Department of the Environment and local authorities to deal with the lack of accommodation and facilities for travellers. The Departments of Health and Education, two of the most important areas of administration dealing with welfare and development, have a distinct lack of interest in the plight of the travelling people.  The health problems faced by travellers are enormous.  The Department of Health and the eight regional health boards have shown a could-not-care-less attitude towards the health status of women and children of travelling families.  Given the deplorable conditions in which many travelling families live, in many cases in unofficial halting sites, it is not surprising that the <Col N="859" /> health status of travellers is well below the national average.  Infant mortality is three times higher among travellers than for the majority of the population and life expectancy is much lower.  On average traveller women live 12 years less than women in the settled community and traveller men live ten years less than men in the settled community.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health, and the health boards, have a major role in developing and encouraging better health facilities for traveller families.  I am glad that many recommendations have been made in the task force report in this regard.  I hope the Minister will put those on top of his agenda in encouraging traveller families to become more health conscious and realise the importance of attending doctors and hospitals and looking after their health and welfare.</P>
    <P>The education of travellers must be seriously considered.  In recent years many primary schools have changed their attitude towards children of traveller families and accept them in schools. A number of schools in my county, particularly the board of management of St. Senan's school in Enniscorthy and the principal of that school, Henry Goff, have been to the forefront in encouraging the children of traveller families to attend school.  They provided worthwhile facilities and proper back-up services. In towns and urban areas where traveller families congregate it is important that adequate school facilities be provided.</P>
    <P>The number of children from traveller families attending primary school is reasonably high, although not high enough, but the number attending second level schools is very low.  It is important that as legislators, in conjunction with the Department of Education, we tackle this problem.  Unique measures may be needed to encourage these children to attend second level schools.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Taylor, will consider the question of equality for all children in terms of pursuing second level education.  Much <Col N="860" /> work with traveller families will be necessary to encourage parents to consider the advantages of their children attending second level schools.  I hope a system will be devised to give leadership and encouragement to traveller families to become actively involved in second level education, which is law on the list of priorities for traveller families.</P>
    <P>The failure of children from traveller families to attend second level schools leads to high levels of unemployment among those families.  Many of those people make their own way in life and have their own self-employment schemes, which are worthwhile.  They sell carpets, clothing and so on &mdash; usually the children become involved in that work at a young age &mdash; but they depend very much on the whim of people to purchase such items and, therefore, it is difficult to make a living.</P>
    <P>Many travellers are in receipt of social welfare.  In the past month in particular social welfare officers have been investigating travellers in Wexford who are in receipt of social welfare.  Seven members of the travelling community attended a clinic I held in Gorey last Friday week to complain that their social welfare payments had been cut off because they could not prove how they were able to purchase their vans or cars.  It appears there has been a clamp down on the payment of social welfare to traveller families.  In some cases the Department may be justified in cutting off social welfare, but many of the people I am talking about do not have new vans or cars and withdrawal of their social welfare benefit is uncalled for. That issue must be dealt with in a balanced and sensitive way and we must not be seen to take action against people because they are travellers.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have had to carry the can in dealing with the problems of traveller families, with little support from Government Departments.  It is not good enough to simply build halting sites and hard stands, and leave travellers to the ways of God.  Halting sites and hard stands are acceptable as a short-term measure, but I would favour <Col N="861" /> the building of houses for traveller families, as was done in Enniscorthy.  Traveller families must be encouraged to integrate in society and become involved with local community groups and sporting organisations and avail of social services provided by the Departments of Health and Education.  For that reason I would like the Minister to consider setting up traveller and community partnership committees in each county which would set about providing accommodation and facilities for travellers. These partnership committees would be made up of traveller representatives, local community groups, local authority members and officials as well as representatives from the State agencies. I am convinced that through dialogue travellers and the settled community could come together.</P>
    <P>The days are long gone when county managers located halting sites in parishes without consultation with local people.  That approach will not work. The rights of the traveller community and the settled community must be protected in a partnership arrangement to resolve the existing problems.  Major problems arise when councils announce that a halting site or a hard stand is to be located in a particular county.  Such announcements are usually greeted with uproar and it can take two or three years for the issue to be resolved.  In many cases, politicians bow to pressure and the halting site or hard stand is not built which results in traveller families being abandoned on the roadside while the row continues as to where to locate them.  Community partnership committees would be in a position to address the problem and decide on the placement of sites, and the facilities to be provided, while allowing the travellers and the settled community have their say.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases where halting sites were developed without reference to the traveller families involved.  Traveller families have their own culture and traditional halting areas and to move them from those areas to, say, a country back road six or seven miles away will <Col N="862" /> not resolve this problem in the long-term because, as frequently happens, the families leave that location and go elsewhere creating further problems.</P>
    <P>The only way to resolve this problem is through dialogue involving the local authorities, the local community groups and the travellers.  Perhaps I am being naive but I believe most communities are of the view that we should make an effort to resolve the problems that currently exist for travellers.  It is not good enough to allow travellers remain on the roadside without basic water, sewerage, health and educational facilities to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, 199 traveller families were recorded in 1994 and 231 in 1995, and increase of 32 families in one year. The only site provided is the eight house site in Enniscorthy with a recommendation from the manager that four new halt stands should be built in the next year or 18 months adjacent to the four major towns in the country.  If that plan goes ahead, we will be well on the way towards helping to resolve the lack of accommodation problems faced by traveller families, but if a row erupts over the location of these halt stands, which may happen in the next six or nine months, we may have up to 260 or 270 families in the county this time next year, and we will not have made any progress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report of the task force.  I ask the Minister to ensure the issue does not fade into the background when this debate has concluded but that there is further movement on it.  The Department of the Environment must be to the forefront on this matter but the Departments of Health and Education should support the Department of the Environment in resolving this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Theresa Ahearn.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate because we have a large traveller population in Limerick.  I pay tribute to the chairperson of the task force, Senator Mary Kelly, who is based <Col N="863" /> in my home town of Newcastle West, for her work and that of the committee in producing this report.</P>
      <P>There are a large number of recommendations in the original task force report and a great deal of action will have to be taken in the coming years if we are to resolve this problem.  In the Newcastle West electoral area, which I represent at council level, we have housed more than 60 traveller families. In my own town of Newcastle West, which is not very large, we have housed approximately 40 traveller families.</P>
      <P>The projection has been made that over a period 3,100 additional units will have to be constructed.  An examination of the location of the traveller population reveals it is restricted to certain counties.  Some counties bear a disproportionate burden in regard to housing travellers.  The greatest satisfaction to any traveller family is to be allocated a house, but many reports highlight the importance of travellers retaining their culture and past traditions.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered when travellers are housed in housing estates, the settled community in those estates equally have rights.  Travellers on occasions are their own worst enemy. They provoke hostility among the settled community with regard to retaining what they believe are their cultural rights.  A problem which frequently annoys people living in housing estates arises when traveller families bring their horses onto the green areas of estates used by children for play activities.  I do not have a problem with travellers keeping their horses on rented land but I am critical of travellers who keep their horses on estates, upsetting an entire community.  My experience of this problem is that fear sets in and children are afraid to play in the green areas originally designed for such activities.  This provokes a hostile reaction from the settled population.  That is not good for the traveller community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have a major responsibility in this regard.  When they allocate a local authority house, they <Col N="864" /> allow tenants the right to keep a dog or cat, according to the tenancy agreement, but tenants should not have the right to keep a horse at the back of the house. In that regard I welcome the proposed Control and Regulation of Horses Bill, due to come before the House in the near future, which will introduce a sense of order to a problem which often impacts on the traveller community as a result of the attitude of the settled population to horses wandering around estates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter. We will not bring in a wildlife Bill yet.  I make this argument constructively as we have housed approximately 40 traveller families in Newcastle West, and if every community adopted a similar approach, we would not have a traveller problem.</P>
      <P>There is another problem which provokes a certain adverse reaction. Rathkeale is one community which has a high preponderance of the travelling population.  That community has accepted many of those travelling families who have been there for generations and have integrated into the community. There is another group who create problems not alone for people in Rathkeale but for people in other parts of the country, those who decide they want a travelling lifestyle.  Such people often arrive in Rathkeale at Christmas time in BMWs and Volvos and flaunt the wealth which they have gained in England and elsewhere.  I wish them the best of luck, they deserve to come home.  In this case we are not talking about deprived travellers but people who have acquired a certain amount of money.  In Rathkeale there are many good houses which are boarded up with wire grills and which are in use at certain times of the year.  It is obvious that travellers have acquired a certain wealth if they have the scope to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> Every politician will find members of the travelling community at his or her clinic and will have to advise them on various issues.  Many of these are responsible, honourable people who are being brought down by a small core group.  Rathkeale was profiled in the national newspapers recently.  Details were given of a travelling family who had been housed but decided to take up residence outside the new graveyard. Several attempts by the county council to remove their caravan and other caravans were resisted by the people involved.  This provoked much annoyance at local level, particularly among people who had members of their families buried in that graveyard.  This is the type of issue which can undo the goodwill which may exist and turn the settled population in the other direction.</P>
    <P>Essentially, it comes down to the whole education process.  The report indicates that at least 80 per cent of the travelling population between 12 and 15 years of age have dropped out of the education system.  There is a problem with illiteracy in the travelling community, particularly among the older members.  We must retain the young people in the education process.  There are many useful recommendations in the task force report.  Over a period it will help develop a stronger bond between what is traditionally regarded as the settled community and the non-settled community.  The recommendations in the report are welcome but much work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>While there may be a necessity for halting sites for people who decide they want to travel, the best possible hope of integration into the community is when they are housed by the local authority. I have witnessed many successes in that direction by Limerick County Council. I compliment Limerick County Council, the officials and the social workers for their effort in trying to ensure the travelling population is integrated.  Much good work has been done but much remains to be done.  I was interested to hear Deputy Browne say that where there is a large travelling population. <Col N="866" /> there is a necessity for some partnership or organisation to liaise with the travelling population and the local community to ensure harmony and a stronger bond of friendship.  If we have that we will, over a period, help to integrate them into the community.  I compliment the Minister on her efforts on behalf of the travelling community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity, following the publication of the task force report, to speak on an important minority group in our community &mdash; the travelling community. As the travelling community do not have a platform to voice their concerns, it is important that a report such as this brings the entire matter onto the floor of this House where the concerns and needs of that community should be debated.</P>
      <P>I compliment the members of the task force, the Minister of State, Deputy Liz McManus, and Senator Mary Kelly on producing an impressive and wide ranging report.  The report has dealt seriously and in depth with every aspect of the travelling community.  While we are debating the problems and the needs of the travelling community we are speaking about a national problem, but the solution has to be local and therein lies the problem.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities are aware of the intensity, and emotion of the debate in trying to find either a halting site or a house for members of the travelling community. That is not because public representatives are uncaring, we work under enormous pressure from the settled community in relation to issues such as this. I have learned from experience that the worst thing any local authority can do is to have the item &ldquo;halting sites or accommodation for travelling people&rdquo; on the agenda to be debated in committee.  The tendency is for everyone to clear themselves and put the blame on someone else.  I will never participate in a debate on halting sites or on housing for the travelling community in committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Whatever we have to say we should say it publicly and let it be on the record.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the contribution and the efforts of my local authority in South Tipperary in trying to provide better accommodation, better resources and better support for the travelling community.  We have provided halting sites and have done our best to spread them evenly throughout all the electoral areas.  As most people will accept, one is dictated to by where they tend to take up residence.  We have also provided good education programmes but like most local authorities we have not solved the entire problem.</P>
    <P>At a recent local authority meeting, a social worker gave us a profile of all the members of the travelling community. We must never forget we are dealing with disadvantaged people who have a life expectancy some 20 years less than most people.  The various illnesses we suffer are nothing compared to those suffered by the travelling community. They also suffer the disadvantage of lack of education, lack of ability and confidence to speak out for their rights. We cannot but be sympathetic to their situation when the reality of their health and living conditions is firmly placed before us.  The approach of the settled community must be one of co-operation with the travelling community.  We are lacking some forum of information, co-operation and communication between the two groups.  There is simply none. The settled community either make up their minds about travellers from their experience of travellers residing beside them or from what they read in the newspapers.  No effort is made to change the approach or outlook of either side and, like all communities, the traveller community is tarnished by the reputation of a small number of people. Travellers generally take up residence on land to which they have no entitlement and the lack of proper sanitation or refuse services causes problems for the settled community.  We expect travellers to keep their halting sites tidy but we must bear in mind that they do not <Col N="868" /> have proper facilities.  However, I know of a case where the settled community encountered major difficulties because of poor behaviour by travellers who were not concerned with the rights of farmers or landowners and had total disregard for property.  It is unfair that such unfortunate incidents lead to resentment of and hostility towards all travellers. I also know travellers who have been placed in houses or halting sites which are a credit to them.  We must bear in mind that all travellers are not the same.</P>
    <P>When talking about the traveller community we must ensure we are referring to travellers and not transient traders, of which my constituency takes an overflow from Rathkeale.  There is great resentment towards transient traders who take up residence wherever they wish and travel around in 1996 vans selling gates, rugs, carpets and other merchandise.  They also cause major problems for the settled community and give genuine travellers a bad public image.  While something must be done about those self-styled transient traders, it is difficult to know where the power lies to deal with them.  Local authorities refer reports about them to the Garda, but nobody appears to have the right to tell them to return to their place of residence.  Unfortunately, transient traders are often confused with the traveller community.</P>
    <P>We must respect the culture and tradition of the traveller community who frequently want to live in groups.  While many people are prepared to accept one or two families living beside them, they are not prepared to accept six or seven. However, it is traditional for the traveller community to move in groups and many of them are not prepared to accept housing unless five or six families are housed together.  That aspect of their culture is an obstacle to making better progress in providing accommodation for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and look forward to the day when travellers have accommodation which is suited to their needs, culture and way of life.  The <Col N="869" /> report will lead to more harmonious relations between the settled and traveller communities.  Travellers are a disadvantaged minority group but we have a duty to cater for them.  Although it will be difficult to make progress in this area brave decisions must be made. Responsibilities come with rights and it will be necessary to alert the traveller community to their responsibilities.  We must respect each other's way of life.  I look forward to a positive outcome from this report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the chairperson of the task force, Senator Kelly, and its members for their great work.  I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, who is a former chairperson.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on the travelling community is substantial, comprehensive and far reaching in its recommendations and proposals and this has been recognised by all Members who contributed to the debate.  It sets out the key policy issues that are relevant to travellers, including the need for accommodation, better health services, improved education and training and inclusion in work and economic activity generally.  It also addresses the difficult relationships which can develop between travellers and the settled community and tackles the key issues of discrimination, the role of traveller women and the importance of their ancient and special culture.  The report will be valuable to anyone interested in this area.</P>
      <P>I compliment those who work with the traveller community.  The report recognises the great work that has been done.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have tackled the problems associated with the traveller community, but that does not mean I am satisfied with the progress that has been made.  However, it is only fair to recognise the great work, which requires patience and perseverance, that is being done by corporations, county councils, health boards and social and voluntary workers throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This valuable study was presented to <Col N="870" /> the public at Dublin Castle in July 1995. Nine months later it has been presented to the Dáil and has come before the House for discussion.  Concluding his speech the Minister, Deputy Taylor, said the task force report presented us with an opportunity which we must not miss.  For my part I will do all in my power to ensure that it gets the support it deserves.  The Minister is sincere and genuine and his intentions are good but, after nine months on the shelf, where is the Government's action plan to implement the report?  While I detect a strong commitment in the Minister's language, we will have to await the decisions of other Ministers.  The Ministers for Health, Education, the Environment and Enterprise and Employment should be here today with plans already approved and agreed by Government and ready for implementation. The task force surveyed the whole area and gave us everything we want in terms of back-up information. This should have been followed immediately by an action plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, outlined her commitment yesterday.  The Ministers for Health and Education are deeply involved.  The Minister indicated that the Government is committed to strengthening health and educational services.  He said the Department of Health undertook to implement a special programme to address the health needs of the traveller community and will publish a policy on travellers' health.  One of the recommendations is that a traveller health advisory committee be set up, one of the functions of which will be to draw up a policy on travellers' health.  The Minister spoke also about a consultative process, the issue of life expectancy and other problems.  These problems are well documented already.  They were documented before the task force report.  They are re-emphasised in the task force report.  What we need now is an action plan, not the generalised promises the Department of Health seems to be making.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> The same kind of thing is happening with regard to education.  There is reference to a White Paper, to traveller children of primary age being enrolled and participating fully in primary education and other good things that we would all support.  Many of these things are already happening, but where they are happening they are not getting the support they need.  That is the problem.  It would not be difficult to say today that we will take certain actions, that where schools have integrated traveller children, we will ensure that those schools get the support they need.  I am familiar with one case where the population of travellers integrated into the primary schools is 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>What used to be called the three Rs, reading, writing and arithmetic, are very important.  The school I have referred to has received remedial assistance for English following many representations from local Dáil Deputies on behalf of a school which badly needed support. There is information to show that the level of understanding in maths is very low and this school is also in need of a remedial maths teacher, but the school has not got such a teacher.  Wearing my national and academic hat I can say this is a wonderful report, but when I go back home I face the reality on the ground where there are wonderful communities integrating young children from the traveller community in a substantial way into their schools and not getting the support and the back-up.  I am disappointed with the lack of action. We are not talking about millions of pounds, just thousands, perhaps £100,000 or £200,000.  We do not have that, and that is what is wrong with the debate on this report.  We have had similar experiences in other areas. Deputy Chris Flood dealt extensively with the issue of the health and educational training of travellers, because they are key issues if we are to solve problems and give support to those who are attempting to solve them.  Deputy John Browne of Wexford had similar problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> I wonder what has happened to the Government.  Has it lost its drive and energy?  Is it getting tired?  Why is there no action?  We are told that money and resources are not the problem.  If that is true, why not get on with the job?  What we need now is the money and the honest commitment to do what needs to be done.  We need a comprehensive action plan based on this nine-month old task force report and the knowledge and experience of the travellers and those who work with and support them.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that because the actions needed are the responsibility of a number of Government Departments he has set up an interdepartmental working group of officials to consider implementation of the report.  That is fine, but we need action.  Perhaps the Government is waiting for the Opposition to come up with plans.  We have all the reports we need, but the Government is about executive action.  The people at the coalface need our support, and we should give it to them without further delay.</P>
    <P>Regarding relationships with the settled community, the task force states that in addition to initiatives and actions taken by the various statutory agencies, one factor which is fundamental to the improvement of the general welfare of the traveller community is the issue of the relationship between travellers and their settled neighbours.  Unfortunately it is recognised by the task force that, in general, that relationship is encountering great difficulties.  This is often characterised by instances of hostility and aggression.  It also concludes that the actions by some travellers are responsible for some of the hostility to them in the settled local community. The task force emphasised that the process of relationship building is a two-way process.  Both travellers and the settled community have a contribution to make to that process, particularly at local level.  The task force examines ways of facilitating the improvement of these relations and attempting to reduce conflict and strengthen mutual respect <Col N="873" /> and understanding &mdash; they see this coming out in what they call a strategy for reconciliation.  It is a sad fact that most of us have prejudices of one sort or another.  These are often based on a lack of information, misunderstandings or simple ignorance, but we have to try to overcome them.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements and procedures applying in the Office of the Attorney General in relation to extradition are as I set out in reply to a parliamentary question on 8 February 1995 but they have been complemented since 18 September 1995 by a computerised case-tracking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrangements and procedures are that the Attorney General is notified, in writing, immediately every request for extradition is received in the office and that he is given details of the request.  A computerised case-tracking system supplements, and may eventually replace, the written notification to the Attorney General.  The system, which incorporates a special alert notice for extradition cases, enables the Attorney General to check the progress of any extradition case.  The combination of these two systems enables the Attorney General to be personally aware, at all times, of all extradition requests and to monitor their progress. <Col N="874" /> I am satisfied with these arrangements, which are kept under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the most recent extradition case in which faulty documents were involved, can the Taoiseach say whether they were checked in the Attorney General's office before the case was proceeded with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That particular case is the subject of a parliamentary question addressed to the Minister for Justice.  I am not in a position to give the House specific information as to particular documents that may or may not have been received in the Attorney General's office but I can say with certainty that the problems that arose in that case did not arise in the Attorney General's office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that the problems did not arise in the Attorney General's office the Taoiseach did say there is an alert system in that office that allows him to personally check and monitor all applications for extradition.  That being the case &mdash; in the specific case I mentioned &mdash; were the relevant documents checked and was any monitoring done on behalf of the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be the subject of a comprehensive reply by the Minister for Justice after the relevant inquiries have been completed &mdash; including the responsibility of all the various offices in the matter &mdash; to the best of her ability to collate and present. It would be best to allow the Minister for Justice to answer that matter in detail.  The Attorney General's office was not in any sense remiss in its handling of the case, a matter for which I am accountable here on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I take it the Taoiseach agrees that the Irish Government cannot be blamed for any errors in extradition warrants issued by the British authorities and, if so, I am delighted to know that.  Will the Taoiseach say in general whether it is the view of the Attorney General's office that in cases that can be prosecuted under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, that happens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to the procedures for dealing with extradition applications as distinct from others not involving extradition.  That is a separate question which does not involve extradition and I suggest he tables a separate question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that there was any omission on the Irish side but the matter is the subject of a separate parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice.  This question tabled by Deputy Harney relates solely to the procedures in the Attorney General's office, which I have outlined.  I have further stated I am satisfied there was no failure to apply appropriate procedures in the Attorney General's office which contributed to the difficulties that occurred in this case. As to the difficulties elsewhere and the attribution of any responsibility for those between different jurisdictions and offices, that will be the subject of a detailed parliamentary reply from the Minister for Justice.  I suggest to Deputy Ahern, as I have already to Deputy Harney, that he await that reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot dwell unduly long on one question. There are other questions tabled to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Defence and the Marine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In his original reply the Taoiseach referred to the fact that the Attorney General was notified, in writing, that there was a computerised case-tracking system, an alert notice system and a checking of progress and that the Attorney General continues to monitor all extradition cases throughout five different phases in his office.  Surely the case-tracking system monitors more than the dates on which such extradition applications are received in his office and when they are dealt with.  From my term of office in the Department of Justice, I know that any such tracking system would also have monitored the accuracy of documentation and so on. Instead of awaiting a comprehensive reply from the Minister for Justice, does the Taoiseach agree, from a national viewpoint, it is important that he avails of this opportunity to assure the electorate and international opinion &mdash; since there was much misrepresentation of the position of the Irish Government authorities on this matter &mdash; that no error occurred on the part of the Irish authorities in the handling of this case as far as documentation was concerned? It is very important that we clarify our position on this matter.</P>

      <P>I have an obligation to safeguard the rights of Members, especially in respect of tabling questions.  If there is a question tabled on this subject to the Minister for Justice we should not anticipate it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Members well know, parliamentary questions for oral reply by another Minister on a subsequent day do not appear on today's Order Paper.  However, it is the case that a question has been tabled, will be answered and &mdash; as the Ceann Comhairle correctly said &mdash; if answered now <Col N="877" /> would involve an element of queue-jumping. Apart from that, the important thing is that a comprehensive reply is given on the matter, and that will be given.  As I said in response to Deputy Burke, which I reiterate, I have no reason to believe that there was any error or omission on the Irish side on this matter that contributed to any of the difficulties but that matter will be fully addressed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be free to put any questions he wishes when the Minister for Justice replies to that parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>As to the position of the Irish Government being misrepresented in this and other related areas, this is something to which all Irish Governments become used and is not something that occurs solely outside this jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the different procedures followed.  My party had tabled a number of questions over the past few weeks on the second mobile telephone licence which were ruled out of order yesterday on the basis that the matter had been raised on the Adjournment last week.</P>
      <P>We seem to follow different procedures for different issues, as it suits.  It is not satisfactory for the Taoiseach to refuse to answer a question today on the basis that it will arise when oral questions will be answered, which is in about two weeks' time.  That is not satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State responsible for Western Development and Rural Renewal, Deputy Carey, has responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's support for the development of the western region in particular by tackling population decline, which has many socio-economic consequences.</P>
      <P>His responsibilities will, therefore, continue to include; liaison with the Western Development Partnership Board whose action plan is currently being considered by the Government; overseeing the implementation of the pilot programme initiative for the development of a more integrated approach to the delivery of public services in remote rural areas, following the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council's report New Approaches to Rural Development; special responsibility for the development and improvement of living conditions on the offshore islands of Ireland, in particular as chair of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development which has recently produced a detailed report outlining a strategic framework for future development; chairing a task force on funding arrangements in the Border region.  The Minister hopes to submit a report to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>Finally, Deputy Carey's related appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with special responsibility for the Gaeltacht represents a clear expression of the Government's commitment to the development and preservation of these unique cultural and historic areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs and Local <Col N="879" /> Development, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has a vital role in ensuring the effective implementation of the Government's local development strategies.  His appointment as Minister with special responsibility for local development is testimony to the Government's commitment to an integrated approach to tackling economic and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>His responsibilities in respect of local development will, therefore, continue to include: support for the many initiatives under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development and the EU urban initiative.  The focus of the operational programme is on drawing on the combined resources of State agencies, local communities and the social partners to target specific areas of difficulty and disadvantage; active support of the various initiatives on the ground, such as the area partnerships; communicating to Government the lessons learned from local development strategies which will benefit and inform mainstream economic and social policy, especially arising from the mid-term review of the operational programme in 1997; promoting European awareness of and support for local development strategy through a major conference to be held during our EU Presidency.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for the International Financial Services Centre, Deputy Gay Mitchell has set the following targets: first, the continued economic development of the centre, particularly substantially increasing the level of direct employment from the current 3,000; targeting 1,000 jobs in related back-office development located outside the centre; and maximising consequential employment in associated legal, accounting and general services in the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>Second, to prepare a strategy for the long-term development of the centre beyond 2005 when the EU provision for <Col N="880" /> preferential tax treatment is due to expire.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Minister has considerable responsibilities in the European area.  He has established an international advisory group to assist him in regard to the Financial Services Centre. Furthermore, there is no overlap in the responsibilities of Deputies Carey and Gay Mitchell.  Each has a clear programme and a specific set of objectives. Avoidance of duplication ensures complementarity between local development initiatives and the wider responsibilities of Government policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can explain why part of my question asks about the overlap of responsibilities because it occurs in the context of a wider question concerning the responsibilities of a number of other Ministers of State.  I asked the Taoiseach to list the achievements of the Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal but that question was referred to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could comment on the appropriateness of that?</P>
      <P>Having listened carefully to the Taoiseach's reply, I still cannot understand what Deputy Carey does for a living, apart from being a TD.  The Taoiseach says he is responsible for halting population decline but can he point to any specific achievement or to anything he is supposed to do between now and the end of this administration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach to point to one specific achievement of Deputy Carey, Minister of State with responsibility for western development who apparently was appointed as an afterthought when he could not get another job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The Taoiseach says Deputy Gay Mitchell is responsible for local development. The only local development I can see Deputy Gay Mitchell having engaged in is local development in his own constituency in Dublin South Central. What has he achieved and for what is he responsible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Deputy Carey's responsibilities are concerned, I think Deputy Ó Cuív, who is sitting beside Deputy O'Dea, will give a very concrete example of the influence Deputy Carey has had in terms of being able to ensure proper standards of electrical power on Inish Meán in the Aran Islands.  Apart from that very specific example he has been responsible for bringing to light and proceeding with the implementation of a comprehensive programme to deal with the problems of the islands, the first ever such comprehensive programme dealing with access, standard of living and standard of services related matters.  He is responsible for the first time in a Government for the political focus on the wider question of western development, something that no previous Government felt was worthy of the appointment of a Minister of State.  Furthermore, he has taken on responsibility for co-ordinating the many expenditures that occur in the Border areas, again something that was not co-ordinated at political level under the previous Government.  When one contemplates the work-load that Deputy Carey has undertaken in terms of island development, western development and co-ordination of Border expenditure, one will have to question the omission of the appointment of somebody with Deputy Carey's <Col N="882" /> responsibilities by any previous Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>This is not tokenism; this is a case of a Minister being given responsibility to do a job and doing it very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea also asked about Deputy Gay Mitchell.  Deputy Mitchell has been effective in ensuring that the local development programme works extremely well.  As a result of his management of that programme, local people have a wider degree of interest in making economic decisions about how EU and national moneys are spent in their areas.  The success of that programme under Deputy Mitchell's <Col N="883" /> leadership is such that other EU countries are interested in examining how we are carrying out this task better than they can.  That is why we are having an EU conference during the Irish Presidency on the issue of local development, with particular reference to urban areas where there is significant deprivation and social exclusion.  Furthermore, Deputy O'Dea might recognise that Deputy Gay Mitchell will be responsible during our Presidency for representing the national position at meetings of the EU Council of Foreign Ministers, given that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will be in the chair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That report calls for action from a wide range of Government Departments.  Its purpose is to bring together in a coherent programme the activities of a range of Government Departments.  The finance provided for Deputy Carey is simply to finance actions which are not covered by existing departmental responsibilities.  It is right that there should be a Minister of State in the Taoiseach's Department with specific responsibility for island development.  That was a good decision and Deputy Ó Cuív might usefully communicate with his urban colleague, Deputy O'Dea, on the value of having a Minister of State for island development.</P>

      <P>The 1996 census is being taken on Sunday, 28 April 1996.  The census covers all persons present in the State on that night. Persons are enumerated in the households or institutions in which they spend the night of 28 April 1996.  In common with other population groups, third level students are enumerated in the census wherever they pass census night.</P>
      <P>There is a legal obligation on heads of households and institutions to provide the information requested on the census form in respect of every person present in the relevant household or institution on census night.</P>
      <P>The census is taken on a <i>de facto</i> basis, that is, the population recorded for each area represents the total of all persons present within its boundaries on census night together with all persons who arrived in that area on the following morning not having been enumerated elsewhere.  In order to avoid gaps and duplication in achieving a full and accurate count of the population, it is essential that a consistent approach is adopted to the enumeration in all circumstances.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the possible serious consequences of holding the census on a Sunday night, particularly for his constituency which may lose a Dáil seat on the basis of census data as many third level as well as many second level students will not be at home on that night?  Is he concerned about the distortion of census data that may be caused, therefore, by taking the census on Sunday night?  In view of the recent debate on the islands and that resources are often granted on the basis of census of population data, is the Minister concerned also that 10 to 15 per cent of island populations in terms of students attending second and third level colleges will not be at home on census night?  Will steps be taken, therefore, to redress the imbalance that will result from taking the census on the night arranged, and bearing in mind that increasing numbers of students are studying away from home during term time?</P>

      <P>May I answer the question and the Deputy can then ask a supplementary if he wishes?  The traditional month for the taking of the census is April.  The date of 28 April was decided on the basis that it was after Easter and before the summer holidays. This date was chosen to achieve stability, conformity and uniformity with past trends.  I acknowledge the Deputy's concerns and I would have had a preconceived idea that the holding of the census on a Sunday night would involve a major net loss, particularly to rural constituencies.  However, that is not borne out by the 1991 census figures.  I accept Deputy Ó Cuív's point that many important calculations are based on census of population figures, including national government and EU grants and <Col N="890" /> population figures determine representation in the Dáil and elsewhere.  This concern has also been voiced by the Council for the West, particularly regarding students attending third level colleges on census night.</P>

      <P>The 1991 census figures for students aged 18 to 24 born or enumerated in Connacht may be of interest.  A total of 11,040 were born in Connacht and 12,698 were enumerated in Connacht.  In other words, more students were enumerated in Connacht than were born there.  A total of 7,841 students were born and enumerated in Connacht, 4,857 were enumerated in Connacht but born elsewhere and 3,199 were born in Connacht and enumerated elsewhere.  The Deputy mentioned my county of Mayo.  A total of 1,979 students aged up to 24 years were enumerated in Mayo in 1991, of which 1,343 were born in the county, 635 were born elsewhere or not stated and 1,406 were born in the county or enumerated elsewhere.

      <P>The Minister of State has given figures for County Mayo and for Connacht, but he is well aware that there will be a net plus figure in some areas of Connacht with third level institutions, like Galway city.  Counties like Leitrim and rural parts of Counties Mayo and Galway will lose out on that night while urban areas with third level centres will gain.  In quoting figures for Connacht the Minister is failing to recognise that statistics for small areas have a major bearing and that dividing counties for the purpose of collecting statistics will distort the picture.  The Minister has not addressed the consequences for the islands.  We are all aware that students from the islands attend second and third level colleges on the mainland.  It is a nonsense to talk about tradition as the tradition of <Col N="891" /> people attending second and third level colleges did not exist 20, 30 or 40 years ago &mdash; time has brought changes.  Why, in view of changing patterns of lifestyle and of the need, as we are frequently told by the Government, to change with the times, did the Government not decide to take the census on Saturday rather than Sunday night?  This would give better data as to where people reside.  I ask the Minister not to quote tradition to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding for renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet is provided under the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 with over £11 million of EU and Exchequer aid available to support total investment of some £31 million over the period.  Under the operational programme, grants for modernisation are provided at a rate of 35 per cent of the eligible cost, which includes an Exchequer grant of 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>To date, 131 vessel modernisation projects have been approved for grant-aid of just over £4 million under the operational programme representing a total investment of over £15 million.  Up to £6 million has also been made available under the decommissioning scheme and 60 fishing vessel owners have applied for premia to decommission their boats.  A good take up will assist in the achievement of our mandatory EU fleet targets by end 1996 and will also help to improve the overall age profile of the fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment support strategy under the operational programme is designed to improve the efficiency, safety and age profile of the fleet in conformity with our mandatory EU fleet targets.  The good take up to date of available incentives for modernisation <Col N="895" /> of existing vessels is contributing to those objectives.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Department to review from all relevant perspectives the future directions of fleet policy, including the relative socio-economic and commercial merits of the introduction of new vessels into the fleet.  In that context full consideration will be given to all the relevant factors, including the economics of realising available fishing opportunities, ongoing EU fleet policy to address the overcapacity problem in the EU fleet overall and the outcome of the Review Group on Fishing Vessel Safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that we have the highest input costs and the lowest output revenues because of the age of the fishing fleet? Does he accept that under the existing scheme, welcome though it is, a number of vessels over the age limit are excluded from the refurbishment programme? It is my information that the funding required to bring many of them up to standard would not be considerable. This would facilitate those excluded from the scheme.  Will the necessity to deal with this essential aspect be taken into account in the review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that our boats are way over the age limit compared to other states.  It would be ideal if we could modernise the fleet, but the reality is that the previous Government, of which the Deputy was a member, reduced the amount originally requested for fleet modernisation and renewal to a miserable £11 million.  I have to operate within the moneys allocated until such time as the operational programme comes up for review later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to see any fisherman going to sea in a boat that is unsafe.  The modernisation grants given to date have helped considerably in improving the safety and efficiency of the fishing fleet. I am committed to reviewing in full the <Col N="896" /> possibilities of assisting the fleet to modernise existing vessels and facilitate the entry of new ones.</P>
    <P>No public representative could stand up and say that they were happy with every single vessel in the fishing fleet, but we are contributing towards its modernisation.  We have approved 131 projects to date for grant aid of just over £4 million, representing a total investment of £15 million.  Until such time as we have an opportunity of reviewing overall policy strategy, particularly for the white fish sector about which I have concerns, and receive the report of the Review Group on Fishing Vessels Safety, due at the end of May, I will endeavour to do whatever I can to assist the industry in improving its efficiency, effectiveness and safety.</P>
    <P>The average investment in respect of the 131 vessels assisted to date is £116,500 per vessel.  This is a substantial sum.  I would not like the message to go out from this House that everybody is going to sea in an unsafe boat to do what I regard as a very difficult job. That is not the case.  There is, however, always room for major improvement.  I intend to try to secure it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that £116,000, the average investment, is a relatively small amount compared to the cost of renewal which in many cases runs into many millions of pounds per vessel and that it is good practice to ensure that the maximum number are brought up to standard for operational and safety reasons?  I do not accept that we do not have an ageing fleet.  All the information available shows that the average age is between 25 and 35 and that we have purchased a considerable number of cast-offs from other European countries.  This has to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Will the Minister give those involved in this tough, hazardous and rigorous occupation, who are unable to compete because their boats are above the age limit, some hope that it will be addressed as part of the review?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is beyond me why the Government of which the Deputy was a member reduced the sum sought by the Department under the operational programme for modernisation and renewal of the fishing fleet to a miserable £11 million over a five-year period.  I have to operate within this sum until such time as the operational programme comes up for mid-term review at the end of this year.  I will not try to defend a situation where the age of the fleet is not what it should be, but in the meantime I will take every possible step and provide every encouragement to assist those involved in the sector to do their job better and in a safer way.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, it is all about money.  I am examining ways and means of doing it other than by providing grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the decommissioning scheme and the fact that the strenuous nature of the occupation requires those engaged in it to retire at or before the age of 50, has the Minister considered ways to supplement their income between that and the normal retirement age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The decommissioning scheme assists in removing old vessels and reducing the overall European fleet capacity.  The PESCA scheme is designed to help those leaving that sector and starting another business on shore.  I sought additional funds for the scheme from a special fund in Europe. There are employment prospects in aquaculture and in fish processing.  I was misunderstood before when I said that there are 1,300 white fish boats in the <Col N="898" /> fleet and their catch could be caught by 50 modern white fish vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  However, every time we modernise or replace vessels people are put out of business.  We must take account of the socio-economic effects on regions where it is difficult to get employment and try to assist people to move into different areas of employment, perhaps in the fishing sector but not necessarily at sea.  We must strike a balance.  There is need for debate on the issue.  If I invest millions of pounds on a new boat I must catch a lot of fish to repay my investment.  I must be guaranteed markets and prices. It is not as simple as replacing one boat with another.  I am anxious to address the matter, particularly in areas where employment opportunities are limited. We must ensure other schemes are put in place so that those leaving the sea will have an opportunity to make a living on shore and so remain in their own areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 41, 45 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Maritime local authorities have accepted responsibility for protecting their respective coastlines against pollution from maritime incidents and for clean-up operations in the event of pollution taking place.  The Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of the Department of the Marine and its associated bodies, the Irish Marine Advisory Group and the Marine Pollution Response Team, assist local authorities in meeting their responsibilities in this regard.  Each maritime local authority has a contingency plan to deal with emergencies at county level.  In addition, IMES directs and co-ordinates resources in the event of a major oil spill or other pollution incident under its contingency plan.</P>
      <P>During the recent incident involving the oil tanker <i>Sea Empress</i> at Milford Haven in Wales and the oil pollution incident on the Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford and Cork coastlines, IMES provided monitoring including helicopter support and were on hand to offer technical advice as requested.  IMES also advised the local authorities on the formulation of their compensation claims.  Sea fisheries officers of the Department assisted with the monitoring of any effects on fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the four local authorities concerned commenced clean-up operations of their respective <Col N="900" /> coastlines immediately following the pollution incident and commissioned the Marine Institute to investigate whether the spillage at Milford Haven was the source of the pollutant.  I wish to compliment the local authorities concerned. As already announced on Thursday last, 18 April, the results of the investigations show that crude oil from the <i>Sea Empress</i> is the pollutant in this case.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy to pursue the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle whereby polluters are held liable for any damage caused and for costs of clean-up operations. In line with this policy and on the basis of the results of the investigation, the four local authorities concerned are currently estimating their respective claims for clean-up costs and damages for submission to the insurers of the <i>Sea Empress.</i> I understand that Wexford County Council is co-ordinating a joint claim and that preliminary estimates indicate the final joint claim is expected to be in the region of £150,000.</P>
    <P>Our procedures for supporting local authorities in this important matter will be kept under review.  Serious issues on the management of such catastrophic incidents as that involving the <i>Sea Empress,</i> in particular in relation to the emergency services response as the incident unfolded, will no doubt arise in the official review of the incident in the UK and by the EU Commission.  In view of the proximity of Milford Haven to our south-east coast we will examine closely the findings of these reports with a view to helping to ensure that threats to our coastline are minimised.  The availability and capability of towing facilities in Ireland to respond to a similar incident in our waters will be reviewed in this context.  I intend to review, as necessary, with the UK authorities at the highest level the lessons to be learned, in the light of the relevant report, from the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Minister of State seems to be saying that much support was given by different agencies, particularly his Department, to local <Col N="901" /> authorities.  However, there is a feeling on the ground that little or no support was given to Wexford County Council or to other councils.  Following the <i>Sea Empress</i> oil disaster at Milford Haven, was the Minister or the Department concerned at any stage about the possibility of oil reaching Irish beaches?  If so, what steps were taken from day one to monitor the dispersal of the oil spill?  If such monitoring took place, why was the oil which eventually came on shore not detected at sea?  Are there facilities for monitoring this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The various agencies gave continuous support to the local authorities concerned and I am surprised that Deputy Browne should claim otherwise.  Immediately the incident occurred at Milford Haven my Department liaised with the Meteorological Service at six hourly intervals to monitor wind and wave movements and detect where the oil was moving.  There was an officer in Milford Haven during the course of the incident to ensure that it was monitored on site.  Close contact was maintained with the UK authorities and EU observers who were in touch with the situation.</P>
      <P>The oil which turned up on our coastline was in the form of globules.  Therefore, it was not transported on the water surface and not detected.  When it turned up on the coastline, it was examined by the Marine Institute.  To establish without any doubt the source of the pollution, the institute also examined the pollution on the Milford Haven side. It found that the samples matched and that the pollution on our coastline came from the <i>Sea Empress.</i> It has, therefore, established a sound basis on which the local authorities concerned can pursue their claim for the recovery of the cost of the clean up operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> What support will the Department give local authorities to back up their claim for compensation from insurers and owners of the <i>Sea Empress</i> to cover the cost of the clean up?  Oil was washed on to the <Col N="902" /> beaches of Wexford yesterday and today.  This seems to be an ongoing problem which will result in major costs for local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I already replied to that. I stated that the technical services available to the Department, sea fishery officers, the Marine Institute and the Irish Marine Emergency Service have all worked with the local authorities concerned and are supporting and assisting them in making claims for recovery of the cost of the clean up.  This is in line with Government policy that we recover the full cost of a clean-up operation in a case like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The attack perpetrated on sea farm cages and moorings at Mannin Bay Salmon Company Ltd. in County Galway resulting in the loss of salmon smolts to sea was a reprehensible and criminal act.  I condemn utterly this appalling and wanton act of destruction which is currently the subject of a Garda investigation.</P>
      <P>The site in question is located at Knock Point in Mannin Bay.  The area was designated fully for aquaculture purposes by ministerial order under the Aquaculture (Clifden Bay, Mannin Bay) Order, 1986, following a public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> The company submitted a licence application to the Department of the Marine in 1993 which involved two elements &mdash; an increase in production limits and the opening up of a new site at Knock Point to facilitate fallowing.</P>
    <P>These proposals were the subject of extensive public consultations including the publication of an environmental impact study.  On foot of the public notice procedures, a range of representations and objections were submitted by interested persons and bodies.</P>
    <P>Following full consideration of submissions, representations and objections received and the Department's assessment of the technical and other implications of the proposal, I informed Mannin Bay Salmon Company Ltd., that I was not prepared to accede to the request to increase production for the 1996 growing season at the company's existing licensed sites.</P>
    <P>I did, however, approve the granting of licences in respect of the fallowing site at Knock Point.  The permissions given for the Knock Point site relate to fallowing only, are of trial duration &mdash; 1996 initially &mdash; and involve no increase in licensed production limits.</P>
    <P>The development of fallowing sites at sea farms is an internationally accepted fish husbandry-management strategy with demonstrable benefits for fish health and environmental standards.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ongoing Garda investigation, the Department's engineering services have also completed an investigation which in substance confirms the extent of the damage caused to nets and mooring ropes and the loss of salmon smolts.  The investigation also highlighted the danger to marine safety and navigation posed by three of the sea farm cages drifting away from the site following the severing of the mooring ropes.</P>
    <P>I also arranged for a representative from my office and officers of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to meet company management to assess the future implications for the company, both financial <Col N="904" /> and otherwise and to offer every assistance to them to re-establish their operational capacity at Mannin Bay and minimise job losses.</P>
    <P>The Department and its agencies and technical services will continue to assist Mannin Bay Salmon Company Ltd. in every way possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply on this unfortunate matter and I join him in condemning it as an act of vandalism of the highest order.  I gather that 250,000 smolts escaped resulting in a loss of over £1 million.  Can the Minister give some measure of compensation to the people who have suffered such a huge loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that 250,000 smolts were released as a result of the damage caused to the cages.  I understand that the company is in discussion with its insurers and this is the appropriate way in which the matter should be advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us wants to see that type of vandalism.  It puts people out of work, destroys property and is in violation of all principles of marine activity under which such activity is not interfered with in this way at sea.  I do not want to see this recurring and I have no reason to believe that it will.  In the meantime we are doing everything possible, through the Department and BIM, to assist the company concerned to re-establish its operation and to protect its investments and employment at that farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The rotation of the Irish battalion of UNIFIL had to be delayed by one week because of the security situation and the dangers it presented in relation to the movement of troops.  That rotation has now commenced with the first rotation flight having taken place yesterday.  The second and third rotation flights are due to take place on 30 April and 7 May 1996.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to ensure that the troop rotation is carried out in a way that maximises the safety of the personnel concerned and ongoing assessments of the security situation, including the routes to and from the Irish area of operations to Beirut Airport, are continuing.</P>
      <P>The families of soldiers who are due to rotate have been kept informed of the situation both by unit liaison personnel and ongoing media briefings given by the Defence Forces press officer and the Irish battalion military information officer in UNIFIL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the safety of Irish troops generally in their execution of the UNIFIL mandate, it is obviously not possible to give absolute guarantees as to their safety.  I can, however, give an assurance that none of the troops will be exposed to any unnecessary risks and all possible precautions are being taken to ensure their safety.  Road movement is restricted to <Col N="906" /> the minimum and is carried out in armoured vehicles or in armoured escorted convoys.  All such movement is notified in advance to the Israeli authorities through the UNIFIL liaison branch.</P>
    <P>The Irish battalion has specially designed secure bunkers in each of its positions and moves to these bunkers in the event of impending attacks.  Some personnel remain in secure observation posts during these attacks to ensure that the necessary observing and monitoring of activities in their area continues. Physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is continually being improved.</P>
    <P>Our troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures are geared to provide maximum safety for them consistent with the carrying out of their mission.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will join me in taking this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish battalion in South Lebanon who are doing a marvellous job in very difficult circumstances.  In addition to providing humanitarian assistance to the local population, our personnel have managed to carry out their normal peace-keeping duties of monitoring and reporting impartially all firings and other incidents in their area of operations.</P>
    <P>I propose to visit the Lebanon this weekend to see at first hand the situation in the Irish area of operations and to express the appreciation of the Government of the manner in which the troops continue to carry out their peace-keeping duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <P>I join the Minister in congratulating our troops serving with <Col N="907" /> UNIFIL in South Lebanon, and I welcome the fact that the Minister will visit them at the weekend.  To what extent have the Government and the Minister protested to the Israeli authorities about the bombing and shelling?  Have they received any guarantee that this will end?  While I accept the Minister cannot give an absolute guarantee for the safety of any troops, nonetheless we need to hear from the Israelis concerning a quick end to this outrageous conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn any attacks on peace keepers.  I sincerely hope the civilised world will respect those who serve on UN missions.  Peace keeping must be kept apart from conflicts between any parties.  The day respect for UN missions disappears is the day we will lose a very valuable asset for peace in the world.</P>
      <P>All incidents endangering the safety of Irish personnel are protested to the Israeli authorities through UNIFIL headquarters.  In the case of a serious incident the Department of Foreign Affairs, at my request, makes a formal protest to the Israeli ambassador.  Certain procedures are in place for lodging protests while the Deputy will appreciate that diplomatic moves are a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs. However, we are using whatever influence we can through our membership of the European Union to put pressure on all sides involved in this conflict to cease this ongoing savagery, and to get back to the negotiating table and reach some agreement for the future.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that we are not behind the door in making our feelings known to the Israeli authorities in this instance and, through our membership of the EU, in seeking a diplomatic solution to this ongoing problem.</P>

While these rates are subject to ongoing review.  I am not aware of any analysis that suggests these rates are a constraint on investment either in modernisation, fish processing or aquaculture.  On the contrary the demand for grants exceeds the resources available at the moment, so that any increase in the rates of aid would reduce the number of projects which could be aided.</P>
      <P>As regards the special scheme and the total rate of aid of 50 per cent for the upgrading of fish processing premises, I should point out that under EU law all fish processing plants had to be upgraded to high standards in a short timeframe or be faced with closing down, putting a large volume of employment at risk.</P>
      <P>On the matter of safety and the modernisation of fishing vessels, some 131 modernisation projects have been approved under the present programme and over 90 per cent of these have a high safety element.  That is an ongoing programme and all new applications will be considered on their merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> As the Deputy will be aware, I have established a high level committee on fishing vessel safety which is reviewing all matters relevant to that subject.  I will consider very carefully any recommendations it may make on the modernisation of fishing vessel grants scheme.</P>

      <P>In this case, when the Operational Programme was agreed in 1994, prior to our party being in Government, the then Government set the rate.  It set these priorities in accordance with policy guidelines.  The real problem is a lack of adequate moneys. If we had more money for this area we would certainly be able to help more people.  We intend seeking additional funds for the marine in reviewing the operational programme at the end of 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently received the final report of the salmon management task force.  I am now studying the report with a view to finalising as soon as possible a <Col N="910" /> comprehensive strategic blueprint for the future management of the wild salmon sector.  I intend to publish the report as soon as this can be arranged and to afford the House, or an appropriate committee of the House, the opportunity to have a full debate on the report.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue raised by Deputy Deasy, the power to issue drift net licences for salmon is exercised by individual regional fisheries boards under section 67 of the Fisheries Act, 1959 as amended by section 11(4) of the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>The criteria by which the boards must allocate drift net licences is set out in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders, 1980 and 1982.  There are approximately 15 points or conditions which the regional boards must consider in determining the allocation of commercial net licences each year.  The purpose of these detailed conditions is to afford as many fishermen as can be accommodated an opportunity to secure an equitable share of the overall salmon catch while ensuring that precedence is given to those who depend on salmon fishing for a significant part of their income.</P>
    <P>I have no immediate proposal to create an alternative system for the allocation of net licences.  However, the drift net fishery and the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order are among the points explored by the task force.  I intend to weigh all recommendations made to me concerning salmon management with a view to implementing practical measures which will secure the future for Irish salmon stocks in the wild.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister will have to study the report of the task force before it is published.  We all look forward to the opportunity of discussing it when it comes before the House.  Will the report have any element within it &mdash; or does the Minister consider it worth while having an element within the report &mdash; to enlighten the public's attitude towards <Col N="911" /> the salmon industry and the fishing industry generally?  We do not have the type of structural history that will attract tourists to Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, we have the natural resources in which other countries are sadly lacking in terms of the environment and in this area.  To promote that fact we must enlighten the people about the necessity to have an industry of this kind and ensure they realise fully the benefits of it to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to refer to what is in the report, but the remit given to the task force was to prepare practical proposals for the management of wild salmon stocks, taking into account the various policy objectives which I previously outlined to the House.  In that context a national salmon policy must take cognisance of numerous issues critical to the conservation of wild salmon stocks and to the maximisation to the economy on a sustainable basis of the value of the wild salmon resource.  The regulation of the drift net fishery is but one element of that management.</P>
      <P>Salmon fishing, particularly the drift net fishing at sea, has been regulated by a number of measures over the years with a view to ensuring that sufficient numbers escape to their native rivers to secure the continuation of the stocks. These measures include a Community ban on all fishing for salmon outside 12 miles from base lines, a restriction on the numbers of licences for the use of drift nets, no fishing for two days at weekends, annual closed seasons, restrictions on the size of boat, the maximum length and depth of nets that may be used and a ban on the use of monofilament material in drift nets.  I agree with Deputy Lynch that the element of public information and education about the value of our fish stocks must form a central part of the strategy in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>This is an important, comprehensive and far-reaching report on the travelling community which will be valuable in the future.  As the report was published nine nonths ago I would have thought that a comprehensive action plan would be in place by now and that each Minister could tell the House what they intend to do.  The report received a warm welcome here and we hope the Government will take action on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the conflicts that can arise between the settled and the travelling communities, it is a sad fact that most of us have prejudices of one sort or another.  These are often based on a lack of information, misunderstandings or simple ignorance, but we must try to overcome them.  This can be done my meeting people and trying to solve the problems together.  The support groups for travellers, which are doing excellent work, are tackling this problem on an area basis.  The excellent work of the support groups in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Finglas is leading to a greater <Col N="1053" /> understanding and development.  I suggest the introduction of community based encounter groups, an approach that could be helpful in solving problems, breaking down prejudices and reaching agreement.  The travellers and the settled community must work together to resolve difficulties such as when problems arise with local hoteliers, restaurant owners or publicans. The encounter groups are helpful and I have seen this process in operation on the northside of the city.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is vehemently opposed to discrimination against any individual or group, including women, people with disabilities and members of the travelling community.  Much of the work done over the years for the travelling community was carried out by Fianna Fáil. We are and have long been committed to reconciling the common good of the community as a whole, with respect for minorities and for creating a tolerant and pluralist society free from discrimination, hatred or incitement on religious or racial grounds.</P>
    <P>We support the introduction of an equal status Bill and believe the difficulties the Minister has encountered can be overcome.  We urge him to bring forward this Bill before the summer. Although such legislation would not of itself put an end to the discrimination faced by the traveller community, it will make an important contribution.</P>
    <P>The basic principle which must underlie the equal status legislation is that in general people should be judged on their merits as individuals.  We are in agreement with the Minister on this but I ask him to bring forward the equal status Bill.  Fianna Fáil will support him in working out its details.</P>
    <P>There are three important Bills pending in this area and the Minister referred to two of them.  I am referring to the employment equality Bill, which will be introduced before the summer; the equal status Bill, which the Minister promises before the end of the year &mdash; we would like to see it sooner &mdash; and the Control and Regulation of Horses Bill which is particularly relevant and to <Col N="1054" /> which different approaches will have to be adopted.  This needs urgent attention. A great deal has been done over the years and the way forward is clear.  The task force has pointed the way and I would like the Government to get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many Deputies who have contributed to this debate, I would like to thank those involved in preparing this report.  In particular, I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who commissioned the report, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, who initially chaired the task force, and Senator Mary Kelly, who took over from Deputy McManus.</P>
      <P>In light of recent comments by a Fianna Fáil councillor in Waterford, I was pleased to note the contributions to the debate last night by Deputies Flood and Martin, both of which were reasonable and restrained.  If fault were to be found it is that Fianna Fáil does not recognise the inconsistency in requesting action and spending in debates such as this and then complaining about the level of public spending when the nation's finances are being discussed.  Like Deputy Martin, who voiced some criticisms, I will not labour that point.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and Deputy Connaughton pointed out last night that this is not the first report on the travelling community and that much of its contents are not new.  It is rather the latest report and, as such, is the most valuable. It is also distinctive in that it has been already followed up with clear proposals, the most significant of which has been in regard to accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of Dublin City Council, representing an area which has a boundary with County Dublin, I am aware of the accommodation problem for travellers. My Dáil constituency of Dublin North East has two traveller housing schemes, one at Caragh Park, Coolock, where there are 22 units, and the second at Grove Lane, which has more than 20 <Col N="1055" /> bays, and where extensive refurbishment works, funded by the Department of the Environment, were recently completed.  These facilities were developed and serviced by Dublin Corporation, which is the local authority. Relations are reasonably good between the settled and travelling communities. Over 10 per cent of the children attending the Priorswood primary schools are traveller children.</P>
    <P>Additional resources were given to this school last year by the Minister for Education.  Meetings between local residents and travellers frequently take place, convened by officials of Dublin Corporation's traveller section, to deal with local issues and resolve difficulties.</P>
    <P>The task force identifies illegal sites as a source of difficulty.  There are two illegal sites in the Belcamp Lane area. The one known locally as Ward's Field has been in existence for a number of years and proposals for housing families there are currently under consideration. The other illegal site is situated on land acquired by Fingal County Council for the construction of the final phase of the northern cross motorway route.  The families on this site were moved there by Fingal County Council last year from the former Baldoyle racecourse.  Fingal County Council provided the families there with a water supply in the form of a water tap but no other facilities were provided.</P>
    <P>Fingal County Council did not consult Dublin City Council or the corporation management when this decision was made.  As a member of Dublin City Council I strongly object to this cavalier action by Fingal County Council in setting up an illegal site in the Dublin city area.  Fingal County Council claimed afterwards that some of the traveller families concerned had lived in the Dublin city area.  If this were true it could be said it had carried out &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo; in this case.  Fingal County Council has a bad record of providing traveller settlement facilities in its administrative area, as had Dublin City Council when it was the local authority <Col N="1056" /> for the present Fingal area.  Fingal had proposed a number of settlement sites in its area but following objections dropped them.  Its policy is one of paralysis. This incident points to the need for action at national level.</P>
    <P>In today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> I note a report of a case at Skibbereen Court where the owner of a company called Shift and Lift was appealing against the severity of a jail sentence imposed on him when engaged in moving travellers in Bantry in 1994.  The owner of Shift and Lift told the court that Dublin County Council had used his company on a regular basis for what he described as &ldquo;to shift travellers&rdquo;.  I call on the Minister to obtain further information on the record of the company called Shift and Lift in dealing with the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of stray horses, some of whom, but by no means all, belong to the travelling community. The damage caused by stray horses is also a source of friction between sports clubs and the travelling community when horses damage football pitches.  In my constituency many pitches and public parks are unusable because of the damage caused by horses.  There have also been cases where children have been injured by horses.  We are patiently awaiting the Control of Horses Bill to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>As a result of the working group established on receipt of the report by the Minister, it has been decided to adopt a five year strategy for traveller accommodation.  This will lead to the building of 3,100 units by the end of the century.  As currently estimated there are fewer than 1,500 travelling families either on the roadside or in halting sites. This is a substantial programme of work.  In the past such programmes were difficult to deliver on.  Consequently, I welcome the establishment of a working group in the Department of the Environment to monitor the implementation of the programme and the fact that there will be a responsibility on all local authorities to develop plans in accordance with the national strategy. <Col N="1057" /> In the past, some councils pulled their weight on this issue while others did not.</P>
    <P>Unless we can secure a coherent approach at national level, the plan is doomed to failure.  It is appropriate that local managers in their respective counties have executive responsibility for delivering on the plan but I issue a word of warning to the Minister for the Environment that that in itself is not sufficient without appropriate pressure from his Department.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, there is a responsibility on travellers to promote their own cause.  While they are unquestionably subjected to discrimination at the hands of the settled community, in some cases travellers act as their own best adversaries.  Many people seem only too pleased to tar all travellers with the actions of a few.  The report's finding in relation to traveller health and education presents a sorry picture.  As the Minister highlighted, infant and adult mortality rates for travellers are over twice that for the settled community, their participation rate in second and third level education is abysmal and they suffer from extremely high levels of unemployment.  While it is understandable that the report should deal with all these elements separately, it is clear they are all linked.  In many cases the health and education standards achieved by a travelling person are directly related to their environment. This confirms that the solution of the accommodation problem is the key to determining whether this task force report will make a greater impact than many of its predecessors.  If and when we make the breakthrough on traveller accommodation difficulties, I am confident that the rest of the issues will fall into place.  This is not to neglect or underestimate the measures already in place, many of which the Minister has outlined, in the fields of health and education. They include the establishment of a travellers' health advisory committee, which will include representatives <Col N="1058" /> from the travelling community, the consideration of a policy document on travellers' health and on traveller women's health especially.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education deals significantly with the problem facing travellers and states the goal that 50 per cent of travellers within a decade should complete the senior education cycle.  If we are determined, through this report, to break the link between travellers and poverty, we must succeed.</P>
    <P>I support a suggestion, made during the debate last night, that a certain number of places should be reserved in universities for travellers.  Without measures for positive discrimination being initiated it is impossible to break the logjam.</P>
    <P>The report also deals with traveller culture.  We all recognise that travellers have a distinctive culture going back centuries.  Nonetheless, culture <i>per se</i> cannot and should not be used to define some brutal and unfair practices.  The treatment meted out to some traveller women is unacceptable, as is the practice by some families of sending children out to earn a living by begging on the street.  Culture by definition is an evolving phenomenon, it does not and cannot excuse such practices.</P>
    <P>The publication of the report presents an opportunity to address this issue in a comprehensive manner.  For too long the plight of the travelling community has been a black spot in the renaissance of modern Irish culture.  As our economy grows and our self confidence as a society increases, as a result of our participation in Europe, it is a chance we cannot afford to miss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past, we have shown ourselves to be adept in categorising and pigeonholing vulnerable minorities.  Categorising made life easier for us but it does not bring much joy to the people who inhabit that category. When you categorise you do not see people as individuals with hopes and dreams.  The danger is that small, visible minorities have tended to be viewed as problems to be solved only on our <Col N="1059" /> terms.  There is a tendency to see minorities as we see ourselves in a &ldquo;why do they not live in houses like the rest of us&rdquo; attitude.  Travellers have problems and frequently they impact adversely on the settled community.  We must plan with the travelling people rather than for them.  We must develop an understanding of their diversity and distinctive culture.  I compliment RTE which, a few years ago, on a radio programme &ldquo;on the Tobar&rdquo; gave travellers a platform to express their own cultural identity and promote a wider understanding of their distinctive traditions among the wider community.</P>
      <P>To build a fully integrated, inclusive society we must try to come to terms with this nagging stubborn issue which has been with us for far too long.  It is now over 30 years since we had the first major report on travellers which was followed by a number of interim reports, culminating in the one we are discussing today.  As bad as the position is now, it was truly appalling at that time.  Only 56 out of 1,198 families were in proper accommodation.  We have come a long way since then.  I do not have the exact statistics but I am sure in the region of 3,000 are housed with significant numbers either in single private housing accommodation, in group housing or in service sites throughout the country.  Clearly, we must continue to ensure we remove that blot which is still here in terms of our failure to complete that task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a generous people with a unique tradition in our support for and involvement in problems abroad as far as Ethiopia and Bosnia and so many other places &mdash; many volunteers are prepared to give their time generously to help people of different denominations, some nomadic and others suffering from hunger and deprivation &mdash; it is strange that this problem in Ireland does not attract anything like the same attention. We can be outraged by a comment made about the travelling community and we can read press editorials, to <Col N="1060" /> which I have no objection, but I am certain that the outrage does not extend to the stage where the people involved would tolerate itinerant families on halting sites close to their homes.  The outrage extends to dealing with the problem at a distance, it does not want to get involved in solving it close up, &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Time and time again local communities refuse to look after this minority group.  They show their resistance by the use of dangerous dogs or good security systems and as long as they do so these injustices will remain.  Members of the travelling community regularly attend my clinics, particularly when their children are about to receive First Communion or they are celebrating other family occasions.  Traveller children have a different life expectancy from children in the settled community.  It is almost certain they will be unemployed. Females are likely to get married at a young age and have more children than they can afford.  They have a greater tendency to get asthma because of the unhygienic and dangerous caravans in which they live during the cold winter months.  However, although those statistics relate to a community that suffers great deprivation and represents a tiny percentage of our population, there is enormous furore when we try to deal with the horrific problems they face of unemployment, lack of education, housing and poor health standards.</P>
    <P>In recent years successive Ministers for the Environment have provided local authorities with increased funds to enable them grapple with these problems but their efforts are often blocked at local level.  Some local authorities acquired land and provided the necessary facilities but they attracted travellers from other areas where such facilities were not provided.  If a uniform policy were adopted each local authority could solve the problem in its area. At present some settled communities are justified in asking why they should have a preponderance of travellers in their area while others do not face up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> As regards education and training, we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a minority group who have a different culture.  We must provide greatly enhanced resources, including remedial and other facilities, at primary school level to cater for travellers coming into the educational stream.</P>
    <P>I have a lifelong interest in the problems of the mentally and physically handicapped.  While much remains to be be done, I can proudly claim that Roscrea has some of the best facilities in the country for such people.  Large numbers of children with poor listening ability, poor hearing skills and others who are unable to conform to present day standards lose out in primary school.  That is evident from prison statistics which show that 90 per cent of prisoners left school before reaching 16 years of age.  That is not to say it is wrong to leave school before that age but early intervention would have succeeded in preventing many of them from being involved in crime, drugs and so on.</P>
    <P>There is great opposition to the travelling community, not least because of the involvement of some of them in crime.  While that may be justified in some cases, there is no basis for it in justice nor will it solve the problems.  They will continue and we will live with the prospect of a divided community.</P>
    <P>Given our track record in endeavouring to solve problems that arise abroad, I cannot understand why public representatives are afraid of losing their Dáil or council seats if they do not back the general public in resisting the travelling community.  I do not believe they would lose their seats if they tackled the injustice perpetrated on this community but if they did it would not be a condemnation of their work.  The public understand frank and vigorous leadership. The facts will not disappear merely because they are ignored.  As a society we are driven to excell in the areas of business, commerce and sport and it defies logic that we cannot solve a problem for a tiny deprived minority in society.  We do not know what it is like <Col N="1062" /> to live with the realities faced by the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Travellers are blamed when they do what nearly every species does when it is hunted.  We have to ask ourselves seriously whether we have the courage to tackle this problem, or must we admit there is latent racism here?  It would be very sad if it were true.</P>
    <P>The value of property can decline overnight as a result of decisions taken at international level which have nothing to do with the traveller community. It can happen as a result of a rise in interest rates.  However, if there is any threat on this front, we do not want to know about it.  I support the Minister's attempts, and I would like to see the legislation introduced so that we can debate it.</P>
    <P>There should be an end to reports, task forces and committees.  There is nobody who has been elected to this House or who has held ministerial office who does not know how crucial is the education of the traveller community, along with improving their health, employment and other prospects, the provision of sites by the local authority and all the things that go towards providing shelter and other normal requirements.</P>
    <P>People elected to this House and to local authorities should realise that public meetings and a public threatening the resolution of this problem will extend into the future, and the same problem will face successive public representatives. The stubborn problem remains, and we shrink from it.  I would encourage local authorities to come up with reasonable plans, to do their best at local level and not be discouraged if nearby local authorities do not tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>For those of the nomadic tradition who will not become involved in education as we know it, we must consider other ways of intervening and encouraging them to get training, and the opportunity to do traditional work.  We need to plan with the traveller community.  In doing that we can encourage them away from the more unacceptable practices in <Col N="1063" /> terms of the management of their own sites, hygiene, litter etc.  Regarding keeping horses in built-up areas, the realities must be brought home to the traveller community as well as to the rest of us.</P>
    <P>My intervention is primarily one of support for and understanding of the problems that exist and of resolve to support the Government and the local authorities in their drive towards a resolution of this stubborn problem.  I encourage public representatives at local and national level to inform the public.  We have generally generous communities who want to help, and they should be encouraged to do so.  There should be a broader understanding of what it is that we enjoy that is not available to the people we are trying to help. We should try to sell that message more generally.  There is a latent sympathy which we need to awaken in everybody outside the traveller community in our efforts to deal with this problem.  We must do it with courage and determination and we should not again be faced, a few years from now, with another report telling us about education, health, life expectancy, unemployment, crime and all the other things that we know about and that we knew about long before now.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Boylan.</P>
      <P>This is the most serious problem facing the people and it will not go away.  I listened to Deputy Smith with great interest.  He is right in saying this is not the best item to have on the agenda for a county council meeting.  I am a member of the Westport Urban Council and of Mayo County Council and we have a major problem with the traveller community. We have one halting site in Castlebar the manager of which, Des Mahon, has done a survey in relation to travellers.  He says this problem will not go away and that by the year 2000 it will have tripled.  It is a problem that will have to be faced by local authorities and the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> We tried to locate a halting site in Westport on three occasions.  We failed because of resistance to it.  I know a certain person in the town who goes to mass every morning and every evening, but when it was proposed to locate a halting site 300 yards from her door she was one of the 300 people that stood outside the Westport Urban Council offices waving her banner objecting to a halting site in that area.</P>
    <P>The assistant county manager, the county councillors and most of the people in my town who do very good work for the traveller community say we must do something about this very serious problem and that we have to find a halting site.  That is the difficulty. Where can one locate a halting site that people will accept?  Last Monday morning, like every public representative elected to this House, I had three or four travellers visit my clinic.  Not a week passes that I do not have travellers at my clinic.  I treat them like everybody else and assist them as best I can.  Last week I asked a friend of mine to go to court in a month's time in connection with a court order from the local council to shift a young traveller off property owned by the council.  The traveller told me he will go if the council will provide somewhere for him to put his caravan.  I understand the case is going not to the local court but to the Circuit Court where, to be represented, he needs to employ a barrister.  A certain solicitor represented him in regard to criminal offences for which he got free legal aid. The solicitor will not be able to defend him this time because he needs a barrister, but to get a barrister for 20 minutes work is costly, and there is no guarantee that he will win his case.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government established committees in which they endeavoured to involve the traveller community.  Nonetheless I cannot accept that the traveller community must have total say, that the traveller tradition must live on, allowing them do whatever they wish.  I will defend my views inside or outside this House.  The <Col N="1065" /> traveller community must give a bit as must the settled community.</P>
    <P>The local authority in Westport has a wonderful record on housing travellers throughout County Mayo.  It is not acceptable that when housed, travellers bring along five or six caravans with their dogs and horses to a housing estate.  That is something that must be investigated.  While agreeing that travellers should be cared for, housed, educated and so on, like everyone else, they must obey the law of the land.</P>
    <P>In addition, every county must establish a register of travellers and be responsible for them.  We in County Mayo, particularly in the Westport area, experience serious problems every summer when anything from 30 to 60 traveller caravans are brought into the town, parked on roads and on beaches and remain there for the summer.  Like everybody else, the traveller community is entitled to go on holiday with one or two caravans but their practice of moving in cavalcade and taking over a town, is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Our electorate respond to every worldwide emergency.  Whenever Irish people are asked to put their hands in their pockets to assist people in need, perhaps because of their Famine and other experiences, they are very generous contributors, always willing to assist a worthy cause or project at local, national or international level.  The settled community will respond to the needs of travellers once the travellers reciprocate.</P>
    <P>I favour giving halting sites and local authority houses to travellers but they must live in the same manner as the settled community.  I have seen people react in a very vicious manner whenever a halting site is proposed to be located within one mile of their residence.  This is especially the case with owners of property and land, many of whom have worked very hard to rear their families, to obtain a mortgage and make a decent livelihood for their families.  While not against the traveller community in general, they are critical of the way some of them behave.  We have witnessed that <Col N="1066" /> behaviour on the part of some members of the settled community, exemplified by many serious incidents nationwide in recent months.</P>
    <P>As a public representative, I hear such complaints daily.  At my weekly clinic on Monday last, I heard complaints about a housing estate in Westport, one from an unmarried mother with a number of children living in a council estate next door to a traveller.  I endeavoured to talk to both parties, and requested the local superintendent of the Garda and the local authority to get them to try to resolve their problems because, if not, one party will have to move on.</P>
    <P>There are wonderful voluntary organisations, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others, whose volunteers give willingly of their time, and will do everything possible to assist travellers but travellers must respond to the settled community and obey the law of the land.  It is fear of behavioural problems among the traveller community that leads the settled community to be apprehensive about being near them. That is all the more reason for enrolling children of the traveller community in schools.  A number of traveller children now attend school along with my children in Westport.  They have settled in and are well respected by the local community.</P>
    <P>One woman from the traveller community approaches me regularly whenever the settled community experienced problems arising from traveller behavioural problems.  She was the first member of the traveller community to be housed in Westport and she set the standard.  The people of Westport responded to her because she responded to them in like manner.  Hers is one of the nicest houses in the local estate, well kept, with a garden full of flowers and is a credit to herself and the traveller community generally.  We endeavour to obtain her advice and the advice of people like her in Westport to help us house travellers.  While it is not a popular political issue, or one that will win votes, at the end of the day we must <Col N="1067" /> do what is right by the public, which is why we were elected.</P>
    <P>On the equal status Bill, like many other public representatives we see press reports that do not portray the full truth.  I know there is a great deal of consultation with the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Minister will resolve their problem.  He will make the right decision when this Bill is introduced, not only in the interests of the traveller community but in the interests of the settled community whose traders must be protected.  Almost nightly, members of the settled community are dealt with in public houses, chip shops and discos.  In this respect I have no doubt the Minister will introduce appropriate legislation to protect the settled and traveller community alike.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Ministers responsible and the Government on the publication of this report.  While the travellers and their interests is not a popular issue, it is one that must be confronted because it will not disappear.  A number of weeks ago the Mayo county manager predicted this problem will treble in the next 20 years.  It must be tackled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing some of his time with me.  This is a very important issue causing many people enormous problems.  Nonetheless there is much hypocrisy among some Members who raise the issue here &mdash; those who call for housing for travellers but who would be up in arms if such a settlement were allocated to their local area.  Can any public representative put hand on heart and say they want travellers housed beside them? Most people would respond in the negative, so let us be factual about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traveller community have brought many problems on themselves; there is no question about that.  I can vouch for there being many good traveller families.  I am probably one of the few public representatives who can claim that we in Cavan County Council play our part in catering for the traveller <Col N="1068" /> community.  A halting site was provided for them in the heart of Cavan Town. When the halting site was developed, there followed a slow process, involving a number of traveller families moving in with their caravans, taking up residence, remaining for a while and moving on. Gradually we progressed to building a total of 20 chalets into which travellers moved over a period.  They insisted on retaining their caravans so that they could move on whenever they might wish to do so.  This policy has worked and those 20 chalets are now occupied. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, recently inspected them.  She was very surprised at the progress made and said it could be the forerunner of many such developments nationwide.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ring and Michael Smith made the point that, whenever a local authority attempts to help the traveller community by providing facilities in, say, Cavan, Longford, Westport and so on, travellers converge on those areas, creating problems.  All local authorities nationwide must play their rightful part in alleviating this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment will have to regularise the overall position, imposing sanctions on any local authority that has not lived up to its responsibilities in this matter after a specified period.  After all, the traveller community are our people.  There is no point in crying about what should be done while nothing continues to be done, adopting the attitude &mdash; solve the problem, but not at my back door.</P>
    <P>If every local authority played its part, the travelling community could be integrated in the community and we have set a good example in County Cavan.  There are, however, families who will not settle because it is their nature to roam.  There is danger when six or seven vans converge at a point on very busy roads and I expect there will be a serious accident involving small children sooner or later.  There will have to be designated parking sites available for those who simply will not settle. Running water and toilet facilities <Col N="1069" /> would have to be available at these parking areas which should be a pre-requisite in every county and located adjacent to the town.  If a problem arises with the travelling community, it is known where they are.  I have been involved with families in Cavan town who simply cannot settle, come spring they get itchy feet and off they go. There is the added consideration that they are into dealing, buying and selling farm gates is big in rural areas.  People could refuse to do business with them but farmers seem to think they get good value &mdash; I am sure the local co-op would be able to give them equal value with the added advantage that one could return the item if it is not up to standard.</P>
    <P>People have the idea that while travellers are moving around the country, they are also targeting houses for robberies. I cannot honestly say whether they are involved in the robberies although there are indications that some are.  However, people in the settled community engage in robbery yet we do not tar the whole community with the same brush.  If the unfortunate travellers are caught robbing once or twice, the travelling community are targeted as being all the same.</P>
    <P>There are some very good people in the travelling community who are very house proud and supportive of their children.  I am aware of one family with a handicapped child and the care the child receives is unprecedented.  The offer to take the child into full-time care was refused.  The child is looked after perfectly.  If we are serious about dealing with the problem we must provide them with caravan parking areas, where they are safely off the road, and the opportunity of progression towards open type chalets so that people can get a feel for what it is like to live in a solid structure where there is a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and dining area and sitting room.  One cannot take a person directly from a caravan and put him into a bungalow, a cottage or other type of building overnight because they simply <Col N="1070" /> will not stay there.  There is an educational aspect to resettlement.  Cavan county manager, Mr. Brian Johnston, and the county secretary will be glad to pass on information on how the system developed in Cavan.</P>
    <P>There certainly does not appear to be any poverty among the travelling community. The Department of Social Welfare looks after them extremely well and there are many agencies looking after such people.  I often wonder how they can afford their caravans, landrovers and vans.  One would have to ask if some members of the travelling community have another agenda because I cannot fathom how they can afford to keep exclusive looking vans on the road and have them taxed and insured.  If some of the families are involved in other activities, they should be questioned about it.  They certainly could not have such vehicles on the strength of social welfare payments.  They may be involved in other activities under the cover of travelling around the country and that is why people raise objections to them.</P>
    <P>By and large, the day of the horse drawn caravan has gone but some travellers still keep horses for the children to play with and this causes extreme nuisance, particularly in the city.  I do not think they should expect people who have gone to the trouble of buying a house to tolerate four or five horses in the park allocated to a housing estate. That could not be allowed.  They will have to toe the line like everybody else. I would not condone allowing a traveller family to pitch their tent beside a housing estate.  The people who have made an investment in their homes should have it protected by the State and one should not allow a development that will devalue their property as that would be grossly unfair, but suitable locations can be found.  In the heart of Cavan, we have developed a halting site and a residential area that is an outstanding success. If this was repeated nationwide, the problem would be solved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a worthwhile debate on the complex question of the settlement of the travelling community. No party or section of society has a monopoly of virtue in handling this issue, equally, nobody carries the full burden of blame for the lack of an overall settlement.</P>
      <P>My party published a programme for the settlement of travelling people entitled &ldquo;Power Back to the People the Fianna Fáil Alternative&rdquo; prior to the local elections in 1985.  In that document, it is stated:</P>
      <P>In recent years, problems relating to the travelling people have become more acute.  Fianna Fáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Believes that these problems transcend any one area and urges that re-settlement be spread over more communities, in all areas of the country.  Fianna Fáil believes that greater understanding and co-operation is required to meet the urgent needs of travellers who are one of the most deprived sections of our community.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody in this House disagrees that this is a national problem and that its solution should be spread throughout the country.</P>
      <P>2.  Deplores the Coalition's decision to transfer authority in matters relating to travellers to the city and county managers.  Fianna Fáil believes that the problem of integration, as well as the achievement of a due balance between the needs of the traveller and the wider community will be effected only with local input.</P>
      <P>Discretionary powers should not be placed in the hands of officials who in the interest of any easy solution often ignore local knowledge and, in any case, are more the agents of central government than local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believed then and still believe that to integrate the travellers into the community there must be acceptance by the <Col N="1072" /> community in the area of the site.  Item 3 continued:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that serviced and supervised halting sites for travellers should be provided, with no more than five families per site. These sites should be properly maintained, supervised and, given the national character of the problem, financed from central funds.</P>
    <P>The provision and construction of halting sites are very expensive and the funding should come from the Exchequer.  Item 4 stated:</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be encouraged to provide special housing and give special attention to the health and educational needs of children.</P>
    <P>This is an important principle and much progress has been made in the provision and co-ordination of the health and educational services.  Item 5 stated:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil calls for a renewed effort to address the problems of the travelling people and the areas in which they have settled.  This effort must involve local communities as well as central agencies in the solution of what Fianna Fáil sees as a national problem.</P>
    <P>It is a national problem today, as it was in 1985.  However, this House and the local authorities have done a great deal. It is easy for people to criticise the lack of progress because much remains to be done.  Everybody in this House recognises that fact and most fair minded Members of the House, given free choice, would tackle it.  Unfortunately, Members are subject to constituency pressures, especially those who are members of local authorities.  However, to the credit of many members of local authorities, much has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Before the 1985 election there was considerable criticism in Dublin County Council of what was being achieved by the local authorities in Dublin.  I had the opportunity in 1985 of reviewing what had been achieved between the original 1960s report on the travellers and the <Col N="1073" /> 1980s.  In the Dublin County Council area 145 families were provided with halting sites and bungalows.  In addition, from 1978 approximately 120 families had been housed, of which 74 traveller families remained as tenants of the local authorities.  It is also estimated that approximately half of the 101 houses made available by Dublin Corporation and occupied by traveller families were located in the county.  Altogether 316 families were accommodated in the county, 270 of whom were still in accommodation taking account of the 46 who had left the local authority houses.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that ten years later a huge problem does not remain within County Dublin.  However, it is fair to put on record the achievement of many councillors who took considerable pressure from residents' associations and others in this regard.  In 1985, following a proposal from me on behalf of the majority group, the council came up with a suggestion to provide sites and houses for travellers.  We believed, as I still believe, that as a society we are not prepared to condemn the travelling community to living in appalling conditions on unauthorised sites at the sides of the roads.  As a society we are more Christian in our approach and we should not be prepared to accept children being left on the roadside because communities are not prepared to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>In the programme of 1985, the council decided to locate two sites for five families in each local authority area in the county.  On average, each electoral area had approximately 7,500 homes.  The proposal would have meant having one travelling family for every 750 homes in an electoral area.  That is not too much to ask any community to absorb.  In a Christian country we should be entitled to expect that people would accept such a proposal.  Generally, people have accepted it.</P>
    <P>There are exceptions and problems. There have been mass meetings, appeals, CPOs and other controversies with some sites but many of the facilities <Col N="1074" /> proposed in 1985 have been built.  Councillors and public representatives have come under horrendous pressure from residents in the process.  However, research would show that in many cases the large meetings, which all Members have attended at some time, were organised by a hard core of up to ten people and did not necessarily reflect the views of everybody at the meetings. Given an explanation and a choice, people are Christian in their approach and will accept travelling families in their communities.</P>
    <P>Deputies and local authority members might say that it is asking too much of them to attend residents' association meetings to argue their point.  We are public representatives because we put our names forward for election as leaders of our communities. As such, it is our responsibility to lead our people and there is no greater challenge than our duty to those within society who are less fortunate than ourselves and who, in most cases, are members of the travelling community.  I am a realist and I understand the pressure imposed on councillors and public representatives; I have been subject to it also.  However, there are occasions when one must stand up to such pressure.</P>
    <P>The 1985 programme proposed two sites for five families in each electoral area.  There was considerable pressure from certain regions of the county and that pressure continues today.  The idea was that one site would be provided in each area and the second sites would be provided during the second round of construction.  Much progress has been made, although not as much as I would have liked.  In Ballycoolin, Blanchardstown, ten families have been settled.  In Porterstown, Castleknock, there are five families, in Portmarnock there are ten families, in Swords there are five and Balbriggan has five.  In addition, housing for ten families has been provided in Parslickstown.  There are six temporary halting sites and further sites are planned for Forest Road, Swords, and <Col N="1075" /> Navan Road.  Those figures relate to just one area of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Much more needs to be done and there must be greater co-ordination. There must be a recognition of the national character of the problem and finance must be provided from Central Funds.  There must also be a reward and punishment approach.  If one local authority does its duty in providing a programme for the settlement of travellers in its area, it should not act as a magnet drawing travellers to the area.  The adjoining local authorities should have to carry their portion of the settlement. They should not be allowed to do nothing in the hope the travellers will go to the adjoining area.  There should be greater co-ordination between the Departments of Education and Health and the health boards.  Unfortunately, that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the responsibility of society and public representatives. The travelling community also has responsibilities.  It would be naive to suggest that all the problems are on one side.  Greater efforts should be made by the travellers to show that communities have nothing to fear by the establishment of sites in their areas.  Those living beside authorised or unauthorised sites should no longer be able to point to the destruction of property, intimidation of families or general misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>The travellers have responsibilities with regard to their own children.  In general, the travelling community's responsibility for its children is excellent. This responsibility is part of their ethos.  However, a hard core of families in the greater Dublin area abandon their children at various locations in the city centre in all weathers.  If a child from a settled community family was treated that way the health boards would have the child taken into care. The traveller children are left sitting on O'Connell Bridge, for example, while the adults take whatever money they collect and take them away in the evening.  It is wrong and should not be allowed to happen.  I raised this matter <Col N="1076" /> in the House previously but nothing happened.  Under the law, if a child from the settled community was involved the parents would be jailed for such mistreatment.  However, because it is traveller children who are involved nobody takes responsibility for them. Somebody must take responsibility to protect those children.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas and local authorities are criticised for not providing proper protections.  I am proud of an Act I brought through this House &mdash; the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, which was welcomed by all parties in the House.  It was designed to prohibit incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.  The definition of hatred in the Act is &ldquo;...hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation.&rdquo; The legislation gives protection to the travelling community, as is its right.</P>
    <P>Much has been done since the original report in the 1960s.  We are inclined to forget about that report and the conditions in which many travellers lived in those days under tarpaulins in horse drawn caravans beside ditches and hedges.  A lot remains to be done.  Many traveller families live in squalor on roadsides.  I welcome the report. However, rather than have diktats and solutions from on high, the issues should be tackled at local level.  Sites should be small.  We need to give the children the opportunity to integrate in society rather than being in an itinerant camp on the edge of a town with 20 or 30 other families.  They should have the opportunity to go to the schools, integrate and have a life in the settled community if that is their choice.  If it is not, there should be a proper network of hard shoulder sites and accommodation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Society has a responsibility and the itinerant community has a responsibility. In a united and Christian fashion <Col N="1077" /> we can protect the future health, education, welfare and accommodation of the travelling community.</P>

      <P>In recent weeks we heard remarks to the effect that travellers &ldquo;are not our people&rdquo;.  I am glad that statement was withdrawn and that an apology was subsequently proffered.  I accept those remarks in no way reflected the policy of Fianna Fáil, whose spokesperson on the traveller community, Deputy Flood, has always impressed me and other Members with his constructive and committed approach to the traveller community. Unfortunately, however, the statement reflects social attitudes &mdash; attitudes which are not often articulated, but which have in the past determined the way travellers have been treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the traveller community are our people.  Their history is inextricably interwoven with the history of the settled community.  About 150 years ago there was little difference between the two communities as individuals from all backgrounds roamed the country in search of survival.  Democratic Left is not prepared to tolerate any section of our community being excluded from full citizenship.  The Task Force on the Travelling Community, which was ably chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and, subsequently, by Senator Kelly, made a number of recommendations designed to ensure the traveller community is fully included in Irish society.  Sadly, we are still far from that goal.  Today the traveller community is separated from the settled community not merely by its lifestyle and culture but also by poverty, ill health, high mortality rates, lack of access to the most basic services and discrimination which is as pervasive as it is unacceptable.  The national strategy on <Col N="1078" /> accommodation stems from recommendations made in the task force report.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, dealt with the subject at some length in her contribution yesterday.  The House knows she is deeply committed to implementing the national strategy and I believe we are fortunate to have a Minister with her track record overseeing this project.</P>
    <P>I will deal today with the social attitudes and prejudices which have developed over decades and which govern and distort the relationship between the travelling and settled communities. Ireland, in common with other developed countries inside and outside the European Union, is currently facing increased levels of social disintegration and alienation.  In such a climate of instability, fear and apprehension, there is a temptation to seek scapegoats and many, from journalists to politicans, have succumbed to that in recent months.  This creeping climate of intolerance &mdash; manifested not only in attacks on travellers, but also in attacks on single mothers, non-nationals and others &mdash; must be challenged.</P>
    <P>At the end of January, a well-known commentator wrote that travellers are &ldquo;without the ennobling intellect of man or the steadying instinct of animals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In common with my party colleague, Deputy Lynch, I considered that and other statements in the article fell within the remit of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989.  The article, reminiscent of the demagogic popular journalism common in 1930s Germany, appeared at a time when on the basis of anecdotal evidence alone, travellers were being implicated in a spate of rural crimes.  Given the climate in which the article appeared and the overt and covert prejudices against travellers in many rural communities, the article was at best provocative and at worst downright dangerous.</P>
    <P>Having made a complaint under the Act, I let the matter take its course only to discover a couple of months later that this article and its author had become a <i>cause célébre</i> for those who would <Col N="1079" /> describe themselves as apostles of free speech.</P>

      <P>I refer to a report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash; I do not know the exact date &mdash; under the name of its author, Mary Ellen Synon.</P>
      <P>Freedom brings with it responsibility and my party has consistently championed the right of all sections of society to express their views without let or hindrance. Members of this House may recall that last year I raised a number of concerns regarding the overly restrictive nature of the Censorship of Publications Act.  However, freedom of speech does not include the right to cry &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in a crowded cinema and at a time when travellers are regularly subjected to violent attacks, freedom of speech does not include the right to excite popular and sometimes violent feeling against any section of society.</P>
      <P>The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989 has until recently proven to be something of a legislative paper tiger.  There is a strong case for reviewing it and I understand this may be forced on us by the recent European agreement on combating discrimination and racism.  There is also an urgent need to bring forward the proposed Equal Status Bill without further delay.  It is now nearly three years since it was first promised and the need for such legislation is becoming increasingly apparent.</P>

    <P>I urge the Minister not to be deflected from his purpose by the vociferous retailer and vintner lobbies, or by their supporters in the political establishment. The huge publicity garnered by the vintners lobby on this issue in recent months is rooted in fantasy and scare mongering rather than reality.  There is no reason equal status legislation should prevent proprietors refusing admission to known troublemakers or ejecting them from their premises.  Such action, <Col N="1080" /> however, should be taken with good reason and not simply on the basis of blind prejudice.  The majority of publicans treat their customers equally.  This was borne out by a rough survey carried in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, which found that a group of travellers was served in seven out of ten pubs they visited. In the remaining three pubs, however, they were refused service with no reason.  It is that minority of publicans, shopkeepers and other business people who must be dealt with by the Bill.</P>
    <P>As well as the proposed equal status Bill, I urge the Minister to consider introducing race relations legislation along the lines of that currently operating in the UK.  I have been informed by a Jewish Deputy that he has been receiving outrageous anti-Semitic telephone calls at home &mdash; his wife has had to take the telephone off the hook.  No doubt the calls are being provoked by the current conflict in the Lebanon but those who are making racist remarks to members of a minority faith must be deemed to be outside the law.  If there is insufficient legislation to tackle that at present, we should introduce similar provisions to those in the UK, where there is a multi-cultural society with more experience of the problem.</P>
    <P>Travellers are the most visible minority in this State but they are not the only minority.  Ireland is no longer a homogeneous society, if it ever was. Earlier this year there was a spate of racial attacks on Dublin's north side and I have no doubt there have been similar incidents in Cork and Limerick.  These attacks, against persons of Asian or African extraction, are no more acceptable than the vicious attacks on members of the travelling community I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>All those resident in this State, of whatever background, must be entitled to freedom from harassment and intimidation. They must be entitled to service in a shop or pub, they must know that their homes cannot be attacked with impunity and they must be allowed to <Col N="1081" /> walk the streets free from name calling and worse.  Legislation cannot of itself change social attitudes.  It can, however, protect individuals and groups from some of the worst excesses of bigotry and intolerance.  For this reason the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act should be reviewed, the equal status legislation should be brought forward with all possible speed and the possibility of introducing race relations legislation should be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Eric Byrne for sharing his time with me.  I pay tribute to the Minister for bringing in this report of the task force.  This debate is an opportunity for us to look at how we treat minorities in our community. The report is a very valuable document which could be useful. However, unless it is used to put theory into practice, it will be just another report.  I believe this Minister and the Government will make significant progress in their efforts to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>In my county of Monaghan the situation is not too bad, except for the periods when large numbers of businessmen-type travellers arrive in cavalcades.  In the Clones district, which I represent on the county council, we have a very satisfactory travellers' facility where a number of families are permanently housed who live very amicably within the community.  It is a small site which was reorganised in consultation with the local community.  That is absolutely necessary and has proved very worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a similar facility outside Monaghan town which has a number of residents but it is not always full.  We also have a transit site there which gives rise to very little trouble, except on some weekends when people arrive and the gates are not open and they park in other residents' avenues for the weekend. We are trying to make sure that does not happen because it is important that the local residents who have, in general, facilitated this accommodation are treated in the way they deserve. <Col N="1082" /> Unfortunately, the situation has not been as amicable in Castleblayney.  I hope that council officials and local councillors can deal with that situation in a responsible way soon.  The Minister stated last night that the actions of some travellers are responsible for the hostility they encounter.  We went to fairly significant expense to ensure the site in Castleblayney was a success and as comfortable as possible.  Unfortunately, others parked along the road verge which meant that traffic travelling fromn Castleblayney towards Scots Corner had to travel on the right hand side of the road on a dangerous bend. Eventually, we had no choice but to close down that site.</P>
    <P>We have to have consultation and co-operation on both sides, as the report has shown very clearly.  Sr. Celine has played a major role in that town and has shown what one individual can do to alleviate some of the problems.  With social workers attached to the county council, she got involved with discussions and negotiations and has given all sorts of help to the travelling community, easing some problems which could easily have been much worse.</P>
    <P>I raised earlier the issue of cavalcades of traveller business people, which is what they are.  Most of the local authority's problems are caused when 15, 20 or more caravans and trailers arrive in town parks or along the roads, set up their encampments and offer lorry loads of gates and other products for sale.  I was on the road from Cootehill to Cavan the other evening and I saw a full lorry load of gates being unloaded on the road edge.  When I returned later that night the gates were still there in a very dangerous location which could cause a great deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>Which company supplied those gates? Was it paid VAT and did it put the sale through its books?  Are the business people who sell those gates to farmers and others operating legitimately? Many business people are under pressure to pay tax and rates and it is only right that these people should be treated in the same way.  A traveller, who I <Col N="1083" /> believe was a business person, called to my home and when he failed to sell me half a dozen gates he lowered the price three times.  I took out my cheque book to write him a cheque and asked him for a receipt for the taxman.  He said he could not do that and was astounded I even asked him for a receipt.  The business people who are selling the gates to these people have to think about their main competitors.</P>
    <P>The report mentions the need for support and training so that the travelling community can get employment.  This is vital.  When I was young, which was many years ago, we enjoyed seeing the travellers coming around selling buckets, saucepans, big pots for boiling potatoes and other items which were useful to the farming community.  That option is no longer available to the travelling community.  They used to mend some of the pots on our doorsteps or in our sheds.  Those craft opportunities are not as available to the travelling community as in the past.  It is important to ensure they are given every opportunity to be trained and to utilise their time and energies in a profitable and useful way.</P>
    <P>I join with other speakers in thanking Deputy Flood, and other members of his party, for distancing themselves from the comments made by a southern councillor.  I can understand the frustration of councillors.  However, in a Christian country, as we believe this is, we must show some understanding and ensure those in need are looked after in the same way as everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this very worthy report.  It was published in July 1995 and it seems a pity we are only now debating it at the end of April 1996. Tardy as it has been, I am glad we have this opportunity to debate it.  Well deserved tributes have been paid to my colleague, Deputy Flood, in which I want to join.  Deputy Flood is a stalwart performer who takes his duty seriously. The fact that on five separate occasions <Col N="1084" />&mdash; and we checked the record &mdash; he asked in this House for a debate on the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community tells its own story.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil/Labour Government set up the task force and I commend its first chairpersons, Deputy McManus and Senator Kelly, who replaced Deputy McManus when she became a Minister of State.  It was not an easy task to correlate the views of so many people with different viewpoints in a manageable, understandable, readable way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke was right to praise himself but he was modest in the way he did so.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Bill 1989, which he introduced, perceived to be radical and is still so.  It is a strong bullwark and breast plate for the travelling community and contains protection for members of that community against verbal and physical attacks.  The Cabinet had a full and comprehensive debate on the Bill and the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, was strongly in favour of it.  I say this not to blow our trumpets but lest any side would seek to portray itself as the only party with proper thoughts about the travelling community.  The initiatives taken over the years have been on a cross-party basis.</P>
      <P>The longest section in the report is that dealing with education and training for travellers.  It contains twice as many pages as the next longest section, which deals with accommodation.  It is right that such a large proportion of this good report is based on the need for education and training.  I commend the members of the task force for their dedication and the way they dealt with all aspects of education.  This section deals with pre-school, primary, post primary and third level education, junior and senior training centres, ongoing training, and interlinking with FÁS and the vocational education committees. The proposals are worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was asked what part of the report should first be tackled in a full and comprehensive way, I would suggest that on education.  If its many recommendations were implemented, there would be no <Col N="1085" /> harassment of or outrages committed against travellers because they would be the masters of their own minds and affairs.</P>
    <P>The references show that when I was Minister for Education I commissioned five reports on the need for education and training for traveller children.  I commissioned an internal report on their needs at post primary level and this was not published until after I left office.  I was interested in this issue because certain measures had been taken at primary level &mdash; I am not suggesting we did everything; the report tells us otherwise &mdash; which we felt were beginning to be beneficial.  Traveller children were beginning to find their proper place in primary education.  I welcome the proposals for a review of junior training centres and to change the name of the senior centres.</P>
    <P>Many traveller children went directly from primary school to the training centres and there was good reason for this.  The centres were needed and I commend Sister Collette for her work in them.  However, as second level education became more pervasive, comprehensive and accessible, clearly the best way to proceed in regard to the education of traveller children was for them to be part of mainstream education and not to be segregated.  This is clearly acknowledged in the report.</P>
    <P>Special schools were reviewed in the task force I set up to examine the special education needs.  There is a school in Bray and one or two others for the education of traveller children at primary level.  While they continue to do great work in an educational and social sense, the best way to help the children of any group which is perceived to be disadvantaged is to provide resources to enable them to participate in mainstream education.  That is better than putting resources into special schools.  A circular I sent to the boards of primary schools dealt with enrolment procedures for traveller children.  There is a need for all of us to obliterate the concept of special status from our thinking. <Col N="1086" /> We must seek to integrate traveller children fully into primary and post primary schools and give them access to all types of courses.</P>
    <P>The task force recommends carrying out a census of traveller children, to ascertain the number attending school and the number proceeding to second level and third level.  Non-participation in third level is a feature of disadvantaged groups.  People do not envisage themselves attending third level, not due to lack of money but because of their background, circumstances and environment.  The needs of those not availing of third level education should be considered.</P>
    <P>I commend the recommendations on the curriculum and the need for in-service training for primary and post primary teachers.  I hope it will become the pattern for more schools to have traveller children in their classes.  In-service training for teachers should not take place in static centres but should be provided in-house, so to speak, so that they can understand the needs of these children.</P>
    <P>There is a need for children from all social backgrounds to understand the background from which others come. No person should be exclusive or have the right to say their culture is different and they do not want anybody else's culture.  There should be a cross-fertilisation of ideas and cultures.  We should absorb and be warmed by the backgrounds and cultures of others.  We always view the question of dealing with disadvantaged groups from our own perspective, of whether we will be discommoded, whether our locality will be put upon and our children share classes with children from disadvantaged backgrounds? That is putting the might over the weak when clearly it should be an inclusive process.  We talk endlessly about the word &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; which is not a mysterious term.  It simply means that everybody is entitled to be confident about themselves and where they come from.  As regards education, that means being confident like everybody else, they are receiving an education which <Col N="1087" /> seeks to integrate various cultures, grades and abilities within the classroom.</P>
    <P>The report strongly recommends that travelling children should not be kept on in primary classes after the age of 12 or 13, which is more or less the normal primary school leaving age.  I would recommend that, too, because it is in pursuit of the very necessary and worthy aim that such children should move on to second level as most children do at that stage.  Why should certain groups of children be left out?  To leave them in primary school until they are 14 or 15 is to mark them out as being different. Happily that situation is beginning to change.</P>
    <P>Children of travelling people encounter many difficulties, more pointedly at second level.  There is the expense of buying a huge range of books which parents of all children at second level must bear.  In addition, uniforms are mandatory in many schools although the Minister for Education delivered a circular on that issue last year.  Nevertheless school management boards are quite emphatic about what they require from children in their schools.</P>
    <P>I remember starting the home-school liaison teacher scheme which was increased during the past three years that I was Minister for Education.  I understand that the present Minister has kept it going.  Under the scheme teachers were appointed to schools but instead of teaching in the school they went out into the community to talk to parents about what school is like and how their children would benefit from it.  There is a visiting teacher facility for travelling children but the number involved is insufficient.  The home-school liaison teacher facility should be expanded and developed for the parents of travelling children.  The environment of regular school hours is alien to such children and their parents.  The help of parents of travelling children is not sought on boards of management, when events are being organised within a school, or at parent-teacher meetings.  In <Col N="1088" /> any case, such activities would be like another world for them.</P>
    <P>When I was a second level teacher in Athlone, I was involved with a committee endeavouring to bring more childeren into second level education. Although life has taught me a lot, at the time I could not understand the tenet of parent-teacher meetings.  We must make a huge effort to see that that procedure becomes the norm.  When power is given to people they feel they are part of the process and are the better for it.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the officials from the Department of Education who were on this task force, including Mr. Liam Hughes who was later replaced.  I know from the recommendations that they made a great contribution.  A stalwart of the system was Sister Colette Dyer who was involved before anyone else.  We worked closely together in the Department of Education.  Sister Dyer and her companion did huge work in the field of education so it is only proper to give credit to somebody like her who in her own way was a pioneer.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have been able to speak on this matter, and to commend the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in this debate.  Congratulations are due to all those involved in the preparation of the report.  They include the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who commissioned the report, the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and Senator Kelly who chaired the task force during its final months.  One of our colleagues from Meath County Council, Councillor Cribben, was also on the task force and had major input into the report, he being familiar with the difficulties we have encountered in Meath with regard to the issue of travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an unprecedented era of economic growth and cultural renewal, when Ireland's reputation abroad has grown in stature, the plight of the travelling community is arguably one of the few blights on our reputation.  This report <Col N="1089" /> and the Government's response represent an opportunity to deal with this long standing difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's comprehensive approach to the report, be it in the field of accommodation, health or education.  It is unprecedented in our history.  Difficulties between the travelling community and the settled community are often based on misunderstanding and ignorance.  However, some problems do exist because of bad faith on the part of one side or the other. Often the settled community jumps to premature conclusions about the travelling community and tar them all with the one brush as a result of isolated incidents. Allegations about traveller involvement in some of the recent horrific crimes in the west is a classic case in point.  In the settled community, there is a presumption of innocence until guilt is determined.  For travellers the presumption is sometimes the exact opposite.  Problems exist on the other side of the coin as well.  Traveller spokespersons often speak of the need for the settled community to understand their distinctive culture.  It is a point well made.  An understanding of that culture and history as elucidated by Deputy Flood yesterday evening, were it known among the wider public, would be welcome. However, the settled community also has its culture and rights.  These include their right to a clean local environment and to their open spaces.  As the report acknowledges, these rights are often ignored by elements within the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I have always been concerned about the all embracing use of the term &ldquo;culture&rdquo;. Be it in travelling community, the settled community or at national level, the fact is that some behaviour has a historical precedent, perhaps going back generations.  For example, the republican culture of armed struggle is no longer acceptable to the vast majority of nationalists.  It is a position I support for, surely, at the end of the twentieth century we have gone beyond that.</P>
    <P>It is no longer acceptable that a small minority of travellers should send their <Col N="1090" /> children out to beg on the side of the street, regardless of the danger that imposes.  Similarly, the treatment of women in traditional traveller communities is no more acceptable than was the treatment of women in the country as a whole until a few decades ago. These practices are not worthy of the term &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.  The success or otherwise of the Government's plans arising from this report will depend on people's ability to compromise on competing aspirations and rights.  For travellers it will require some compromise on their right to travel.  I say this for a number of reasons and with particular examples in mind.</P>
    <P>Neither do I propose that any law be introduced to this effect.  However, I sometimes wonder how women and children in traveller families are affected by the existing situation.  In the settled community for example we are all aware that the greater the security and continuity available to a child in school, the better that child performs, the easier it is to monitor the child's health and respond to difficulties.  Similarly, women travellers have a right to the best possible standards of health care.  I am sceptical if this can be delivered while they move from place to place.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also have a duty to respond to what is a countrywide issue. As the law stands, any local authority has a duty to provide sites for the number of travellers within its area.  Certain county councils who do not respond batten on other authorities who take their responsibilities more seriously.  Naturally, travellers will be attracted to areas where superior facilities are provided. Consequently, the less any local authority does to cater for travellers, the fewer travellers there are to cater for. Meath County Council, has provided housing accommodation for travellers, which stands alongside the best in the country, and a halting site in Navan. Another halting site is under construction and a further one is planned for Trim. However, events in Navan left a <Col N="1091" /> very sour taste with the settled community. For nearly two years travellers continued to park illegally outside a community college and serious allegations of abuse of people and property were levelled against them.  The courts were not helpful either.  It appears that travellers can move from town to town and from one local authority area to another, with each authority obliged to provide halting facilities.  This is a impossibility for any authority and makes the job of getting co-operation from the settled community extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>The kind of activity that took place in the seaside resort of Laytown last summer also creates difficulties for any local authority.  In that instance, hundreds of travellers moved in on community facilities &mdash; tennis courts and playing pitches &mdash; and took over the area for weeks. This must be stopped.  The courts can no longer take the soft line they have taken in the past because those attempting to provide facilities are being penalised by the courts and other authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Minister for the Environment to establish an interdepartmental working group to monitor the implementation of the report.  Its work will be critical in ensuring the success of the accommodation strategy outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy McManus.  The groups should take a hard line with any council or county manager who shows any sign of wavering.  It has been one of the success of this Government and its predecessor that, not only have we announced schemes in all policy areas, but our track record in following up on them to ensure implementation has improved. Perhaps the best example of this has been the manner in which the Department of Health has been able to ensure that additional resources to alleviate hospital waiting lists has translated into smaller lists.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy is ambitious.  The provision of over 3,000 extra accommodation units for travellers by the end of the century is not a <Col N="1092" /> piece meal measure.  If and when it is delivered upon, it will mark a significant step in our path to becoming a modern and pluralist society.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the plans in the areas of education and health.  As things stand the high mortality rates of travellers and their lower levels of education are a scandal.  However, travellers, and the so called heads of their households, also have their role to play here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's determination to press ahead with employment equality and equal status legislation.  As the Minister acknowledged yesterday, reservations have been expressed about this legislation.  However, I call on those concerned about these proposals to heed the words of the Minister who said:</P>
    <P>The Bill will only apply to discrimination on clearly specified grounds, including membership of the travelling community.  Refusal of service for another and genuine reason, such as misbehaviour will be unaffected.</P>
    <P>This responds effectively to any reservations I have heard about the legislation. I compliment all those involved in preparing the report and welcome the high quality contributions to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to begin on a sour note.  However, Deputy Eric Byrne lectured us earlier on the merits of the approach by Democratic Left to minorities, etc.  The Deputy should talk seriously with some of the members of his party at local level who do not appear to have got his message.  They have made bad situations in my own constituency and the area of County Meath to which Deputy Brian Fitzgerald referred even worse by encouraging activities that should not be encouraged. I will not say any more because I believe matters are now resolved.  However, we do not need lectures from Democratic Left on how to behave at local authority level on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate all who have contributed to this report.  I am aware of the amount of work, the commitment and <Col N="1093" /> dedication that went into it.  I also congratulate the Minister in bringing it forward and thank the Government for allocating time for an issue as important as this which is usually left on the back burner.</P>
    <P>It is especially appropriate that, almost to the day of the anniversary of the reading of the 1916 Proclamation, we should debate a topic such as this.  In the proclamation our founding fathers set out their aspiration for society.  It was to be an all inclusive society, with the intention that everybody would be treated equally.  The proclamation states:</P>
    <P>The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally,...</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we should, today of all days, ask ourselves if this guarantee holds today and if we have lived up to the ideals of our founding fathers.  If we were honest we would have to say it does not.  We have not lived up to those ideals.  This report and the prospect of its being fully implemented mean that we will have gone a long way towards meeting the guarantee our founding fathers gave 80 years ago to treat all of the children of our nation equally.</P>
    <P>As a public representative, I believe it is my duty and that of every other public representative to be vigilant and represent those who voted for me, those who did not and those who are unable to vote.  The benchmark of any progressive society has to be the republican principles on which our nation was founded and which are contained in our Constitution whereby everybody in this nation should be treated equally.  I believe in that, as we all should.  This report and the actions we take as a result of it will show how committed we are to those tenets of republicanism.</P>
    <P>Does the guarantee our founding fathers gave in 1916 hold today?  In <Col N="1094" /> recent times attacks on travellers, particularly those in Bray, Bantry and New Ross, have highlighted the tense atmosphere that can exist between the two communities that are defined primarily by whether their lifestyle is nomadic or otherwise, namely the travellers and the settled community.</P>
    <P>The statistics relating to the travelling community are bleak but bear repeating in this House if only to remind ourselves of how far we have to go.  The travelling community accounts for 0.5 per cent of the population.  There are over 1,000 households on the roadside and 237 on temporary sites.  Infant and adult mortality rates are twice those of the settled community.  There has been a 25 per cent increase in traveller families during the last ten years.  No person with any Christianity could stand up in this House and say anything other than this report is overdue and should be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>The task force was established in July 1993 and that welcome initiative culminated in this report.  The five sub-committees on accommodation, education and training, health, traveller economy and discrimination address all the crucial problems and highlight most clearly the disparity at every level between the two communities.  The main thrust of the report is that the lifestyle of the traveller is getting steadily worse, despite all the progress we have allegedly made over the last number of years.  That problem is compounded by the disappearance of the traditional economic activities of travellers, as well as the low rate of participation by travellers in the mainstream labour force and their high reliance on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The task force results, reflecting submissions to it, and the all-encompassing recommendations on the traveller issues set out for us an agenda that must be confronted urgently.  The Government should not procrastinate.  The report should be implemented and the plight of the traveller community, which is getting steadily worse, should be faced.  I <Col N="1095" /> acknowledge the progress that has been made since the report was published.</P>
    <P>I have one regret in relation to the Government's reaction to the report in that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is not in complete and overall charge of implementing and co-ordinating all sections of the report with a budget to do so.  I know of his sincerity and commitment to this and other areas of his brief.  I have no doubt that had he been given full charge of this programme it would be implemented.  I pay that tribute to him because I know of his dedication.  The implementation is not being done in that manner.  I can only ask the Minister to ensure, and I know he will, that it does not fall between two stools and that there is no lessening of the effort because it is spread over a number of Departments. That is a crucial issue which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the accommodation of as many members of the travelling community as possible should be given priority by this Government.  The Minister has stated, and the Government has repeated on a number of occasions, that it has agreed to provide over 3,000 units of additional accommodation by the year 2000.  That is a very ambitious and expensive programme but it is the least we can do.  The task force recommendations further outline the necessity for supporting administrative and legislative changes to meet the needs of the existing and projected population of the traveller community.  This is the right approach.</P>
    <P>We cannot do what we did before which was to provide housing accommodation, whether particular housing accommodation for travellers or a house in the middle of an estate, and just leave people to their own devices.  That policy was pursued by local authorities in good faith even in the recent past.  It was not good policy because travellers were housed in settled areas.  They were not suited and prepared properly for the settled life and their neighbours were not prepared for them.  The result was a <Col N="1096" /> disaster.  As Deputy Fitzgerald will know, in many of the early settlements in County Meath where travellers were put into houses, they left after a number of years because of these problems.  The approach detailed in the report is correct. We should provide the accommodation but we must also provide the back up and support for the families to ensure they can fit into their environment and that the environment can adapt to them.  We did not place enough emphasis on that in the past.</P>
    <P>The other essential areas of health and education are linked to the accommodation question.  One will have a better chance of success in those areas, some of which were outlined by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, if people are in reasonable accommodation, whether fixed, transient or whatever.  Accommodation is a basic need that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>One of the causes of the major problems of dissent, hostility and discrimination within and between the communities is the inferior living conditions of travellers.  Travellers often find themselves criticised and abused because of the unsanitary and unhygienic conditions in which they are forced to live. This leads to problems with the settled community.  Those conditions have to be challenged by both communities.  The report states that the best and most effective way of doing this is by helping travellers to help themselves.  The irony is that the settled community must also challenge its stereotypical attitudes which often go a long way to preventing good neighbourliness between travellers and the settled community.  As with any divided society, minimal contact between the communities contributes more to the prejudice and ignorance which exists on both sides, but probably more on the settled side.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission on itinerancy, the report of the travelling people review body and this task force report recommended the need to urgently address accommodation requirements.  I hope they will be urgently addressed and that they will <Col N="1097" /> not be swept aside as they were in previous reports.  All the reports emphasise the importance of trying to solve the accommodation problem.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must be flexible in their approach to the provision of accommodation.  Attitudes among members and officials must change because in many cases they are stereotyped. In addition to local authorities protecting the needs of travellers, there should also be a coherent national strategy which reflects an organised approach and prevents conflicting council policies in different areas.  Deputy Brian Fitzgerald referred to this.  There is no point in Meath County Council, for example, being a good local authority and trying to meet the needs of travellers, if travellers from other counties, who do not have accommodation, decide to move there because it is the only place where something will be done for them.  This problem must be tackled at national level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Fitzgerald also mentioned the travellers who leave houses every year at the same time and invade other communities and abuse people and facilities.  That must be addressed or it will cause huge problems between the two communities.  It is in the interests of the travellers as well as the settled community to address this issue.</P>
    <P>In the past few days there have been calls on the Minister for the Environment to investigate organised and bully-boy tactics against travellers.  I reiterate that call because whoever authorised such illegal activities should be brought to justice.  It reflects a view in society that we should not tolerate and which must be confronted.</P>
    <P>We should respect the travelling culture while encouraging them in areas such as mainstream employment.  Providing quality education for children and addressing women's welfare problems will go some way towards addressing this issue.  It is a testament to that approach and to the adage that &ldquo;nothing succeeds like success&rdquo; that Mr. Frank <Col N="1098" /> Barrett, a 19 year old Galwegian traveller, is included in the Irish Olympic boxing team.  His success is Ireland's success. This is due not only to his own efforts and discipline, but also to the efforts of two local gardaí, a local radio station and a bank who supported him. Such action by both communities who worked together can yield the type of society of which we can be proud and for which the signatories of the Proclamation would have hoped.  We must emphasise that travellers are people, not problems.  If we address them as people, we will go a long way towards removing many prejudices.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dempsey on a well constructed speech which began and ended with a reference to the Republic.  I respect that approach to this issue.  If the Republic is not a motivating factor, I hope our Christian values are when responding to the needs outlined in this report.</P>
      <P>The last speaker referred to Bantry which hit the headlines recently in relation to travellers in the playground there.  When the issue arose I tried to get through to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; because I holiday in that part of the country and Bantry is the major town near where we stay.  Each year we went to the play area which gradually became more derelict.  Approximately three or four years ago in the play area there were a couple of travellers' caravans beside the tennis courts.  My eldest children started to play tennis while the younger ones shared tennis balls with the travellers' children.  The equipment in the playground was appalling in that swings were rusted and the sandpit had not been cleaned for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came back to Dublin I wrote to the local Deputy and asked him to do something about the playground.  It never occurred to me to say anything about the travellers.  I received an extraordinary letter which stated that they did not plan to do anything about the playground until the travellers had been removed.  It was not a problem for me that travellers' caravans were there, but <Col N="1099" /> that the play equipment was unsafe for children and that the playground was unsightly.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the reason my reaction was not shared by those locally is that there is a large travelling cohort in my constituency. We have two major housing sites and two official halting sites.  The major halting site for Castleknock is also in Finglas and there are one or two large unofficial sites.  I am not saying we do not have problems, but we have the opportunity to mix regularly with travellers. Many mature relationships have developed in the community, including one with myself as a public representative. The travellers are a pleasure to do business with because they are uniquely patient when we are trying to find the resources to give them.  They have added a lot to the community in Finglas and they contribute in many ways, such as recycling material from the city dump.</P>
    <P>We should congratulate everyone involved in the task force report which is a comprehensive and fundamental document.  Some time has passed since the commitment was given to achieve full housing of travellers by the year 2000.  I do not know what progress has been made in the two years since that objective was established but I hope what happens in the remaining three years to the turn of the century will be monitored carefully.  We must ensure that objective is achieved because, as the previous speaker said, accommodation is a central issue and the opportunity to reduce hostilities flows from it.</P>
    <P>I welcome that the report has the reduction of conflict as a priority item. From my experience, contact and communication are key elements.  If these exist, one begins to realise that travellers are as varied in their talents and personalities as their neighbours in the settled community.  There are bad eggs, as in the rest of society, but many travellers have fine qualities.  Communication and contact is important.</P>
    <P>As the report acknowledges, the community development programmes which <Col N="1100" /> have been established in recent years are extremely important in terms of the confidence of the travelling community and the emergence of individuals who have become leaders and public spokespersons. As a result of major programmes in recent years, people have been in a position to put their case clearly, articulately and attractively. This surprised many in the settled community.</P>
    <P>The Pavee Point development is most important and a pleasure to visit.  It is also a pleasure to visit the homes of travellers, many of whom keep their homes like new pins.  They would be as well represented as good housekeepers in the settled community.  They maintain many of the old features, such as metal and ceramics in the window and net curtains. There are also attempts to develop gardens, even in the most appalling circumstances, on the sides of the roads if they manage to stay long enough for a planting season.  Such efforts are also visible outside large scrap-yards.  We share many of their motivations to make a better world and, as the previous speaker pointed out, much more progress could be made if we tapped into that on the basis of a mutual agenda rather than along the traditional lines of hostility.</P>
    <P>I visited Israel for a housing and planning conference &mdash; Dublin Corporation is receiving bad publicity at present but I have not been on any of the major trips recently &mdash; and one of the topics there was their problems with the Bedouin community.  Many people say the Bedouin community is different from the travelling community because they are much more exotic; the community is historic and they ride around the desert on camels.  However, the same problems arise with the Bedouin community in terms of urban settlements, how they integrate and their place in a modern world, how they can be educated and what can be done to stop them dying young.</P>
    <P>The problems are similar but an interesting proposal was made at the conference which indicates a deeper <Col N="1101" /> respect for their culture than the travelling community here.  One of our major visits was to a Bedouin area.  They were developing a cultural centre and we were entertained under tents in the Bedouin style.  I mentioned this to colleagues in the House and they found it outrageously funny.  However, it is not funny and perhaps we could consider such a move in Ireland.  Pavee Point is a first stage in that regard.  Although it is based in a major urban building, elements of the culture are presented there.  Perhaps recognition of the culture could take this form in the future.</P>
    <P>We should remember that people once thought bottled water would not sell.  Perhaps we could make that jump regarding travellers at some point in the future and perhaps a traveller group could consider such a project.  Many aspects of their culture are interesting, as is much of our lost way of life.  For example, many aspects of our culture in the 1950s is fascinating but it is disappearing quickly.  If we do not attempt to capture them now, many old traditions in the travelling community, such as craftwork, will be gone.</P>
    <P>Discrimination is a critical issue.  The Minister must answer questions about the ongoing delay in introducing the equal status legislation.  Deputy Smith mentioned encouraging people to be brave in facing down the inevitable public opposition to local halting sites.  We all have experience of this issue and some responded differently from others. However, Deputies will show their mettle by supporting the Minister's efforts on this issue.  Reasonable responses from those in business should be taken into account but we should not compromise on the fundamental issue that they may not discriminate against travellers.  This is the challenge facing all sides of the House.  It is also a way in which those who warmly support this document can help to change the position of travellers.</P>
    <P>Some Members may have read an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> yesterday written by a journalist who visited a number of pubs with three travellers, <Col N="1102" /> one of whom is well known to me; a number of them may be from my constituency. The group sought entry to ten pubs in the city, seven pubs accepted them and three rejected them.  The logic for rejecting or accepting them was incoherent and it indicates that it is possible to discriminate against travellers in the same way as any other group. It is important that the House shows it is serious about the issues raised in the report.  It identifies that discrimination is a real problem for travellers on many fronts.  Legislation is required, but also the mechanisms to support it.  I urge all those who contributed to the debate to support it and ensure it is not watered down to the extent that it does not achieve its objective.  This will test the sincerity of many of the contributions to the debate.</P>
    <P>I was aware of the situation regarding the health of travellers but it was shocking to read it as presented in the report's summary.  The difficulty for travellers of being accepted on medical card lists is sad.  The summary also mentions their level of access to public health nurse intervention.  Many of these aspects are fundamentally related to the lack of sympathy in the community.  The low rate of immunisation is most worrying when one considers that over 90 per cent is the desired objective.  They are achieving a rate of approximately 50 per cent and this is very much out of kilter with the rest of the community.  They also have limited access to out-patient and in-patient services.  I shared a maternity ward with a traveller woman and I saw the great difficulty she faced in accessing services in the same way. Some of it is related to cultural difficulties but traveller women are not integrated and much work needs to be done in that area.</P>
    <P>Those of us on local authorities are familiar with the issue of accommodation and I am glad that Dublin Corporation has made significant progress in this area.  However, we have the advantage that the area is largely developed and there are not many open sites that travellers can enter.  We have <Col N="1103" /> problems but, by and large, we are moving to deal with them.  Despite the fund which is available for improving and providing traveller accommodation, there are extraordinary delays in the Department of the Environment and the corporation.  The priority given to travellers seems to be a great deal lower than conventional housing programmes which, put on the list 12 months after improvements to a travellers' site were mooted, have been completed 18 months to two years before the work on the travellers' site got under way.  I refer to the Ballymun site in particular and I could mention at least six housing areas in the city.</P>
    <P>There is a real problem in the Department of the Environment.  The structures and the resources exist but adequate priority is not given to travellers. One would expect an enthusiastic welcome for projects which have local agreement, given that this is so difficult to achieve.  If there is local authority support for a development, the Department's attitude should be to move ahead quickly, put the development in place and work on the more difficult projects.  However, the opposite is the case.  We had an extraordinary experience in my area when a small housing site was agreed to.  It caused great difficulties and political stress for a number of us who supported it and it had a political fallout for some.  The end result was that the Department of the Environment did not go ahead with it because a compromise was reached to reduce the number of units and it was decided that the cost per housing unit did not warrant proceeding with the plan.  We should not face such experiences when agreement is reached as regards traveller accommodation.  The Minister should ask that the Department of the Environment be shaken up a little.</P>
    <P>As others have said, accommodation is critical because from it flows access to education and health.  In my area we have had traveller education schemes and classes and they have been integrated into one of the local schools.  I <Col N="1104" /> suppose we made mistakes in terms of lack of integration.  We have seen the value and problems of training centres. Adult education is extremely valuable. Many women, not only in the travelling community but in deprived areas, become pregnant early in their lives. The travelling community shares a great deal with the deprived areas in the city where many young women are lone parents, but at least those in the travelling community are in a family situation. Perhaps the reason travellers are more accepted in these areas is that people see they share similar problems which removes prejudices that may exist among the more privileged who have not had similar experiences.</P>
    <P>An issue which has been thoroughly analysed covers the economic activities of travellers and the problems which they cause.  We argue about this regularly in Dublin Corporation.  While we provide housing, we will not provide space for economic activity.  Communities face problems in relation to the unsightliness of scrap-yards.  I would perfer to maintain economic activity through adequate planning and the provision of suitably screened areas adjacent to sites.  If sites were adequately screened, they would be more acceptable to the community.</P>
    <P>Despite the serious analysis of needs, I will conclude by being a little upbeat. I know a number of people from the travelling community.  Many people, through lack of knowledge, perceive them as a deprived group.  From what I know of the travelling community, it is an exciting and vibrant group.  They provided a major float in the Old Finglas festival which was horse drawn and presented many of the fine crafts which they are still capable of producing, including copper work.  There are some remarkable families, including the Collins and the Maughan families, in Finglas and in Ballymun.  They are well liked in the community and they provide many services.  Travellers are loyal voters.  At the last election a traveller arrived at my headquarters in a Hiace van looking for posters and leaflets.  The <Col N="1105" /> feeling that it is all one way cannot be substantiated.  It was something which gave me and them great pleasure.</P>
    <P>I finish by telling a story which indicates that travellers are on the move. Many Members will remember the media attack on travellers as a result of remarks made by the senior law officer investigating a number of crimes in the west.  A press conference was held at which all political parties and interest groups were represented to support travellers and to say that this did not represent an honest view and that it was dangerously close to incitement to hatred.  Suddenly, the inevitable mobile telephone rang.  It belonged to someone who was distinctly a traveller with a ponytail and an earring and who had to leave with his mobile telephone in his pocket.  Travellers are on the move and they are good partners.  We must accept needs must be met in relation to housing, health, education and a wide range of issues.  We must meet the immediate challenge of the equal status Bill and work in partnership with the travelling community to meet the other needs identified in this excellent report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to comment on the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community. I congratulate everybody associated with it and our spokesperson, Deputy Flood, who gave us a good run down on travelling people, where they came from and the progress made over the years.  There is consensus that the travelling community deserves attention as regards integration into the mainstream of society.  How this should be done is another question.  The task force has its views and, by and large, they are acceptable.  However, in many cases the settled community has divergent views on a number of issues, especially in relation to accommodation.  Their views are not being sufficiently listened to by Government, county councils, urban councils and other people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of housing, whether in single houses, group housing, halting sites, transient sites or emergency sites, <Col N="1106" /> is emotive and consultation with all concerned is essential.  The idea that one can force halting sites on local communities without consultation is unfortunate and at best divisive.  It is not sufficient to give powers to county managers for compulsory purchase orders to acquire sites.  Although a site is acquired, one may divide a community and lose the goodwill which exists towards travellers.  We now have settled and indigenous travellers to an area or a county.  We have transient travellers and traders trading in scrap or antiques.  Moneylenders and caravan traders are an unwelcome subgroup which has developed within the travelling community.  They are experts in the management of money and moneylending and they do no service to the indigenous population or to other travelling people who require caravans and on whom they prey.  It is an unwelcome development.</P>
    <P>The subgroups within the travelling community may need to be dealt with in various ways and flexibility is essentially. Philosophy is all right but it will not solve problems in relation to the travelling people.  It is no good producing reports if we do not act on them in a sensible way.  We must take into consideration the views of the settled community which is in the majority.  By and large, the settled community is fair-minded if approached openly and given details.  It appears housing is the best long-term proposal as regards addressing the problems of the travellers. Accommodation will make it easier for other processes to unfold in areas such as education, health, the environment, occupational problems, social welfare, discrimination and integration.  On the issue of accomodation, caravans and halting sites are not the best option. Caravans <i>per se</i> are not suitable because they are fire hazards.  There is also an overcrowding problem as traveller families tend to be large.  We must consider this issue and not rush into adopting a simple solution which will not solve the long-term problems of traveller people.</P>
    <P>If we provide good housing, we will <Col N="1107" /> contribute to improved health among travellers and the housing authorities may be able to register their numbers in any given area.  It would then be easier to keep records and provide immunisation and parenting and home economics skills.  When dealing with disadvantaged groups, it is essential that they be made aware of the proper methods for preparing food and know which foods are good and which are essential. Traveller people have a tendency to eat convenience foods.  That reflects badly on the way in which we deal with travellers and their knowledge of diet, etc.</P>
    <P>Maternity care has improved in recent years.  Traveller mothers now visit maternity clinics and take iron supplements, folic acid etc.  They are not afraid to come to doctors' clinics, which is a welcome feature.  In the long-term, if this process continues, statistics for maternal and infant mortality among traveller people will fall into line with those for the settled community.</P>
    <P>Speakers referred to the life expectancy of travellers.  In this respect we must consider smoking, diet, and their <i>modus vivindi.</i> Do traveller people take sufficient care of their health?  It is a two way process.  There is an onus on the medical profession and on the traveller community regarding the way in which they live and behave.  General practitioners have been accused of not providing facilities and treatment for travellers. Health boards must improve their services to travellers.  Sometimes a traveller comes to a general practitioner's surgery, and the general practitioner may not be recompensed for the service provided, because the health board will state that it has no record of the person in question being registered in its locality.  Travellers must be provided with a different type of medical card which can be used in any health board area.  Another issue relating to travellers is intermarriage which is causing many problems, including genetic defects. They should be informed of the implications of marrying a close relative.  The <Col N="1108" /> incidence of genetic defect among the group is well documented.</P>
    <P>I compliment the traveller community for the way in which it deals with children with mental handicap.  Such children are well cared for and are not placed in residential care.  Traveller people take good care of their own if given any help in doing so.  Members of the traveller community also have a tendency to marry early.  This can pose problems in later life.  It is a vital ingredient in the process of the integration of travellers.  The place to begin that process is at pre-school and primary level.  Moneys must be made available to help traveller people in this regard. The parents of traveller children may not have much education and require extra assistance to set them on the right path.  As Deputy O'Rourke stated, everybody should be well versed in the three &ldquo;Rs&rdquo; -reading, writing and mathematics. We can build on this and encourage children especially those who are not interested in academic subjects to pursue an education in the vocational subjects such as woodwork or metalwork, which are traditionally associated with the traveller community.  The question of education involves flexibility and we must try to give these children a chance.</P>
    <P>Education is the one area where easy integration can be achieved at an early level.  I compliment the religious communities for their tremendous work in this area.  They were involved in this type of work long before others began to highlight it and they have done their part with regard to integration of education at pre-school and primary level. Great emphasis must be placed on primary education but travellers must also be encouraged to become involved in second level education &mdash; vocational or otherwise.  Academic excellence cannot be equated with intelligence.  Quite a number of travellers are very intelligent and work intelligently in vocational subjects such as woodwork, metalwork, etc., which have been a tradition of their community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> Settled people cannot accept destruction of their environment through illegal parking and the destruction of flowers, shrubs, etc.  The problem in regards to horses has been raised in this House on a number of occasions.  I understand legislation will be introduced to deal with that whole area.</P>
    <P>Illegal parking is a problem with regard to the development of tourism. The traveller community must act responsibility in this regard and must be flexible in its relations with settled people who also have rights.  Unfortunately the Garda do not have the power to inform the traveller community that parking is completely forbidden in certain areas.  Parking is permissable on national primary highways but there are problems removing travellers from other areas.  The hands of the Garda are tied in this regard.  The importance of introducing laws which take account of the problems experienced by both travellers and the settled communities must be appreciated.</P>
    <P>Social welfare benefits are not the answer to travellers' problems.  Unfortunately, when travellers settled in houses we gave them social welfare but nothing else.  We did not provide education or training and we are now paying for that.  We did not treat them the same as settled people.  We did not look after their education.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>(1) condemns the lack of respect shown for the Dáil by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications when he misled the House in relation to the plans for the Dublin Light Rail system by withholding <Col N="1110" /> information on an EU investigation in both debates and in responses to Parliamentary Questions on 14 December 1995 and on the following dates in 1996, amongst others: 31 January, 5 March, 6 March, 26 March and 28 March;</P>
    <P>(2) calls on Minister Lowry to explain why he proceeded to announce the Light Rail lines for Dundrum and Tallaght on 12 December 1995 given that:</P>
    <P>(a) on 29 November 1995, according to the EU Regional Affairs Spokesperson, his Department had agreed to a postponement pending the further investigation which represented a full study of the entire Light Rail Plan; and</P>
    <P>(b) a serious question mark was hanging over the lines, the phasing and the £114 million in EU funding;</P>
    <P>(3)  calls on the Minister, in the interests of openness and accountability, to lay before the Dáil all correspondence between him and the European Commission in relation to the Dublin Light Rail system; and</P>
    <P>(4) condemns the Government for overseeing a serious deterioration in relations between Ireland and the European Commission with this controversy involving Minister Lowry following on other serious ones involving Ministers Howlin and Yates.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>(1) condemns the attempts by Fianna Fáil to undermine light rail for Dublin and to damage the good relationship which exists between the Government and the European Commission, particularly in circumstances <Col N="1111" /> where Fianna Fáil had prior knowledge of the regulations governing the proposed socio-economic evaluation of the light rail project which were negotiated while they were in Government;</P>
    <P>(2) supports the actions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in pursuit of the firm objective of having light rail in operation in Dublin during the year 2000;</P>
    <P>(3) welcomes the commitment in the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999, to provide substantial European Union funding for light rail and in particular the tangible demonstration of that commitment in the form of the £3 million already paid to CIE for preparatory work on the project;</P>
    <P>(4) supports the Government commitment to construct the core light rail network to Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative;</P>
    <P>(5) notes that the study requested by the European Commission involves a comparative evaluation of the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum lines, not a fundamental reevaluation of light rail;</P>
    <P>(6) confirms the assurances repeatedly given by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications that no final decision will be taken on the routes until the public consultation programme launched last December by the Minister has been completed, a statutory public inquiry has been held and the EU approval procedures have been finalised.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin traffic is chaotic and has been for many years.  We have an over reliance on the private motor car and an increase in car ownership and there are no designated routes through Dublin for heavy commercial vehicles.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transport Initiative was the first real attempt to produce a comprehensive blueprint to deal with this ever worsening problem.  The DTI involved widespread public consultation on a scale never seen before and many members of the public got involved in that process.  The initiative recommended, among other things, a port access route and three rail transit lines going to Dundrum, Tallaght and Ballymun.</P>
      <P>I understood the details announced by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on 12 December last on the routes for the Dublin light rail plan to be a <i>fait accompli.</i> They proposed the designation of Tallaght and Dundrum lines as the priority involving an expenditure of £114 million, with the deferral of the Ballymun line to a later date at best, or indeed its cancellation.  I thought at the time that that was the end of the matter.  Ballymun had a good case but it lost out and at the time I accepted that, albeit regretfully.  I was astonished to learn that this was not the case, that the EU had called for an investigation and had sought comparative socio-economic studies of the various route options.  This information was withheld from the Dáil; these facts were concealed.  I regret that all of us were misled on this matter.  The Ballymun case has merit and it should have been heard.  It is a deprived area of Dublin's northside and job creation there is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of the north side of Dublin hold the view that they always lose out and this would seem to be the case <Col N="1113" /> in this instance.  I am sure Deputy Ryan would agree with me on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a widespread public perception on the northside of Dublin that we lose out time and again when it covers to providing amenities and facilities and this would seem to have happened in this case.  While not to discuss the technical merits of the three routes &mdash; that is for other people to consider and decide &mdash; I welcome the investigation requested by the European Commission in the interests of fair play and equity.</P>
      <P>Our dealings with the European Commission generally are under the spotlight once again.  The European Commission and its Commissioners are not to be messed with or taken for granted; they are involved in serious business.  Once again, Government Ministers have let us down in this regard.  I ask Ministers to demonstrate in future that we have a competent system of Government and administration in this country and that we are capable of adhering to high standards, rules and procedures.  We need to demonstrate that our Ministers are not fly-by-nights or three-card-trick men, that we are capable of adhering to democratic Government, that we can function as a modern State with a modern system of Government and have modern proceedures in place.  We need to demonstrate that there is openness, transparency and accountability.  It is important to bring this to the fore in our future dealings with the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the DTI is the Dublin port access route.  The Government gave the go-ahead for the Dublin port tunnel.  It is important that the port of Dublin be allowed to function, it is the commercial backbone of the city and its hinterland and it is important that manufacturing business have proper access to it.  I am in favour of the <Col N="1114" /> Dublin port tunnel in principle but the local residents, who will be directly affected by it, must be permitted to have an input into the debate on the proposed route and the many other associated issues.  The public consultation process has been totally inadequate.  Many of the residents of Dublin North Central have been badly treated and it is very important that their legitimate concerns about this tunnel be addressed quickly for the benefit of all the citizens of this county.</P>

      <P>Many Members wish to speak on this motion.  As a Dublin TD, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is very clear that the Dublin light rail system is a critical initiative and it is essential that we move ahead with all speed to implement this most worth-while project. My constituents are extremely interested in it, are very positive about it and are keen to see the project proceed. I accept Deputy Brennan had to <Col N="1115" /> make his point as an Opposition spokesperson on transport but it is most unfortunate that he should do so at the cost of possibly undermining the project.</P>
      <P>Members of Fianna Fáil must make up their minds whether they are in favour of the light rail system because, at present, they are giving an ambivalent message, which is unhelpful.  What is needed for the completion of the project is an all-party approach and a major public information campaign to inform people about the project, the timescale and the advantages of this method of transport which has clearly worked extremely well in other cities in Europe. Anybody driving, walking or taking a bus in Dublin can see and experience the dreadful traffic gridlock in the city. We must move fast on this problem.</P>
      <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that we are at an important crossroads and that the next four years will be decisive in determining the future of transportation and the quality of life in Dublin. It would be a great tragedy if the controversy of recent days undermined the real progress being made by the Minister, Deputy Lowry, in tackling Dublin's traffic and transport problems. As Deputy Haughey said, we all recognise that transportation is one of the most important factors influencing the city.  Transport influences the growth, shape, size and environment of urban areas.  The traffic congestion in Dublin is a serious threat to the efficient running of the city.  It imposes heavy social costs on the community through pollution, wasted time, accidents and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years these problems have been the subject of discussion, argument and reports.  Too frequently there have been no productive results.  We cannot afford to debate the fundamental issue any longer, we must deal with it.  The problems with Dublin's traffic have been growing since the economic boom of the 1960s and action must be taken to prevent further gridlock.  In 1971 the results of the Dublin Transportation Study were given to the then Minister <Col N="1116" /> for Local Government.  It recommended the development of an integrated transportation system to accommodate anticipated increased travel in the period to 1991.  However, the DTS recommendations were never implemented and the chance was missed.  In 1978 the Transport Consultative Commission was established and presented its report.  Again, nothing was done.  The commission was given responsibility but was dissolved a little over 12 months later.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have had opportunities &mdash; which we did not grasp &mdash; to do something about Dublin's transport and traffic.  The DTI is the latest attempt to come to grips with the problem and we cannot afford to miss this opportunity as it can succeed where others did not.  It looked at the financial implications of its recommendations and that is important.  The DTI was carried out with financial support from the European Commission which meant that its recommendations could be included in the operational programme for transport.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is committed to providing financial assistance for light rail in Dublin and it is a distortion of the facts to suggest otherwise. The Commission has already paid £3 million towards the preparatory costs of the project.  It is important that a socio-economic analysis is carried out, that there will be a public inquiry and that an environmental impact study will be carried out.  The public consultation procedure has already begun and, in my experience in Dublin South-East, it is working well.  People are getting involved in meetings and with their local residents' associations in making recommendations on how the project could be improved.  Public consultation will mean that we will have an effective light rail system that will have the support of people living in the affected areas.</P>
    <P>We must build on the success of DART by improving the attractiveness of public transport.  A capital city the size of Dublin requires a mass transit system which can move large numbers <Col N="1117" /> of people along main transport corridors quickly and easily in a reliable way. Implementing DTI is the best way forward. An integral part of the DTI recommendations was that we should have a rail based system.  It suggested that it could be implemented at a far lower cost than an extended DART network. The experience of other cities has been that a rail based system works well.  The Dublin City Business Association sent representatives to look at transport in a number of European cities and concluded that the light rail system was the way forward.  The evidence from around the world is that it is the way to reverse the decline in public transport in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It is important to move quickly on this issue.  A huge amount of preparatory work must be done and it is important that the opportunities which have been created already are not lost. The Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil also had a role in this &mdash; has decided to prioritise the lines.  It is inevitable that this will be challenged and those who are on the second stage sections will want to make a contribution to the discussion and give their input on the priorities that have been agreed.  We are still a long way from a final decision but we are making progress and that is the important point.  There has been a huge amount of debate already and it is inevitable that there will be further debate.</P>
    <P>The request from the European Commission should not cause the alarm it appears to have caused.  From the beginning it was a built-in legal requirement. All major projects funded by the EU have this requirement so I cannot see what the fuss is about.  We still have to pass legislation on this issue, we have to look at the environmental impact statement and the outcome of the public inquiries.  It is important that we maintain the momentum.</P>

      <P>When I was preparing the national plan there was much pressure on me not to allocate money for the light rail system and to spend it on roads or other projects.  However, I included the light rail system in the national plan for the Structural Funds because it is, as recommended by the Dublin Transport Initiative, an important element in solving Dublin's traffic chaos.  It is widely known and has been discussed previously in this House in the context of other projects, such as the Tallaght Hospital and the peat station for the midlands, that the EU Commission requires a detailed evaluation of all projects worth £20 million or more.  Evaluation studies carried out to date in relation to the light rail project confirm that the light rail system makes strong economic and traffic sense <Col N="1119" /> and that the two lines suggested for the first phase of the project, Dundrum and Tallaght, will perform extremely well. The full return from the light rail system will only be realised when the three lines of the system are in place.</P>
      <P>The previous Government and its Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and the Government and its Minister, Deputy Lowry, would have been remiss not to proceed with detailed planning of the light rail system pending the final go-ahead from Brussels.  The decision to proceed with detailed planning for the Dundrum and Tallaght lines was taken by the previous Government in light of the preliminary cost benefit studies of how the project would be best phased &mdash; six options were examined at that stage &mdash; in conjunction with the planning go-ahead for the proposed port access tunnel from Santry to Dublin Port.</P>
      <P>I was born and reared on Dublin's northside and spent my first 21 years there.  This issue is not, nor should it become, a northside <i>versus</i> southside debate.  The line to Ballymun makes clear economic sense and completes the Luas project.  The question at issue with regard to Ballymun is not whether but when; it is a question of timing.  It makes more sense from a timing perspective to start with the one line which has a dedicated right of way &mdash; the Harcourt Street line.  It would also minimise traffic disruption during the construction phase.  The logistics suggest it is preferable to build the port access tunnel first to offer an alternative access route into town during the construction phase of the Ballymun line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read many reports on the current controversy which use the shorthand of &ldquo;northside poor, southside rich&rdquo;.  As a northsider living in the southside, I want to challenge both of those stereotypes.  The northside has areas of deep poverty.  Equally, the catchment area of the Ballymun line has areas of comfortable prosperity.  Along the catchment area of the Dundrum line <Col N="1120" /> there are areas of good incomes and also unemployment blackspots which are well documented in, for example, Dublin County Council's CODEM report.</P>
    <P>Extending the Dundrum route the extra mile to Sandyford industrial estate makes huge economic sense.  That industrial estate has factories employing nearly 7,000 people.  The economics of running full trains in both directions during the morning and evening commuter peaks make sense.  An extra £10 million, which is small money in a project of this scale, would bring the Dundrum track that vital extra mile to the Sandyford industrial estate and would also serve some of our unemployment blackspots in that area.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission is rightly concerned about the employment impact of the construction phase of a major project like Luas and in ensuring that people living in jobless blackspots can benefit during the construction phase.  I repeatedly pursued this issue with Commissioner Bruce Millan with regard to Structural Fund spending and I am delighted to see Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies taking such an interest in this aspect of the project.  Commissioner Millan said that every project seeking EU funding had to go for tender on a European scale and it would be extremely difficult to impose conditions as to where the workers on the construction phase of the project would come from.  I hope that out of these evaluations we will achieve what I have sought for so long, that those who get the jobs for the building phase of the project will be those who might not otherwise get work, who have been unemployed for a long time and whose skills we should build up to ensure they are able to benefit from these jobs along the route.</P>
    <P>I welcome the study commissioned by the European Commission.  In the wake of the studies carried out by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and CIE, I am confident that the phasing of the project, as it has proceeded to date, will come <Col N="1121" /> about and the full economic benefits will be reaped when the three phases of the light rail system are in place and all areas of the city, north, south and west, can benefit from it.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the LRT system which, when completed, will have major implications for the environmental and economic life of Dublin and its people.  It is my hope that the political charges made by the Opposition over the past few weeks will not delay this project.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1991, Labour Party councillors from both Dublin city and county made a detailed submission, with the able assistance from the then MEP, Barry Desmond, to the EU for Structural Funds to put in place a co-ordinated transport infrastructure incorporating a light rail transit system for Dublin.  I was pleased to be a member of the delegation which presented the Labour Party document <i>Transport Development for Economic Growth</i> to Commissioner Bruce Millan in November 1991.</P>
      <P>It was our view that the LRT would be cheaper to build than either a metro or DART system.  The system is user and environmentally friendly and the vehicles ride comfortably and quietly. Cars, vans and buses are significantly noisier.  I was pleased that the EU sanctioned these Structural Funds, especially given that the previous operational programme from 1989-93 was biased in favour of roads against the rail system &mdash; the ratio was around 17:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was always my view, obviously wrongly held, that the Government approved the findings of the Dublin Transport Initiative report in 1994, which recommended that in phase I CIE would proceed with the rail link to Tallaght and Dundrum.  The Glasnevin/Ballymun route and ultimately the link to Dublin Airport was for some unknown reason relegated to phase II.  In effect, this meant that work would not commence on this phase until the next century, depending on the <Col N="1122" /> availability of finance.  This was another incidence where the northside and its socio-economic problems, particularly unemployment, were forgotten.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to know that a socio-economic cost benefit analysis on a number of routes is under consideration, particularly as I understand, and I am open to correction on this, that the DTI did not take into consideration the impact on north Dublin of the staggering growth of Dublin Airport, which had a throughput of 8 million passengers in 1995 and has a projected level of 13 million passengers by 2003.  Hopefully this will be brought to the attention of the EU in its review and perhaps the Ballymun route will get the go ahead in phase I.</P>
    <P>The DART system, which has been an unqualified success, has taken significant numbers of private cars off our roads.  The DTI has recommended the extension of the DART to Greystones and Malahide on the basis that the conversion of an existing rail link is a worthwhile option.  Given that the Greystones extension received approval during a recent by-election, I recommend the Government to approve the extension to Portmarnock and Malahide.  This would facilitate another option, such as linking the DART to the airport and Swords, one of the fastest growing towns in Ireland.  There is a cast iron case for a rail extension to the airport. Apart from the fact that Dublin is the only European capital without a direct rail link from its airport, it is also an industrial centre in itself with over 100 companies and some 8,000 people are employed there.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend this proposal and urge that the Opposition should stop playing political football with this important issue which is so vital for the future of Dublin and in job creation for its people.</P>

      <P>I listened last night to Deputy Tom Kitt, a good friend of mine, make the most outrageous attack on the Minister for many unsustainable reasons.  The last time I heard him speak <Col N="1123" /> in a similar vein was in regard to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett, and his accusations will prove to be equally unfounded in this case.</P>
      <P>As one of the Deputies representing Ballymun, I was anxious to put on record my welcome for any re-evaluation which might bring the line there more quickly.  The northside did reasonably well from the distribution of Structural Funds because of the substantial investment in the proposed tunnel route.  It is not without its controversies. Environmental issues are involved and we are fighting hard at every level in this regard.  However, it is a substantial investment.  We shared the view of many that it was hard to see where any additional public facility could go on northside roads without putting that tunnel in place first.  However, we welcome the commitment to commence with planning there.</P>
      <P>The opening of the Drumcondra station, which will allow northside commuters access to the Maynooth commuter line over the next year, the construction of this tunnel and this review makes the northside feel that these funds have been spent reasonably.  We do not wish to be set off against any other area of the city.  The needs of each sector should be evaluated fairly.  While we see merit in all the proposals, we would welcome any new emphasis given to Ballymun in addition to the commitments already made to the area.</P>

      <P>I look forward to the next 18 months with curiosity and, I hope, enjoyment in responding to the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motions.</P>
      <P>This motion comes from the party whose one time leader was accused by the President of the European Commission of telling untruths with regard to the Structural Funds.  Have the Fianna Fáil Deputies forgotten the saga of the incredible shrinking billions?  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, returned from Edinburgh like a latter day Braveheart with £8 billion.  A few months later his Government published the national plan and slid down the slippery slope of half truths, untruths, rumours and leaks.  We were confronted with the unedifying spectacle of Fianna Fáil Ministers engaging in stout denial cloaked in bluster and then passing the blame for their own miscalculations to Commissioners, officials and other cohesion countries &mdash; not necessarily in that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what way our comrades in Fianna Fáil may wish to present the figures, the Fianna Fáil led Administration <Col N="1125" /> managed to mislay about £1 billion on its ill-fated journeys between Brussels and Dublin.  That was not a bad day's work.  The loss of £1 billion was small beer compared to the damage to the country's reputation in Europe.  The EU mendicants went to the well once too often and, in the process, managed to alienate the EU Commission, its officials and other EU member states.  If one wants to know why the taxpayers will have to pay a fine of £75 million for the behaviour of our beef processors, one should look carefully at the party in power during that period.</P>
    <P>This Government is repairing the damage inflicted by the previous Fianna Fáil led Administration on our relations with Europe.  We have succeeded in restoring the trust and confidence which is necessary if Ireland is to play a full and equal role in the EU.</P>
    <P>Not content with bad housekeeping when it was in power, Fianna Fáil is now engaging in a blatant and cynical attempt to sow renewed discord between the Government and the European Commission.  It would happily fritter away the strength in the relationship between Ireland and the EU for the sake of a few cheap headlines.  The Fianna Fáil motion centres on the study requested by the European Commission. Its wide-eyed amazement at this requirement is, at best, disingenuous. The lack of sufficient research, analysis and additonality was one of the reasons the national plan had to be subjected to radical surgery.</P>
    <P>The need for a cost benefit analysis of the DTI package was included in the Community Support Framework, which Deputy Bertie Ahern may recall, and in the operational programme for transport which Deputy Cowen may recall.  If the Deputies in Fianna Fáil were aware of this their motion is no more than the normal bluff and bluster.  If they were not, it becomes clear why they made such a mess of the EU funding saga. Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways. Are we once again to be treated to the incompetence theory?</P>
    <P>The EU Commission is fully entitled <Col N="1126" /> to seek independent studies of various projects.  In doing so it is protecting the interests of the hard-pressed European taxpayers, to whom we are eternally grateful.  The proposed study will simply provide a comparative evaluation of alternative routes &mdash; Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum.  It has nothing to do with the light rail projects, for which funding is already committed in the operational programme.  I understand money has already been paid to CIE for the preparatory work.  The only threat to the funding for this project comes from those mischievous souls in Fianna Fáil who view the role of an Opposition as being destructive rather than constructive.</P>

      <P>There is concern in Dublin that the Dublin light rail transit system will not be constructed because of the evident mishandling of the issue by the Government and, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Lowry.  The Minister launched Luas in all its glory last year and the publicity was favourable about the return of light rail transit systems to Dublin.  We were told Luas would play a key role in reducing traffic congestion in the city and how the Dublin light transit system would help modernise our public transport operation in Dublin.  We support these noble aims and objectives.</P>
      <P>In Government Fianna Fáil pioneered the return of a modern light rail transit system to Dublin city when it formulated the priorities under the EU backed Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99.  The other major political parties backed this idea.  When Luas was launched we were not told that the EU Commission had not approved the specific plans for the initiative as laid down by the Government. It is evident the EU Commission had been and is seeking further evaluations on the socio-economic cost benefits of the Luas scheme as put forward by the Minister, Deputy Lowry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the Minister launched a project worth £122 million in EU Structural Funds without the approval of the EU Commission.  The Commission is a tough paymaster and sets stringent monetarist criteria for the implementation of EU backed schemes. It is angry with the Minister and rightly so.  No Minister should ever take the Commission for granted.  It is a friend to <Col N="1128" /> Ireland and does not approve of Ministers trying to spend moneys without its approval.</P>
    <P>The Luas project is now in real danger.  A sum of £15 million has been allocated for the project this year and £27 million next year.  However, it appears that because of the Government's mishandling of the issue there is a real risk of it not being able to draw down the allocated funds in the necessary time.  The Minister has done little to advance the cause of good relations with the EU Commission.  He has been recklessly irresponsible with the spending of enormous amounts of Structural Funds.  It is hard to believe that this Government is supposed to be operating behind a pane of glass as the most open and transparent Administration in the history of the State.  The Minister has not answered the questions put to him.</P>
    <P>His statements speak of Fianna Fáil misleading others but who is misleading whom?  It is not only Fianna Fáil who thought the money was available and that the project was going ahead &mdash; his colleagues thought so too.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who represents my constituency, held a public meeting for the people of Ranelagh, Rathmines and Rathgar to announce that this would go ahead and to detail the great benefits it would bring.  It was a successful meeting and people were delighted with the advances which would be made.  Deputy Frances Fitzgerald held another meeting with the same purpose.  I do not want to get into argument about this.  It is an important matter and we do not bring it up for cheap political gain.  We were told this was going ahead and the Minister's colleagues in Government believed so too &mdash; the proof of that is the public meetings they held.</P>
    <P>The Minister must answer the questions on this issue, he cannot leave it hanging.  A traffic management plan is to be introduced in my constituency, much of which depends on whether the Harcourt Street line is established.  The Ballymun-Airport line is needed but if <Col N="1129" /> we want to get traffic out of the city centre there is an advantage in first introducing the Harcourt Street line. The Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, made a good point in saying that if the tunnel was built first it would alleviate problems when the Ballymun line was built.  We should not have a northside-southside row about this.  The strong impression was given that the first two parts of the project would go ahead but we are now told that they will not.</P>
    <P>If there is a problem, the Minister should admit it and one hopes it can be resolved.  However, claiming that he did not say something when it is obvious that he did is ludicrous.  This project is very important to Dublin.  Everyone wants it and it should go ahead as quickly as possible, with everyone working together.  The Minister should be much clearer on this issue and explain where the project stands.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, for sharing his time on this important debate.  I was sorry to hear the remarks of Deputy Eric Byrne &mdash; I thought he might speak about the need for the project but he decided to spend time dealing with Fianna Fáil. Why that should be the case is beyond me.</P>
      <P>It is important for a modern capital city like Dublin to be provided with the type of facility we are discussing.  Everyone in the House strongly supports it but we on this side are concerned about the confusion surrounding the project, arising from the actions of the Minister, Deputy Lowry.  We regret that because if there are difficulties they will impinge on all of us, particularly those who represent constituencies in the greater Dublin area, and we do not want that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing public transport is sketchy and cumbersome, despite the best efforts of those who work in it, such as the managers, workers and drivers of Dublin Bus.  It is not sufficient to meet the needs of the greater Dublin region and consequently it is extremely <Col N="1130" /> important that light rail goes ahead without a hitch.  There are differing views on where the lines are going; my concern is that the Tallaght line goes through areas which contain people with access to their own private transport.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the route of the Tallaght line because I have met people in the organisation which is planning the physical provision of the structure. Unfortunately, the western part of Tallaght is being ignored.  I live in Tallaght and represent its people in the House, so I cannot understand why the line does not extend to west Tallaght, which is a hugely built up area, heavily dependent on public transport, in which substantial housing development is continuing. It was short-sighted of the planners not to extend the line to Fettercairn, Brookfield, Killinarden and Old Bawn and then have it circle back to the Square.  That would have made sense as it would have taken the line through a catchment area with a vast number of people without their own transport. Public transport in those areas is sketchy and when there are incidents on buses they are arbitrarily withdrawn by Dublin Bus to protect their workers, which punishes the entire community. This is an intolerable position and it increases the need to provide the service to west Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The way the Minister is handling the issue has caused a great deal of doubt. People do no know whether the system will be put in place.  We in this House are trying to aid the Government in clarifying the position, as our party leader and our spokesman have asked, so that it can get on with the project.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister, Deputy Lowry, castigate my good friend and colleague, Deputy Cullen, because he had the temerity to change political parties.  If I had been in the House at the time, I would have asked the Minister if he ever heard of former Deputy Michael O'Leary.  It is not long ago since the leader of Labour decided to change parties &mdash; and he joined Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>This is the Minister who gave erroneous information to the Dáil about the Horgan Quay site.  He said the man who had purchased the site had it for over 12 months but had not paid a penny; yet the Minister's Department had sent the contract to that man only one week before.  The allegations about receipts and travel had to be withdrawn in this House also.  Even yesterday, when the Minister was replying at Question Time in his usual condescending and pompous manner, he refused to give information to this House which was its right to receive.  He refused to confirm whether he appointed a certain individual to the Aviation Authority. Does he ever learn?  Ministers from other parties, such as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and ethics herself, the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, told people about the grandiose scheme which had the approval not only of the Cabinet but also of the EU, only to find out there had been concealment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is extremely serious.  The Minister concealed information from the Dáil and from his Cabinet colleagues. He also tried to conceal information from the EU.  Of what are these <Col N="1132" /> instances of concealment and secrecy a manifestation?  When we read editorials describing the Minister as prone to error, we can only conclude that he is suffering from lack of confidence and belief in his ability.  If this were not so, he would have no problem openly telling the House that exact position.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats have long favoured the provision of a light rail transit system for Dublin and we continue to be enthusaistic supporters of the project.  The availability of substantial funding from the European Union gives us the opportunity to proceed with a project which would simply not be affordable if we had to finance it from our own resources.  Within five years Dublin could have an excellent rapid transit system, comparable with the best in any city in the developed world.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House focuses on the handling of the LRT issue by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I am not interested in political point-scoring; instead I want to use the opportunity of this debate to set out the Progressive Democrats' policy on the transport requirements of the capital.  I must say, however, that I am not surprised that the Minister finds himself at the receiving end of yet another critical motion in this House. As the most accident prone member of an increasingly accident-prone Administration, he could aptly be dubbed the Minister for continuing chaos.  Several of his Government colleagues are claiming that they only became aware of the EU's demand for further studies on the LRT project when they read it in the papers &mdash; so much for collective Cabinet responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our basic objective should be to use the available money to build the best possible rapid transit system for the whole of Dublin, yet the Government's plan will serve only one side of the city &mdash; the south side.  We cannot proceed with a rapid transit proposal that ignores the north side of Dublin.  To do so would fly in the face of social justice, <Col N="1133" /> economic logic and transport efficiency, as we have already heard from a Labour Party Member from the northside. There are 400,000 people living on the north side.  The Ballymun-Dublin Airport link has been dropped, apparently because, due to lower car ownership in places like Ballymun, rapid transit would take fewer vehicles off the road. What kind of crazy policy is it that people on the south side must have rapid transit because they have cars, but people on the north side cannot have it because they do not have cars?  The Ballymun link must be reinstated as an essential part of the whole LRT proposal.</P>
    <P>It is a sad commentary on the present Administration's handling of this issue that it takes a European Commission official in Brussels to tell it that Ballymun is a deprived and disadvantaged area and that its social needs must be catered for.  Was the Minister for social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, not aware of this already?  I ask the Minister to state precisely when the Ballymun link was dropped from the LRT plan and why.  Was it because CIE seriously underestimated the cost of building the whole system and, having gone to Brussels with an overall project cover of £200 million, subsequently discovered that they could only deliver two lines for this price?</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to state whether money earmarked for the Ballymun line has been siphoned off to fund the construction of the north-south post access road tunnel from Whitehall to East Wall.  One only has to stand on O'Connell Bridge and watch the trucks grinding their way along the quays to know that what the port needs is an east-west road tunnel, linking it directly with the main routes out of the city to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway. Commercial interests put forward a fully costed proposal for the construction and operation of such an east-west tunnel using private money.  Instead, we are to get a north-south tunnel built with public money.  Can anybody in this Administration explain why?  Is this part <Col N="1134" /> of a plan to create such traffic congestion in the East Wall area to ensure that the eastern by-pass is ultimately built across Sandymount Strand, at a probably cost to the taxpayer of £500 million or more?  Clearly, we need more transparency and accountability in this whole process.  I urge the Government to re-examine its plans for the north side.  Can it not look at the feasibility of the privately funded east-west road tunnel?  If that option was chosen, then the north-south tunnel could be scrapped and the money saved could be used to complete the Ballymun-Dublin Airport link.  The Government should be honest enough to admit that the Ballymun line is not being postponed; it is being cancelled.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the EU will greatly reduce our access to Structural and Cohesion Funds from the end of the decade.  Without such funding it is unlikely that the Exchequer would be able to finance the cost of such a project. It is a pity that we have not adopted a more innovative and imaginative approach to the funding of the whole LRT system.  There seems to be strong ideological opposition to the private provision of public infrastructure. The attitude of the Labour Party, in particular, appears to be that we can have a State service or no service.  There is no reason why commercial capital cannot be attracted into the construction of the rapid transit system.</P>
    <P>Is the Department currently engaged in a consultation process for the LRT or a propaganda process?  Has it investigated the feasibility of running the centre-city sections of the system underground? Have the Minister or his officials met with the promoters of the unified proposal, who have advocated such a strategy?  Has the Minister sought detailed figures from independent experts as to the cost and practicality of providing rail tunnels to carry the LRT from the Grand Canal inwards towards the city?  Assuming that the underground option has been investigated, could the Minister, in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability, publish the studies which led to <Col N="1135" /> it being rejected?  If we do not go underground, what kind of traffic are we likely to see in the city centre area?  Picture the present situation at College Green at five o'clock on a Friday evening.  Thousands of cars, buses, trucks and motorcycles are grinding their way slowly through the rush-hour traffic, all competing for scarce road space.  Now add half a dozen trains to this mess.  This is a recipe for chaos, not for rapid transit.</P>
    <P>What time savings will this road-bound LRT system deliver that could not be achieved by simply converting the Harcourt Street line, for instance, into a dedicated busway?  If it does not deliver appreciable time savings, then why spend £220 million on it?</P>
    <P>Has the Department made any efforts to quantify the cost of the disruption that will be caused during the construction phase of this project?  I have already seen estimates that in the Mount Brown area alone up to 1,000 jobs could be lost in local business because of the disruption caused by the building of the LRT system.  The Minister should also clarify how many buildings will have to be demolished to make way for the on-street sections of the LRT.  Can he confirm that, in some instances, whole streets may have to be demolished in the oldest parts of the city, with a devastating impact on local communities?</P>
    <P>The whole idea of a rapid transit system is that it can convey people quickly from place to place by avoiding all other forms of traffic.  If a transit system has to fight for space with other modes of transport &mdash; cars and buses, for example &mdash; then it can no longer claim to be a rapid transit system.  The new LRT systems recently installed in Manchester and Sheffield support this view.  Both systems run on segregated track for almost all of their length.  This means that in the Manchester system only 3 kilometres out of a total route length of 31 kilometres run on the street, and less than half this is in conflict with other traffic.  In Sheffield, virtually all of the <Col N="1136" /> system runs on segregated track and, out of a total route length of 33 kilometres, only 600 metres is in conflict with other traffic.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with what is planned for Dublin.  Under the proposed LRT system more than half the total 40 kilometres of track length would run along suburban roads and busy city streets in direct conflict with motorised traffic. Every major junction between the canals would be a battleground for trains, buses, trucks and cars with the travelling public being the ultimate losers.  The mind boggles at the traffic chaos that would result from building twin train tracks along the central reservation of the Naas Road, one of the busiest arterial routes in the country and a vital commercial link between Dublin and the rest of the country.  Will intending passengers be expected to walk across three lanes of heavy traffic in order to clamber aboard their train in the middle of the road?  The Minister should explain how this will work.</P>
    <P>The proposed system for Dublin also has serious drawbacks from the standpoint of safety.  Research into light rail transit conducted for the Department of Transport in Britain established that the accident rate on non-segregated systems is five times higher than on segregated systems.  In other words, are we about to install in Dublin a system that may be not just unsatisfactory but potentially unsafe as well?</P>
    <P>I would like to see LRT routes running through the suburbs on segregated track, as far as possible, away from roads and other traffic.  Has the Minister given any consideration to the unified proposal to which I have referred already?  That proposal envisages using the old Harcourt Street line as already planned.  For the Tallaght line, however, it would utilise the bus-way reservation which is already in place.  This would enable the Tallaght line to serve the densely populated suburbs of Crumliin, Drimnagh, Walkinstown and Kimmage, instead of running down the middle of the Naas Road.  As they reach the line <Col N="1137" /> of the Grand Canal both routes would go underground from there to the city centre, providing a fast, safe and reliable link to the suburban centres.  Nowhere is the busy area between the canals would the trains clash with existing traffic.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister accept that a segregated system running underground through the centre and on designated track in the suburbs would be able to use high capacity vehicles similar to those used on the DART?</P>
    <P>I understand that the Luas proposal favoured by the Government may be overstating the carrying capacity of the tram-type vehicles that will be used on it.  Can the Minister confirm that the purchase of additional trams will add up to £25 million to the capital cost of the project?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also accept that a segregated system running underground in the city centre would be able to carry more passengers, offer faster journey times, operate at lower cost and reduce the risk of accidents, or has his Department made any study of these issues? This option would, in effect, be an extension of the existing, highly successful DART system to the rest of the city.</P>
    <P>The unified proposal showed how a comprehensive, integrated light-rail network for the whole city could be provided within five years.  This proposal would comprise three lines, including a vital link to the airport, with all the city centre sections running underground.  It would also allow for the extension of the proposed Dundrum link to Sandyford and later, one would hope, to Cabinteely. Everybody agrees that traffic congestion in Dundrum village is already so bad that extension to the Sandyford industrial estate, where there is adequate space for park-and-ride facilities, is absolutely essential.  The proposal would comprise: Sandyford to Dublin Airport &mdash; a DART-type service would run along the Harcourt Street line, go underground at the Grand Canal, re-emerging at the old Broadstone line and proceeding overground to Dublin Airport; Tallaght to Connolly <Col N="1138" />&mdash; a similar service would run from Tallaght along the reserved busway, going underground at Sundrive Road and re-emerging at Connolly to provide a link with the Bray-Howth DART line, and Temple Bar Interchange &mdash; an underground station at Temple Bar would provide a hub for the whole system, enabling journeys to be made, with interchanges, from Tallaght to the airport, from Dundrum to Howth, from Bray to Ballymun.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister or his Department given any consideration to the feasibility of this citywide proposal and, if so, will he publish the result of those deliberations? Would the Minister accept that, with appropriate funding from the commercial sector, this proposal could be brought on stream without any increase in the current level of public funding available for the Luas project as currently envisaged?  Has the Minister or his Department investigated the possibility of putting the whole project out to competitive public tender as happens with road projects of this size?  If we are not prepared to engage in new thinking, we are unlikely to arrive at practical and affordable solutions to any of the major problems confronting our capital city.</P>
    <P>The whole LRT debate focuses on the transport requirements of Dublin.  We must not forget that there are other cities in the country which also have transport problems.  Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford all have to put up with inefficient and unreliable bus services operated, incidentally, by a Dublin-based company.  I am not advocating light rail for these cities but at the very least could the Minister not make it an operational requirement of Bus Éireann that its provincial city services be operated to quality management standards such as ISO 9000?  This would go a long way towards ensuring a better and more reliable service for the people of those cities without the need for huge additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has many questions to address which have been left unanswered and which merit full accountability.</P>

      <P>: I welcome this opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the process which has been followed on the light rail issue.  Despite my limited ministerial experience I can bring an overview to this debate which I hope will be helpful.</P>
      <P>I worked initially with Deputy Michael Smith when he was Minister for the Environment.  He was, and is, the Fianna Fáil representative for North Tipperary.  We had an excellent working relationship and I was very sorry when it ended.  By coincidence my current post also involves working with a Minister from North Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am pleased to say again that the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and I have an excellent working relationship. In these portfolios I have been aware of the ongoing developments on DTI and of the light rail project in particular.  In many ways this has been a seamless progress from stage to stage.  The light rail project was given initial political direction by Deputy Cowen who, as Minister, ensured the necessary work was undertaken to secure agreements on funding. Following the Edinburgh Summit he and his officials worked to ensure that this project would be part of the National Development Plan and subsequently included for funding under the Operational Programme for Transport. Naturally, challenges have been encountered at each stage but these have been overcome and we have moved on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister, Deputy Cowen secured Government approval of the provisional funding that the links to Tallaght and Dundrum be constructed during the period of the national plan with the remaining links to be constructed at a later stage.  That was the time the decision was made, and the priorities of Government established.  This decision enabled the CIE project team and its <Col N="1140" /> consultants to undertake more detailed work on the project.  They got on with the job of checking technical aspects of the routes.  They started to identify underground services that would be affected.  They also commenced preparatory work on land ownership and other issues.  When the current Minister, Deputy Lowry, came to office he built on the work done to date.  He strengthened the Department's team and ensured that the CIE management team was augmented by the appointment of a head of programme and projects responsible for investment, including light rail.  When more detailed preparatory work was completed he ensured that this was presented to the Irish public and to the European Commission at the first available opportunity.  This was done so as to be certain that views would be listened to and evaluated before anything was set in stone.  These two events &mdash; the presentation to the Irish public and to the Commission &mdash; happened at almost the same time and have given rise to the present unnecessary controversy.</P>
    <P>Some points need to be clarified. When the Commission were given details of the planning and evaluation work in progress they did not reject it. They did not question the light rail concept. They did not seek to have the overall project re-evaluated.  They did not question the core network as recommended by DTI.  They did ask that the Department have more work done in relation to the Ballymun option.</P>
    <P>They need this information before a final decision can be taken.  CIE had evaluated six options &mdash; this analysis is available from CIE &mdash; and the Commission asked that further work be done on two of these options.  These were the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum proposals.  One of these was the option given priority by both Governments and both included the Tallaght-city centre section.  This puts the request in context.</P>
    <P>Let us also be clear on who is doing this evaluation work.  It was agreed that the additional work would be arranged <Col N="1141" /> by the Department.  It is misleading to give the impression that this was some sort of unilateral Commission investigation. Both parties recognised that no final decision had been taken.  Both parties agreed jointly on the terms of reference for a study.  Both agreed jointly on the procedures to be followed.  Both agreed jointly on the list of consultants who were to be invited to tender.  There has been no disagreement with the Commission.</P>
    <P>Never at any time since the request for a study was made has there been any attempt to avoid that study.  In one form or another both administrations need this study for their respective approval procedures.  There has been a difference of emphasis but no breakdown in relations with the Commission.  Indeed, working relationships with the Commission continue to be good, both friendly and businesslike.</P>
    <P>While I am on this aspect I also want to clarify the points made last night about the need to synchronise Commission and departmental activities. This was done.  The Commission was advised of the provisional decision taken by Government and was subsequently presented with the detailed information as I have outlined.  There are so many parallel strands to be brought together that I do not see how it could have been otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is no way to get Commission approval before the detailed planning and evaluation work is done.  There is no way to do the detailed work without having a focus and we are not finished yet.  In case there is any doubt, let me state that other information is needed for the formal EU application.  This includes, for example, the environmental impact statement which is currently being prepared and which is also needed for our national procedures.  Let nobody feign surprise when issues raised in this process have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I was dismayed to see the manner in which wider issues have been tied into this debate.  These, while part of the national consultative process, have nothing to do with the Commission <Col N="1142" /> request.  Issues like extensions to Sandyford or to the airport are separate. Abandoning on-street light rail in favour of an underground system is not something the Commission has even hinted at, and it is not on our agenda.</P>
    <P>Minister Lowry rightly made the point in the Seanad when he said we could not afford the luxury of more studies to re-examine the fundamental basis of the DTI strategy.  This strategy included building a phase 1 of an on-street light rail network to Cabinteely, Dundrum and Ballymun and recognised that only part of that could be built before 1999.  Successive Governments and the EU Commission have accepted this.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount of work to be done to ensure we have light rail by 2000 AD.  It is time to stop this ballyhoo which is only putting at risk funding which has been included in the operational programme for transport. Let us get on with building this first stage.  The danger is if we argue too long, we may all end up as losers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Private Members' motion was deliberately tabled by Fianna Fáil because the party stands by its charges that the Minister, Deputy Lowry, has grossly misled this House, the Seanad and the public in relation to the Dublin light rail project. Misleading this House was not an accident or a one-off.  The information about the EU investigation of phasing the light rail plan was knowingly concealed by the Minister on the following ten occasions: at the announcement of the two lines on 12 December 1995; in an Adjournment debate on 14 December; in parliamentary questions from Deputy Shatter and me on 31 January; in a major debate in Seanad Éireann on 14 February; in reply to parliamentary questions from Deputy Molloy, Deputy Callely and me on 5 March; in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Haughey on 6 March; in newspaper reports on 8 March; in reply to parliamentary questions from Deputy <Col N="1143" /> Quill on 26 March; in reply to a parliamentary question from me on 28 March; and in a major speech to the Dublin City Business Association on 28 March.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion calls on the Minister to lay before the Dáil all the correspondence between him and the European Commission in relation to the light rail.  We believe that the Minister, in the interests of openness and transparency &mdash; as they like to call it &mdash; should take that course of action immediately.  We are not alone in that view.  In an editorial in this week's <i>Sunday Business Post</i> the Minister was requested to be more open in his policies.</P>
      <P>There is a strong recent precedent for such disclosure of information and for that information to be laid before the House.  After the Mutton Island controversy, for example, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, laid before the Dáil the correspondence between him and the EU Commissioner for Regional Affairs. Why will the Minister, Deputy Lowry, not do the same?  The previous material is available in the Library for all Deputies to examine.</P>
      <P>However, in his speech last night the Minister, Deputy Lowry, refused the request to lay this correspondence before the Dáil or to place it in the Library.  Instead, he tried to fob us off by laying just the terms of reference of the EU investigation in the Library. That is a cop-out and a form of censorship. Why does he not take the course taken by his colleagues and lay this correspondence before the House?  The Minister, Deputy Lowry, claimed that doing so would serve no useful purpose. The Minister is acting as judge and jury, which is clearly wrong.  If he has nothing to hide, why not lay the correspondence before this House?  Will we have to wait until there is another story in the newspapers about what happened at the Commission and what the Minister agreed behind closed doors with the EU before we get disclosure, only to be told at that stage it is normal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's refusal to publish the <Col N="1144" /> full correspondence means he has, in a way, redefined this Government's commitment to transparency.  He has produced his own minimalist type of transparency. Quite frankly, I find this version unacceptable.  It is against the spirit of the Programme for a Government of Renewal which brought this Government into office.  I ask the Taoiseach and the leaders of the other parties in Government to exercise their political influence in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister's version is unacceptable to the media.  In an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week the leader writer said that this debate about the Dublin light rail was more than a political skirmish.  It stated:</P>
    <P>At the heart of the dispute are very serious questions about the Government's respect for the Dáil, its relations with the European Commission in Brussels and, not least, the apparent lack of any community or local involvement in transport policy.</P>
    <P>The accident-prone Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Mr. Lowry, who has been accused by Fianna Fáil of misleading the Dáil, has yet again got some explaining to do.  His statement last night does not satisfactorily answer the many questions raised.</P>
    <P>...The Fianna Fáil charge that Mr. Lowry was involved in a &ldquo;gross deception of both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo; is thus not entirely without substance.  And the Taoiseach's sturdy defence of his ministerial colleague in the Dáil yesterday would appear to fly in face of the facts as now known.  The truth is that Mr. Lowry allowed the impression to build that the Government's decision to proceed with the Tallaght and Dundrum projects, at the expense of Ballymun, was a <i>fait accompli.</i> The Minister has only himself to blame if his political judgment is again being questioned.</P>
    <P>...As it is, this whole episode will serve as a further reminder of how this Government's much-vaunted <Col N="1145" /> commitment to openness and accountability means very little in practice.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> editorial was equally critical and is worth quoting:</P>
    <P>[Minister] Lowry is now attempting to make little of this matter, but it is of no small importance.  If a Fianna Fáil politician behaved in such a way, he or she would be hounded by the likes of Lowry and Fine Gael ... Yet Lowry apparently feels he has no case to answer in relation to the Luas project. We do not agree.  If we propose to use huge amounts of EU cash for a piece of infrastructure, then we must first convince the EU of the merits of that investment.  And the citizens of Dublin deserve quite precise information regarding the status of the project.</P>
    <P>The Minister's refusal to publish the correspondence between himself and the European Commission looks like a cover-up.  The Minister knows the case is threadbare and to publish would expose this concealment.  I again invite the Minister to publish the correspondence between his Department and the EU.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night the Minister tried to maintain that the investigation ordered is normal.  He quoted quite selectively from the Community Support Framework to back this up. However, he decided not to quote from page 78 which outlines that such investigations are ordered only when the information supplied by a member state is inadequate.  Ireland had supplied the information required and this investigation signalled a serious development which should have been disclosed to the country, and to this House in particular.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Lowry, also quoted very selectively last night from the correspondence of the EU Regional Affairs Commissioner to his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  He did not quote the Commissioner when she expressed concern to the Minister for the Environment that the Mutton Island <Col N="1146" /> project was being announced while it was still being examined and without any prior exchange of information with the EU.  Did the Minister get a similar letter from the same Commissioner, Dr. Monika Wulf-Mathies?</P>
    <P>The Minister announced plans for the two lines when the matter was still being examined and without letting the EU know, even though his officials met the Commission on 29 November 1995, two weeks before the official announcement.</P>
    <P>Another interesting observation arises on this controversy from correspondence laid before the Oireachtas by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  In those letters the EU had to disabuse the Minister of the notion that the Commissioner's investigation into Mutton Island was very unusual.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, claims such investigations are par for the course.  He must be the only member of this Administration who believes that such EU investigations are normal.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night, the Minister lists projects which were the subject of EU investigations.  Will he answer how many of them were announced without the disclosure of the investigation or before the investigation was completed? As far as I can establish, there were none apart from this one.</P>
    <P>The Minister reiterated the pathetic claim last night that he had not announced plans for the two light rail lines and that he had referred early to a public consultation process.  This is a distortion of the facts.  There is no doubt that, on 12 December 1995, Minister Lowry announced plans for the two lines and expressed regret that Ballymun would not be part of the first phase.  He also said that the public consultation process he launched was in connection only with these two lines, nothing more.  This is borne out in parliamentary replies and speeches and in the leaflets circulated by the light rail team.  I am not aware that any of them went to Ballymun.  All the leaflets I have <Col N="1147" /> were circulated near the proposed Dundrum and Tallaght lines.</P>
    <P>It was a gross distortion for the Minister to claim last night that Ballymun arose only during the public consultation process.  The leaflets on light rail also scotch the claim by the Minister that he never launched the first two lines.  In a leaflet entitled <i>Between the Lines,</i> circulated in the Dundrum area in the last few days, there are three pictures of the Minister and one of a train.</P>

      <P>The front page of the leaflet states:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Mr. Lowry T.D., has stated that the Light Rail line to Dundrum will travel across the Taney Road Junction and on to Sandyford Road North.  The Minister made this announcement at the launch of the public consultation process last December.</P>
      <P>These leaflets are in wide circulation in Dundrum and Tallaght.  I cannot find one of them in Ballymun.  It is clear, therefore, that the Minister was forging ahead with the two lines and it was only when he was pulled up by the EU that the question of the Ballymun line emerged.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that he could set the route for the line, distribute brochures advising where it was going, order public consultations on two specific lines but not on the third and that all this means nothing?  I do not believe this, nor does anybody else.  The reality is that the only thing the Minister did not announce in his speech on 12 December was the EU investigation, which he should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Minister not announce the EU investigation, given that it was so significant?  Why was a year lost? Why are detailed maps for the light rail routes not available at this stage?  Why <Col N="1148" /> were five months lost since the EU investigation was agreed?  It is only now that the procedures are being put in place for the investigation.  Given the delays, there is a great danger that, by the time the operational programme for transport review comes up next year, Ireland could lose out, for example to Portugal, unless headway is now made.</P>
    <P>These latest delays pose serious threats to the light rail.  In a speech to the Dublin City Business Association on 28 March, the Minister warned that there is a fixed timescale for the EU funding that underpins the project and no guarantee this money will be maintained unless the timetable is adhered to.  What is the position today on this timetable?  If the light rail phasing is changed by the EU, as is now likely, will there be funds for all three lines to go ahead at once or will the Government have to withdraw its announcement on the two lines?  I would be interested in attending such a press conference.  Will the lines be completed by the deadline for the operational programme for transport?  If lines have not been laid by this time next year, will Ireland lose EU funding for the light rail to, for example, Portugal, which is already very advanced in this area?</P>
    <P>This controversy does not just raise the matter of the Minister's respect for the Dáil but also for the EU.  He proceeded with the announcement of plans for the light rail when an investigation had been ordered.  He did not even acknowledge that investigation on ten different occasions in this House when I raised the issue with him.  He brushed it off as insignificant.  Is it any wonder that Irish-EU relations are at such a low?  If there are to be further controversies after this one and those already involving the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, we can say good-bye to any goodwill we have built up painfully over the years.</P>
    <P>This motion relates to light rail. However, there are many other areas within the Transport, Energy and <Col N="1149" /> Communications portfolio where the Minister's judgment is also in serious question.  There is the second mobile telephone licence controversy, about which we will hear more next Tuesday. The Minister's handling of a strategic alliance partner for Telecom Éireann is now a shambles.  Eight of the ten top bidders have withdrawn from the competition with just two left.  This side of the House will oppose any shabby attempt to sell off 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann at a panic, knock-down price.  This process is also being pursued in a secretive and misguided fashion.  It should be abandoned and there should be a full debate in the House as to how we go forward.</P>
    <P>In recent days we have seen media headlines about practices in the semi-State organisations.  Are the leaks in this morning's newspapers another tactical diversion?  Last year the Minister questioned tendering processes which led to a witch-hunt for weeks on end.  Various diversionary tactics were tried during that time.  Is this another one?</P>
    <P>In his speech last night, the Minister conveniently forgot to tackle the issue of whether he informed his Government colleagues about the light rail investigation. At the weekend, the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> reported that the other Ministers were, like the Dáil, the Seanad and the public, kept in the dark with regard to the EU investigation.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter because the importance of Government action on this issue goes way beyond its implications for the individuals who yesterday lost their basic personal assistance service.  In light of outstanding Government commitments, the imminent production of a number of important reports and the widely accepted need to radically alter support services for people with disabilities, the Government's response to this need has a larger significance.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies may not be aware of the developing idea of personal assistants and their role in helping people with significant disabilities to achieve personal independence.  A personal assistant assists an individual with a disability with every aspect of daily living such as personal care, household tasks, assistance in college, the workplace, driving and interpretation.  The model with which I am most familiar is that developed by the Centre for Independent Living through its INCARE programme. It stresses the control of the process by the individual and the need for high quality training.  This programme, which was originally supported with funding from a former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has shown dramatic results.  Participants in the pilot programme were more likely to progress their education and maintain employment.  However, most importantly, they have developed personally, moving away from passive dependence and enjoying a sense of personal freedom which they could not have imagined before they got involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personal assistance service was referred to an advisory group by the last <Col N="1154" /> Minister for Health.  This group reported to the Minister last year and while its recommendations have been circulated to some interested parties, they have not been made available.  I understand the group strongly supported the development of personal assistance services and specifically recommended the provision of £5 million for the development of such services for people with physical disabilities. Action has not yet been taken on foot of the report.  Following a difficult period last year, funding for the INCARE pilot programme has been main-streamed by the Department of Health through the Irish Wheelchair Association.</P>
    <P>The specific case I am raising concerns seven people who will lose their personal assistants today if action is not taken immediately.  The people are all in the process of completing a course in social studies in the National College of Industrial Relations.  The course, accredited by the NCEA, relates to disability studies and, in particular, to issues arising from independent living. To be able to participate on this course the students needed personal assistants in whose training they played an integral part.  The assistants were trained, but they will now lose out.</P>
    <P>As the course has been completed, the initial funding for the personal assistants which came through the NRB, an agency of the Department of Health, has run out.  The official funding ran out in February and since then the Centre for Independent Living has been funding the project.  However, that funding is no longer available.  Yesterday seven people who have been trained to provide this service became unemployed and seven people who were benefiting from this service had their ability to be independent snatched from them.</P>
    <P>One of those people affected wrote to me.  She stated:</P>
    <P>Before starting this course many of us were today dependent on our family and friends for our personal needs and social outlets.  A lot of us had <Col N="1155" /> been trying to further our education so it would give us a better opportunity for employment.  But without the availability of our personal assistants this was not realistically possible. Having a personal assistant has made a huge difference to our lives.  We have become more independent and less reliant on our families.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the right policy on personal assistance is obvious.  I have already mentioned the advisory group's report.  I appeal to the Minister to give a practical demonstration of the Government's commitment to action on personal assistance by providing the necessary funding to make sure that the personal assistance service which has done so much for those individuals is reinstated.  He can show his good faith by announcing he will make temporary funding available for these seven people.  For 12 months this would have a tiny net cost for the Exchequer but it would be a powerful statement that the Government intends to properly support the personal independence and empowerment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I thank Deputy Mary Wallace for allowing me to support the case she has made for people who have shown tremendous courage in the face of their disabilities.  These people are intelligent and were in good jobs but they now need personal help.  I ask the Minister for Health to do all he can to restore the help they received, which they badly need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I wish to set in context the question raised by the Deputy concerning the provision of personal assistance services to persons who have recently completed a disabilities studies course in the National College of Industrial Relations.  Funding for these personal assistants, who were required for the duration of the course, was provided <Col N="1156" /> by FÁS and the European Social Fund to enable the students to participate in the course.  As the course has ended, funding from FÁS and the ESF is no longer available for this service.  I understand that temporary funding has been provided by the Centre for Independent Living for the personal assistance service for these students.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the availability to such services to the wider disabled community is that limited personal assistance service is currently available to persons who participated in the Centre for Independent Living horizon pilot project.  The INCARE project did not include the students concerned. That two-year project ended in December 1994.  I agreed to fund the continuation of this service, on a pilot basis, to the existing participants pending an examination of the whole question of personal assistance services.  It is not intended at this point to provide additional places pending a decision on the extension of the personal assistance service.</P>
      <P>An advisory group was established to report to me on future policy of providing and developing a personal assistance service to enable persons with physical disabilities to live independently. Specifically, the group was asked to examine the personal assistance services provided by the Centre for Independent Living under its INCARE programme, the current and likely future demand for such a service, the model and organisation of service which should be provided, taking particular account of cost effectiveness, and the estimated cost of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advisory group agreed that the independent living model can offer a higher degree of social gain to individuals than the residential model. However, it considered it essential that any independent living scheme be properly structured and administered. Accordingly, the report's recommendations in relation to the provision of a personal assistance service include the matter of fundraising, departmental responsibilities and the introduction of <Col N="1157" /> an assessment procedure.  The aim of this procedure would be to assess the dependency and levels of service needs of each applicant as well as to determine the capacity of the applicant to manage a personal assistant.</P>
    <P>The report was circulated as a discussion document to interested parties who were invited to comment on the report's recommendations and on the development of a personal assistance service by the end of February this year. These comments have now been received and are being examined by my Department in conjunction with a cost benefit analysis of personal assistance services which was independently commissioned by my Department.  This cost benefit analysis is essential from the point of view of considering the cost of establishing such a service and the equity of providing a high cost total independence service for a relatively small number of people against the benefits of providing other less costly supports to a far greater number of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have asked officials in my Department to discuss the case raised by the Deputy with the health board concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter, which is of extreme importance to my constituency.  At present, there are 222 pupils at St. Brigid's national school, Convoy, with eight classes in five classrooms.  Since 1978, parents, pupils and teachers of the school have been awaiting an extension to the school. Unfortunately they have encountered set back after set back.</P>
      <P>The project went to tender in 1986 but did not proceed any further.  In May 1995 we were delighted that the Minister sanctioned the extension once more.  However, the project has fallen once more when it was almost at the last hurdle.  The school is awaiting sanction from the Department to provide funding for the proposed extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> My real concern is for the safety of the pupils and teachers.  When the Drumkeen national school was being built, a prefabricated building was taken to Convoy to try to alleviate overcrowding. This prefab is dangerous.  It is a fire hazard and there is also a problem with rodents.  The remedial class is being taught in the cloakroom and senior pupils do not have any cloakroom facilities. The nine members of staff have nowhere to go.  There was a general purposes or assembly room, but that is also being used as a classroom.  There is a chronic problem and the extension which has been sanctioned will be totally inadequate because Donegal County Concil intends to build 40 new family houses in Convoy.  If there are two children in each house, another school will almost be required.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter.  I realise there are constraints on the Minister's budget but the funding made available to County Donegal through the primary building programme has been paltry. The need is perhaps not as great as in other counties, but one of the schools in greatest need is St. Brigid's national school in Convoy.  Given that people have been disappointed since 1978, it is time they received what they deserve. An extension is urgently required and the people need the Department to sanction the funding immediately, otherwise costs will increase &mdash; the needs have already increased &mdash; and we will be left with nothing.  People in the area have put money into an account to provide the local contribution and their donations, commitment and tolerance should be rewarded.  I ask the Minister to sanction the tendering process immediately.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department's position in relation to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Brigid's national school, Convoy, County Donegal.  This has been a problem for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> I am aware that the school has a staffing level of seven assistant teachers in addition to the principal along with a shared remedial teacher.  The current accommodation consists of five permanent classrooms, a general purposes room divided for use as two classrooms, plus a prefab which is reported to be in poor condition.  I appreciate that the accommodation available is less than satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the school's accommodation needs, a building project at this school was included in a phased national building programme for 1995.  I am pleased that this project has progressed through the various planning stages.  However, I am not in a position to indicate when the project is likely to commence.</P>
    <P>This project is reviewed on an ongoing basis against a set of objective criteria and a priority listing which governs the order in which projects proceed. Due to the current level of contractual commitments on the primary building programme, it is not possible for me to state at this point when funds will be available to allow the proposed extension to St. Brigid's national school to proceed to tender.  A decision on the timing of the tender process will be taken later in the year in the light of expenditure on existing contractual commitments and the financial resources available.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department appreciates the concerns expressed by the school authorities, the parents and the Deputy in relation to the need for improved accommodation at St. Brigid's.  Every effort will be made to ensure that this project proceeds to construction at the earliest opportunity. I again thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to outline the current position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to make an issue of it, but it is unfortunate that the Department of Enterprise and Employment is taking this matter because this issue is primarily, although not exclusively, a matter for the Department of Finance.  A special unit in that Department is handling Border funding generally. This is a matter which I have been pursuing relentlessly for months with the Department of Finance with a view to getting a certain portion of the money from the Border peace fund allocated specifically for industrial site development in all southern Border counties.</P>
      <P>I represent the constituency of Louth, but I will take the risk of representing the interests of other Border counties.  There is an immediate and serious need to have resources made available for industrial site acquisition and development and promotion of the area. When we have the opportunity to reflect in five years' time, will there be tangible evidence that peace money was spent in the southern Border counties in 1996?  I will be pleased if we can look back and say that money was invested wisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the proposed expenditure areas for the money in the programme as set out.  It states that the money will be spent by ADM, the area management agency and Combat Poverty. Both are worthy bodies but Border counties need industrial infrastructure as a matter of priority.  In places like Ardee, Drogheda and Dundalk there is <Col N="1161" /> a serious deficiency in that regard.  From inquiries I have made, resources are not available within the IDA's budget to make any progress in the locations I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister &mdash; this is not political &mdash; to ask his Department to liaise with the special unit in the Department of Finance, which has responsibility for the expenditure of this peace money, to get a percentage of the money earmarked for industrial development in the southern Border counties.  It is estimated that approximately £9 million is needed for the job and the sooner the money is earmarked the better.  I appeal to the Minister to give this serious and immediate consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the seriousness of the matter raised by Deputy Kirk.  I would have been happy if the Department of Finance had dealt with it.  I will look at the character of Deputy Kirk's remarks, which seem to be focused more on my Department, which is probably the reason it was sent to the Department of Enterprise and Employment. The matter relates to infrastructure in terms of the provision of industrial units on the southern side of the Border.</P>
      <P>The Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties contains a range of measures designed to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable society and promote reconciliation by increasing economic development and employment, promoting urban and rural regeneration, developing cross-Border co-operation, and extending social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall responsibility for management of the programme in the Irish Border counties resides with the Department of Finance.  However, funding under the various measures was made on the basis of weightings made by an EU Commission Task Force which consulted widely in the target area to <Col N="1162" /> ensure that the programme addressed the real needs of the people and communities in those areas most affected by the conflict in the North.  Particular emphasis was, therefore, given to measures which promote social inclusion.  This theme extends across all the measures and there is also a specific social inclusion sub-programme which accounts for 30 per cent of total available funds.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of measures in the programme which contribute more directly to economic development, particularly sub-programme 5 which aims to assist productive investment.  Measures under this sub-programme include: investment promotion, which involves an interest rate subsidy; new industrial development services; and trade development.</P>
    <P>The first is administered by the commercial banks and there may be some scope under this measure for interest rate subsidies for developers of industrial properties as well as for promoters of industrial projects.  The second measure is geared towards more direct financial support for small and medium sized firms.  The allocation under the measure is £2 million, so the scope is obviously limited.  Any decision on a refocusing or reallocation of funding to increase the amount available under this measure can only be made with the approval of the programme's joint monitoring committee, which includes EU representatives as well as representatives of relevant Government Departments and implementing agencies.</P>
    <P>In normal circumstances, such reallocation of funding would only occur as a consequence of the failure of particular measures to use up their allocation. Account would probably also have to be taken of the extent to which the objectives of a particular measure are already supported under other EU financed programmes.  In terms of industrial development, the EU, through the Structural Funds, also supports a number of major programmes which apply throughout the Border region, including <Col N="1163" /> the <i>Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-99 and the Local, Urban and Rural Development Programme, 1994-99</i> under which county enterprise partnership boards are supported.  The EU also supports the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that considerable investment has taken place in infra-structural services in the Border region under INTERREG.  Out of a total of £96 million available to the Irish Border counties, £36 million has been specifically earmarked to support the Department of the Environment in the areas of roads, water and sewerage works.  The improvement of such basic infrastructure is a pre-requisite to the expansion of industrial development in the Border counties, as industrialists are most likely to choose to locate in areas where good infrastructural facilities exist.</P>
    <P>I understand, however, that discussions have been taking place between interested parties, including IDA Ireland, Forbairt, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, and Oireachtas Members from the Border counties, on the possibility of accessing additional funds under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation for the provision of suitable industrial infrastructure which would include the provision of industrial sites and advance factory buildings.  I also understood that the IDA met the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, in the context of his overall responsibility for the overseeing and co-ordination of all funding for the Border counties, and that the matter is currently under active consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Alternative farm enterprise is something which has often been discussed and which will need to be discussed in future given the trend in farming.  With the change in farming patterns over the past number of years where dairy cows, pigs and poulty were put into intensive units, there was a need for alternative farm enterprises.  I suppose we could say that we have not been successful to date as regards the choice of enterprises.  However, I am not critical of the Department because it is a case of never venture, never win.</P>
      <P>Rabbits were one of the first alternative farm enterprises which came on stream.  I was very involved in that because there was a good return for breeding stock.  A processing plant was set up in my constituency which was heavily grant-aided, but it was not commercially viable.  A person who had spent all his life in the poultry business said to me that rabbit production would never be a commercial enterprise and he was right.  Such ventures and projects should have received more in-depth examination.  The same applies to deer farming where people made substantial outlays.  There is a substantial number of deer farms in County Monaghan which enjoyed good returns when breeding stock was being developed. However, it is doubtful if they will remain commercially viable.  Due to the size of the outlay involved, the Department should provide assistance in the form of headage payments or in some other way to people experiencing hardship.</P>
      <P>I was concerned last week when a Deputy on the Government side used the trouble being experienced by the people to whom I referred to criticise a person who did much for agriculture and politics in the past.  The Deputy attempted to use the person in question who has now left the political scene, as a scapegoat in this case.  However, it did not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past number of months Teagasc published a booklet by Tony Leavy entitled <i>The Rural Economy.</i> Mr. Leavy and his associates produced a <Col N="1165" /> report which listed a number of alternative farm enterprises including forestry on marginal land and the propagation of intensive crops such as seed potatoes, tree nurseries and soft fruit on good agricultural land.  The Minister of State should encourage the Department to begin a serious investigation into this area.  In recent years I promoted seed potatoes and soft fruit and the Department should examine the viability of such crops because there could be an outlet for them in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leavy's book also stated that 50 per cent of farms in the west are at risk unless an on-farm system is introduced. In America, the agricultural authorities launched a campaign to promote potatoes as a quality health food.  Such action helped the economy and provided massive employment in the fast food industry.  A great opportunity exists in Ireland for the propagation of new and seed potatoes.</P>
    <P>A good opportunity also exists to grow soft fruits due to the development of plastic tunnels, etc. and create job opportunities in this area, particularly when it is considered that these fruits are required for the manufacture of yoghurts.  The Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and Forestry have engaged in promoting fruit and vegetables because Ireland is the lowest consumer of such foodstuffs in the EU. I ask the Minister of State to examine these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Deputy Leonard.  Due to time constraints, I will deal only with the question of deer farming.  I share people's concerns that many deer farmers have discovered that their enterprise is viably suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to take two initiatives.  He might use the economic unit in Teagasc to investigate deer farming in Ireland and take appropriate action to ensure that deer farmers do not face financial ruin.  For example, support could be provided by way of headage payments or some other action. Those involved in deer farming entered <Col N="1166" /> the industry on Government advice that people should consider alternative enterprise.  Many entrepreneurs who became involved in deer farming have now discovered that it is not viable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Leonard and O'Hanlon for raising this issue.  In response to Deputy Leonard's request for the inclusion of soft fruits and seed potatoes under the alternative enterprise scheme, I must inform him that this matter is being successfully dealt with by An Bord Glas.  I agree there is very good potential in both areas.  Ireland is almost self-sufficient with regard to potatoes following two bumper harvests in recent years.  We are also producing many seed potatoes.  A number of years ago we imported ware potatoes whereas we now export them. We have also cut down on the importation of seed potatoes and the advent of brown rot disease will probably encourage Irish farmers to produce their own. At present, An Bord Glas is providing assistance to people involved in those areas.  Last year the soft fruit industry enjoyed a very good season.</P>
      <P>There are a number of deer farming enterprises in County Kerry and I agree with Deputy O'Hanlon that deer farmers face a challenging and difficult time. The Department is currently examining the possibility of extending the headage grant system to cover deer farmers to provide some assistance.  A decision has not been made but I will pursue the matter because I share the Deputy's concern in this regard.  Many deer farmers face financial ruin because the situation is so bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of alternative farm enterprises is part of the response to the reforms of CAP and GATT.  Under the <i>Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99</i>, my Department operates a number of schemes which encourage farmers and other rural dwellers to develop non-EU quota controlled enterprises.  These <Col N="1167" /> include the alternative enterprise, agri tourism and organic farming schemes.</P>
    <P>The alternative enterprise scheme was launched in December 1994, and follows a similar scheme which operated from 1989 to 1993.  It applies mainly to investments in sport horses, deer, greyhounds and other non-EU quota species including rabbits and goats.  The development of these alternative enterprises are of relatively recent origin. For example, the total Exchequer expenditure in the 1989-93 programme amounted to only £11 million compared with planned Exchequer expenditure of £22 million under the current programme.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been remarkably successful to date.  Some 3,600 applications have been received of which approvals issued in respect of some 1,900.  This represents an overall total investment of £15 million and a grant commitment of £7.2 million.  The main sectors of investment have been deer and sport horses. The development of agri-tourism has been a feature of alternative enterprise in recent years and will continue to be one of the significant features of farm development in the future.  Under the current OPARDF a new agri-tourism scheme was launched in March 1995. Since then, some 105 projects have been approved representing a total investment of around £5 million with a grant commitment of some £2.4 million.</P>
    <P>Aid is also available for the development of organic farming.  Some £1 million will be available up to 1998 to aid (i)  grading, packing and distribution of organic produce and (ii)  recognised bodies, including Bord Glas and An Bord Bia, in the marketing and promotion of organic bodies.  In 1995 there were 370 registered organic growers and <Col N="1168" /> the target is 600 by 1999.  Indeed this target is likely to be exceeded because of the extra incentive available under rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS.  This dovetailing of different schemes has the desirable result of increasing the effectiveness of both schemes.</P>
    <P>Other measures under the OPARDF and the CAP reform accompanying measures, including farm afforestation, are also making a significant contribution to farm diversification and the underpinning of agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>As with any commercial development, difficulties have been experienced in the development of a number of sectors, in particular in the rabbit and deer sectors.  Both sectors were mentioned by Deputies.  In the rabbit sector the downturn in export demand was the major problem.</P>
    <P>The development of deer enterprises was initially led by breeders, supported under the alternative enterprise scheme. It is essential, therefore, that this sector develop and market venison.  In this regard assistance has been available to producer groups.</P>
    <P>The various schemes promoting diversification are kept under constant review by my Department.  Furthermore, the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry provides for a mid-term review of the operational programme and at individual measure and sub-measure levels. This review will be held in the second half of this year.  A detailed review of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the various schemes contributing to farm diversification will be part of this process.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 April 1996.</P>

      <P>The consultants employed by the Efficiency Audit Group to carry out a review of the Defence Forces commented favourably on the extent to which conventional military skills have been retained within the system and the high standard in officer training and technical training at individual level. However, the consultants found that the standard of collective training was inadequate, due mainly to the existence of a multiplicity of small sized units and the widespread geographic dispersal of these units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for improved levels of training in the Defence Forces is addressed in the implementation plan for the next three years which was recently approved by the Government.  The main elements of the plan which will enhance the training capacity of the Defence Forces are a revised organisational structure for the Permanent Defence Force comprising a smaller number of operational units each with increased strengths; a reduction in the number of headquarters units; a reduction in the number of military personnel involved in purely administrative duties; and the establishment of a Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh camp <Col N="913" /> which will have a wide ranging responsibility for the education and training of all ranks.</P>

      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance the the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Naval Service currently has a total of seven vessels which are deployed in the most efficient manner on fishery protection duties having regard to current and predicted fishing patterns.  The Naval Service fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>In 1996 to date, the Naval Service has recorded a total of 747 sightings of fishing vessels, including sightings of vessels in the southern seaboard, of which 279 were boarded.  Of the 279 fishing vessels boarded, 15 were subsequently detained for alleged breaches of fisheries legislation. The Air Corps have carried out 118 aerial fishery patrols since the beginning of the year.  These patrols are co-ordinated with the Naval Service patrols and sightings made by the CASA aircraft are passed to the Naval Service vessels on patrol for whatever action is considered necessary.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importantion of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.

    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such requests.  Recent Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a joint task force involving the Garda, the customs service and the Naval Service, will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, will also increase the role and effectiveness of <Col N="915" /> the Naval Service in this area.  The question of whether additional resources are required will be kept under review as these measures are implemented.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The voluntary early retirement VER scheme for the Permanent Defence Force was launched on Monday last, 22 April 1996, and applications will be accepted from 29 April 1996.  The scheme will close not later than 7 June 1996.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am not yet in a position to state the number of applications.  I understand that there is a considerable degree of interest in the VER scheme among certain personnel.  The terms of the schemes are commensurate with those offered in other areas of the public service, having regard to the unique features of the Defence Forces superannuation arrangements.  Taken in the context of the military sphere, where there is an entitlement at a relatively early stage in one's career to a pension and gratuity, I believe that the enhanced benefits will be sufficiently attractive to achieve the objectives of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> A board has been established to evalauate all applications for VER.  In considering these, it will apply the following criteria: skill requirements of the Defence Forces; age of the applicant; organisational requirements of the new Defence Forces structures; continued viability of PDF units; and exit and replacement costs.</P>
    <P>The scheme is completely voluntary. Similarly there is no onus on the Defence Forces to offer early retirement to anyone whose retirement is not considered in the best interests of the organisation.  However, an appeals mechanism is available for those applicants rejected by the board.</P>
    <P>The scheme is flexible in that it caters both for personnel who may wish to leave immediately, and those who wish to stay on and avail of the full range of support services.  This decision is at the discretion of the applicant.  Exit dates will be notified as soon as possible and will be determined having regard to the applicant's leave entitlements and the degree of pre-retirement support he or she requests.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive information booklet giving details on voluntary early retirement has been made available to all PDF personnel eligible for the scheme.</P>

      <P>The criteria for the use of Air Corps aircraft, both fixed wing and rotary, for the transport of Ministers on internal and external flights, have been set down by successive Governments over the years and are regarded as satisfactory.  The use of Air Corps aircraft for ministerial transport takes into account many <Col N="917" /> factors such as the priority of Minister's engagements, the demands of Minister's schedules and the availability and suitability of other travel arrangements. Transport arrangements following ministerial air transport flights are matters for the relevant Ministers.</P>

      <P>Apart from their peacekeeping duties of monitoring, patrolling and reassuring the local population the Irish battalion personnel have provided the following humanitarian assistance to civilians in the Irish area of operations and in the wider UNIFIL area: shelter in Irish positions for as many as 1,000 persons at a given time &mdash; the number of civilians seeking shelter fluctuates with the prevailing security situation; the transport of civilians to Tibnin hospital; medicines, fuel and bedding have been distributed to those most in need; and Irish officers have led humanitarian convoys in areas outside the Irish battalion area of operations.</P>
      <P>I want to draw particular attention to the role of the Irish UN troops in providing humanitarian assistance to the local population following the Israeli attack on Qana.

    <P>The Tánaiste has made available the sum of £200,000 to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the civilian population in the Lebanon affected by the <Col N="918" /> bombing.  Of this, £75,000 will be allocated to the Irish battalion to enable them to expand their emergency assistance. This money is in addition to the humanitarian grant which is administered by the Irish battalion on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The amount of that grant is currently £40,000 per annum &mdash; £20,000 per battalion.</P>

      <P>Discipline in the Defence Forces is governed by the provisions of Part V of the Defence Act, 1954 as amended and regulations and rules made thereunder. <Col N="922" /> As the provisions are very extensive it is difficult to go into detail on the matter. Notwithstanding this, essentially the procedure is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When a charge is preferred for an alleged offence against military law the charge is normally investigated by the accused's commanding officer who can:&mdash; (1) dismiss the charge, or (2) remand the accused for trial by court-martial, or (3) subject to certain exceptions deal with the case summarily.  In such circumstances the range of punishments are limited.</P>
      <P>A court-martial is a court of law.  Its procedures are not unlike those followed in the civil courts.  A person tried by court-martial can be represented by an officer of the Defence Forces, or by a civilian solicitor or barrister-at law.  A right of appeal lies to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court which is composed of one Supreme Court judge and two High Court judges.  The Appeal Court has power to affirm or reverse the conviction in whole or in part and to remit, reduce or increase the sentence.  There is also provision for petitioning against sentence to the adjutant-general of the Defence Forces and to the Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>The number of trials by courts-martial for the past five years are as follows: &mdash; 1995 &mdash; 24; 1994 &mdash; 23; 1993 &mdash; 24; 1992 &mdash; 41; 1991 &mdash; 45.  Apart from appeals and petitions in connection with courts-martial, flexibility in addressing grievances is available under Section 114, Part IV of the Defence Act, 1954 which provides for a redress of wrongs system for every member of the Defence Forces who thinks himself wronged in any matter.</P>
      <P>In the case of an officer who thinks himself wronged he may complain to his commanding officer and if he is dissatisfied with the response of his commanding officer he may complain to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a non-commissioned officer or private who thinks himself wronged he may complain in the first instance to his company commander.  If he is dissatisfied with the response of his <Col N="923" /> company commander he may complain to his commanding officer.  If he is dissatisfied with his response he may complain to the adjutant general who, if so required by the NCO or private concerned, shall report on the matter to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the work of the sub-committee of the Conciliation Council established in 1992 to examine the grievance procedures has now been finalised and new procedures have been agreed with the representative bodies of the Permanent Defence Forces.  The new procedures, which include the appointment of a grievance officer, are due to be introduced shortly.  In addition to improved procedures for dealing with complaints under section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954, they provide, subject to stated exceptions, for the submission of complaints other than those coming within the scope of section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954.  Time guidelines for dealing with complaints have been introduced to ensure resolution of complaints without delay.  Complaints requiring expeditious decisions e.g. eligibility for promotion competitions, may be certified as urgent and will be dealt with as quickly as possible by all concerned.  I am confident that the implementation of the agreed new improved procedures will result in more flexibility and efficiency in dealing with complaints.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking foreign weapons suppliers and manufacturers comprise or are part of extensive commercial organisations in that field.  Within such organisations particular units or subsidiaries may be involved with the manufacture of landmines but my Department has little information in the matter as such equipment is not normally purchased for the Defence Forces.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's concern about the shipments of nuclear fuel and plutonium through the Irish Sea.  Such shipments are governed by the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation code on the safe carriage of irradiated nuclear fuels known as the INF code.  I consider the INF code to be deficient in a number of very important respects and I wish to inform the Deputy and the House of the steps which I am undertaking to have them changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuclear materials &mdash; the most lethal of all cargoes &mdash; are, at present, effectively exempt from the normal rules governing dangerous cargoes.  Many of the basic requirements for dangerous cargoes are noticeably absent from the INF code.  There is no requirement to plan the route or to notify coastal states; no requirement to carry out hazard evaluations of the materials being transported and of the flasks in which they are contained; there are inadequate arrangements in the event of accident for emergency response, for recovery of materials lost or sunk or for liability regime for compensation and salvage. At the International Maritime Organisation's assembly in London last November, my colleague at the Department, the Minister of State Deputy Gilmore, secured agreement from representatives of the 152 countries in the IMO to adopt Ireland's resolution governing the shipment of nuclear materials and to strengthen the INF code.  Ireland's resolution seeks to address the deficiencies in the INF code.  The resolution instructs the IMO's Marine Safety Committee and the Marine Environment Protection Committee to consider extending the INF code to include the following: route planning; notification to the coastal state; marking of flasks; protection and salvage plans in the event of emergencies; the designation of <Col N="926" /> sensitive areas in which nuclear shipments must take place.</P>
    <P>The deputy chief surveyor of the Department's marine survey office represents Ireland on both the MSC and the MEPC.  These committees have been instructed to thoroughly examine Ireland's proposal and to report to the next assembly of the IMO next year with recommendations as to how the INF code should be strengthened.  I am confident that procedures to strengthen the code will have been considered and prepared in time for the next IMO assembly.</P>
    <P>In view of the concerns expressed by Ireland and supported by other IMO countries a special consultative meeting to discuss the code, in advance of consideration of it by the MSC and the MEPC, was called by the secretary general of the IMO last month.  Ireland was represented at this meeting by the deputy chief surveyor of the Department of the Marine and the assistant chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Ireland made a detailed presentation at the meeting calling on the code to be strengthened.  There was considerable support for Ireland's position.  The MSC and the MEPC will take on board the views expressed at this meeting when preparing their recommendations for the strengthening of the code.  On 13 September, 1995 an EU Directive concerning reporting arrangements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods (HAZMAT) came into force. Ireland has requested the EU Commission to expand the definition of &ldquo;Dangerous Goods&rdquo; to include substances coming under the INF code.  The EU Commission indicated that it is positively disposed towards finding a suitable mechanism to take account of Ireland's concerns.  We intend to progress this matter further at the forthcoming HAZMAT committee meeting in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will continue to pursue every avenue to ensure that a tough new code governing the <Col N="927" /> shipment of nuclear materials is put in place.</P>

      <Quest>the number of flagship landings of fish into Ireland for 1996; the total tonnage of fish landed; its value; and the percentage of these landings which were verified by Irish fishery officers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date this year 52 flagships have landed fish into Irish ports on 147 occasions.  Landings have amounted to 1,372 tonnes of fish, valued at around IR£2 million.  Approximately 75 per cent of flagship landings to date were verified by the Department's sea fishery officers through random spot checks carried out by day and night.</P>
      <P>None of the landings by flagships inspected on the quayside was found to be in breach of EU fishing rules.  This reflects the high level of inspection and control we impose and which vessels have come to expect when they land their catches here.  The job of policing and enforcing compliance with conservtion regulations is obviously made easier when these vessels do land into Irish ports.</P>
      <P>More often than not however they land elsewhere and we then have to rely on other member states to enforce the law.  In addition to land based inspections the Irish fishery protection services also closely monitor flagship activity at sea.  The Naval Service detains all vessels suspected of being in breach of fishing regulations and prosecutions follow in every appropriate case.  We are continuing to press for much closer scrutiny by other member states of fishing activity of flagships at sea and on landings into their ports.  I am concerned about the flagship problem from a number of perspectives and I am glad to have this opportunity to share those concerns with Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 150 flagships, or so called quota <Col N="928" /> hoppers, operate in EU waters.  Most of them are registered in the UK.  There are 12 on the Irish register and some registered in France and Germany. They fish against the national quotas of the state in which they are registered. They are owned or partly owned elsewhere and mainly land their catch abroad which, as I have outlined, imposes particular enforcement problems.</P>
    <P>My immediate priority therefore is to ensure that the activities of flagvessels are adequately controlled.  I am however more broadly concerned about the inconsistency underlying the quota regime of the Common Fisheries Policy which allows flagships to benefit from national quotas without providing real economic benefits for the fishing communities of the flag state.  This is because the eligibility for quotas and their administration by member states has to take full account of general Treaty provisions on right of establishment and freedom of movement.  I have raised these concerns with the Commission as indeed has my UK colleague, Minister Baldry.  We will be working together with likeminded member states on the complex and difficult issues involved to see whether, in the longer term, changes are possible.  European fish stocks are under severe pressure and national fishing industries are faced with the prospect of further fleet cuts to address the overcapacity problem in the EU fleet as a whole.  The flagships issue has to be recognised as one of the demensions of the overall problem and, as I stressed at the Fisheries Council last Monday, it must be taken into account in the search for equitable and realistic solutions to secure the future viability of fish stocks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>Some 60 fishing vessel owners have applied for decommissioning premia under the national scheme established last year.  The applications represent a total capacity of nearly 3,000 tonnes, and a good take up will assist in the achievement of our mandatory EU fleet targets by end 1996.</P>
      <P>Even allowing for the relatively buoyant market for privately sold tonnage at present, it is expected that actual take up by approved applicants under the scheme will be largely in line with targets. The position will continue to be kept under close review by the Department and BIM up to the 31 May deadline for the actual decommissioning of boats and payment of grants.</P>
      <P>The differential tonnage premia set under the scheme are in line with EU Regulation 3699/93 which requires member states to apply <i>pro rata</i> scales and rates of assistance which take into account the age of vessels.  In deciding on the national rates account was also taken of available funding and of the relative market value of vessels in the various age categories.</P>
      <P>While other EU member states may have operated different types of decommissioning schemes, such as the tendering scheme operated in Northern Ireland, the grants paid may vary between member states provided they remain within the ceiling and reflect the age differentials prescribed in the EU regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Spanish market is a vitally important outlet for Irish fish exports. Over 14,000 tonnes of fish worth over £32 million were exported to Spain in 1995.  Consequently any factors which adversely affect prices in this market are of concern.</P>
      <P>Since 1993 the Spanish peseta has devalued by some 7 per cent against the Irish pound with particularly large short-term fluctuations in early 1995. Over the same period the average value per kilogram of Irish fish exports to Spain has fallen by just over 11 per cent. The exchange rate fluctuations have doubtless contributed to this decline. However there have been other factors at work also, including recession in Spain, the quality of fish landed, competition from non-EU countries and supply-demand problems.</P>
      <P>Imbalances in supply and demand recur frequently on the European whitefish market which is notoriously volatile.  The European market overall between January and March of this year was very difficult for the whitefish sector although there has been a welcome improvement in prices over recent weeks.  In that context, I underlined to colleagues at the Fisheries Council last Monday the importance of taking prevailing market conditions into account when agreeing annual tariff rates for fish imports from outside the EU.  The right balance must be struck to safeguard the interests of Community fishermen while meeting consumer and processing industry demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> Exchange rates and other factors affecting fish prices on the Spanish market, and export markets generally, will continue to be closely monitored by my Department and BIM in consultation with the Department of Tourism and Trade.  Exporters will doubtless continue to deploy available means of hedging their business against currency and market risks.  I am advised, however, that no special aid measures to compensate Irish exporters for the peseta exchange rate are planned.  While a source of difficulty the situation is not considered comparable to the sterling crisis of 1992 which was unique in its severity and impact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in reply to his question of 1 February, it is very difficult to obtain proof as to where undersize fish or indeed any fish placed on the market have been caught.  For that reason it is of primary importance that the authorities in member states act firmly and expeditiously to enforce conservation provisions.</P>
      <P>In this regard the role of the Commission inspectorate is critical in ensuring that member states maintain strict observance of EU regulations and I will continue to press for Commission inspections to be undertaken in key geographical areas of concern.</P>
      <P>Contacts have also been initiated with the Spanish ministry at official level with a view to regular high level liaison on this and other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, from 1 January 1998 vessels will be required, when entering and exiting Irish waters, to report the nature and volume of <Col N="932" /> catches.  This will afford the opportunity to systematically check, as vessels exit Irish waters, the volume of fish of each species and whether EU regulations in relation to minimum fish sizes have been complied with.</P>
    <P>To this end the protection service will be deployed to monitor the accuracy of such information and where serious discrepancies are detected, detain the offending vessels.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 42 together.  Since May 1992, a programme has been in place to sample sea trout from rivers known to be affected by the sea trout decline and rivers where populations have not declined in order to determine the levels of infestation of sea lice in sea trout populations.</P>
      <P>The latest sampling programme was undertaken in May and June, 1995 and, as in previous years, was designed to capture sea trout smolts returning to freshwater during that period.  A total of 635 fish were captured at 41 locations around the coast.  The samples were analysed by Dr. O. Tully, Zoology Department, Trinity College Dublin and a report furnished to the sea trout working group in September 1995.  The working group analyses, and draws conclusions from, the data emanating from the sea trout sampling programme and other scientific research and monitoring and reports to the Minister annually.</P>
      <P>The latest report on sea lice infestation of sea trout was also made available to the sea trout monitoring and advisory group which was established to monitor, assess and co-ordinate the implementation of the 1994 report of the sea trout task force, to monitor the results of inspections, research findings and other circumstances affecting sea trout stocks and to make appropriate recommendations to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The sea trout monitoring and advisory group's second report, which was presented to me recently, recommended, among other matters, that the existing sea trout sampling programme be revised in order to provide for more intensive sampling of certain rivers and to make certain samples available for histological, bacteriological and virological examination.  I have endorsed in full the recommendations of the group and have directed the appropriate agencies to ensure that the revised sea trout sampling programme will be put in place this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> I have been assured by the relevant agencies that the revised sea trout sampling programme will be implemented this year in accordance with the timetable and schedule which applied in previous years and that the results will be made available as quickly as possible in order to enable prompt and effective stock conservation measures to be taken if required.</P>

      <P>I am aware that many of the vessels in the Spanish fishing fleet which fish in our waters have been previously convicted of fishery offences.  However, it is also the case that vessels from other member states which fish in our waters, and indeed some of our own fleet, also have previous convictions.</P>
      <P>As I have outlined to this House on many occasions before, Ireland has strict controls in place to ensure that all vessels operating in Irish waters comply fully with EU fishing regulations.  The fisheries protection services detain all vessels suspected of being in breach of fishing regulations and prosecutions follow in every appropriate case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalties under Irish law for fishery infringements are among the toughest in Europe, and reflect our resolution to safeguard fish stocks and eliminate illegal fishing activity in our waters. Since 1994, a regime of hefty fines and <Col N="936" /> confiscations of nets, catch and boats has been available to Irish courts.  Vessels which repeatedly commit offences are subject to severe penalties, which may include confiscation.</P>
    <P>Our control and enforcement regime and the related penalties are paying dividends.  This is reflected by the fact that while boardings have increased, proportionately, the number of vessels detained has declined.  This clearly demonstrates that more and more fishermen are coming to the conclusion that illegal fishing is no longer worth the risk.</P>

Following completion of public notice procedures under the Foreshore Act, 1993 by one applicant, a number of objections and representations were lodged with the Department.  These are currently being assessed by the Department together with a number of other applications which will also be subject to full public notice procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have visited the area and met with a range of local fishery interests in relation to this and other aquaculture developments within the Waterford Harbour area at the Deputy's request.

    <P>At that meeting the shellfish industry's code of practice, a working document on best practices employed by oyster farmers around the Irish coastline, was explained as was the licensing process.

The Department and BIM remain available to provide any additional information which the residents may require.</P>

The entry-exit data when combined with the data coming from the Air Corps CASA patrols will result in a more focused and cost effective deployment of naval patrol vessels.</P>
    <P>Further Community controls will apply from the end of 1997 in the form of a catch reporting system which will require vessels to transmit details of the quantities and species of fish on board when they enter and exit our waters.  In the light of these ongoing developments, I am satisfied that Ireland's protection capability will be able to cope with the task of enforcing fishing regulations and that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure the protection of the fish stocks in our waters.</P>

      <P>The Marine Institute, with 75 per cent funding from the European Regional Development fund, is purchasing a new research vessel to replace the research vessel <i>Lough Beltra</i> which is nearing the end of its useful life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following advertising in the national press, trade journals and the Official <Col N="939" /> Journal of the European Union in September and October, 1995, seven shipyards submitted tenders based on the specification and plan prepared by the Marine Institute.  Two of these were Irish.</P>
    <P>The tender documentation provided that the contact would be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender with regard to the following: demonstrable relevant experience and technical merit; price quoted and value for money; awarding authority inspection of financial records and at its option the furnishing by the supplier of a performance guarantee; compliance with appropriate national and EU tax clearance procedures and period for completion.</P>
    <P>In the view of a technical evaluation committee set up by the Marine Institute to consider the tenders received, the tender from Scheepswerf Visser, B.V., Den Helder, Holland, best fitted these criteria.  In particular, the Dutch tender was the lowest and had the shortest period of completion.  The Marine Institute Board accordingly recommended that the contract be awarded to Scheepswerf Visser B.V.</P>
    <P>The tenders from the Irish yards were at least 25 per cent dearer than the tender from Scheepswerf Visser and they could not be considered to offer best value for money on the basis of the published award criteria.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that in relation to the above table that offences may have occurred in the year previous to that in which fines were imposed and a number of cases relating to alleged fishing offences for 1994 and 1995 are still <i>sub judice</i> and the outcome of these cases may affect the figures for those years.</P>
    <P>It is evident from these figures that our investment in enhanced surveillance capability has led to higher levels of compliance.  This is reflected by the fact that while boardings have increased, proportionately, the number of vessels detained has declined.  This clearly demonstrates that more and more fishermen are coming to the conclusion that breaking the law is no longer worth the risk.</P>

      <P>My predecessor negotiated a total funding package of £18.6 million (1994 prices) for the development of port <Col N="941" /> infrastructure and facilities as part of the £144 million Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99.  This figure of £18.6 million is being invested in three areas: £8.38 million will be invested in capital development works at strategically important fishery harbours and aquaculture landing places, £7.46 million in harbour development in Gaeltacht regions and a further £2.76 million in the further development of the national ice plant network.</P>
      <P>The development of the sea fishing and aquaculture industries is a key element in the Government's strategy for expansion of the Irish economy and in particular the expansion of economic activity in the peripheral western regions.  The provision of adequate fishery harbour infrastructure is an important element of that strategy.  With the assistance of the European Regional Development Fund over the 1989-93 period, some progress was made in the development of Irish fishery harbour infrastructure.  However, significant investment is still required to put the necessary harbour infrastructure in place to service our important sea fishing and aquaculture industries.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present funding levels are not sufficient to address these infrastructural needs and it is my intention to vigorously pursue additional funding for this area, particularly in the context of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have consulted the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL), who have statutory responsibility for the provision of aids <Col N="942" /> to navigation around the coast of Ireland, regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>I understand that there has over the years been a number of reported incidents of vessels experiencing similar difficulties in distinguishing the entrance to Waterford Estuary from Tramore Bay. An investigation of the problem by CIL identified the similarity of the radar response from Hook Head and Browstown Head as a significant factor.  To address this CIL installed a Racon on Hook Head on November 1974.  The current Hook Racon has a range of 10 nautical miles and would appear on a radar screen as a plume, indicating the morse letter K at the lighthouse.  This has the effect of making Hook very distinctive to radar observers.  This aid would have particular importance by day and in poor visibility when the light may not be visible.</P>
      <P>Hook Head light had a nominal range of 23 nautical miles and this is considered more than adequate for vessels approaching Waterford Estuary.  A fog signal is also provided at Hook Head.  In addition, the red sector Dunmore East Lighthouse had a nominal range of 13 nautical miles, which will provide confirmation of a vessel's position.</P>
      <P>In light of recent occurrences the matter had been further reviewed by CIL, who have concluded that the extensive range of aids to navigation provided are sufficient for marking the entrance to Waterford Estuary for all types of craft. I have asked my Department, however, to consider means by which vessels intending to enter Waterford Estuary will be alerted to the importance of availing of the aids to navigation in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This reply refers to Sub-programme 2 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, the discretionary grants scheme for local development, grants in support of Communicating Europe, grants in respect of western and island development, and grants in respect of the famine commemoration.</P>
      <P>Regarding 1.  Integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas &mdash; the Department of the Taoiseach has overall co-ordinating responsibility for the operational programme for local urban and rural development, 1994-1999.  Grant approval and allocation under sub-programme 1, local enterprise and sub-programme 3, urban and village renewal are the responsibility of the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and the Environment, respectively.</P>
      <P>Sub-programme 2 &mdash; integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas, is administered on behalf of the EU Commission and the Department of the Taoiseach and by an independent intermediary, area development management (ADM) Ltd. The principal objective of Sub-programme 2 is to counter disadvantage through support for communities who make a collective effort to maximise the development potential of their areas, which are capable of a sustained effort to implement a plan and which have committed an appropriate level of local resources, broadly defined, to that process.</P>
      <P>Three categories of communities and groups are eligible for support under this sub-programme for which the total amount of funding available up to 1999 is £110 million.  Regarding partnerships in designated disadvantaged areas, 38 areas have been designated &mdash; (£85 million), Communities in other areas&mdash; (up to £22 million), and other organisations representing or working on behalf of travellers and selected organisations with the capacity to make a significant contribution to the sub-programme's objective &mdash; £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> 2. Discretionary grant scheme for local development&mdash;the nature of this grant scheme is the disbursement of funds to groups who are capable of making a significant contribution to local development.  The following criteria apply in relation to these grants: level of disadvantage in the areas; that the project is not elibible for support under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development or, being eligible, had not actually been supported to a sufficient degree to be viable; that the project would complement a programme of activity or other project being supported under the operational programme; that the group receiving support would be enabled to contribute more effectively to the partnership process in local development; that the groups receiving funding have the ability to carry through the project successfully and evidence that funds will be applied to the purpose for which they were granted.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to assist in the process of socio-economic development at local level to complement the measures funded under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development &mdash; £872,845 was allocated under this scheme in 1995.  A further £250,000 is available for allocation in 1996.  The appraisal of applications is at an advanced stage at present.</P>
    <P>3.  Under the Communicating Europe Initiative, a number of grants were paid in 1995 to the following; Irish Country Woman's Association &mdash; European Affairs Week; Europe Week &mdash; Local Radio Initiative; Institute of European Affairs &mdash; Research and Promotion of European Issues; Carrefour Network &mdash; Local Media Awareness Campaign; Irish Council of the European Movement &mdash; European Awareness Campaign.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Communicating Europe Initiative is to raise public awareness of EU issues and the various activities grant aided are in line with this objective.  As yet no grants have been made available for 1996, although it is <Col N="945" /> envisaged that support will be made available to a number of projects, including the Europe Week project and the ICA's European Affairs Week.</P>
    <P>4.  Western Development &mdash; the Western Development Partnership Board was established to promote the economic development of the western region with the objective of achieving population stability by the end of the decade at 1991 census levels on a county basis. The term of office of the board is for two years up to 31 December 1996.</P>
    <P>The board receives an annual grant from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.  In 1996 the amount of the board's grant is £120,000.  In 1995 the board received a grant of £100,000 and an additional amount of £28,000 approximately, to defray exceptional additional costs incurred in finalising their action plan.  In addition the board received a once-off payment of nearly £50,000 in respect of consultancy services.</P>
    <P>In its report entitled <i>New Approaches to Rural Development,</i> the National Economic and Social Council sets out its belief that a unified location based approach to service provision in rural areas should be actively explored.</P>
    <P>In response to this recommendation, a pilot programme initiative has been established to explore innovative ways of ensuring that a range of essential services are maintained in less populated rural areas in an effective and economic way.</P>
    <P>Following a programme of seminars which were hosted by Minister of State, Deputy Donal Carey, last year, a high level steering committee was established by the Minister to assess and recommend the pilot projects for inclusion in the programme.</P>
    <P>The committee has carried out an initial assessment of all proposals received and is at present considering which of them will become pilot projects for the most feasible model of integration of State services in rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> It is expected that those projects selected will be established by June of this year.  The pilot programme will run for a period of two or three years and funding for these projects will be made from the Western Development Subhead of the Department of the Taoiseach's Vote, it is too early at this stage to identify funding allocations to individual projects.</P>
    <P>The report of the inderdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development sets out the strategic framework within which future Government policy on the islands will be formulated and implemented.</P>
    <P>One of the report's key recommendations is the establishment of a financial envelope within which the current operational cost of access services would be financed, together with a provision for infrastructural works.  In addition, a further sum of £1 million has been allocated in 1996 for the specific provision of improved access to offshore islands.</P>
    <P>Funds will be allocated on the basis of proposals to be submitted by the relevant local authorities.  Furthermore, on a once off basis, £120,000 was allocated to seven island voluntary agencies in 1995 from funds available for western development.</P>
    <P>The Famine Commemoration Office does not have a specifically designated grant scheme.  However, from time to time the interdeparatmental commemoration committee, chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, receives requests for funding towards various activities related to the commemoration of the Famine and the Rebellion of 1798, and considers each request on its merits as a fit and appropriate commemoration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 55 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference, which will consider amendments to the European Union treaties, was launched on the occasion of the Turin European Council on 29 March.  Chairing the Intergovernmental Conference during the second half of the year will be one of the main priorities of the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The composition of the European Commission is one of the issues which will arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and indeed may fall for reexamination from time to time.  The recently approved White Paper on Foreign Policy makes clear the Government's strongly held view that Ireland could not countenance losing the right to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  To deprive member states of the automatic right to nominate a Commissioner far from making the Commission more efficient would make it less efficient in its essential role of protecting the common interest and in retaining public support for its central role, which Ireland fully supports, in the process of European integration.  Any changes to the Treaty must, of course, be agreed unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British White Paper on the Intergovernmental Conference, a Partnership of Nations, sets out the overall British strategy for the conference.  It deals with a range of issues including the number of Commissioners.  In that context, the British White Paper mentions a number of options which might be considered in the context of further enlargements of the Union, including the possibility of a two-tier Commission. As the Government has stated in the Irish White Paper on Foreign Policy, the further enlargement of the Union must not be used as an excuse to call into <Col N="949" /> question the delicate institutional balances, including the balances between the member states, which represent the Union's most important achievement and resource.  The Government's firm view is that the further enlargement of the Union should not have any implications for the right of every member state to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  We consider that it would, however, be appropriate for the large member states to agree in the context of further enlargement to nominate only one member of the Commission. I therefore welcome the view expressed by the Commission itself in its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference that, in the context of enlargement, the number of its members should be reduced to one per member state.</P>
    <P>As regards the European Parliament, there is a broad view emerging that a ceiling should be placed on the membership of the Parliament and that the size of the Parliament cannot be allowed to grow with each successive enlargement. A figure of 700 members has been mentioned as appropriate.  This approach is likely to mean a reduction in the number of MEPs from each existing member state.  Our firm view is that the smaller member states must continue to have an adequate level of representation in the Parliament.</P>

      <P>I do not share the perception that the European Union has grown away from the principle that national parliaments are the immediate representatives of the citizens.  At Governmental level in Ireland, it is fair to say that the trend in recent years has been of a greater awareness of the <Col N="950" /> important role the Oireachtas has to play in European Union affairs in general and in ensuring that the Union remains close to its citizens in particular. A similar trend towards the better involvement of national parliaments has been evident also in many other member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The members of the European Council and the Council of Ministers remain responsible to their national parliaments. Irish Ministers report to the Oireachtas on the work of Council, answer parliamentary questions and participate in debates on EU issues.  In addition, the treaties provide for ratification procedures involving national parliaments <i>inter alia</i> for any new Treaty amendments, accession of new member states and changes to the system of own resources.  National parliaments have played, and will continue to play a significant role in the European Union in vetting the primary and secondary legislation of the Union.</P>
      <P>Since 1973, when Ireland joined the EEC, the Oireachtas has always had a committee devoted to European affairs. The experience gained from the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in April 1993 was built on by the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs in March of last year.  As a Vice-President of the joint committee, the Deputy will be aware that together with the members of the Dáil and the Seanad who make up the Joint Committee on European Affairs, all MEPs elected from the island of Ireland can attend meetings of the Joint Committee as non-voting members.  Other members of the European Parliament may, on invitation, attend meetings of the Joint Committee.  In addition, there have been eleven ministerial appearances before the committee to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the Joint Committee on European Affairs can be seen in the context of Declaration 13 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that &ldquo;it is important to encourage greater involvement of national parliaments in the activities of the European <Col N="951" /> Union&rdquo;.  The greater involvement of national parliaments has also been fostered through the establishment at Union level of COSAC &mdash; the Conference of European Affairs Committees. COSAC, which comprises delegations from the European Affairs Committees from the national parliaments of each of the member states, meets once each Presidency to discuss issues of importance on the Union agenda.  Ireland will host a meeting of COSAC during our Presidency on 15-16 October next.  Regular meetings of the Presidents of the Parliaments of the member states also take place on issues of importance on the European Union agenda.  Ireland is represented at these meetings by the Ceann Comhairle. Meetings of the chairs of the foreign affairs committees of the member states also take place, although on a less frequent basis.</P>
    <P>The European Union is paying particular attention to ensure that the Union of the future remains close to its citizens.  Ensuring that the Union remains relevant and responsive to the needs of its citizens will be an important focus for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>It is also one of the underlying objectives of the Intergovernmental Conference, which Ireland will chair during its Presidency, to agree measures to make Europe more relevant to its citizens. The White Paper on Foreign Policy makes it clear that the Government's priority will be to ensure that, to as great an extent as possible, the Treaty changes agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference make the Union and its institutions more responsive to real public concerns.</P>
    <P>The Government is convinced that while respecting the independent competences of the European institutions, the Dáil and Seanad will continue to play a very important role in ensuring that the Union remains close to its citizens in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As clearly outlined in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, the Government is totally opposed to the indiscriminate nature, production, stockpiling, use of and trade in anti-personnel land-mines and are seeking support for a total ban on these weapons. In this context, we are taking an active part in the Review Conference on the Inhumane Weapons Convention.  This Conference is currently meeting in its Final Session in Geneva and will conclude in early May.</P>
      <P>When the review conference commenced, Ireland was one of only five countries calling for a total ban on anti-personnel land-mines.  Since then, the same position has been adopted by a further twenty-six countries.  I am greatly heartened by this increase in the number of countries which have come to share our view.  I hope that the significant changes in the positions of these delegations to the conference will have a positive influence on the negotiations and contribute to efforts to secure the maximum strengthening possible of Protocol II.  The provisions of this Protocol relate to the prohibitions and restrictions on the use of land-mines.  It is hoped that all States Parties will accept an amended Protocol including a ban on the use of non-detectable anti-personnel land-mines; a ban on the use of long-lived, remotely-delivered anti-personnel land-mines; and a ban on the transfer of land-mines which do not comply with the new rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland does not manufacture or trade in any of the weapons covered by the Inhumane Weapons Convention. The White Paper makes it abundantly clear that the Government intends to ensure that such manufacture will not <Col N="953" /> happen in the future.  There is currently a comprehensive legislative framework in place which controls the manufacture, stockpile, repair, transfer and export of land-mines.  Under the Explosive Act 1875, a licence is required for the production and stockpiling of land-mines. No such licence has been or will be granted.</P>
    <P>Under the Control of Exports Order 1983 which was made under the Control of Exports Act 1983 by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, the export of land-mines is subject to licence.  No such licence will be granted.</P>

      <P>The basis of Ireland's existing participation as an observer in the Western European Union is set out in chapter 4 of the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy.  The White Paper also addresses the question of Ireland's possible participation, on a case-by-case basis, in humanitarian and rescue tasks and peace-keeping tasks under the Petersberg Declaration.  The White Paper states that it is desirable and right that Ireland should be prepared to make a contribution in areas where it has proven capacity and experience and that the Government believe that such involvement would be in keeping with Ireland's commitment to international peace; would constitute a concrete contribution to European security; and would be a sign of solidarity with our European partners and neighbours in the search for a more secure and stable security order in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has therefore decided to discuss with the Western European Union the possibility of Ireland's taking part, on a case-by-case basis, in humanitarian and rescue tasks and peace-keeping tasks under the Petersberg Declaration and to consider such changes as may be necessary to the Defence and Garda Síochána Acts to enable Ireland's Defence Forces and <Col N="955" /> gardaí to take part in such operations. In this context, the White Paper makes clear that the Government does not intend that Ireland will be involved in tasks of combat forces in crisis management.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union has a role in relation to the common foreign and security policy under the Maastricht Treaty as it stands.  The Maastricht Treaty, which was duly ratified following a referendum, and which came into force in November, 1993, explicitly recognises the Western European Union as an integral part of the development of the EU and provides for the Union to request the Western European Union to implement actions and decisions of the Union that have defence implications.  There is a consensus in the EU that these should include conflict prevention and peacekeeping tasks &mdash; what are generally referred to as Petersberg tasks.  If the EU were to undertake such tasks, it could request the Western European Union to undertake the operational role &mdash; as it has done already in the case of the EU Administration of Mostar, where the Western European Union is providing the police element of the EU Administration at the request of the EU.  It was because of the relationship between the EU and the Western European Union which was established in the Maastricht Treaty that a previous Government decided that Ireland should become an Observer at the Western European Union in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference, which began on 29 March, is expected to consider further how the EU's common foreign and security policy provisions can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security, including through the EU-WEU relationship and the handling of Petersberg tasks.</P>
    <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, I see considerable potential for us to build on our achievements in the area of peace-keeping and international co-operation in a way which is <Col N="956" /> in harmony with our traditions and values.  The forthcoming meeting of the Western European Union Council of Ministers in Birmingham in May is expected to examine further the modalities for possible observer participation in the Petersberg tasks, taking account of the contribution that Ireland and the other Observers have made to UN peacekeeping over the years.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to be seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Nigeria. Along with its EU partners, Ireland is sponsoring a resolution on Nigeria at the 52nd Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights currently taking place in Geneva and has participated as a member of the EU troika in the carrying out of demarches in capitals seeking support for its adoption. This follows the recent fact-finding mission sent to Nigeria by the UN Secretary General.  The mission's mandate was to examine the judicial process of the trial of the late Ken Saro-Wiwa in the context of the international human rights instruments to which Nigeria is a party, and the plans of the Government of Nigeria to implement its declared commitment to restore the country to democratic rule.</P>
      <P>The Government is monitoring the situation closely and on an ongoing basis with EU partners, pursuant to the review procedure enshrined in the respective EU Common Positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995, which allow for the adoption of further measures, including further sanctions, in the light of developments in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to support all appropriate measures under the terms of review of the EU Common Positions on Nigeria and in the UN and other international fora, with a view to maintaining strong pressure on the Nigerian authorities to take specific steps towards an early transition to democracy and to ensure full respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>

      <P>As a troop contributing country of long standing, Ireland has consistently supported efforts to strengthen and improve the consultation process and exchange of information between the Security Council, the Secretary-General and troop contributing states.  We have in recent months, in association with EU partners and other troop contributing states, intensified these efforts to have the Security Council review and improve the procedures initially set in place in November 1994.  I am pleased to report that these efforts have been successful and that they resulted in a decision of the Security Council, on 28 March 1996, to introduce new and revised procedures to strengthen and improve consultation and exchange of information with troop contributors.</P>
      <P>Under the new procedures, meetings will be held as a matter of course, under the chairmanship of the President of the Security Council, between members of the Security Council, troop contributing countries and the UN secretariat for the purpose of consultations and an exchange of information and views. Member states which make special contributions, other than the provision of troops, to peace-keeping operations will also be invited to attend.  The meetings will be held in good time before any decision of the Council on extending, modifying or terminating the mandate of any peace-keeping operation, and as a general rule will be indicated in the monthly work perogramme of the Council.  These meetings will also be in addition to those which are convened and chaired by the secretariat for troop contributors to meet with special representatives of the secretary-general or force commanders, or to discuss operational matters, to which members of the Security Council will also be invited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new procedures also provide for <i>ad hoc</i> meetings to be convened in the event of unforeseen developments in a peace-keeping operation which may require action by the council.  The council also undertakes in regard to new <Col N="959" /> peace-keeping operations to hold meetings, unless impracticable, with prospective troop contributor states who have indicated they may be willing to provide troops to the operation.</P>
    <P>There is also an undertaking that these meetings will be better prepared by circulation of information and agenda in advance to participants.  Furthermore the President of the Security Council will report to members of the Security Council on the views expressed at these sessions with troop contributors. The annual report made by the Security Council to the United Nations General Assembly will have an appendix containing information on meetings held with troop contribiting states.</P>
    <P>The new consultation and information sharing procedures are a clear recognition on the part of the Security Council that it is essential that the views of troop contributing countries are heard, a position which Ireland and other states have long maintained.  The arrangements proposed should, if properly utilised, lead to more frequent and more informed meetings between the Security Council, the secretary-general and troop contributing states and, through improved reporting procedures, insure that members of the Security Council are aware, on a continuing basis, of the views of troop contributors on specific peace-keeping operations.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the industrial action being taken by members of the Civil and Public Service Union in the Oireachtas is part of a wider dispute affecting those grades throughout the Civil Service.  Discussions have taken place with the staff panel, on which all Civil Service unions are represented, with a view to resolving the issue which lies at the heart of the present industrial action, that is the one-in-three restriction on the filling of vacancies in the Civil Service.  These discussions are ongoing and I hope an outcome satisfactory to all concerned will be arrived at shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> The Deputy's attention is also drawn to the statement issued jointly by the Civil and Public Service Union and I last week in which it was agreed that negotiations with the union under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement would take place with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission.</P>

      <P>Data on the national debt are traditionally published at end-year and represent the opening balance on 1 January of the following year.  The opening balance on 1 January for the years 1994 to 1996 were 1994 &mdash; £28,357 million, 1995 &mdash; £29,227 million, and 1996 &mdash; £30,210 million.</P>
      <P>A succession of low budget deficits since the late 1980s, together with increases in Gross National Product, has resulted in a significant fall in the debt burden.  In particular, over the two years in question, the debt ratio fell from over 100 per cent of GNP at 1 January 1994 to about 90 per cent by 1 January 1996. It is expected that, in the coming years, continued budgetary prudence combined with strong economic growth will yield further significant progress in this area.</P>

    <P>These figures are based on returns received to date and are subject to adjustment on receipt of late or amended returns, especially in respect of the more recent years.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be provided in respect of share purchase schemes qualifying for tax relief under the provisions of section 12 of the Finance Act, 1986.  It is tentatively estimated that over the period from 1987 to date share purchases by employees valued at about £4.1 million were accorded tax relief at an approximate cost to the Exchequer of £1.9 million. The number of applications approved was of the order of 6,300 but this number includes repeated counts of some employees who subscribed for shares in different years within their statutory life time limits.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The health boards operate means tests for certain entitlements and charges as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  Medical Card Eligibility&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical <Col N="968" /> cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  The guidelines were revised upwards on this basis with effect from 1 January 1996.  It should be noted that a person whose income exceeds the guidelines may be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Income Maintenance Allowances&mdash;</P>
    <P>In assessing eligibility for the allowances listed below, health boards are obliged to have regard to all the applicant's means and the means of his/her spouse.  Assessment procedures are for the most part similar to those used in assessing income for medical card eligibility. Full account is taken of the amount of means and the allowance is reduced accordingly.  However income from supplementary welfare allowances, and amounts of up to £34.10 per week from recognised rehabilitative employment, are disregarded in calculating means for this purpose.  These allowances go up each year in line with increases given effect in the Finance Bill.</P>

    <P>The income of an applicant's spouse is taken into account when medical card eligibility is being assessed (&ldquo;spouse&rdquo; includes unmarried persons who are living together as man and wife).  The income of other household members is not normally taken into account.  If considered financially independent by the chief executive officer such members would normally be assessed for a medical card in their own right.  Interest on savings is usually assessed, not the actual savings.  Likewise the income deriving from property owned is assessed, not the actual value of the property.</P>
    <P>The following income is excluded: child benefit, supplementary welfare allowance, family income supplement, domiciliary care allowance, foster care allowance, blind welfare allowance, Department of Defence service pensions 1916-1921, mobility allowance, weekly payments from community employment, carers' allowance and back-to-work allowance.  Article 8.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 obliges a health board to follow the procedures set out in the second schedule to the regulations when assessing the means of a person who has applied for a nursing home subvention.</P>
    <P>Schedule three of the subvention regulations concerns the assessment of adult children of an applicant for subvention. A health board may only assess a son or daughter's ability to contribute towards the cost of the nursing home fees of a parent if the son or daughter is aged twenty one years and over, is residing in the jurisdiction and possesses sufficient personal income to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees as assessed under the procedures laid out in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Long-stay care&mdash;</P>
    <P>Persons with incomes who are provided with long-stay care in public hospitals, homes for the elderly and other long-stay institutions may incur liability for long-stay charges.  In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances.  Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable <Col N="971" /> amount is left to meet the person's personal needs.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication by Barnados of the report &ldquo;Children First&rdquo;, which is a timely and important contribution to the continuing debate of how best to promote the welfare and protection of children in this country.  The report looks at child poverty, child abuse, juvenile justice, educational disadvantage and drug abuse.</P>
      <P>The Government, in its policy document A Government of Renewal has given a clear commitment to putting in place adequate policies and services for children and their families who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. A first step in this regard was my appointment as Minister of State at the Departments of Health, Education and Justice with special responsibility for developing and co-ordinating policies and services in relation to child care. The Government also established a Cabinet Committee on Children, representative of the Ministers for Health, Education, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social Welfare to co-ordinate and review progress on the comprehensive commitments contained in our policy document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been achieved in improving supports to vulnerable children and their families.  The Government has concentrated on adopting a multi-dimensional approach involving a combination of legislative <Col N="972" /> and service measures in certain key areas.</P>
    <P>A top priority has been the implementation of the remaining sections of Child Care Act, 1991.  Many of the principles and strategies contained in the Barnardos document reflect those of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by this country on 28 September 1992.  The philosophy of the Convention is also closely reflected in the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>The concepts of the rights of the child, and of the best interests of the child, are to the forefront of all actions relating to the Child Care Act.  Sixty-one of the seventy nine sections of the legislation are now in force.  The most complex provisions of the Act were introduced in October last.  These greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards, the courts and the Garda to intervene in cases where children are at risk.  The remaining eighteen provisions of the Act, in relation to preschool services and childrens residential centres, will come into force before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Extra funding in the region of £35 million on an annualised basis has been provided to health boards to develop a wide range of child and family support services to enable them operate the new legislation in partnership with the voluntary sector.  I will shortly be in a position to announce a detailed child care action plan for 1996.</P>
    <P>The pro-child and pro-family thrust of Government policy has made considerable progress in other areas.  Child benefits has, for example, been increased by 45 per cent over the first two budgets of this Government.  These measures directly benefit over one million children and almost half a million families.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice is preparing legislation which will replace the Children Act, 1908 with a new framework for dealing with young offenders. Important features of the legislation will be an emphasis on early intervention, for example, by placing the Garda Diversion Programme on a statutory basis and the provision of community <Col N="973" /> sanctions and measures which the courts can impose.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental objective of the White Paper on Education that the rate of retention in schools to completion of the senior cycle should increase to 90 per cent by the end of the decade.  Progress in the achievement of this target is being made, and rates of retention have increased from 70 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent at present.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has a range of strategies in place which are designed to prevent early school leaving and to encourage disadvantaged pupils to participate more fully in the education system. These include the development of early start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the home school community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; improvements in the quality of teaching and qualification systems; expansion of psychology and guidance services; expansion of concessionary teaching posts; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme for necessitous pupils; alleviation of examination fees for necessitous pupils; the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and the vocational training opportunities scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved a comprehensive range of measures for the prevention of drug misuse and the treatment of persons who are already misusing drugs.  Special attention is given to improving the provision of services for drug misusers in the Eastern Health Board area and stressing the crucial role that education and the promotion of healthy lifestyles can play in the prevention of drug misuse.  This programme includes strengthening existing school-based substance misuse prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>I note that the report by Barnardos calls for the introduction of mandatory reporting in relation to child abuse and neglect.  The House will be aware that <Col N="974" /> I recently launched a discussion paper, entitled &ldquo;Putting Children First&rdquo;, which highlights the main issues associated with mandatory reporting.  This paper has been widely circulated to allow full and detailed consideration of the implications of introducing such a legislative requirement.  When this consultation process is completed, I will be in a position to make decisions concerning the question of mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns expressed by many within our society including Barnardos, on the need to continue to prioritise measures to assist vulnerable children and families.  I am fully committed to achieving further progress in this regard and the issues raised in the Barnardos report will be carefully considered in this context.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy will be aware that a key recommendation of the Comhairle Review on Consultant Manpower Needs for the Cork region was the establishment of a pan-hospital structure.  This structure is designed to act as a vehicle for achieving consensus between the agencies in Cork with regard to the priority consultant posts and the location of these posts within the Cork hospital system.  I am pleased to say that the pan-hospital structure has been operating effectively since early 1995 and I understand that its consultation process in association with the management of the agencies concerned is almost complete.  I anticipate detailed proposals from the pan-hospital structure in relation to agreed priority consultant posts in the near future.</P>
      <P>The timing of consultant appointments will depend on the availability of development funding and the competing demands for priority in use of those resources.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council applied for funding in 1995 for the realignment and widening of the R263 Killybegs to Glencolmcille under the EU co-financed scheme of specific improvement projects which promote employment and economic activity. While the council received grants of £976,000 for six schemes, the scheme in question was not one of those selected for funding.  No application for funding <Col N="1012" /> under the scheme was received in respect of 1996.</P>
      <P>It is open to the council to consider whether to re-apply for funding for the project under the EU co-financed scheme which will continue in operation until 1999.</P>

      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that my Department has decided to award incremental credit to the person concerned in respect of two years' teaching service with a vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>Further inquiries in relation to this case are near completion and I expect that the manner will be finalised in the near future.</P>
      <P>Applications for incremental credit require the verification of the nature and extent of the teacher's prior service so as to ensure that an entitlement to this credit exists.  By their nature these can require a number of contacts with former employers and this, coupled with the need to prioritise the deployment of resources, can result in a delay in finalising the applications.  However, I can confirm that my Department is reviewing its procedures in this area with a view to significantly improving the turnabout time in the handling of these applications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 87 and 88 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement reached with IMPACT to which the Deputy refers was a settlement of a claim submitted by that trade union on behalf of school secretaries in County Dublin Vocational Education Committee schools.  The claim was for the upgrading of posts of school secretaries and was processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for clerical and administrative <Col N="1017" /> grades of vocational education committees. The Departments of Education and Finance, the Irish Vocational Education Association and IMPACT, representing the parties to the scheme, agreed to have a job evaluation survey undertaken of these posts.  In accordance with the recommendations of the report of that survey, which were accepted by the parties concerned, agreement was reached that Grade 3 secretaries in schools and colleges in County Dublin Vocational Education Committee with 40 wholetime teacher equivalents and over would be upgraded to Grade 4.  The regarding was subject to revised job specifications appropriate to Grade 4 level being implemented for the post holders concerned.</P>
    <P>In December, 1995 IMPACT submitted a claim for the regarding of school secretaries nationally.  As agreed with the union, this falls to be processed under Clause 2 (iii) of Annex 1 of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  As the claim is a matter for negotiation with the union concerned it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on any issue encompassed by the claim.</P>

      <Quest>the number of primary schools, in terms of enrolment quota, in a position to discriminate at entry against children not of the religious faith of that school; and the way in which a reduction in pupil/teacher ratios might be expected to impact on the number of such schools.</Quest>

      <P>I regret that it is not <Col N="1019" /> possible to provide figures on the details sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Primary schools with adequate resources, both teaching and accommodation, generally admit all pupils who seek entry.  Accordingly, most parents are able to have their children enrolled in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The managerial authorities of schools not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry normally implement an enrolment policy.  Local circumstances may be such that, from time to time, the board of management of a particular school may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
      <P>The majority of Irish primary schools are denominational in their governance, structure and operation.</P>
      <P>In this context, the White Paper, Charting our Education Future, emphasises that the denominational character of schools is a factor which plays a role in the admissions policies and staffing of schools.  That role, however, must be reasonable and proportionate to the legitimate aim of preserving the ethos of schools and must balance this right of schools and their students against the rights to education of students of different denominations or none.  While the denominational nature of schools may imply that they have a right to give preferential treatment to co-religionists, discrimination cannot be arbitrary and schools must act reasonably and fairly according to admissions criteria known to all in advance.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage that a reduction in the pupil teacher ratio would have any overall impact on the enrolment arrangements made by such schools.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that morale in the Garda Síochána is low either because of pay and working conditions or anything else.</P>
      <P>The pay agreements which form part of national programmes are, in common with the rest of the public service, applied to all members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, however, say that the four Garda associations have been critical of their non-participation at the central <Col N="1026" /> pay discussions for national programmes. The question of whether the Garda associations ought to be closer to the determination of public pay policy in the context of national programmes is one which could be usefully examined.  I believe that the best way to proceed, at this stage, is by way of discussion between all the representative associations and my Department.  The aim would be to find an approach which would be consistent with the position of the associations under trade union law but which would allow the Garda associations to make a contribution to the process which will follow the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
    <P>So far as the quality of accommodation is concerned I believe that, while some accommodation needs improvement and this is not denied, gardaí have every reason to be satisfied with the programme for improvements.  A very considerable investment has been made in improving Garda accommodation in recent years and many members of the force have benefited from this expenditure. In fact, since 1992 over £24 million has been spent between maintenance and new works.  Indeed, in the two years 1995-96 in which I had an involvement, as Minister, in the provision of money for the Garda building programme, some £17 million has been allocated. This year alone there is an allocation of nearly £9 million.  I think this is an indication of my commitment to eliminating accommodation problems throughout the country and that gardaí generally appreciate that significant progress is being made countrywide.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to change the free fuel scheme in view of the recent report by the heat and energy group which is being backed by the Combat Poverty Agency concerning the extent of fuel poverty in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The report <i>Paying the Price &mdash; Fuel Poverty in Ireland, North and South</i> has been compiled by Heat and Energy Action Tallaght following a conference organised by HEAT and Neighbourhood Energy Action (Northern Ireland) in April 1995.  The conference and report was part-funded by the Combat Poverty Agency.  The report is a compilation of speeches from speakers at the conference.  In short the recommendations include: improved standards of insulation within building regulations; the continued payment of social welfare heating allowance to meet the high costs of living in cold homes, whilst a programme of heating system and insulation improvements takes place; within the context of fuel prices, a greater recognition of the energy efficiency needs of consumers, alongside price reductions and incentives for low-volume users.</P>
      <P>In the report, HEAT has called for a more integrated approach by the various Government Departments and agencies involved in dealing with fuel poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas in which my Department has a role in combating fuel poverty is through the national fuel scheme. The scheme assists certain householders <Col N="1030" /> who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks, from mid October to mid April.  An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 is paid to qualified householders in areas where there is a ban on the sale of bituminous coal.</P>
    <P>A sum of £44.5 million was set aside for the 1995-96 scheme.  This compares with expenditure of £25.9 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>A review of the national fuel scheme to ensure that it is operating effectively and equitably will get under way shortly and I will be happy to consider the points raised in the report in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology, Deputy Rabbitte, last year commissioned Deloitte and Touche, management consultants, to undertake an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland.  The report has not yet been submitted to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  However, my Department is at present examining a draft of the report recently sent to the Department by the consultants.  It will be necessary to have further discussions with the consultants with a view to ensuring that the final report fully satisfies the terms of reference established for the study.  My intention is that the study's conclusions and recommendations, based on expert economic evaluations, will provide a sound basis for the development of effective measures to reduce the burden of insurance costs on economic activity in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory obligation to lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The appropriate form of publication of the report will be considered following its finalisation.  At this stage, I would, however, like to express my personal preference for a wide dissemination of the consultants' analysis, conclusions and recommendation.</P>

      <P>The Travers report on Science, Technology and Innovation was published in March 1995 and contained 160 recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Government established a task force, under the supervision of a Cabinet Committee, to examine the recommendations and to report on how they could best be brought forward for implementation.  The task force was chaired by Mr. John Travers, chief executive officer of Forfás and included representatives from Government Departments.  The Travers report has been completed and its recommendations have been considered by the Cabinet Committee.</P>
      <P>The Travers task force report is an internal document and it was never the intention to publish it.  It is now with the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology who is preparing a public response to the Tierney report, for early consideration by Government prior to its publication.</P>

      <P>I am fully committed to the promotion of deer farming as an alternative enterprise.  This is evident from the number of support measures which are already available to deer production enterprises through the auspices of my Department.</P>
      <P>1.  The alternative enterprise scheme gives grant-aid on investments of up to £20,000 for the provision of deer handling facilities and fencing at a rate of 50 per cent in less favoured areas and 40 per cent elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  To assist the development of deer breeding stock a grant of £160 for Red Deer or £80 for Sika or Fallow Deer, subject to a maximum of £4,000, is paid for the introduction of new stock or the <Col N="1039" /> retention of additional breeding stock on deer farms.</P>
    <P>3.  Under the Structural Funds there is also a scheme of aid in place to stimulate the growth of deer producer groups. Under this scheme individual producers are encouraged to establish groups in order to be better placed to meet market requirements, and to implement coordinated production, quality and marketing strategies.</P>
    <P>4.  From this year, venison is included in An Bord Bia's promotion campaign both for the home and export markets and a comprehensive survey of market opportunities has recently been conducted to assist this campaign.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a scheme of headage payments for deer is under active consideration.</P>

      <P>I visited Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Lebanon, Cyprus and Israel during the period 13-25 March 1996.  The primary purpose of my visit was to see for myself the work of Irish military personnel serving in the region and to assure them, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, of how proud we are of the outstanding manner in which they have consistently performed their duties on United Nations service.</P>
      <P>I spent two days in Cyprus during which I met the chief of mission and the force commander of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.  I attended briefings by the chief of staff of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus and the senior Irish officer in the force.

I toured the Irish area of operations in the south of the country <Col N="1043" /> where I visited 14 Irish UN posts and saw at first hand the conditions under which Irish troops are required to operate.

      <P>The direct cost &mdash; which includes maintenance, fuel and support services &mdash; of the 310 flights was £866,000.

    <P>Under the package, a range of measures have been agreed for 1996. The measures, in the main, relate to the implementation of the new entry/exit requirements which came into force on 1 January 1996.  The total amount of expenditure under the programme for 1996 for both the Departments of Defence and the Marine is £5.8 million. of which £4.3 million will be met by the EU.  The proposals for expenditure in 1997 under the package have to be submitted to Brussels by end June 1996. These proposals will include, <i>inter alia</i>, expenditure as a down payment for the acquisition of a new ship for the Naval Service.  It is not possible, in advance of a tender competition for the vessel, to say when it will be commissioned but <Col N="1046" /> past experience has shown that the overall acquisition process takes about two years.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the reference is to the civilian employees engaged under section 30 of the Defence Act, 1954, who provide various services for the Defence Forces at military installations across the country.  These are normally provided for in Subhead F of the Defence Vote and, for 1996, this subhead caters for a strength of 1,352 civilian employees at a cost of £20.55 million. There is an annual turnover of approximately 40 of these civilians and their replacement is provided for within the provision in the 1996 Estimate.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties at Courtown Harbour, County Wexford in which a machine is permanently required to dredge the mouth of the harbour to allow access to fishing and leisure craft, that a machine has always been there, that a replacement had to be obtained by the local fisherman's association in view of the poor condition of the original machine; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the replacement machine, as was the case with the original, cannot be removed from Courtown; his views on whether the machine is a permanent fixture in the harbour; the portion, if any, of the purchase price of the machine he will pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Ongoing maintenance dredging of the mouth at Courtown harbour is a matter for the appropriate harbour authority, which in this instance is Wexford County Council.  Therefore, the provision of the required plant for such maintenance dredging, such as a dragline, is a matter for the council.  In certain circumstances, grant aid is available under the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 towards the purchase of harbour equipment.  However, such aid is not available for any equipment which would be classified as a mobile asset.  Dredging equipment would fall into that category.  The fact that a piece of plant or equipment is retained in one location is not the defining issue in whether it is regarded as a mobile asset.  Dredging equipment is usually capable of being moved from harbour to harbour.</P>
      <P>The question of whether a contribution can be made to the cost of dredging at Courtown Harbour only arises in relation to consideration being given to undertaking a scheme of capital dredging at the harbour within the limits of finance available to me.  It is not proposed to aid such a scheme in the foreseeable future.</P>
