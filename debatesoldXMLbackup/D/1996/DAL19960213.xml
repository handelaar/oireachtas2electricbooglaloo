      <Quest>the progress, if any, that has been made in the Interdepartmental Group, chaired by his Department, on the Development of a National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the UN summit for social development the Government decided that the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development should draw up the elements of an anti-poverty strategy. The main objective is to enable the consumers of the very extensive services made available to tackle poverty to influence policy.  This will improve the effectiveness of the more than £2 billion of public funds devoted annually to tackling poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to facilitate the widest possible consultation the interdepartmental policy committee circulated an explanatory leaflet to a wide range of interested organisations and individuals and invited them to make submissions to the committee on poverty issues.  In addition an advertisement was placed in <Col N="878" /> national and provincial newspapers in July 1995 inviting submissions.  Approximately 600 groups expressed an interest in being consulted and 241 submissions were received.  These submissions helped inform the preparation of a discussion paper on poverty, social exclusion and inequality in Ireland and a consultation paper on institutional mechanisms to support the strategy which were published in December.  A summary of the submissions made to the committee was also published at that time.</P>
    <P>These papers formed the basis for discussions at seminars which were held in Cork, Monaghan, Galway and Dublin and with leading researchers and academics involved in poverty issues in January this year.  All those who had made submissions or who had indicated their interest in the process were invited to attend the seminars.  More than 500 people attended.  The committee is pleased with the high level of response and attendance at the seminars.  The national network of community and voluntary groups representing people experiencing poverty and social exclusion has been holding consultations with its members on the documents prepared by the committee and consultations have also taken place with the social partners.</P>
    <P>In addition the National Economic and Social Forum considered the documents at its December plenary session and has prepared an opinion on the national anti-poverty strategy which will further inform the deliberations of the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee is considering the feedback from the seminars and consultations and in due course will submit for the Government's consideration a statement of the basis on which a national anti-poverty strategy should be developed.  It is envisaged that further public consultation will take place as the key elements of the strategy are developed.</P>
    <P>It is also envisaged that the anti-poverty strategy to be adopted by the <Col N="879" /> Government will complement the strategic management initiative being developed by Government Departments and agencies.</P>

      <P>When does the Taoiseach envisage that work on the final document will be ready for circulation to the Government in the first instance and to this House for debate?  Will the Taoiseach give indications of the way the interim document is shaping up in so far as it would influence and direct policy in the period ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to approve the document in June and have discussion on it thereafter in the Dáil.  It is probably a little early yet to talk about the shape of the document.  Although much consultation has taken place, final consideration has yet to be undertaken and obviously it would be better to await that before giving further details. I stress that this is an approach designed to ensure that those who experience poverty are consulted and their experiences and views are taken into account in the way in which policies are implemented to assist them.  There is no doubt that successive Governments have spent considerable sums of money on proposals of various kinds, the intention of which was to alleviate poverty &mdash; that is not in dispute.  What has not been devised up to now is a structured arrangement for consulting on both a one-off basis and an ongoing basis those who benefit from it in a way that ensures their viewpoints are taken into account and that the best results possible are obtained from the resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Taoiseach say to those who have been involved in the process in recent months who believe this is a cynical exercise based on the increases given in the budget to those in the poverty classes where the unemployed and elderly received an increase of 30p per day and people over 80 years received an <Col N="880" /> increase of 20p per week?  Does he agree there is not much point in putting together a complicated structure if these issues are being ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, it is fair to say that the Government has taken very careful account of the consultative process, first in the fact that in the budget we concentrated on one of the causes of poverty, long-term unemployment, and introduced a number of initiatives to deal with it.  It is widely welcomed by all those concerned about poverty that we are tackling not only the symptoms of the problem but the cause, the absence of opportunity to work.</P>
      <P>As social welfare increases are greater than the level of inflation, they represent a real improvement in the living standards of the people concerned. At one stage members of the Deputy's party complained that the Government was spending too much but it appears they have changed their minds.  They seem to change their minds on that score almost every day, depending on where they are speaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell long on this question and will await publication of the final report.  I do not share the Taoiseach's optimism about the feelings of the long-term unemployed.  The over eighties are not looking for work and a weekly increase of 20p is not much good to them.  I welcome the initiative if it is of benefit and I would appreciate if, at the earliest opportunity, the Taoiseach would pass the draft conclusions of the report to one of the committees of the House so that we could have an input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to those <Col N="881" /> over 80, the Government introduced a substantial increase in the living alone allowance which must be added to any consideration of the basic pension increase.  Under their terms of reference there is no restriction which would prevent any committee discussing this matter and any which wishes to discuss it is free to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government announced on 26 October 1995 that officials from relevant Departments would prepare for consideration by Government the elements of a strategy to deal with unemployment.  Subsequently the group, comprising officials of my Department, the Office of the Tánaiste and the Departments of Finance, Social Welfare, Education and Enterprise and Employment, has met on a number of occasions to develop a co-ordinated approach to policy regarding unemployment.</P>
      <P>The group presented two reports to Government.  In addition, the group facilitated the development of the package of complementary measures to respond to unemployment which were contained in the Budget Statement.</P>
      <P>Tackling unemployment has implications for a range of Departments and programmes.  It is essential that co-ordinating mechanisms operate efficiently both centrally and locally to reflect this reality.  Primary responsibility rests with each Minister and his or her Department to ensure that all relevant opportunities are pursued to tackle unemployment, especially long-term unemployment. Participation by senior officials in interdepartmental discussions facilitates the development of a shared analysis of the nature of the problems and thus the co-ordination of policy response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interdepartmental group will <Col N="882" /> continue in existence and will meet from time to time, as necessary, to facilitate this co-ordination.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why the Government has failed the unemployed, bearing in mind that in the 14 months since he became Taoiseach the number of unemployed has increased by more than 6,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not failed the unemployed and, therefore, the Deputy's question does not arise.  I remind her that in the past 12 months there has been a net increase of 45,000 in employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who can restrain themselves sufficiently long to think will reflect that the labour force is increasing at approximately 25,000 a year and during the past year a substantial number of people have returned from abroad because our economy is more buoyant than that in neighbouring countries.  Those people are added to the number looking for work.  Therefore, it is possible that although we succeeded in increasing employment by 45,000 last year, because of the additional people &mdash; returned emigrants and demographic increases given that the birth rate 15 to 20 years ago was higher than the retirement rate now &mdash; coming on to the labour market annually, from time to time there will be a combination of a major increase in employment and an increase in unemployment. I believe the Deputy understands that very well.  Any attempt by her to make a political point of the type she is making has the side effect of displaying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate why the Minister for Finance in the Budget Statement projected that only 31,000 jobs would be created in 1996? Can he explain the slow down in the rate of job creation?  Is he also aware of the findings of the labour force survey which indicate 412,000 jobs net will have to be created between now and the year 2,000 to reduce unemployment by 2,000. Will the Taoiseach agree they indicate that under the Government's projections the country will be locked permanently into a high rate of unemployment if present policies continue?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who studied the birth rate and age structure of this country in the mid-1970s would understand that 20 years later we would have a problem in terms of employment.  The numbers who reached the ages of entry to the workforce &mdash; 18 to 25 &mdash; were greater by 25,000 to 30,000 than the number who reached retirement age. That was obvious since 1970 to every Government which read the census. There should not be any surprise in this House that there is an unemployment problem.  It is something which was foreseeable for 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputies to reflect on the need for long-term planning in this area. Unfortunately in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when we knew we faced a huge problem and should have set aside money to enable us to create additional jobs, Governments embarked on a borrowing spree which burdened us in dealing with an entirely foreseeable unemployment problem.  The demographics <Col N="886" /> were obvious to anybody who could read the census in the 1970s.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The advisory group on the local employment service is chaired by my Department but serviced by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The group's advice is primarily directed to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, but issues arise which are of concern to other Ministers represented on the group, which comprises representatives of the office of the Tánaiste and the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Finance, Social Welfare, Education, FÁS and ADM Ltd.</P>
      <P>The local employment service is being established initially in 14 areas, including the original 12 area partnership companies.  It has been established on the basis of recommendations arising from the work of the National Economic and Social Forum.  Its objective is to provide a more co-ordinated and client-centered service to the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed. In doing so, it seeks to deliver a more streamlined response to the needs of the unemployed by statutory agencies operating locally, especially FÁS, the Department of Social Welfare and the vocational education committees, as well as the very important Outreach services for the unemployed provided by community and voluntary organisations, including the ICTU centres for the unemployed.  The local employment services is being established on a partnership basis because of the critical importance of the active support of employers in developing an effective placement service.  The measures announced in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance will, of course, increase the effectiveness of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the advisory group is to consider problems which may arise in the establishment of the service, especially by ensuring that policy and <Col N="889" /> practice at national level in Government Departments and statutory agencies fully supports active co-operation with, and participation in, the service at local level.  The group has also given detailed consideration to the plans for the development of the service in the initial locations.  On the basis of this consideration, the group has recommended to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the level of funding to be made available from his Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the group will continue to monitor the implementation of the service and to advise the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, as necessary, on issues arising from its operation.</P>

      <P>I do not have that information readily available to me at this time.  As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is merely chairing an advisory group on the service.

Any <Col N="890" /> detailed questions about the level or source of recruitment for the service might be more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly two years ago, the National Economic and Social Forum recommended the establishment of local employment services.  To date, fourteen have been set up.  When that report was produced in June 1994, the forum thought that if local employment services were introduced, long-term unemployment could be brought down to 20,000 by the year 2000.  What is the Taoiseach's opinion on that report and the non-implementation of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hazardous to make early projections about the level of long-term unemployment.  It is appropriate to target the local employment services on the areas of greatest need initially, and that is what is being done in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I meant to ask was whether it is intended that that report &mdash; which recommended the nationwide implementation of the local employment service, with which I agree &mdash; will be followed through?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the availability of funds we will seek to extend the local employment service.  However, I cannot say when the service will operate nationwide.  It is fair to say that the maximum return from such a service is likely to be obtained by initially concentrating these extra resources on placement in areas of highest unemployment where people who live there will have experienced the greatest degree of resistance to their being employed, partly because of the length of their unemployment record and, unfortunately, partly on grounds of their address.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of EU Heads of Government he has met bilaterally since September 1995, with a view to the preparation of Ireland's EU Presidency.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2972/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1 September 1995 I have had substantial bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Gonzalez of Spain, Prime Minister Dini of Italy, Prime Minister Major of the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg.  I also had a short bilateral meeting with President Chirac of France.</P>
      <P>In addition I have attended a meeting of the European Council in Madrid and an informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government in Majorca. These meetings have been concerned to a greater or lesser degree with the ongoing agenda of the European Union. As a primary responsibility of the Irish Presidency will be to administer this ongoing agenda the meetings have helped to contribute to preparations for our Presidency.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have reported to the House on most of these meetings.  In particular I reported on 24 January to the House on my meeting with Prime Minister Dini of Italy on 17 January last.  Since Italy currently holds the Presidency of the European Union this was an exceptionally important and useful meeting in the context of preparations for the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Taoiseach's planned objectives for the Irish Presidency of the European Union following the meetings to which he referred?  With particular reference to economic and monetary union &mdash; bearing in mind the doubts and concerns expressed by the French and German Governments and leaders in recent weeks &mdash; what way does the Taoiseach intend to persuade both the Intergovernmental Conference and the <Col N="892" /> Heads of State to make progress during our Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I already answered that question on a number of occasions in the House.  As far as the general objectives of our Presidency are concerned, we would wish to see the Intergovernmental Conference effectively advance preparations for enlargement of the European Union and the requisite institutional changes to accommodate its enlargement.  In particular we would need to see a strengthening of pillar III so that a problem of major concern to us, that of drugs and the crime associated therewith, can be tackled on a Europe-wide basis.  We would also want to see improvement in the Community's performance on the whole issue of employment.  As the House is aware, the Commission, the ECOFIN and Social Affairs Ministers will report to the Dublin Summit in December next on the employment issue which will provide us with a major focus.  On the drugs question specifically, the expert group which reported to the Madrid Summit has set out a programme of detailed work on what we can do to tackle the drugs problem. While that matter is being given to the Italian and Irish presidencies to carry forward, until we ascertain exactly where matters stand at the time we take over the Presidency, it is impossible to be any more precise about our objectives. For example, some of the work with which we might expect to have to deal may be dealt with during the Italian Presidency or, conversely, some work we might expect the Italians to deal with may not have been dealt with at that stage and may have to be taken forward into our Presidency.  Therefore, it is not possible to give any more precise statement on our objectives at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to inform the House that the Government has already established its inter-ministerial committee to prepare for our Presidency, which is meeting regularly, working to the agenda coming through, in order to be <Col N="893" /> fully prepared logistically and politically for the issues we must take on within the six months of our Presidency.  Of course, there will also be a number of external relations challenges to the European Union during our Presidency, one foreseeable one being the aftermath of the Russian Presidential election, when relations with Central and Eastern Europe at a political level will be of considerable importance.  In addition, the development of the transatlantic dialogue will be very important to the European Union.  Ireland has a record of working in that area.  For example, there are suggestions for extending the transatlantic dialogue to include Canada and Mexico, issues in which we would also be taking an interest.  However, it is impossible at this stage to be any more precise because we do not know exactly what stage that work will have reached by the time we take over.</P>

      <P>The last time we touched on the subject of the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference the Taoiseach listed a number of items similar to those he mentioned today.  I availed of that opportunity, and do so again today, of saying how disappointed I am that, on reflection, he has still not included a major element of our Presidency &mdash; the whole question of the environment &mdash; which was one of the great successes of our last, &ldquo;green Presidency&rdquo;, as it was known.  Since this is a very important issue to the electorate, will the Taoiseach review his agenda and include the environment as a priority issue on the agenda of our Presidency?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue just mentioned by Deputy Burke is one of those central to the considerations of the Intergovernmental Conference as the whole question of European security is one of great concern to many member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the environmental agenda is concerned, the Deputy might reflect on the fact that the big proposal in Europe in recent years was the introduction of a green tax, a tax on carbon fuels.  I would be less than honest with the Deputy if I did not tell him that that proposal is running into immense difficulties, that there are a large number of countries that object quite profoundly to it.  There are also many interests in this country, for example, in the midlands, where turf production provides a very important part of people's livelihoods and where they would be deeply concerned about it, as, no doubt, would those who derive their employment from the generation of electricity.  It is not an easy question.  Perhaps when Deputy Burke is framing his questions to the Minister for the Environment he <Col N="895" /> might assist us all by letting us know where he stands on the green tax.</P>

      <P>The question of <Col N="896" /> whether the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the case referred to by the Deputy is relevant in respect of equality of treatment in any particular claim or Irish situation is a matter primarily for the redress mechanisms and courts before which claims would be taken under the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>The ruling of the European Court of Justice in the case in question did not resolve the equality claim taken under UK law.  I understand that the case has gone back to the UK courts for determination on the basis of the facts of the case but that a decision has not yet issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Having fully interpreted the redress mechanisms and other legislative notions in the reply will the Minister refer to the reality of this finding and say whether it has, or is likely to have, implications for our systems?  Has the Minister put in train any study or investigation rather than waiting until the case is referred to the UK courts? In my question I referred particularly to the current claim by nurses with a large number of females and comparable professions which have large numbers of males.  It would appear that at management level nurses are not doing as well as males.  Will this finding have any bearing on our system?  If the Minister is unaware of any such bearing will he investigate the matter thoroughly?</P>

      <P>The European Court case referred to by the Deputy has not yet concluded.  The final determination of the facts and the law in that case has to be done by the UK court.  It would be inappropriate to start reading too much into the matter until, at the very least, the case has concluded.  When it concludes it may be that the facts may not warrant drawing any general conclusion. I am not in a position to draw any conclusions at this stage, it would be premature.</P>

I tried to draw a comparison between nurses at management level such as a matron in Beaumont Hospital or the Mater Hospital and members of the Garda Síochána at, say, superintendent level and so on.  Where there is a preponderance of women they are not getting the same reward for similar skills.  This is a serious and urgent matter.

      <P>I strongly condemn the recent attacks on the elderly, a number of which have tragically resulted in the loss of life.</P>
      <P>In seeking the assistance of members of the public, including the travelling community, to bring the perpetrators to justice, the gardaí are reported in the newspapers as having acknowledged that the vast majority of the travelling community are law abiding and unreservedly condemn what has happened. The gardaí are making every effort to track down, and bring to justice, the perpetrators of these terrible crimes.  As regards the manner of the portrayal of the travelling community in the national newspapers, it is, of course, open to any person to complain to the gardaí where that person believes that an offence has been committed under incitement to hatred legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's condemnation of the attempts to make the travelling community scapegoats for recent incidents.  It was certainly reprehensible. I would like to see the Minister intervening at an earlier stage.  I tabled this question so that it could be shown that the presentation in the <Col N="899" /> media was extremely unfair to the travelling community in that it implied involvement by the travelling community as a whole in the groundwork and in the commission of the recent horrific crimes.  This was totally untrue and was an incitement to hatred.  We need to have a method of responding to such coverage more urgently.  Will the Minister say how that might be done in future?  A spokesperson should say this is grossly discriminatory and say it sooner.  I appreciate it is difficult to do so in the middle of the great concern about crime and criminal issues but it is grossly unfair to the travelling community who have been doing such excellent work in their own development and who participate in local communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods' comments.  I deplore the attempt to make the travelling community a general scapegoat.  It behoves the national newspapers, and anybody else who comments in public on these matters, to bear in mind that it is not acceptable to place blame on any minority community for an incident.  There are criminal elements in the travelling community and there are criminal elements in the settled community also. The issue is who has been involved in any crime and the question of what community they belong to should be irrelevant.  It is open to any person to make a complaint to the Garda about that matter.  The incitement to hatred legislation deals with such issues.  All commentators should take note of that legislation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the Employment Equality Agency has adequate power to deal with the growing problem of bullying, abuse of power/dominant position by men against women in the private and public work areas.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most common forms of harassment in the workplace is sexual harassment.  Legal redress is available to victims of this form of behaviour under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, notwithstanding the absence of a specific reference in the Act to sexual harassment.  In 1985 the Labour Court, in a precedent case, ruled &ldquo;that freedom from sexual harassment is a condition of work that an employee of either sex is entitled to expect&rdquo;. Accordingly, the court treats any denial of that freedom as discrimination within the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1994 I published a code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of men and women at work.  This code of practice was prepared by the Employment Equality Agency with the full co-operation of the ICTU and IBEC and, in accordance with a commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the code of practice is being promoted, monitored and reviewed by the Employment Equality Agency.  The agency has sought to ensure as wide as possible distribution of the code and to date in excess of 30,000 copies have been distributed to employers, individuals and other interested parties.  While the present code is not mandatory, the case for legal recognition for such a code is under consideration in the context of the current review of existing legislation.  In addition, I also intend to <Col N="901" /> make more explicit provision to combat sexual harassment in the new Bill which I expect to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the Employment Equality Agency continues to provide advice and assistance to employees and employers in both the public and private sectors on the issue of sexual harassment.  Any person who reports a concern to the agency, the lead experts in this field, will receive a confidential, personal and sympathetic hearing.  It will advise people of their rights and, if necessary, may represent or arrange for them to be represented in proceedings under the employment equality legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said sexual harassment is one of the major grievances in the workplace and that was a finding of the Employment Equality Agency.  I proposed earlier that there might be a helpline, particularly for the public service, to deal with the problem and that much of the harassment is akin to bullying or the abuse of power in the workplace.  This is not being sufficiently highlighted.</P>
      <P>I have had a complaint from a lady staff member in a Civil Service Department. She went to the Employment Equality Agency because she was being harassed, but it said that because the harassment was not explicit or clear-cut sexual harassment, it did not come within its remit.  A great deal of harassment in the workplace involves undermining a person's confidence, bullying and the abuse of power yet the Employment Equality Agency does not see this as being in its remit.  Is it in the agency's remit?  If not it should be, or there should be some other mechanism to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, any matters arising under the 1974 or 1977 legislation would properly come within the remit of the Employment Equality Agency.  The circumstances outlined by Deputy Woods sound rather like sexual harassment but one would have to hear all the circumstances.  The agency has skilled, experienced and professional <Col N="902" /> staff who provide a first class service.  I have not had complaints about its operation in this field.  It operates within the ambit of the law as interpreted by tribunals and courts and it does a good job.  Its advice is available.</P>
      <P>If there are any shortcomings and any particular circumstances may not be within the ambit of the legislation as interpreted by the courts and tribunals, we can examine the matter in the context of the soon to be published employment equality Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One could probably describe it as gender harassment rather than sexual harassment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have certainly come across it.  I would have thought it would come within the ambit of the Employment Equality Agency but the experience in the case to which I referred was that because it did not involve specific sexual harassment, as distinct from gender harassment, it was not covered.</P>
      <P>Harassment is not always sexual but is often an abuse of power undermining people in the workplace.  One could possibly describe it as gender harassment. I welcome the Minister's commitment to examine the issue.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to review the Civil Liability Act, 1961, particularly the section which specifies the amount of compensation for death where there are no dependants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1628/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Part IV of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, gives dependants a statutory right to sue where the death of the deceased has resulted from a wrongful act.  The damages payable to such dependants under this type of claim fall under three headings: funeral expenses; <Col N="903" /> compensation for mental distress &mdash; currently limited to £7,500; and, loss of pecuniary benefits.</P>
      <P>As the Act is framed, the term &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; is defined to mean &ldquo;any member of the family of the deceased who suffers injury or mental distress&rdquo;. Thus, it has a much broader meaning than one might, perhaps, first imagine.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question is focused on the fact that, where a child suffers a fatal accident, damages under the more substantial heading of loss of pecuniary benefits would not arise normally and the principal head of compensation would be the £7,500 which is payable in relation to mental distress.  The same situation could also arise, of course, in relation to other family members, for example, brothers and sisters. I appreciate that individuals in such circumstances might feel this amount does not reflect the pain and grief which such a loss would bring.  However, the provision is not intended to place a monetary value on the life of the deceased person.  Rather, it is a statutory acknowledgment that such pain and grief merits court recognition when a compensation award is being made.  I propose to consider the question of an amendment to the 1961 Act to provide for an increase in the limit of £7,500 on compensation for mental distress.  Any such proposals for legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his commitment in that regard.  There is a section in the Civil Liability Act, 1961, which deals with liability for negligence by local authorities in relation to accidents on footpaths and roadways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-implementation of that section has given rise to the ludicrous distinction between malfeasance and nonfeasance: if a person is injured after a local authority has carried out repairs to a footpath, they have a case against it if the work was done negligently whereas they have no case if the local authority ignores its responsibilities and an accident occurs as a result.  Will the <Col N="904" /> Minister consider implementing the section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat surprising that the section of the Civil Liability Act, 1961 to which the Deputy is referring has not been implemented, but I presume there must be a good reason for this given that successive Governments have failed to implement it.</P>

      <P>In all probability the matter would fall within the ambit of the Minister for the Environment.  I will consider the matter, but the Deputy will understand that the question of the funding of local authorities would arise. I presume that is the reason the section has not been implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The section was inserted for a reason.  It is not logical to insert a section in legislation and then deliberately decide not to implement it.  Will the Minister convey to the Minister for the Environment that the present position is ludicrous?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the figure of £7,500 prescribed as the statutory maximum for damages recoverable for mental distress on the death of a dependant does not vary with the number of dependants and, therefore, has to be divided up among all the dependants as the judge sees fit?  Is he aware that this figure has been fixed for some time and must as a consequence have lost a considerable <Col N="905" /> portion of its value?  Will he indicate what new figure he has in mind?  Would he be favourably disposed towards granting the Minister in any amending legislation a right to vary the amount by regulation rather than have the matter decided once every ten to 15 years when the amount in question becomes scandalously low because of the effect of inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of all the points made by the Deputy.  For all these reasons I am considering increasing the current figure of £7,500 which has remained unchanged since 1981. Prior to that date the relevant figure had remained unchanged for an even longer period.  I will consider all aspects of the matter.  I do not have any particular figure in mind.  If the Deputy or any other Member wishes to make representations, I will consider anything they may say in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the present position is unsatisfactory in that a parent who suffers from shock and trauma after his child has been knocked down can receive damages whereas a person who suffers serious psychological consequences on the death of a child without witnessing the circumstances in which the child was injured and who was not directly involved in the sequence of events cannot claim damages for shock?  While some people rightly recover large sums of money for the devastation of their lives, others because of artificial rules of law are left with a derisory amount in compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The law has evolved in two different streams.  On the one hand, there is a direct damage relationship and, on the other, the provision under which the figure of £7,500 is payable which is on a different base.  It is not intended to compensate for any particular monetary loss, but to be a solatium or recognition.  It was introduced in 1961 for the first time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to bring forward two anti-discrimination Bills &mdash; the employment equality Bill dealing with discrimination in the workplace and the equal status Bill covering non-employment areas. Both Bills will prohibit discrimination in their respective areas on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, <Col N="908" /> race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.  These grounds, and hence the minority groups which will be protected from discrimination, are as set out originally in the Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The employment equality Bill has been included in the Bills expected to be published prior to Easter as outlined last month in the Government legislation programme.  I hope the equal status Bill will be published in the latter part of 1996.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination cannot take place prior to the enactment of these Bills.  The requirements of the Convention are borne in mind in drafting the Bills and I will ensure that any other steps necessary for ratification are identified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have recently met representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Association, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  We agreed that these bodies will let me have their proposals as to how their concerns can be met in the equal status Bill.</P>

      <P>My colleagues and I also met representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Association and the Vintners' Federation of Ireland who are <Col N="909" /> extremely concerned about some of the Minister's proposals.  As the Minister is aware, publicans must maintain order in their houses, but if the legislation is enacted in the manner flagged they will not be able to do so and Garda resources are overstretched.  The Minister is placing more responsibility on vintners, in effect, he is tying their hands.  Does he realise their fears in this regard?  It is not possible for them to control certain people who enter their premises and the Minister proposes to take away their right to refuse such people access.  I hope he takes account of the grave fears of vintners in respect of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenneally stated that I am putting additional responsibilities on vintners.  In broad terms, this legislation will prohibit discrimination against a person on the sole grounds that he or she belongs to a disadvantaged minority group.  The UN Convention on the Discrimination of all forms of Racism has been ratified by 137 countries worldwide.  Ireland is unable to ratify it without these two Bills in place.  I expect the legislation to be brought forward towards the end of this year and enacted with the co-operation of Members on all sides.  In this regard, I welcome Deputy Woods's recent letter confirming his support for the legislation.</P>
      <P>I informed representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Association that I will work with them to achieve agreement, in so far as possible, on the thrust of the legislation and that their suggestions would be considered sympathetically. I reiterate that undertaking to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe any Member would have difficulty with a prohibition in the legislation regarding discrimination on the grounds of race and so on.  The main difficulty is that publicans will have to give a reason for refusing a person access to their premises. There are many known criminals and drug dealers who may not have <Col N="910" /> been convicted in the courts.  If the gardaí are not in a position to prove a case against them, publicans would certainly not be in a position to do so.  Can publicans refuse to serve such people because it is well known that they are drug dealers?  Publicans that do so will be taken to court and subsequently to the cleaners.  That is what the Minister must address in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I would appreciate if the Minister would supply me with a copy of Deputy Woods's letter as I would be interested to know the manner in which he agreed with the Minister's intentions. Will the Minister oblige me in that regard?</P>
      <P>The Minister recently submitted a letter to public representatives stating that the Bill will reflect similar types of legislation in other European Union countries. That is a poor basis on which to introduce this type of legislation here. Our culture and social way of life differs considerably from most other European countries.  I would not like if, as a result of this legislation, we became as dull and as sober as continentals.  I would take issue with the Minister if he attempted to do that.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for Deputy Woods to agree to send a copy to Deputy Deasy.</P>
      <P>Racism is racism whether it takes place in Ireland, Britain, France, Germany or elsewhere.  We must decide whether we wish to ratify the UN convention on racism.  Virtually every other civilised democratic country has ratified it and this legislation is necessary for us to do so.  The Government believes it is necessary for us to ratify it and we must introduce anti-discrimination legislation. The exact basis, terms, onus of proof and so on are matters for the detail of the legislation.  I will be happy to discuss its minutiae when it is finally approved.  That is what Committee Stage debates are for and what democracy is all about.  I will consider sympathetically the suggestions of Members and outside groups.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that publicans must run their businesses.  Many of them have informed me that most of their problems arise with members of the settled &mdash; not the travelling &mdash; community. Racism or discrimination against minority groups is not acceptable and that will be the thrust of these two Bills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point about being criticised in respect of a Bill, the terms of which have not yet been published.  However, the Minister is the author of his own misfortune in that he is a great man for saying what he proposes to do and then spending a great deal of time producing the text.  That may have given rise to some of the controversy in this case.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the issue of the travelling community is not a racist one or is he putting it into that category?  I am fascinated as to whether travellers belong to that category of discrimination. Does the Minister categorise them in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> Will the Minister indicate whether members of sexual minorities will be protected under the equal status legislation? Will it be possible for publicans to take steps, on a discretionary basis, to prevent their premises becoming a gay public house if it is situated in a particular part of a certain city?  Will they have discretion in this regard?  Can they take steps to protect their clientele or pursue a particular admission policy?  Are the managers of gay clubs or public houses entitled to pursue an admission policy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to become involved in a semantic discussion as to whether the position of the travelling community relates to race or any other disadvantaged category.  In many respects they are a disadvantaged category in society.  The report of the task force which examined their situation in all walks of life states that they are a disadvantaged group.  That is the thrust of the legislation.  As to the detail and content of that legislation, we must await the publication of the Bill and its discussion by both Houses in due course.  As I stated earlier, sexual orientation will be one of the categories dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that we welcomed his proposal to proceed with an equal status Bill.  We urge the Minister to introduce it as soon as possible so that the detail can be discussed on Committee Stage.  In that context, the Minister's new proposals require that, in court, licensed vintners defend the reason they refused a person entry to their premises at a particular time.  In a recent letter the Minister pointed out that it will not be necessary to give a reason for refusal of service to a customer at the time of refusal but that it will be necessary to provide a reason subsequently for that refusal, which will cause great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the manager of a premises is suspicious that someone is pushing drugs, a problem with which I am reasonably familiar, he can ask the person to leave. <Col N="913" /> Such action is desired by the community, local residents and patrons of the premises involved.  Similar considerations arise for people attending to their business in supermarkets, etc.  Licensed vintners will not be able to refuse service to anyone if faced with the threat of subsequently appearing in court to argue their case.  The greatest difficulty arises in relation to this issue.  If the Minister has some improved way to deal with discrimination, this will solve the problem in advance.  If not, we will have to deal with it on Committee Stage. That is where the problem lies, however.  People are upset and concerned that they might have to provide a subsequent reason for refusal.  The matter must be resolved on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of strict legislation that the Minister intends to introduce is very different from that which appeared in the advanced billing from his Department.  A great deal of controversy has been generated about this matter because the documentation from the Minister's Department suggested legislation which would require vintners and others to provide &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; reasons for refusals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Many intelligent people throughout the country drew that conclusion from the documentation issued by the Department.  People are genuinely worried about this problem.  I read the Minister's letter about not giving a reason at the time of refusal.  The phrase in the letter regarding providing a reason, though not necessarily at the time a person was refused service, has given rise to great worry and confusion with which the Minister has not dealt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of a judgment handed down in the Dublin Circuit Court by Judge James Carroll which was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on <Col N="914" /> Thursday last?  That judgement seems to establish the principle that business people must be permitted to exercise reasonable control over events on their premises.  As I understand it, this includes the right to refuse service without providing a reason.  If the Minister is not aware of that judgement, I will provide him with a copy.</P>
    <P>With regard to discussing the legislation when it is published, I remind the Minister that the Tánaiste gave me a commitment three months ago that the Government would consider my request to have the Select Committee on Legislation and Security discuss the heads of the Bill before publication.  Has that weighty consideration reached a conclusion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see the newspaper report in question.  However, I agree with Judge James Carroll if he stated that it is necessary for traders to have reasonable control of their premises to enable them to administer their business.  Of course it is necessary for traders to retain reasonable control of their premises.  &ldquo;Reasonable&rdquo; is the operative word.  It is not reasonable for any trader to discriminate against a person on the sole grounds, for example, that the colour of their skin is black. That was the type of discrimination that Members condemned when practised in the form of apartheid in South Africa. That kind of conduct is not reasonable and will be addressed by the legislation.</P>
      <P>At the appropriate time I will be happy to discuss the heads of the Bill with the relevant committee.  It would be premature to do so at present because the legislation is at a very early stage of preparation and has not yet been considered by the Government.  It was considered in draft form by the previous Government but not the present one.  At a later stage, when the matter has matured to an appropriate extent.  I will be happy to discuss it with the relevant committee.  I understand that senior officials from my Department met the committee today to discuss some broad aspects of the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister is missing the point of this discussion.  He was the first person to introduce the issue of the travelling community and black people to the debate.  We have no problems with the Minister's proposals in relation to discrimination.  I have already highlighted our fears regarding the problems we see with the legislation. I ask the Minister to take on board our <Col N="916" /> views and the views of a number of people on the opposite side of the House.  My colleague, Deputy Deasy, wrote an article in the vintner's magazine along those lines.  The Minister mentioned that when the legislation is brought forward we will have an opportunity to table amendments.  We all know that when Ministers come into the House they are reluctant to accept amendments and change legislation but the Minister will be doing everyone a favour, including himself and his own party, if he ensures that those aspects are left out of the Bill before it is published.</P>

I would point out to Deputy Kenneally that his own party and the Labour Party specifically referred to this legislation in their joint programme for Government at the beginning of 1993. The Bill was prepared in draft and approved in head form by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government so the matter has been in existence for a long time.  I do not accept I am missing the point; I understand and appreciate it very well. This is limited legislation in its thrust and intent as set out in that joint programme for Government and continued on as the policy of this Government.  No person should be discriminated against on the ground alone that they are a member of one of the disadvantaged categories of people I listed in my reply.</P>

That is an undesirable trend.  The issue of travellers should not arise in this type of legislation because the most obnoxious people one could meet in a public house, or any public place, are affluent members of the settled community who, after one or two drinks, tell people like myself and other politicians how to run the country.</P>

It appears that neither the Minister, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs nor the Minister for Finance knew what was going on when a decision was being made on the contract in the first instance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 29 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>In the Estimates for my Department in 1996 the Legal Aid Board has been allocated £6.5 million, an increase of approximately 5 per cent over 1995.  As in 1995, funding of £45,000 has been provided for FLAC.  Marriage and children's counselling organisations have been allocated £900,000, compared to expenditure of £750,000 in 1995, and the Family Mediation Service has been allocated £300,000, compared to expenditure of £260,000 in 1995.  Details of the allocations for 1996 are set out in the Estimates for Public Services for 1996 (Abridged Version), copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the allocation for the Family Mediation Service has not been taken up in the past and that it has not been possible to provide a service because of a lack of necessary facilities.  Will the Minister address this issue, given the allocations for 1996?  In view of the outcome of the referendum, does he agree that there is a need to significantly increase early access to services for people who are experiencing marital difficulties?  Am I correct in saying that allocations were not taken up by the mediation service in the past?  I would like to ask a question about the service in Limerick, a later question tabled by me deals specifically with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at this stage the Deputy has gone beyond the bounds of what is a statistical question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Family Mediation Service does very valuable and important work.  The extension and expansion of that service is under way and arrangements are being put in <Col N="924" /> place, hence the increased funding provided for this purpose in the Estimates for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  Were allocations for the mediation service not taken up in previous years?  Can the Minister give an assurance that this will not happen in future given the need for mediation services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was initially expected that a second Family Mediation Service centre in Limerick would be opened last year but this did not prove possible.  I expect that the centre will be opened this year and funding has been provided for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be repetitious but the Minister has not answered my question.  Neither do I want to refer to Limerick because of your ruling, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. However, I understand that money allocated for mediation services was not fully taken up in previous years.  Is the Minister saying that this funding would have been taken up if the centre in Limerick was opened?  If this is not the reason, why was it not taken up, did it go somewhere else or has it been included in this year's allocation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation in the Estimates for the Family Mediation Service for this year is £300,000 while the comparable figure in 1995 was £260,000.  I hope the centre in Limerick will be operational on a full plenary basis later this year.  That is the present position and if Deputy Sargent wants more specific information on what is happening in Limerick he should table a question on the matter.</P>

      <P>Inan Bashir was 29 years of age.  He ran a small newsagent's kiosk at South Quay in Canary Wharf. He was a well known face to hundreds of office workers who bought newspapers and snacks from him before commuting home.  He lived at home with his parents in Streatham, South London.  His brother described him as &ldquo;a lovely man&rdquo;.  He is dead today, killed by the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Jefferies was 31 years of age.  He was helping Mr. Bashir, his friend, because Friday was his busiest day.  He was a keen musician who would occasionally sing songs to amuse customers. He lived at home, the only child of a widowed father, also named John Jefferies, in Bromley, Kent.  Father and son were referred to by neighbours as <Col N="1089" />&ldquo;Big John&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little John&rdquo;.  He too is dead, killed by the IRA.</P>
    <P>Inan Bashir and John Jefferies died because of republican violence.  What did these two young men ever to do Ireland, or do against Irish republicans, to deserve such a death?  Who has a right to decide that Inan Bashir and John Jefferies should die for Ireland?</P>
    <P>Barbara Osei is 23 years of age.  She is still in hospital suffering from horrific injuries caused by flying glass.  Over 100 other people were injured in a shower of flying glass, masonry and metal.  For the remainder of their lives, many of these people &mdash; disfigured, blinded and traumatised &mdash; will wake up at night, thinking they are back in Canary Wharf. What did they do to Ireland, what did they do against republicanism, to deserve such permanent injuries?</P>
    <P>These people did not deserve to suffer. To all who know any of those killed or injured at Canary Wharf, I say the overwhelming majority of Irish people, at home and abroad, share deeply in your grief.  We too are traumatised by your loss.  The tragic deaths of Inan Bashir and John Jefferies on Friday last are a terrible waste of young lives.  I extend my deepest sympathies on behalf of the Irish Government and the Irish people to the relatives of both men. There are many questions still to be answered about the IRA bomb on Friday. Who authorised it?  When did they decide?  Who knew in advance that it would happen?  Who knew when it would happen?  Who knew that it would happen, but was not told the exact date? Who speaks for those who knew?  What would they have to say now if they met Mr. Bashir's brother, or Mr. Jefferies father?  Would they even have the moral courage to meet them?  Would they be able to look into the eyes of the bereaved?</P>
    <P>This is a time of shock and sadness, it is also one for restraint and reconciliation. There will be much analysis, much writing about what has happened. As I have said many times, it is true that some could have done more to underpin the peace.  It is also true that others did <Col N="1090" /> more than could ever have been expected.  I do not propose to attempt to spread the blame.</P>
    <P>I have made my position clear.  The blame for the suffering and deaths of innocent people rests solely on the shoulders of those who agreed to, who knew about, and those who planned and planted the bomb at Canary Wharf.  Let us not become so lost in the moral fog that we cannot see this clearly.</P>
    <P>Democratic politics is about the resolution of conflict.  Politics is an inexact science, but politics will always be needed, because there will always be a conflict to be resolved.  In trying to resolve conflict, politicians always have made, and always will make mistakes.  In this they are no different from the rest of humanity.  However, there is a deep and fundamental difference between occasional selfishness and the normal human errors that democratic politicians might make, and the use of violence to achieve political ends.</P>
    <P>There is no moral equivalence between killing people to achieve political ends and making mistakes in the course of non-violent politics.  They are entirely different, and we must be absolutely clear about this difference.</P>
    <P>The British Government made a mistake in its response to the Mitchell report.  The Unionist parties made a mistake in not sitting down with Sinn Féin and asking them the hard questions face to face, but a comparison cannot be drawn between political mistakes and the response to those mistakes that took human life.  Killing is never justified as part of the political process.  Killing is never justified as part of a negotiation. Killing is not an acceptable passport to negotiations.</P>
    <P>A Government cannot allow murder, or the threat of murder, to set the political agenda.  Our State is founded on democratic principles.  We do not use violence, and we reject those who do, and those who accept political support from those who use violence.  If we accept violence in one area of life, then we are opening the door to the <Col N="1091" /> acceptability of violence in other areas of life.</P>
    <P>It is part of the role of government in a democracy to protect people from violence from every quarter.</P>
    <P>As leader of the Opposition, before I became Taoiseach, I made an act of faith when in this House I said in September 1994 I believed in Sinn Féin, and I was willing to believe that the IRA had ended the killing for good.  Since then I have reguarly met and trusted Sinn Féin.  Even last week I had an amicable meeting with Sinn Féin including Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. I accepted that Sinn Féin was committed exclusively to advancing its cause by peaceful, democratic politics.  I believed they had made an irreversible commitment to peace.  That act of faith has now been thrown back in my face by the IRA.</P>
    <P>I ask Sinn Féin to tell me how we can restore that faith.  Let Sinn Féin tell the Government this publicly, because this is the public's business and not just the stuff of private meetings.  Let Sinn Féin say what it has to say to all the Irish people, not just to me.</P>
    <P>I still want to talk to Gerry Adams about peace.  I share the frustration that he, and others, feel about the pace of political progress in Northern Ireland.  I cannot do so until Sinn Féin persuade the IRA to say, and prove by what it does, that violence has no place in the political process.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has influence with the IRA. Sinn Féin and the IRA are part of the one republican movement.  Sinn Féin can, from time to time, speak authoritatively for the IRA.  It persuaded the IRA to stop the killing 17 months ago.  It can persuade it to do so again.  Sinn Féin must now speak to the IRA and convey a simple unambiguous message: killing does not serve our people.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear.  We have not shut any door on Sinn Féin, but we will not meet it at ministerial level until the IRA campaign is called off.  I welcome Deputy Bertie Ahern's support, on RTE's &ldquo;6.01 News&rdquo; on Sunday, for that <Col N="1092" /> policy &ldquo;of not formally meeting with Sinn Féin, going back to what had been the practice over a number of years&rdquo;.  I also welcome the support by the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Mary Harney.  This is no more than I would have expected from two democratic parties in Dáil Éireann.  This Government's policy is the same as the one followed by Mr. de Valera, Mr. Costello, Mr. Lemass, Mr. Lynch, Mr. Cosgrave, Mr. Haughey, Dr. FitzGerald, and Deputy Albert Reynolds.  There were no handshakes or photocalls in Government Buildings until the killing was stopped, nor will there be now. That firm policy helped bring us the peace and it will do so again.</P>
    <P>Our decision puts down a moral marker on what Irish society considers to be civilised political behaviour.  It puts down a political marker in relation to what we expect of Sinn Féin.  It also represents a security marker.  I am speaking here about the security of the State and of all who live in our own towns and countryside.</P>
    <P>As the SDLP Deputy Leader Seamus Mallon said on RTE television last night, &ldquo;Our party, the SDLP, recognises that any sovereign Government, in a sovereign State, has a duty to protect that sovereign State, and I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that I believe, in this instance, that the Irish Government had no option whatsoever but to take this stance&rdquo;.  He continued: &ldquo;You cannot have a situation where a sovereign Government one day, or one hour, is sitting having discussions and negotiations with a political party that is part of a movement which is murdering people and one hour later having to go themselves in front of the television cameras or on the steps of Government Buildings to explain that&rdquo;.  Mr. Mallon underscored the particular responsibility on Government, as Government, to protect the democratic institutions of the State from complicity, or the suspicion of complicity, in acts of terror.</P>
    <P>The Government's door is open to Sinn Féin.  I will talk to Gerry Adams and his colleagues as soon as they go to <Col N="1093" /> the IRA and succeed in getting it to say that it will stop killing people.  In the meantime, Government officials are in daily contact with Sinn Féin and reporting to me on what Sinn Féin has to say.  The Tánaiste and I are willing to authorise a face to face meeting at official level with Sinn Féin.  This meeting can take place on the basis that Sinn Féin would bring forward their ideas on how the ceasefire can be restored.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that there are people in the republican movement who believe in peaceful politics and are using their influence to get the IRA to stop killing.  The Government is supporting John Hume in his enormous efforts to persuade the IRA to end violence.  If the IRA clearly states that the cessation of violence is restored, the Government will resume full political discussion with Sinn Féin.  I urge the leadership of Sinn Féin to think strategically as well as tactically. All democratic politicians have experienced tactical setbacks.  I believe, and have said, that recent British Government responses were tactical setbacks for the Irish Government but such setbacks have not, and will not, deter us from our strategic goal of agreement between the people on this island.</P>
    <P>The republican movement must understand that a peace process cannot be just a tactic, something to turn on and off to relieve the frustrations that will arise as part of any political process. It must come to understand that all democratic politics anywhere are based on the principle of consent &mdash; consent not to use violence, to accept the same rules as apply to others and to abide by collective decisions.  The republican movement, as a whole, must reflect on the principle it signed up to when it joined the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, namely &ldquo; that all differences relating to the right of self-determination of the people of Ireland, and to all other matters, will be resolved exclusively by peaceful and democratic means&rdquo;.  Sinn Féin needs to think about what that means for its current attitude to the IRA bomb in London.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> Sinn Féin did not make a mistake when it embraced the peace process. The peace process was working.  Let me itemise the progress that has been made so far, which shows why the republican movement should have persevered with the peace process.  The British Government has accepted that it no longer has any selfish or strategic interest in Ireland, and that it will accept the will of the people of Northern Ireland on their political future.  It is now for the people to find a basis for agreement, with the support and involvement of both Irish and British Governments.  As a result of the cessation of violence, British and Irish Ministers were freely meeting with Sinn Féin.  Highly accomplished reports on many issues of relevance to the Northern Ireland situation were compiled by the parties at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  We were closer than we had ever been at the time of the IRA bomb in London to the goal of all party talks.  The British and Irish Governments had agreed a firm aim of launching all party negotiations by the end of this month.  There was, as Prime Minister Major's speech showed yesterday, a lot of work going on on alternative mechanisms for launching these negotiations on a basis that would allow everybody to take part, including Sinn Féin and the Unionists.  The Mitchell report had just been published and provided a carefully balanced formula for getting over the roadblock in regard to decommissioning of arms.</P>
    <P>More than that, last week had been characterised by a considerable intensification of the political track.  The Government's proposal for proximity talks was gaining real momentum towards all-party negotiations by the end of this month, as agreed between the two Governments.  The Tánaiste's visit to the United States, and in particular his discussions with President Clinton, went very well.  His meeting with the Progressive Unionist Party in the political track was a milestone.  The Government's face-to-face discussions with the SDLP, the Alliance Party and Sinn Féin were most constructive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> On the morning of Friday, the day of the bombing, I had a very positive meeting with four key Conservative Party backbench MPs who were, I believe, beginning to appreciate the merit and practicality of the Irish Government's proposal for proximity talks.</P>
    <P>As all such progress was being made the IRA decided to ignite a bomb in London.  Apart from its immorality, this bomb was a drastic political mistake from the point of view of the cause of Ireland.  Let me tell the House what we have been working on, and continue to work on, with the British Government. We are working on an inclusive, democratic mechanism that will be ready and waiting for Sinn Féin and the republican movement to participate in as soon as the IRA renounce violence.  We want to build a vehicle that will accommodate the two Governments, the Unionists and the Nationalist communities in all-party negotiations.  We want Sinn Féin to be part of that.  It has much to contribute. But before it joins us in rebuilding the peace process, it must get the IRA to stop killing for political purposes. The Government sincerely hopes that Sinn Féin will influence the IRA to reach that decision.  That is why it is leaving open channels of communication to that end at official level.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Government will do everything possible to get the peace process back on track.  In particular, it will work closely with the British Government to steer the process through this difficult stage.  I had a very constructive telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister on Sunday evening.  We agreed on two key objectives &mdash; first, to bring an immediate end to violence and secure a restoration of the IRA ceasefire and, second, to persevere with our work towards the commencement of all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>With a view to advancing those objectives, the Prime Minister and I agreed to meet as planned later this month. There is much for both Governments to build on.  Progress at times since the end of August 1994 may have been slow, but <Col N="1096" /> set against the history of three centuries of fundamental political division in the ancient province of Ulster, the pace and nature of work in the last two years towards a lasting, all-inclusive settlement was quite unprecedented.</P>
    <P>Imaginative intergovernmental understandings were reached.  The Joint Framework Document set out for the first time a shared British/Irish model of a possible agreement that was designed to give impetus, focus and direction to all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>The US Administration led by President Clinton was, and still is, an active participant in the peace process.  The Mitchell report on decommissioning offered new and challenging insights on the way forward to immediate political negotiations.  The work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation provided clear focus on realities, principles and requirements.  Recently, we launched our proposal for proximity talks as a mechanism to achieve the firm aim of all-party negotiations set out in the November communiqué.</P>
    <P>All these developments were against a general background of peace dividends for everyone &mdash; reduced security, economic rejuvenation and above all, the freedom from the oppressive fear of bombs and bullets.  Those dividends, and the potential for their further development, will guide the actions of the Government.  We will relentlessly pursue the objective of a lasting political agreement.  Our commitment to the aim of reaching a fair and balanced settlement remains undiminished.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister said his mind is not closed.  Nor is mine.  In that spirit, and following on my phone call with him on Sunday, I put a series of issues to him on which work needs to be undertaken before our planned meeting before the end of this month.  The matters I suggested we consider together are: the creation of a way forward that Sinn Féin could honourably join, and into which it would be accepted by the other participants, once the IRA campaign is over; whether, and how, an elective process, which is broadly <Col N="1097" /> acceptable and fully within the three strand structure and which followed from proximity talks, might lead directly and speedily, without equivocation, to all-party negotiations.  In that context I welcome John Major's openness to the ideas of others in finding the way to a restoration of the ceasefire.  I note his statement that elections would give the electoral mandates and confidence which could lead straightaway to negotiations; the way in which proximity talks, which would enable the two Governments to clear up doubts and misunderstandings in the minds of the participants about all proposals, might be helpful; how these talks could enable us to be as clear as possible in advance on how the principles and modalities of the Mitchell report would fit into any &ldquo;elective process &mdash; all-party negotiations&rdquo; proposal.  This could deal with the real danger that because of lack of proper procedural understanding, an impasse over decommissioning could unexpectedly paralyse negotiations at any stage.  I made very clear the Irish Government's view that the presentation of any way forward must take account of the justifiable fears of Nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland.  Neither the elective approach nor any other approach should be presented as a foregone conclusion or as a policy to be imposed.</P>
    <P>This preparatory work for the meeting between me and the British Prime Minister must also now take on board the very welcome and interesting proposal from John Hume for referendums North and South.  This proposal has considerable merit as it would afford all on this island the opportunity to state in a unique way their opposition to violence and their wish for all-party negotiations. It would show that the only electoral mandate any of us have is to use exclusively peaceful methods.  It would end the theology of violence, and would endorse the demand for talks without threats.  The Government would be prepared to give top priority to the necessary legislation, if agreement is reached on the terms of such referendums and <Col N="1098" /> the issue of how best to avail of President Clinton's offer, when I spoke to him on Friday night, of his support, and that of his Administration, for the restoration of the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am satisfied that a viable basis exists, despite the terrible act on Friday, to restore peace to the people of these islands and this time to underpin it on a democratic basis, provided Sinn Féin uses its influence for peace, and the IRA clearly says that a total cessation is again in place.</P>
    <P>I ask the IRA to think again.  A quarter of a century of violence did not progress any of your political aims.  It divided Ireland more than ever before. There is no escaping the truth that bombs and bullets do not persuade people to change their minds.  Violence is a bankrupt substitute for peaceful persuasion and patient negotiations.  I urge every Deputy in this House and everybody in Ireland to join me in an unambiguous call for the restoration of the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I extend our deepest sympathies to the families, relatives and all those who knew Inan Bashir and John Jeffries on their tragic deaths.  We extend our sympathy to all those who were injured and hope they will have a quick recovery to full health.  From photographs and reports in the media we know many of them, unfortunately, will not get back to total health in the short-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people regard the bombing in London last Friday night and the breakdown of the 17 month IRA ceasefire as an absolute tragedy.  It should not and need not have happened and must not be allowed to continue.  The IRA holds sole responsibility for the renewed bombing.  The impasse in the peace process is something for which we are all responsible.  All of us involved must learn from our mistakes.  The peace process must be put back on the rails again, if possible, before further tragedy occurs.  In this House we must give the reasons Sinn Féin must now go back to <Col N="1099" /> the IRA and ask it to stop before it is too late, before the renewed cancer of violence spreads to Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>My central theme will be what needs to be done.  We should approach the matter in three ways: our attitude to the London bombing and the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire; the lessons to be learned from the way the peace process has been handled in the past 17 months; and how we can best proceed to restore the integrity of the peace process before further irreparable damage is done.  It is four months since I, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, requested a debate in this House so that we could talk at length about problems in the North.  I know from the Whips that during the next two days most Members of the House will endeavour to contribute to the debate &mdash; more than half the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party have already listed their names. That is proof that people are prepared to join the Taoiseach in extending their sympathies to those who were killed and injured and in ensuring the process is retrieved.</P>
    <P>What has been most lacking in the peace process to date is a spirit of generosity. Before I make some difficult and harsh statements on this issue, I will say something positive about the achievement and maintenance of the ceasefires and the peace process during the past 17 months. The peace process has been a magnificent achievement of which Irish people at home and abroad have felt justifiably proud and which has been greatly admired all over the world.  Loyalists, even if they define their nationality differently, have shared in that pride.  To give a single example, the Irish peace process has been an inspiration to the people and politicians of the Basque country who are also caught in the grip of violence that is difficult to end.</P>
    <P>The Irish peace process was largely a creation of the Irish people and was sustained by them most especially by Nationalists and loyalists.  Both sets of paramilitary organisations held their <Col N="1100" /> ceasefires with a discipline that has few parallels elsewhere.  Even those who disagreed with the ceasefires, some in smaller paramilitary organisations, nonetheless respected the will of the people and of the community.</P>
    <P>The peace process owes a great deal to dialogue and to the political courage and risk-taking by leaders in both the republican and loyalist organisations as well as political leaders like John Hume and Deputy Albert Reynolds.  Like many others of different political persuasions, I had come to admire the personal commitment and courage of many of the republican and loyalist leaders whom I have come to know.  I feel some sympathy for many of them in the difficult and awful predicaments they now face.  In particular, Gerry Adams deserves credit for persuading the IRA to accept a complete ceasefire and to make a definitive commitment to the peace process, even if it has now broken it.  He should get some assistance consistent with democratic principles, to help to restore it, but this time it must really be for good.  I and my party, in the right spirit, intend to give him whatever constructive help we can, but the political atmosphere will be poisoned and trust will be impossible, if a constant sense of threat continues to hang over us.</P>
    <P>The democratic process is slow and frustrating.  All of us in this House know that and the constitutional Nationalist politicians of the SDLP are even more aware of it.  Political progress is never automatic.  Serious and prolonged setbacks are something we all experience from time to time.  We have to tackle these difficulties politically and in democratic ways.  Eighteen months is far too short a period to test what the democratic alternative can deliver, particularly when 25 years of violence delivered so little.  If 25 years of paramilitary campaign could not deliver measurable progress towards a united Ireland or British withdrawal, what is the justification for going back to it and giving up on the political process after <Col N="1101" /> only 18 months, when its long-term potential has scarcely even been tried?</P>
    <P>I understood the argument that IRA leaders could not bind a future generation, and therefore, hesitated to use the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;, but it was reasonable to expect that after one generation had been blighted by conflict, the coming generation would be given a full opportunity to see what peace and democratic politics could achieve over the next 25 years.</P>
    <P>Virtually everyone in this country is horrified and appalled by the bombing of an office block in the East End of London, and by the accompanying statement that announced the end of the IRA ceasefire.  Bombings by their nature, no matter what warnings are given, inflict sudden death and injury on the civilian population in a way that can never be calculated in advance.  Those who allow or order them to be planted can justifiably be accused of a callous disregard for human life.  What have two poor workers done that they should be blown to smithereens, and why should around 100 office workers, travelling home on a Friday evening, be showered with splinters of glass?  What credit do such actions confer on the Irish cause? The IRA statement speaks of removing injustices.  Can the IRA not see all the human injustices that last Friday night's bombing and a sustained campaign of violence would create?</P>
    <P>Britain is our most important economic partner.  The Irish economy, North and South, and those looking for employment here will also suffer in different ways as a result of last Friday night's bombing.  Many here who might have earned a living next summer in the tourism trade or who might have found employment in new industrial or service projects may not do so now.  As in every conflict, ordinary working people suffer most.  The bombers may have thought they were damaging the city of London, and no doubt they were, but they were also hitting the heart of every provincial town and city in Ireland, even if they remain physically unscathed.</P>
    <P>We believe it is a profound political <Col N="1102" /> miscalculation by those who carried out or authorised this bombing to believe that their political case will be strengthened by last Friday's action.  On the contrary, they have made the task of those in Sinn Féin who have argued their political cause infinitely more difficult. They raise a doubt as to whether any reliance can be placed in future on Sinn Féin's influence with the IRA or on Sinn Féin assurances with regard to the IRA's further intentions.  The bomb has damaged the credibility of all of us who urged people to put their trust in the commitment to peace of the movement which combines Sinn Féin and the IRA.</P>
    <P>The long-suffering people of Northern Ireland deserve better than the prospect they now face.  They have been through 25 years of a bloody and pointless conflict, and they do not want to go through it again.  There is more to life than politics.  It is not true that there has been no benefit to the people from the peace.  Life has been easier and more relaxed.  Most of the fear had gone, creating a greater sense of freedom. Plans and projects for the improvement of the economic and social conditions, even in the most deprived areas, were being discussed and, in some cases, were in progress.  Security had been scaled down.  Cross-Border roads were being reopened.  There was new hope of a better life for the future, even if there remained immense political difficulties with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>The people of Northern Ireland do not deserve to be plunged back into the fear and the reality of random death by bombs or sectarian assassination.  Their children deserve a better future.  Two of the biggest atrocities on this island over the past 25 years occurred outside Northern Ireland, in the Republic. While the Garda will do everything to protect people, we have no guarantee of immunity.  Well over 3,000 people died during the past 25 years.  I do not want to see anyone on this island or on these islands die as a result of renewed political violence, but time is fast running out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> If the ceasefire is restored, this country, North and South, faces an exceptionally bright economic future which will benefit all our people and will have some influence in bringing the two parts of the island closer together in many ways.  That future will be partially blighted if full-scale violence returns. We will feel the effects, directly or indirectly, whether or not we are directly subjected to attacks.  Renewed violence would cost us millions of pounds in extra taxes and lost opportunities.</P>
    <P>I now come to deal with the political aspects of the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire.  The original IRA statement promised &ldquo;a complete cessation of military operations&rdquo; and &ldquo;a definitive commitment&rdquo; to the success of the democratic process.  The IRA and Sinn Féin understood quite well that the commitment required of them, and which they gave, represented the equivalent of a permanent end to violence, even though the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; was not used. &ldquo;Definitive&rdquo; is defined in the dictionary as meaning &ldquo;finally fixing or settling something&rdquo;, &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;.  It means that there can be no alteration of intent, no going back.  Martin McGuinness gave the assurance that the ceasefire would hold &ldquo;in all circumstances&rdquo;.  On 6 September 1994 Gerry Adams, with John Hume and Deputy Albert Reynolds, issued a statement which commenced:</P>
    <P>We are at the beginning of a new era in which we are all totally and absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving our political problems.</P>
    <P>Similar joint statements have been made with the present Government. Sinn Féin joined the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on the basis of terms of reference which stated:</P>
    <P>It will be a fundamental guiding principle of the Forum and of participation in it, that all differences relating to the exercise of the right of self-determination of the people of <Col N="1104" /> Ireland, and to all other matters, will be resolved exclusively by peaceful and democratic means.</P>
    <P>Last week the Sinn Féin delegation agreed to a statement in the Forum report that:</P>
    <P>the first principle must be the right to peace, based on justice.  Flowing from this right is the principle that the pursuit of all political goals, including the establishment of an overall political settlement, must be undertaken by exclusively democratic and peaceful means, characterised by dialogue and free from violence and coercion.</P>
    <P>The renewed IRA campaign is not compatible with any of these statements.</P>
    <P>There are now enormous contradictions in the position of both the IRA and Sinn Féin.  In the past the IRA had a reputation for keeping its word.  On 31 August 1994 all sides of this House accepted the permanence of intent.  I am very disappointed that the present IRA has not kept its word.  Those of us on the Nationalist side, the Irish Government, Fianna Fáil and other parties in this House, John Hume and the SDLP, Irish-Americans and the Administration of President Clinton, all feel profoundly disappointed.  Some will argue, pointing to the continued state of preparedness of the IRA, that from the start its commitment to peace was not made entirely in good faith, was only conditional, not unconditional, and that, in practice, it was keeping its options open.  It will be said that the action last Friday has provided Unionists and the British Government retrospectively with some basis for their claims of justification for doubting all along the IRA's position.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are many senior people and ordinary members in Sinn Féin, and even in the IRA, who were committed to the peace process, who knew nothing in advance about the decision to end the ceasefire and who did not agree with it.  From the point of view of IRA volunteers in August 1994, the leadership brought about a peace with honour, which was neither victory <Col N="1105" /> nor defeat, but which allowed Sinn Féin to transfer for good their struggle onto the political and democratic plain.  It could prove much more difficult, if violence continues, to restore peace on the same terms that volunteers will find honourable or acceptable.  That is the reality which must be faced before all boats are burnt.  When conflict really begins, all sides tend to up their demands, making peace more difficult. We can already see this beginning to happen.</P>
    <P>I have always known and understood that Sinn Féin and the IRA are determined to stay together as part of the one movement.  I have always believed and tried to persuade others that attempts to create splits or talk up alleged ones are counterproductive, that their discipline has been more an ally during the peace process than an enemy.  It is far more important to us that internal debate should result in a restoration of the ceasefire than that public condemnations be expressed which would create an open split and nullify the influence of those who might be able to bring it about.</P>
    <P>How could the IRA call an end to the peace process without apparently even informing or consulting many of those who spoke for its political movement and who had been battling politically on its behalf?  On the face of it, the IRA has treated some of the leaders of its political movement with contempt, and seriously prejudiced its ability to serve them in the future, by damaging their credibility.  A French newspaper, which had no axe to grind one way or the other, wrote at the weekend that this outrage has wiped out years of effort by the leaders of Sinn Féin to give a certain respectability to the republican movement associated with terrorism for 20 years.</P>
    <P>While I understand the political frustration that was building up, without in any way excusing the decision to end the ceasefire, experience has demonstrated that violence leads nowhere.  I note the IRA statement ending the ceasefire is short on defined aims or the <Col N="1106" /> character of what may follow, whether it consists of a once-off event, a limited series of actions, or a full-scale campaign. It clearly represents a provocation to other paramilitaries, which I hope they will firmly resist.  However, loyalists have nothing to gain by joining in.  I understand the difficulty that responsible leaders have in controlling all their volunteers from undertaking hasty and instinctive reflex actions. They should leave dissuasion of the IRA to the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, North and South, and to the forces of the State.  I assure them that Fianna Fáil, and I believe all other parties in this House, will remain totally wedded to the principles of the Downing Street Declaration, including the principle of consent as there defined. That is what we spoke to them about when we were in Government and we are committed to it.  It is imperative that there be no further acts of violence from any side, as each act of violence will make the restoration of peace under any reasonable conditions even more difficult.</P>
    <P>The peace process was not built on the imposition of political tests.  In Government, Fianna Fáil did not require that people give up deeply held convictions or ideological beliefs, even where these may in practice have been one of the sources of conflict.  It was far more important that the IRA campaign should have ended than that it accepted the principle of consent, which is essentially a political requirement.</P>
    <P>Professor Eide, a respected Norwegian international lawyer, who undertook an important study for the Forum states: &ldquo;Numerous territorial arrangements made in earlier times would, if they had been effected today, be seen as a violation of present-day international law.  Since they are already in existence, however, they must be accepted until such time as there is consent to change. On the other hand, it is obviously legitimate to openly argue in favour of change to seek to achieve the necessary consent to bringing it about&rdquo;.  This reflects exactly the understanding that <Col N="1107" /> underlay Fianna Fáil's discussions on self-determination and consent, both with Sinn Féin and the British Government, in the drafting of a joint declaration that eventually became the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>I believe the alleged justification in international law for the position on national self-determination that underlies the Sinn Féin analysis and the IRA's armed struggle is fundamentally flawed. Self-determination means government by consent but, as John Hume has often pointed out, the will of the Irish people to solve their differences and conflicts by exclusively political means is not in doubt and has on numerous occasions been overwhelmingly demonstrated.  In practice the present-day IRA has ignored the principle of national self-determination. The people of Ireland have, over and over again, expressed in unmistakeable fashion at elections their will that their profound differences have to be resolved by exclusively political means.</P>
    <P>There should be no doubt about the position of Fianna Fáil.  While we consider partition was a grave injustice and contrary to the principle of national self-determination, if it had been correctly observed at the time, we cannot ignore the lapse of time and treat Northern Ireland 75 years on as if it had never existed.  Most of the Irish people, while they would like to see a united Ireland brought about in due course by peaceful means and agreement, have no wish to coerce an unwilling Unionist majority into a united Ireland against their will. As they confirmed in 1994, Sinn Féin does not believe on the face of it in coercion either.  In any case, practical reality dictates that coercion will not work.  There is not the power to do it, and it would not be right even for anyone to talk of it.  In the joint statement on 6 September 1994, Albert Reynolds, John Hume and Gerry Adams stated: &ldquo;We reiterate that we cannot resolve this problem without the participation and agreement of the Unionist people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will be honest and say that like <Col N="1108" /> many people, I have great difficulty in understanding the tortuous distinctions between non-coercion, veto and consent. Sinn Féin accepts on the one hand that a Protestant majority in the north cannot be coerced into a united Ireland, but vehemently denies it has a right of veto over it.  It accepts that Unionist agreement is needed for any settlement, but denies that the consent of a majority in the North is required.  Quite frankly, most of us find such distinctions difficult to grasp and doubt their substance of reality.  Yet they seem to be a cause or source of conflict.</P>
    <P>I will give another example.  The first draft of the Downing Street Declaration which had the support of John Hume and Gerry Adams as well as conditional IRA support as a possible basis for peace, the text of which is to be found in a 1994 <i>Political Quarterly</i>, stated in paragraph 5, speaking of the Taoiseach: &ldquo;He accepts, on behalf of the Irish Government, that the democratic right of self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with the agreement and consent of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;. This last clause was slightly amplified in the course of negotiation with the British to &ldquo;with and subject to the agreement and consent of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Are we to believe, as suggested in a weekend newspaper analysis, that that sort of fine verbal distinction is part of the basis for the renewed IRA armed struggle?  Is it not the truth that republicans have always been torn between the generous notion of needing and seeking Unionist agreement and the more ideological belief that in the last analysis Unionist consent is not required?  Less dogmatic rigidity on the part of Sinn Féin in certain areas could have contributed greatly to increased momentum and confidence in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The IRA, if it continues down its present path, will infallibly destroy the current peace process, which was one of the most noble endeavours created in Ireland this century, and the Nationalist consensus on which it was based.  If that <Col N="1109" /> violence goes on, I predict it will ultimately destroy itself and its movement because, without support among the Irish people, it will not survive in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The IRA has the capacity to do immense damage to the wider interests of Nationalist Ireland and to discredit by association the whole basis of the peace process and many of those who worked on it.  In August 1994, it took, on the basis of a fundamentally sound analysis, a long-term strategic decision. It is short-sighted to devalue that strategic decision to a tactical one.  The breakdown of the IRA ceasefire will make it impossible to maintain any inclusive Nationalist consensus. Nationalist Ireland will be weakened and divided, and in some less friendly quarters, discredited.  It is ironic that the Nationalist consensus for peace should have been abandoned at a time when, led by the Irish Government, it was functioning reasonably well with strong support from Washington.</P>
    <P>I am also very surprised and disappointed that members of the IRA should have allowed themselves to be provoked into a serious blunder by British Government obstruction and what in effect was an attempted Unionist veto on inclusive political talks.  There will of course be a certain grim satisfaction at the turn of events in some of these quarters.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the way the peace process has been handled, particularly by the British Government. Again, I would like to praise before I blame.  The Government of John Major did contribute with the Irish Government to the breakthrough of the IRA ceasefire.  The British Prime Minister, John Major, deserves full credit &mdash; as I have said many times already in this House and elsewhere &mdash; for his contribution to the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document.  I fully accept that if he had been solely concerned with parliamentary arithmetic, John Major would never have become involved in the peace process.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I regret that his fine <Col N="1110" /> part in that achievement has more recently been overshadowed by serious mishandling of the peace process by the British Government over the last 12 months.  I believe that the peace process would still be intact today if it had been better and more sensitively handled, and without any loss of democratic principle. A little more understanding, generosity and confidence-building would have made all the difference to persuading the IRA to stick to their commitment to democratic politics as now providing the only way forward.</P>
    <P>I am saying very little today that I have not said in private to various British representatives or that I have not argued in public before the ceasefire broke down.  The British Government did not fulfil its own commitments.</P>
    <P>First, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement the British Government promised to work together with the Irish Government to accommodate the rights and identities of the two traditions.  The solo British run, announcing an elected body without any proper consultation with the Irish Government, the day the Mitchell report was published was in clear breach of the spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was a throwback to the unilateral Prior initiative of 1982 which was launched without consultation with the then Irish Government.  Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that type of approach was meant to be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>Second, in the Downing Street Declaration, the British Government promised &ldquo;to work together&rdquo; with the Irish Government to achieve agreement, and &ldquo;to encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement of such agreement through a process of dialogue&rdquo;.  In paragraph 10 they promised that democratically-man-dated parties showing a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods would be free to participate fully in democratic politics, and to join in dialogue between the Governments and the political parties on the way ahead.  That right of full participation was denied by the British Government to Sinn Féin for over a <Col N="1111" /> year because of the creation of a subsequent precondition.  Sir Patrick Mayhew keeps saying Unionists will not turn up to talks in this or that format. What efforts did he make to persuade them?  If the British Government could talk freely to Sinn Féin, and even invite two SF councillors into Downing Street, why did they never publicly urge Unionists that it was time for them to talk to Sinn Féin?  Why were the Labour and Liberal Democratic Parties not doing the same?</P>
    <P>Third, prior to the ceasfire on 4 January 1994 John Major pledged in the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i>, &ldquo;If they renounce violence &mdash; for good &mdash; and show they mean it then Sinn Féin have the clear prospect of entering into the talks process, with the other constitutional parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Five days later he promised:</P>
    <P>We've offered them a route into the democratic talks themselves.  That is what is on offer.  All they have to do is give up violence ... will the IRA give up violence in order to enter into talks in the democratic process?</P>
    <P>On 26 May 1994 at a press conference John Major said about Gerry Adams: &ldquo;there is an opportunity for him to give up violence and then in a short while to enter the constitutional talks&rdquo;.  Sixteen months after the ceasefire, more than a short while has long since elapsed.  The IRA called a ceasefire on the basis that they would be admitted to all-party negotiations on a three strand basis, with the Framework Document, not on the basis of being allowed to join an elected body or assembly.</P>
    <P>Fourth, in the Framework Document of February 1995, the British Government declared with the Irish Government that the climate of peace &ldquo;transforms the prospects for political progress, that &ldquo;everyone now has a role to play in moving irreversibly beyond the failures of the past&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;a vital dimension of the three-stranded <Col N="1112" /> process was the search for new institutions and structures to take account of the totality of relationships&rdquo;.  They acknowledged the widespread desire &ldquo;to see negotiations under way as soon as possible&rdquo;.  They hoped to give impetus and direction to the process. They undertook &ldquo;to deploy their political resources with the aim of securing a new and comprehensive agreement involving the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland and commanding the widest possible support&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In recent months it seemed that the British Government had abandoned its commitment to early all-party talks so clearly set out in the Framework Document. Indeed, its political resources were, if anything, deployed in the opposite direction, to put up new obstacles to progress.  I will not dwell on the commitment to all-party talks at the end of February that were promised in the 28 November 1995 communiqué, a commitment that had again effectively been abandoned by the British Government before last Friday.</P>
    <P>If Sinn Féin and the IRA have severe credibility problems in the light of commitments they have made, so too unfortunately do the British Government. Over the past 18 months they singularly failed to provide any credible or broadly acceptable route into all-party talks.  In public at least it was not apparent that they had lifted a finger to urge Unionists towards talks.</P>
    <P>In the absence of victory or defeat for one side, did the British Government seriously expect the peace to last absolutely indefinitely if there were no progress towards negotiations?  Were they not exposing the peace to huge risks by placing it under almost intolerable strain?  For example, what would have happened in South Africa, the Middle East or Yugoslavia or any other conflict area if, after a ceasefire had been painfully secured, no round-table negotiations were to take place over 17 months, if one principal party to the conflict &mdash; in this case Sinn Féin because of its associations &mdash; continued to be excluded from the conference table? <Col N="1113" /> The British Government tried to treat Sinn Féin and the IRA to all intents and purposes as defeated parties on whom they could impose terms at will and with whom the understandings on which the peace was based could be safely ignored.  There was never the slightest acknowledgment by the British of the republican or loyalist contribution to peace.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere was spoilt from the beginning by British quibbles about the original IRA ceasefire statement.  This was then replaced by an unrealistic precondition about decommissioning, against which they were warned by successive Irish Governments and out of which they proceeded to create a serious obstacle.</P>
    <P>When the Mitchell report eventually provided a solution to that problem within hours a proposed elected body was promptly interposed and perceived as yet another stalling tactic or worse.  It allowed republican critics of the peace process to argue plausibly that the British Government had never acted in good faith, that there was no intention of ever allowing all-party talks to take place, except on humiliating and one-sided terms that involved unacceptable political or military preconditions.  As many of us in this House have argued repeatedly, how could we demonstrate the superiority of the political alternative if Sinn Féin continued to be denied full participation in it, as originally set out?</P>
    <P>Lack of generosity also applied to prisoners.  I have been told many times by very good inside senior people that if even 50 prisoners in the North had been given early release the ceasefire would still be intact today.  In Britain the Home Secretary stiffened the regime for many long-serving prisoners in Britain, while minimal concessions were made to prisoners in the North.  People seemed determined to ignore the role both republican and loyalist prisoners had played in securing and supporting the ceasefires and to play to the Gallery of right-wing Tory opinion.  The Unionists were quite agreeable to a sensible <Col N="1114" /> prisons policy and were not an obstacle to it.</P>
    <P>Sir Patrick Mayhew once used the analogy of a slow bicycle.  Inevitably, perhaps, anyone who tries to cycle slowly will end up, as in this case, falling off.  As the person primarily in charge of Northern Ireland policy, I believe he bears more responsibility than anyone else for the prolonged impasse in the peace process up to Friday last.</P>
    <P>As I said in my Ard Fheis speech last November, &ldquo;can it be that we are actually seeing the re-emergence of the old situation, where Irish affairs are treated as nothing more than a pawn in the British political game?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In recent times, obviously there was some truth in that.  Indeed, a plausable case could be made for saying that Sir Patrick Mayhew's job was to manage the Northern peace process in a way that ensured the survival of the Tory Government at Westminster rather than the survival of the peace itself.</P>
    <P>My party supported the conclusions of the excellent Mitchell report.  It provided the solution to the decommissioning issue and should have paved the way for all-party talks before the end of February.  No one in this House could believe how within a few hours a most valuable piece of work could be cast uncermoniously aside by the British Prime Minister for an idea that came from only one side of the divide.  Instead of adopting the Mitchell report as the way forward to talks, an elected body was offered as the only alternative to prior decommissioning.  It is evident unfortunately that this removed the last hope of any move within a reasonable time-scale to all-party talks, on a threestrand basis, despite united Nationalist opposition to the proposal for an elected body.</P>
    <P>During the entire 17 months of the ceasefire, there was scarcely a breath of criticism from the British Labour or Liberal Democrat parties about the mishandling of the peace process.  It was left to a few senior outspoken Tory and Labour backbenchers like Peter Temple-Morris and Kevin McNamara <Col N="1115" /> to provide warnings on what was happening.</P>
    <P>Irish people in Britain and this country respected the role of the British Labour Party in Government in 1969-70 when James Callaghan was Home Secretary. They saluted the contribution of Clive Soley and Kevin McNamara.  They will also remember that the current Labour leadership rarely lifted a finger to help the peace process when it was in difficulty.  They gave Sir Patrick Mayhew and the Major Government a free hand to drive the peace process virtually into the ground.</P>
    <P>Despite our strong feelings about the behaviour of the British political establishment, we recognise that it is essential for the two Governments to work together.  The conciliatory tone of the British Prime Minister yesterday would be more welcome if it had come earlier. A spirit of humility all round rather than a sense of vindication would better serve us in rescuing the peace.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that the peace process was handled perfectly on this side of the water.  At this time it is important for us in this House to try and support the Government in positive efforts to rescue the peace process. I acknowledge that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have devoted enormous time to it, and have done the best they could by their own lights.  I acknowledge the genuine efforts of the Taoiseach to understand a political philosophy and organisation, with which he had little sympathy prior to coming into office.  I also acknowledge the efforts of the Tánaiste and his Department to provide continuity, to ensure realism and to defend as best he could the original spirit of the peace process.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil, too, need to be self-critical.  Perhaps we could and should have done more to tie down firmly both Sinn Féin and the IRA on the one hand, and the British Government on the other, before the ceasefire, to more explicit commitments, assuming this could have been achieved.  It was irresponsible on both sides to allow a <Col N="1116" /> strong Government that had the confidence of republicans and Nationalists to fall over a matter that did not compare in importance with the peace process. The smug assumption at the time that the peace process was bigger than any party or individual and could be equally well handled by others has turned out to be not entirely true.  The notion that the new Government would be better placed to do a deal with Unionists has also so far not been borne out, particularly in the light of recent recriminations.</P>
    <P>A major factor in the difficulties in the peace process was that the British Government no longer seemed to be listening to the advice of the Irish Government.  The Government, despite its best efforts, did not always conmmand the full confidence of the Nationalist community.  When the Taoiseach briefly argued for a decommissioning gesture last March, it gave huge encouragement to the British campaign to make it a precondition.  Last autumn, there was a feeling that too much ground was being given diplomatically, although we supported the 28 November communiqué, albeit with reservations. The refusal to meet John Hume and Gerry Adams together had a devastating impact on confidence, and I personally could not and still do not understand it, since the British Prime Minister has always been willing to meet the Unionist or indeed other leaders together.  I would also have to say frankly that the admission, against precedent, of the leader of Democratic Left into the Anglo-Irish negotiations, even though his Department gave him no functional responsibilities in the area, and his constant sniping at Sinn Féin, did not help confidence in the Government either.</P>

      <P>We have adopted a bipartisan approach, while reserving the right to make both positive proposals and on occasion offer criticism.  I would, therefore, prefer to focus attention on <Col N="1117" /> our responsibilities in this House and the responsibilities of the Government in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>On the positive side, I have always acknowledged the valuable support of the UUP and indeed the Alliance Party for the Downing Street Declaration.  I welcome the improved level of contact and political exchange that has taken place between our parties, especially over the last year.  Much the same is also true of our relations with the loyalist parties.  Politically there is much more in common than can be easily acknowledged, as Senator Mitchell observed. Unionist and Nationalist parties make things very difficult for each other, because of the traditional gulf of mistrust.</P>
      <P>What I regret, however, over the last 17 months is the non-co-operation with any aspect of the peace process by the DUP, and the continued reluctance of the UUP to re-enter three strand talks, with or without Sinn Féin, as that reluctance goes back long before August 1994.</P>
      <P>I believe that people in Northern Ireland, not least the business and professional communities, would have appreciated the beginning of direct dialogue between the Unionist parties and Sinn Féin, I know some Unionist representatives like Chris McGimpsey, Raymond Ferguson and Ken Maginnis were prepared at least to engage in debate.  Unfortunately, the UUP gave the impression that it wanted to stall all-party dialogue as long as possible, and instead bring the peace process under the umbrella of an elected strand 1 body, which would not embark on formal negotiations for some time.  Was it too much to ask the Unionist parties, for the sake of the better life enjoyed by all during the ceasefires, that they should have engaged in direct talks with Sinn Féin as the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> and the Methodist Church urged?  I cannot believe that many people in Northern Ireland can be pleased at the way in which the precious opportunity of peace has apparently been politically squandered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> I accept that the argument about a return to Stormont was not the real issue in this debate but there seems to be little recognition that majoritarianism is not democracy in a divided community. In general, Unionists seem to have considerable difficulty with any new practical applications of the principles of partnership and parity of esteem within Northern Ireland.  They have even greater difficulty with practical recognition of the all-Ireland identity to which Northern Nationalists are particularly attached but which can be in the interest and service of the entire community.</P>
    <P>My only hope is that some good can come out of evil.  I hate to think it takes an act of terror to get anybody to reflect.  I think all parties and both Governments will examine closely the experience of the last 17 months, and that we will all try to learn from the mistakes and over-confident assumptions that we made.  Nor should we uncritically go back to all the practices that obtained over 25 years.  Successive Government may have abided by the finest democratic principles, but they did not succeed in doing what we must do now, namely stop the violence in good time forever.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the two Governments to do more than they should have done and agreed in principle to do, before the bomb was set off in London. If they committed themselves in the 28 November communiqué and previously to getting all-party talks off the ground soon, they of course remain duty bound to do that.  The objective of all parties and Governments involved in the peace process must be to get IRA violence stopped for good and political progress started.</P>
    <P>Everyone who has any influence with the IRA must try to ensure that there are no further attacks, as every attack will make the task of restoring the peace process to its previous state and achieving early inclusive all-party talks even more difficult.</P>
    <P>I call on the IRA to restore the authority of its political leadership.  Unless it <Col N="1119" /> does so, Sinn Féin and the IRA will be left without a political voice, and will find it very difficult to influence the intensifying dialogue between the two parties and the two Governments.  In August 1994, they boarded a political train that seemed to be going somewhere, only to find that it slowed right down.  Now that they are off the train, there is a danger that it will start to move again, and it could quite readily disappear into the middle distance. There will be forces around only too happy to see what they regard as a dangerous Nationalist consensus for peace ruptured for good, with republicans left with nowhere politically to go. I have always believed that Sinn Féin's influence can only be brought to bear within a broader consensus and will not come any longer from the continued threat of IRA violence.</P>
    <P>There is strong support for the view that dialogue must be maintained.  That is equally the strong conviction of Senator Mitchell and the US Administration, who have immense experience of conflicts throughout the world.  The political traditions in these islands are somewhat different.</P>
    <P>The situation prior to August 1994 was that there had been no direct contact at Government level with Sinn Féin or loyalists, which was mainly conducted through intermediaries.  However, there was a single direct line of communication with a person in the Taoiseach's office.  The British, as we discovered, also had their own direct line of communication. While we should not return to a policy of total isolation, which arguably continued for so long, it would be very dangerous to create the perception that democratic Governments are negotiating under duress.  There is a very careful balance to be struck.</P>
    <P>I believed there was a case for a meeting last Saturday between the Taoiseach and Gerry Adams, before high-level contact was curtailed, to put as strongly as possible the Government's view on the previous day's event.  Many people found the Taoiseach's initial statement <Col N="1120" /> too hard.  It was in the same spirit that we proposed yesterday that this Friday's meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should go ahead, though we understand that that will not now happen, and that it is in fact being postponed for two or three weeks which is far better than stated earlier.</P>
    <P>I understand the formal position of the Taoiseach and the Government.  I want them to know that they will have our support in any contact with Sinn Féin they judge appropriate.  They should not feel inhibited by fear of criticism from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed, we encourage them to continue the maximum level of contact that they consider prudent.</P>
    <P>As an Opposition party, we naturally have somewhat more freedom in this matter.  There is a balance to be struck between bringing home to the IRA the enormity of what it has done to the peace process, and trying to find acceptable ways of putting it back on track. We will try to talk to all parties, including Sinn Féin, in an appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to whether there would be value in having a US peace envoy, who could talk freely to all parties without compromising any principles of democracy.  I put this suggestion to the US Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy Smith, yesterday and the response from the United States and from Senator Mitchell has been quite encouraging.  The Clinton Administration is the one part perceived as neutral by all, and we will continue to need the quality of help and assistance it has given us in recent years.</P>
    <P>We also believe the Mitchell report has a central role.  We must at all costs avoid being drawn back into old arguments about permanence and decommissioning. The only way to avoid that is to take the six Mitchell principles and phased decommissioning during negotiations as our cornerstone.  We should firmly resist any attempt by the British Government to add a seventh principle, that of consent, which they had wished to see in the Mitchell report.  There must not be new preconditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> I have no difficulty welcoming John Hume's idea of a referendum, held simultaneously in both parts of Ireland to underscore the exercise of the principle of self-determination in relation to violence, to put it beyond all argument or doubt, and all-party talks.  At that point, the IRA and the political parties would be directly confronted by the wishes of national democracy.</P>
    <P>It would be best, when and if the present breakdown is overcome, if all the paramilitary organisations of their own accord would decide quickly, simultaneously and by agreement to disband and, by whatever method, safely dispose of their weapons in a verifiable manner.  President Clinton was right when he said their day was over, and what happened last Friday in London only confirms that.  Practically no one wants an Ireland in which paramilitary organisations continue to hold sway. They and the forces that motivated them belong to history.</P>
    <P>With regard to an electoral process or an elected body, I am glad the British Prime Minister accepted yesterday that this was not the only option.  There are still many unanswered questions.  It is still not clear whether immediately following elections it is envisaged that three strand talks should begin, with those elected making up the negotiating teams.  In the three strand process, the two Governments played a central role. We do not want to see strand two between the Northern parties and the Irish Government diluted, or the holding of strand two talks made subject to the will of the majority in the body.  We would prefer the two Governments to organise and convene the talks as they did before.  An elected body that is only a debating chamber could not trigger a phased start to decommissioning, which the Mitchell report says should happen during the negotiations proper.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if an elected body is solely for the purpose of providing teams to negotiations, the exclusion of Sinn Féin because of continuing IRA violence that has been hinted at would only serve to inflame the situation <Col N="1122" /> further, by challenging or denying its electoral mandate.  I remain concerned about the divisive effect of elections, in that they are likely to throw up new obstacles to talks.  I am not convinced of their necessity.</P>
    <P>The proximity talks proposed by the Tánaiste before the end of the month would be a demonstration of the two Governments' good faith in their commitment in the communiqué of 28 November. The idea gets over the problem of parties that will not talk to each other.  Either the appointment of a US peace envoy or the proximity talks or a combination of both, if properly handled, will provide a good start to sort out ideas on the way forward.</P>
    <P>Prior to August 1994, the British Government seemed most of the time to want to push forward the talks process ahead of the peace process.  The Irish Government must not lose sight, in all the manoeuvrings that will take place, of the primary objective of all of us, which is to restore peace and make political progress.  As long as there is any realistic hope in the short-term of stopping a renewed IRA campaign and restoring the ceasefire, we must guard against proposals designed to achieve a measure of agreement among some constitutional parties but that would leave the violence to continue.  The peace process and the talks process must be treated as one.</P>
    <P>A great national effort is required to mobilise public support for peace and Fianna Fáil will play its part in doing all it can North and South to convince those we meet.  I ask the IRA to listen to and respect the voice of the Irish people and those elected to the Oireachtas to represent that voice, and all other parties to make their best endeavours to achieve a workable compromise that leads directly to talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday was one of the darkest and most depressing days in recent Irish history &mdash;&ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; as Cardinal Daly has rightly called it.  It left me and, I am sure, the overwhelming <Col N="1123" /> majority of Irish people sad and angry, Two young Londoners, at the end of a long day's work in a newsagents, met a brutal death.  Many others were maimed or wounded.  They were wantonly made to suffer for a cause of which they probably knew little and understood even less.  Our first thoughts must be for the innocent victims and their families. They did not expect that by going about their normal daily lives they would become the victims of a conflict we all believed was over.  The Government has already, on behalf of the people, expressed its deep sympathy.  Our words will be scant consolation, but that does not diminish the sincerity with which they are expressed.</P>
      <P>The London bomb shattered more than the lives of its victims.  It shattered also the hopes so many of us cherished that we had at last left behind the dark shadow of violence.  It shook our confidence that we could successfully construct a truly inclusive process in which the commitment to the democratic and peaceful process would be universal and unquestioned.  It faces us with the question whether the peace process is stronger than those who seek to destroy it, and the need for us to make it so.</P>
      <P>I have heard people interviewed on the radio who claim they have got nothing from the ceasefires.  This is simply not true.  The past 18 months lifted a great burden from the lives of ordinary people in Northern Ireland.  They were enjoying &mdash; many for the first time in their lives &mdash; the benefit of a peaceful society, which is their fundamental right.  People from both parts of the island were reaching out, in a transformed climate, and discovering common interests and affinities which the violence had blighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The visible signs of conflict and of the security response to terror had been fading away.  The economic benefits of peace had begun to manifest themselves both North and South &mdash; tourism numbers in Northern Ireland had increased by 56 per cent and North-South trade had increased by 12 per cent.  There was <Col N="1124" /> a striking increase in international interest in investment opportunities, assisted by the major support offered to the cause of peace both by the European Union and the United States. There has been a proliferation of new contacts and a development of new understanding across the Border, at all levels.</P>
    <P>Friday's bomb has done huge damage to all these developments.  If it presages the resumption of a campaign of violence then we will throw away the gains which have so painstakingly been made.  Politically, many people have invested unprecedented hopes in the peace process and have worked tirelessly for its success.  The ending of the cessation of violence calls into question all that has been achieved in recent years, and threatens to make a mockery of the efforts of all of us who have worked for peace in Ireland, in Britain and throughout the world &mdash; above all in the United States.</P>
    <P>No language is sufficiently strong to condemn the action of those responsible for the bomb.  Its wanton disregard for its victims was matched by an equally contemptuous disregard for the collateral damage done to the true welfare of the Irish people, in terms of their political hopes and aspirations and their natural right to peace.  We cannot pretend this was not a grave setback to the search for a political accommodation.</P>
    <P>However, the present situation calls for more than condemnation or passive despair.  We must seek to put matters right.  It is the sobering truth that this bomb may be the opening move in a new spiral of tragedy and destruction. Those who resort to violence frequently do so in the delusion that they can control the process.  History &mdash; and not least the history of Northern Ireland &mdash; shows otherwise.  It is crucial, therefore, that we all use our utmost political resources to draw back from the brink. We must redouble our efforts to bring about a lasting peace, underpinned by a comprehensive political settlement.  The Government has already made clear that it has chosen the path of peace.  We <Col N="1125" /> want the republican movement to rejoin us irrevocably on that path, but whether they do so will not diminish our determination to reach our chosen goal.</P>
    <P>The approach of this Government and of its predecessor to the search for peace has been consistent, comprehensive and logical.  It is fundamentally encapsulated in the Joint Declaration.  It has been based on awareness that the divisions which have led to conflict can only be healed by the agreement and co-operation of the people, North and South, representing both traditions in Ireland.  We know that such agreement will only be won if there is a shared understanding of, and commitment to, the fundamental principles which must underpin a political settlement.  In essence, there must be consent on all sides to new political arrangements and structures, and identities of all.  The Government and the great majority of the people of the island fully accept, and have repeatedly made clear, that there can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its people.  We have equally made clear that any political accommodation must be squarely based on the principles of parity of esteem and equality of opportunity, treatment and advantage, and must address and embrace all relationships.</P>
    <P>The prospect for real peace and lasting agreement is immeasurably enhanced by the cessation of paramilitary violence and the consequent scaling down of security counter-measures. The coming of peace will so alter the political climate as to make a just and lasting agreement achievable, not easily achievable, but ultimately so.</P>
    <P>Our approach has been based on a continuing repudiation and renunciation of violence, coercion and threat as a means of securing political progress.  We reject and condemn them both as morally evil, and as politically futile. However, at the same time we have worked on the assumption that those who used or threatened violence had &mdash; not for moral reasons, for violence is <Col N="1126" /> always wrong &mdash; to be offered a meaningful political way out of the bloody <i>cul-de-sac</i> in which they were trapped. Accordingly, with the British Government, we reiterated that the achievement of peace must involve a permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence.  We confirmed that, in these circumstances, democratically mandated parties which established a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and showed that they abided by the democratic process were free to participate fully in democratic politics.</P>
    <P>In short, we have sought to set out both the basic requirements for a settlement and the way to get there &mdash; through dialogue and negotiation &mdash; but we made clear that admission to dialogue, and the right to take part in negotiations, had to involve an end to violence. Violence is the direct opposite of democratic politics.  It seeks not to persuade, but to overwhelm: it looks not for agreement, but for victory.  I said in the Dáil on 31 August 1994 that there is a fundamental distinction between democracy and violence and that &ldquo;no true dialogue is possible between those, on the one hand, who accept the constraints and rules of democracy and those, on the other, who accept them only selectively or not at all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the IRA ceasefire the then Government made clear that the price of Sinn Féin's admission to full participation in the political process was a total cessation of violence.  We made clear that there could be no question of trying non-violence for a limited period to see what it brought, of turning the tap on and off.  We saluted the announcement of 31 August on the basis that it represented a permanent and irrevocable step away from violence and into the democratic arena.</P>
    <P>On that understanding, the then Government moved swiftly to welcome Sinn Féin into the democratic family, opening discussions with its leadership and moving to establish the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  That clear <Col N="1127" /> commitment to a total cessation of violence is the basis on which we have operated since then and on which our commitment to fully inclusive negotiations has been based.</P>
    <P>As Saturday's Government statement makes clear, the fact that commitment to a total cessation of violence, which was to have held in all circumstances, has now been revoked, in the bloodiest possible way, fundamentally alters the situation.  That fundamental change cannot be ignored by the Government and must, of necessity, bring about a change in our approach.  That is the reason the Government does not feel it right or appropriate to meet Sinn Féin at ministerial level until there is a restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  The republican movement must be shown, with whatever emphasis it takes, that we do not and will not condone violence.</P>
    <P>As has been made clear, this does not mean that Sinn Féin is being isolated or marginalised.  Contacts will continue at official level in order that we can establish whether and how Sinn Féin can be brought back fully into the process. There will be no closing-off of practical channels of communication and no lack of opportunity for dialogue in either direction.  Likewise, we acknowledge the continuing courage and commitment of other political figures, notably John Hume, who will, we understand, continue to engage in direct contact with the Sinn Féin leadership, as he has done for several years.  We very much hope that these exchanges will be successful and fruitful.  Nevertheless, the Government has a particular responsibility, as the custodian of democratic values on which this State is founded and as the representative both in Ireland and internationally of the interests of all our people, to make utterly clear the dividing line between politics and violence.  As Séamus Mallon has said, it is possible to make peace or war, but not both.</P>
    <P>The crucial goal now is that the ceasefire should be restored and the search for political progress resumed in the <Col N="1128" /> only climate where meaningful and inclusive political negotiations are likely to succeed, namely, a climate free of the threat or use of violence for political ends.  I know for a fact that a great many members of Sinn Féin are working hard to bring about such a decision.  Sinn Féin has invested heavily in the peace process and many within that organisation have worked tirelessly in its cause.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly praised the personal courage and political creativity shown by the Sinn Féin leadership in bringing about the August 1994 cessation of violence.  That courage and creativity is now needed more than ever as well as a realistic awareness that each atrocity narrows palpably the prospect of political agreement and the trust that is the essential foundation for any lasting settlement.</P>
    <P>It is equally vital that the loyalist ceasefires hold firm and that the appalling spiral of killing and retaliation not be allowed once again to impose its fatal logic upon us.  The honest and courageous leadership which the leaders of the loyalist political parties have shown in recent days is commendable and once again demonstrates that they have a vital role to play in the search for a settlement.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problems which we need to overcome by political negotiation have not altered since last Friday &mdash; Friday's bomb serves only to remind us of the urgency and necessity of agreement and the terrible future to which a failure to agree would condemn us. Likewise, the basic principles which must underlie a settlement have not changed.  Nor has the route to agreement changed: there is no alternative to comprehensive and inclusive dialogue and negotiation.</P>
    <P>Since the cessations of violence the political path has been a tortuous and difficult one.  I have always thought and said that it would be so.  Twenty-five years of violence aggravated the already profound lack of trust between the two communities and only served to restock what Senator Mitchell called their vast inventories of historic recrimination. <Col N="1129" /> There is no doubt, however, that the road to the all-party negotiations which are accepted as necessary on all sides was made more uphill than it need have been.  There can be no doubt that with greater flexibility and imagination all round we could have been much further forward.</P>
    <P>Just as the Irish Government and Nationalists generally were for too long dismissive of the Unionist identity and unwilling to acknowledge the real interests and fears of the Unionist community, so the British Government and Unionists generally have not appreciated or taken on board the sensitivities and concerns and demands of the Nationalist community.  The Unionist refusal to talk or their insistence that talks must be on their own terms and within a conceptual and institutional framework of their own making has been decoded as a reluctance to take part in the common enterprise of building a society in which all can feel at home.  Many Nationalists see it as a refusal to acknowledge or address their legitimate concerns.</P>
    <P>The search for peace and a negotiated settlement to underpin it must inevitably be a joint enterprise between the two sovereign Governments and all those with a contribution to make to a solution.  In this, the relationship between the two Governments is the enabling condition for progress on all other fronts.  It is an &ldquo;iron law&rdquo;, to borrow Mr. Paddy Ashdown's phrase, that the prospect of success for any initiative on Northern Ireland is in direct proportion to the degree of agreement the two Governments bring to bear in seeking that objective.  The pattern of the relationship between the two Governments over the past decades has been one of ever-growing co-operation.  It is important to maintain that co-operation in the face of any threat of violence.  It is ever more important to maintain it to meet the challenge of peace and under-pinning it through a negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>Such co-operation requires an act of political will.  Each Government must <Col N="1130" /> operate within the constraints of its own situation.  Good English politics all too often can make bad Irish politics and the converse is equally true.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Joint Declaration and the Framework Document are so many milestones along the road to our co-operation and show the degree of convergence and solidarity which is possible when the political will and imagination is there.  A carefully co-ordinated approach is again necessary. Both Governments have an interest in overall peace, stability, justice and fairness in Northern Ireland which transcend any partisan interest there.  We need to make that commitment shine out from our common position and &ldquo;stay on message&rdquo; in that regard, to borrow the American phrase.</P>
    <P>The Northern parties, since the ceasefires, have been locked in a stand off between those who wished to go into inclusive negotiating without preconditions and the two Unionist parties which did not.  That stand-off has caused great and dangerous frustration.</P>
    <P>I repudiate the view that there has been no progress in that period.  Progress may have been too slow for many people's liking, including that of the Irish Government, but we have continued to work for agreement with the British Government.</P>
    <P>I was flying over the Atlantic last Friday, one hour after a very productive visit to Washington which had significantly advanced the prospect of talks, when I was informed of the IRA statement and when the bomb exploded in London.  Progress &mdash; slow, tortuous, but real &mdash; was put at risk by a murderous but ultimately futile gesture of frustration.</P>
    <P>The political stand-off is mainly concerned with a disagreement as to whether an election must come before negotiations or negotiations before an election.  This disagreement coincides more or less exactly with the constitutional fault line in Northern Ireland, the pro-union parties demanding an election first, the Nationalist parties the opposite.  For as long as that remains the <Col N="1131" /> case, the elective process inevitably polarises the political debate.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist parties' reluctance to begin with an election is not based primarily on a fear of a return to Stormont, although any such proposal would be anathema to them.  It reflects a fear that the purpose of such an election would be ritual and symbolic, rather than practical. Elections in Northern Ireland are proverbial for their predictability.  That predictability might almost be offered as one of the defining features of the problem. There is no doubt whatever that elections will confirm what is already incontrovertible &mdash; that there is a Unionist majority and a Nationalist minority, in the percentages which they both know exactly.</P>
    <P>Nationalists fear that the purpose of such an election would be to establish the dominance of the majority, and the primacy of the internal strand of negotiations, as a prelude to going to the table.  The suggestion that the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland should revert to the status of a subject minority is for them very like what a proposal for a united Ireland is for Unionists &mdash; a certain receipe for wall-to-wall opposition.</P>
    <P>It is wise, in debating the election option, to bear this ingrained reflex in mind.  It is not of course allayed by a Unionist refusal to address these concerns in the political track, or the refusal to discuss elective options with the Irish Government, on the grounds they are an internal matter.</P>
    <P>Nationalist leaders have made known the many practical difficulties they foresee in approaching negotiations through an elective process.  The very language illustrates some of the dangers &mdash; we fight elections, we do not fight negotiations. Elections can be adversarial and confirm existing divisions.  Negotiations must be inclusive and must seek new ways to make consent in a divided society a meaningful concept.</P>
    <P>The final say about any elective process rests with those who are invited to <Col N="1132" /> stand for such elections, namely, the Northern Ireland political parties.  We have said repeatedly that this issue should be a matter for discussion and that the onus is on those who believe that the elective approach is best to persuade those, who, from experience and analysis, have advanced several cogent objections to it.</P>
    <P>It has been a helpful development that Prime Minister Major, in a carefully measured speech in the House of Commons yesterday, sought to address two areas of particular concern.  He sought to provide assurances that an elective approach would not lead to inordinate delay and to make clear that all-party negotiations would ensue as an immediate and direct result of an elective process. These clarifications are positive and helpful and will make it easier for the elective approach to be considered calmly and rationally in the manner we would wish to see.  However, there is still a need for clarity on a range of other very important and complex aspects of this issue, and a need to address these in discussions between the Governments and the parties.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell report, whose brief passing reference to an elective process received such unexpected prominence in the House of Commons, nevertheless sets out succinctly and shrewdly three important criteria.  It underlines the need for broad acceptability.  This is a requirement of common sense, as well as of fairness.  An elective process which was boycotted by the Nationalist community, or whose result was boycotted by the Nationalist community, would serve little, if any, useful purpose.  There is an ominous precedent in the Prior Assembly, which resembles in some respects some of the ideas now on the table, and which was boycotted by Nationalist representatives in the early 1980s.</P>
    <P>Any elective process would need to have an appropriate mandate.  This again could involve a wide range of issues.  One of the most important would be the relationships between any elective process and the negotiating process. <Col N="1133" /> Unless that were direct and immediate, and without scope for further pre-conditions, I do not see that Nationalists would have any incentive to consider the proposal.  The Unionist suggestion that elections were an alternative to negotiations significantly increased opposition to their proposal.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the three-stranded process.  I said earlier that any suggestion of an internal solution automatically guarantees the total opposition of Nationalist political leaders in Northern Ireland.  It would be essential that the three-stranded dimension is clearly and unambiguously spelt out in any proposal for an elective process and that the independent role of the Govenrments and the integrity of the three-stranded process is guaranteed at least to the same extent as in the 1991-92 talks.</P>
    <P>Looking beyond the particular issue of an elective process, there is an urgent need to address the basis and format of negotiations themselves.  Much work remains to be done to establish the model of negotiations which can command the agreement of all the parties. We need to establish which format will best enable a lasting settlement covering all the strands to be hammered out.  We need to see how the potentially invaluable contribution which the Mitchell report could make can best be reflected in the negotiating process.</P>
    <P>It was the need to resolve these many complex issues, as well as to give momentum to the process of negotiation, which led me to propose to the British Government the notion of proximity talks.  I regret this proposal seems to have been addressed, and partly dismissed, on symbolic grounds rather than on a consideration of the practicalities involved.  The preparatory talks involve eight or nine parties and two Governments. We had a firm target of the end of February.  We had a range of complex and interlocking matters to discuss between the Governments and with all of these parties.  There was a danger that the contacts taking place, frequent and <Col N="1134" /> welcome through they were, could be merely a chain of inconclusive meetings.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that I proposed that the two Governments should take the initiative of calling all the parties into one convenient venue for an intensive two-day conference.  I am of course fully aware that certain parties have difficulty in meeting certain other parties. The arrangements and, so to speak, the geometry of the proceedings can be easily arranged to take account of all of these sensitivities and to ensure that no group is pressurised into a meeting which it does not want to hold.  At the same time, the proximity of the parties would enable an intensive interaction to be set up between them and with the Governments, using whatever contacts and meetings are appropriate for any given participant.</P>
    <P>The present stand-off between the approach of those who believe elections must precede negotiations, on the one hand, and those who believe elections should flow from negotiations, on the other, is not necessarily irreconcilable. Many of the reasons which led parties to adopt one or other position reflect genuine and rational concerns, but concerns which can perhaps be addressed and assuaged.  For that, however, a process of intensive discussion is necessary. The proximity talks proposal is intended, essentially, to deal with this need and to fast track the preparatory phase of talks.  If there is a speedier and better way of doing that, naturally the Government will be open to it.  So far, however, I have not heard any, I remain convinced that the proposal which we have made is a practical one, and takes account better than most of the practical requirements of the position.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government is also determined that, whatever route is taken to all-party talks, there should be a place at the table for the loyalist parties.  The people whom they represent have been part of the conflict in Northern Ireland and they must be directly involved in finding a solution.  We would have grave doubts about any mechanism which <Col N="1135" /> excludes them from the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>The loyalist parties have, as I have already mentioned, made a positive contribution to the process of reconciliation which has been a feature of the last 18 months.  Only last week I welcomed a delegation of the Progressive Unionist Party to Iveagh House, where we had a most constructive and encouraging meeting and I look forward to meeting the Ulster Democratic Party in due course.</P>
    <P>The immediate challenge facing the two Governments is how to fulfil the mandate of the November communiqué and to reach agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of all-party talks.  We will continue our efforts over the coming days, in consultation of course with the British Government, to put together a package of options which might be put to the parties in the near future.  The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister will be able to review progress in that regard at a summit very soon.</P>
    <P>I am certain that I speak for every Member of the House when I say that it is our fervent desire that Sinn Féin is part of negotiations we wish to see in place.  All parties represented here have worked closely with Sinn Féin in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation for almost a year and a half.  We have all gained from the experience.  I appeal to Sinn Féin to make it possible to participate without qualification in the peaceful democratic process.  I call upon the IRA not to stand in the way of allowing Sinn Féin to do so.  The people of Ireland are tired of wars.  Violence begets only violence.  We demand peace.</P>
    <P>Together the people of this island have the patience and determination to overcome mistrust and to construct a political foundation strong enough to ensure that peace will never again be broken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A dreadful cloud of gloom, near despair, swept through the country since news of the IRA bombing <Col N="1136" /> broke last Friday.  In that evil deed two innocent people were murdered and 100 injured.  The explosion destroyed our hope, our sense of optimism that flowered all too briefly for 17 months. People everywhere are rightly shocked and terrified at the prospect of a full blown return to violence and tit for tat killings that we had for the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>Collectively, we are all holding our breath and hoping that the peace process can be salvaged.  Whatever tactic or strategy motivated the IRA to plant that bomb, it was just a tactic or a strategy. If murder is one strategy or one of one's tactics, one places one's self outside the limits of democracy, of civilisation and the most basic form of morality.  It must be repeated in this House over and over again that killing and maiming, whether with semtex, armalites, petrol bombs or baseball bats, is profoundly evil.  It is evil wherever or whyever it is done.  In Bosnia the murder and mayhem was done in the name of nationalist national self-determination.  In London, that justification is just as repugnant and threadbare.</P>
      <P>No political imperative which claims to flow from the so-called right of national self-determination can override the dictates of common humanity.  No human cause justifies inhumanity and murder.  No cause commands our silence in the face of such inhumanity. These words are not a form of self-indulgence or a ritual in the politics of selective condemnation.  Any politician who finds himself or herself gagged by political circumstances from denouncing what happened last Friday should ask themselves this question &ldquo;What greater cause do I serve that demands my silence when human beings are being murdered and maimed to satisfy my demands?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peace is not the gift of the gunman, it is our birthright.  We must not be grateful to those who suspend killing.  We should never confuse the end of fear with feelings of gratitude and admiration for those who no longer terrorise us.  It is not the function of the IRA to <Col N="1137" /> bind this generation or the next to the use or non-use of violence.</P>
    <P>My heart goes out to the families of those killed on Friday, and living victims and the families affected by that atrocity. It is particularly poignant that among the dead and mutilated are immigrant workers who never wished for anything except to be left in peace. A moment of reflection by those who supported, planned or executed the bombing would surely impress on them how utterly grotesque it is to kill and maim ordinary people to make a political point.</P>
    <P>It is equaly grotesque if politicians become more flexible and conciliatory following bombings of that kind.  There will be many, if they see a more conciliatory response after a bombing, who will think that violence pays.  Sovereign governments and constitutional politics must never be seen to give or reward in any way violence.  We must be flexible but we should have been flexible during the past six months.  If something was wrong last week, it is equally wrong today.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to look in anger and shock at the inhumanity of the London bombing.  We must move away from the politics of the last atrocity.  The peace process can be salvaged but only on the basis of reality.  It will not be salvaged on the basis of wishful thinking or by surrendering to extremist positions, least of all to the extremism of violence. We must take careful stock of our current position.  It is only on the basis of a realistic assessment that we can move forward.</P>
    <P>The republican movement must take full responsibility for what happened on Friday last.  That bomb signalled an end to the peace process and brought about today's despair.  There was no justification whatever for what happened. The response by the republican movement was selfish and one-sided.  Sinn Féin leaders and many other commentators have sought to understand why the IRA broke its ceasefire on the basis that it got nothing from the cessation of violence.  They believe they have <Col N="1138" /> nothing to go to the IRA with to get them to reinstate the ceasefire.  That is a travesty of the truth and a version of events which cannot, and must not, go unchallenged and uncorrected in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to outline some of the positive features which resulted from the ceasefire.  In this Republic, section 31 of the Broadcasting Act was lifted.  The broadcasting bans in Northern Ireland and Britain were also removed.  IRA prisoners were released and Sinn Féin representatives were received by two successive Governments at the highest level.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was established to facilitate Sinn Féin.  The Irish Government supported the granting of visas to the United States for leading members of Sinn Féin and they were received at the White House.  In Nothern Ireland the Border roads were opened and there was a remission of the sentences of what are known as political prisoners.  The British Army was withdrawn from the streets to barracks and some units were returned to Britain. Exclusion orders were lifted and British Ministers held talks with representatives of Sinn Féin at Stormont.</P>
      <P>It must not be underestimated that these enormous achievements occurred in a period of 17 months following 25 years of horrific violence.  That was what Sinn Féin received from the peace strategy. It got nothing from a campaign of violence that lasted for 25 years.  I believe that these were significant achievements.  In assessing what happened during the past 17 months, we must consider the response of the republican movement to the achievements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1994, a postman was murdered in Newry.  More recently five civilians allegedly involved with illegal drugs were murdered.  The vicious punishment beatings continued and numbered over 100 on the republican side. The republican movement refused to <Col N="1139" /> endorse the consent principle which every party in this House, and every other nationalist party on this island, endorses.  It refused to surrender even one ounce of semtex as a gesture of its goodwill that it would forswear violence in favour of democratic politics.  When the republican movement carried out these actions, the Sinn Féin leadership refused to condemn such thuggery.  We are informed that Sinn Féin do not like the politics of condemnation and have a disdain for it.  However, no party is more ready to condemn everyone from the British Government, the unionists, the RUC and more recently the Irish Government &mdash; than Sinn Féin.  They condemn anyone who does not buy into their selective agenda.</P>
    <P>Many of us found it difficult to work with Sinn Féin at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  We sometimes found it hard to accept their double-speak and linguistic somersaults.  We did so, however in the interests of the greater good.  We tried so hard to wean them away from violence and encourage them into the democratic political process. Many of us were prevented from expressing our real feelings in case we might upset the peace process in any way.  We held back when we might have stated certain things.  Lest Sinn Féin's representatives think we endorsed what happened, we did not.</P>
    <P>The plain facts must be spelled out in this House if we are to move forward in a sensible political way.  The picture is not black and white.  The suggested scenario of a hard done by Sinn Féin and an intransigent British Government is far from correct.  As Seamus Mallon stated last night, his community and party have attempted to have nationalism recognised in Northern Ireland for 23 years.  Despite the slow, tedious and tortuous nature of politics they never resorted to or justified the use of violence. There are many decent people throughout the country who although they are repulsed by what happened in London on Friday last, they believe that we should still have meetings with Sinn <Col N="1140" /> Féin.  It is important to realise that the peace process is larger than any party and that Sinn Féin and the IRA should not be permitted to take it hostage. There may have been many who were so mystified at the weekend that they believed a meeting between the Government and Sinn Féin might have put the peace process back on track and led to a renewed cessation of violence. I believe the Government's actions were correct.  I respect and support its decision.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo;.  There must be a political settlement.  We must create a society in Northern Ireland where Unionists and Nationalists feel equally at home. Northern Ireland must become a partnership, there must be parity of esteem for the two communities.  Unionism and Nationalism are incompatible but it must be and is possible for both communities to live side by side if the appropriate structures are put in place.  It is important that we understand there is no distinction between what are called the &ldquo;peacemakers&rdquo; in Sinn Féin and the IRA itself.  It is correct to say perhaps that there would be no peace process without Gerry Adams.  However, it is equally true that there might not have been a need for such a process without Gerry Adams and his allies in the IRA. Ordinary, decent people must not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>I believe that much more could have been achieved during the past 17 months.  It is regrettable that the British Government and the Unionists dragged their feet and that various divisive diversions were introduced along the way. No matter what diversions were introduced, there can never be any justification for what happened on Friday.  If, as Seamus Mallon stated last night, a bomb were placed at the Financial Services Centre in Dublin, we would not like to see the British Government meeting with the people, or their political allies, who planted it.  Equally, if a bomb were planted at the Treasury Building in Washington I do not believe the American Government would like <Col N="1141" /> to see the Irish Government meeting with those responsible.  It is important that we are not ambivalent in relation to these issues.  We must realise that the hopes and aspirations of many people were destroyed on Friday.  I recently met with an American investor who planned to build a major tourist facility on the Border.  He asked me if thought the ceasefire would last.  I informed him that I believed it would.  I am sure he, and many like him, are re-examining their investment plans and making alternative arrangements.  Many people will also be changing their holiday plans for 1996.  That is what is so sad about the events of Friday last.  Even if it was an isolated bomb, it will have enormous implications for investment and tourism. Many of us were looking forward to the official visit this year of President Mary Robinson to Britain and to a return visit of the Queen to this jurisdiction.  We felt there was a new relationship evolving between our two countries.  Much of that, and the goodwill that comes from visits like that and indeed the two royal visits that have already taken place, were shattered by a bomb detonated in the name of this country.</P>
    <P>It is important that the two Governments unite in a common strategy.  The failure of the two Governments to act together in recent times gave soccour to those who planted the bomb.  They must have a positive, agreed political agenda. If the Government fail to unite in a creative positive response, they will play straight into the hands of those who prefer the lethal certainties of violence to the uncertainties and infirmities of politics. They must have a common approach and they must seek the support of the American Government for that common strategy because if they do not have it the Governments' efforts would be undermined.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has isolated and marginalised itself; it has not been isolated by anybody else.  The two Governments should be in a position to call talks of all those parties that renounce and reject violence, whether the talks are of the round table or proximity variety.  It <Col N="1142" /> is important that those talks are held so that the widest possible support can be gained for the way forward.  Whether it is an elective process, a referendum or immediate all-party talks among those parties committed to peace and democratic politics, it is extremely important that we agree on the way forward.  If it is not possible now for those that believe in constitutional politics to meet in these circumstances, I despair about the future.  It is important too that links are kept open with Sinn Féin and with those who influence the IRA.  Whether those are national links, links within Northern Ireland or links from America, it is importnat that we encourage those links.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday the Taoiseach said that if elections were to be held they would &ldquo;pour petrol on the flames&rdquo;.  If that was the Taoiseach's view on Sunday &mdash; and it has been the Government's view before the bomb on Friday &mdash; it is important that we do not change our strategy simply because of that bomb.</P>
    <P>There are obvious problems associated with an elective process.  They tend to make people more inflexible and less open to the views of others.  There is no floating vote in Northern Ireland.  I can think of nowhere in the world where elections do not make any difference than Northern Ireland; they do not change anything.  Elections have a polarising tendency and unless we can reduce or overcome that, it could have a damaging effect on the process.</P>
    <P>As elections are competitive it makes it more difficult to have conciliation afterwards.  Elections are concerned with making choices between different parties, not with building bridges between them.  It is important in the context of what has happened that we do not see a return to the extremism we have seen all too often in elections in Northern Ireland, to see people look over their shoulders at the more extreme element in their own community. Recent opinion polls clearly show that there has not been any major shift in opinion within Northern Ireland <Col N="1143" /> and, therefore, I do not believe elections will make any electoral difference.</P>
    <P>John Hume has called for referenda North and South.  Sometimes we are too inclined to dismiss the proposals advanced.  In the context of Northern Ireland we have a duty to consider everything.  He wants a referendum so that the people can exclude violence and give the participants to talks a positive mandate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps other options could be put to voters in the context of a referendum. The people could decide the fundamental rules under which talks could take place.  The people could give a direction to their political representatives of the ground rules that have to be followed in subsequent talks.  In particular it is important that we understand and accept the consent principle.  Ever since the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Irish Governments have agreed that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of people there wish it to happen.  It is important that Unionists are reassured on that point and the recent refusal of Sinn Féin to endorse with other parties the Forum report is a cause of great concern in this regard.  Equally it is important that Nationalists know there will be no internal settlement and that their fears in that regard are addressed.  A referendum could have a useful role in reassuring both communities on these two points.</P>
    <P>I am not trying in the context of a referendum to advocate another fully crafted proposal or to make matters more prescriptive than they might otherwise be but it is time we all got real.  We simply cannot engage in a pretence that dialogue will dispense with the principle of consent.  The consent principle was enshrined in the Anglo-Irish Agreement registered at the United Nations and it has been endorsed by every party in this House.</P>
    <P>What is negotiable in the context of all-party talks is the kind of society that Northern Ireland can and should be.  We can also negotiate the nature of the links <Col N="1144" /> between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island, which are so important.  It is equally important, in the context of negotiations, to decide on the links that will be maintained with the United Kingdom should a majority of the people in Northern Ireland opt to move out of the United Kingdom.  Because of the kind of society Northern Ireland is, there will always have to be links with the Republic and with Britain.  It is not possible that any substantial minority would not have their legitimacy recognised in that way.  In the context of negotiations, the internal government and other arrangements can be decided.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland is a bipolar community. It has to become a partnership. We must accept that nationalism has to be as legitimate in Northern Ireland as unionism.  Unionists may feel they have everything to lose by engaging in talks but it is not satisfactory for them to live in a society where over 40 per cent of the people do not have their aspiration, their identity and their legitimacy recognised.</P>
    <P>In its very existence Northern Ireland represents unionism.  Whether it is the flags and emblems, the British Administration at Stormont or the Parliamentary representation at Westminster, Northern Ireland recognises only the Unionist tradition.  It has to equally recognise the Nationalist identity.  That will not happen unless we have a political settlement.  Their priority now must be to re-establish the peace process but, equally, no door should be banged shut. The practice of leaving a key in the door cannot be extended to those whose allies continue to get involved in atrocities such as that which occurred last Friday night.  No party should have open access to Government which varies its tactics at will between murder and argument. It would be wrong for the Irish Government or for the rest of us not to differentiate between those who fully reject violence and those who cannot.</P>
    <P>If some people's mandate is not respected, as Sinn Féin says its mandate is not, it is because it has placed itself on a different level to everybody else. <Col N="1145" /> Its continued association with the IRA and its support for the IRA's campaign automatically places it in a different position to all other parties.  Violence cannot be coupled with politics and while contact must not be lost with anyone who can play a vital role, whether it is Senator Mitchell or whoever, it is important to ensure that the two sovereign Governments move forward together with a positive agenda and seek the widest possible support for it.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to put questions to the Government this evening but obviously that is not possible.  However, if the proximity talks are to go ahead, which I know the Government will maintain they should, is it envisaged that Sinn Féin will be involved in those proximity talks?  It is clear to me that if the Government is refusing to deal with Sinn Féin formally, it would be inconsistent that it be involved in those proximity talks.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was asked on Sunday about my suggestion that the two Governments should call talks between all the parties committed to peace he said he did not favour that suggestion; he wanted all inclusive talks which must mean he wants Sinn Féin involved.  That is inconsistent with the position adopted by the Government and perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare might clarify that matter in his contribution.</P>
    <P>If the two Governments are united in a flexible strategy which does not stall or flounder simply because Sinn Féin is nobbled by the IRA, we can look forward with hope to a political settlement. If the moderate parties in Northern Ireland had come together in the past, the vacuum would not have been filled by the men of violence.  The refusal of the Ulster Unionist Party, the Alliance Party and the SDLP to come together and reach a political agreement has led to the vacuum being filled by people like Sinn Féin and the IRA.  We must push forward and challenge those who feel that if they do not get their way, they can use a bomb or a bullet to force change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> That is not acceptable, and the Irish Government would not accept such an approach.  It is important to move forward on the basis of democratic principles. All the parties to all-inclusive dialogue must be committed to the six Mitchell principles and the decommissioning proposals outlined in the report.  The time has come for the parties in Northern Ireland and the two Governments to sit down and engage in dialogue to ensure that Northern Ireland becomes the type of partnership and acceptable society we all want to see it become.  Shakespeare said: &ldquo;A peace is in the nature of victory where both parties nobly are subdued and neither party loser&rdquo;.  Northern Ireland must become a society where both parties are subdued and where neither party becomes a loser.  When that day comes we will have reached a political settlement, whether Sinn Féin and the IRA are on board.  Democratic Governments can then use all the powers at their disposal to ensure that the settlement is not opposed through violence.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on the Governments to give leadership and it is not acceptable for the British Government to maintain that it cannot command anyone to engage in talks.  It must not stand helplessly by; rather it must encourage the dialogue to which it committed itself in the Downing Street Declaration. Equally, the Irish Government must continue to take its courage in its hands. It will have my support in doing this but if it seeks to negotiate or give concessions to Sinn Féin in order to get the IRA to again give us a ceasefire it will not have my support.  It must remain firm, united and determined.  If it does this we will have a political settlement even if it takes longer than some of us thought.</P>

      <P>As a Member of the Government and the Leader of Democratic Left I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I also welcome the positive contributions by the <Col N="1147" /> Leaders of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and the strong support they are offering to the Government at this critical period in terms of the democratic institutions of this State.</P>
      <P>On the question which the Leader of the Progressive Democrats raised about participation by Sinn Féin in proximity talks or the Taoiseach's comments about all-inclusive talks, obviously a direct question to the Taoiseach is the appropriate way to pursue this matter. If I was asked the question I would say my objective &mdash; and I assume it is the Government's objective &mdash; is to seek to ensure there are all-party talks.  We have made it very clear that Sinn Féin can only have access to the process on the basis that there is no more violence, that the violence stops now and permanently. That is the fundamental underlying principle of the Government's approach to the current situation.  There is no contradiction in what the Taoiseach has said about inclusive talks and our attitude to Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>The Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made a very positive contribution. However, I was slightly taken aback when he singled me out for criticism of my attitude to the peace process. He questioned my right to be involved in the Government's approach to the peace process and Anglo-Irish relations. I am the leader of one of the parties in a three party Coalition Government and I am also Minister for Social Welfare.  It would be extraordinary if all the parties in a three party Government did not have a direct involvement in the position being put forward by the Government or were not <i>ad idem</i> on it.  I make these points not by way of argumentation but simply by way of clarification.</P>
      <P>His second criticism was that my sniping at Sinn Féin was unhelpful.  I do not snipe, which is perhaps one of my failings. Rather I speak my mind and I very often stubbornly stick to what I believe is the correct thing to do or say.</P>

      <P>Time and time again in the past 25 years I have challenged the right of Sinn Féin and the IRA to take life, to bomb the people of Northern Ireland, Britain or Germany, and I have often done so at personal risk to me and my family.  On one occasion when I opposed attempts by Sinn Féin and the IRA to take control of my constituency of Dublin North-West through the so-called Concerned Parents Against Drugs I was threatened by an armed man at a public meeting.  I did not back down then and I will not do so now in terms of my total political opposition to everything Sinn Féin and the IRA stand for.  I oppose and abominate everything they stand for.</P>
      <P>Ever since the IRA declared a ceasefire in August 1994, during debates in the House, at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and at private meetings with its members I have supported Sinn Féin and given it credit for the courage it has shown in negotiating and maintaining the ceasefire.  Up until last Friday no one could claim that I sought to undermine Sinn Féin in terms of its relationship with the IRA and the maintenance of a ceasefire.  Of course I criticised Gerry Adams' statement that the IRA had not gone away.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, last Friday we saw the brutal evidence of this.  I criticised that statement because I believed it frightened the people who had suffered for the past 25 years that the violence was about to start again.  As a democratic politician I had an obligation to criticise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have criticised Sinn Féin and the IRA for the failure to identify the whereabouts of &ldquo;the disappeared&rdquo;, the bodies the IRA did away with over the past 25 years and to whom they never allowed their loved ones give a decent burial.  I will continue to criticise Sinn Féin and the IRA for this but as long as they maintain a ceasefire and declare their absolute commitment to peace I will stand four square with them, and as <Col N="1149" /> soon as they do so again I will stand four square with them, but not until then.</P>
    <P>The London bombing by the IRA cannot be justified under any circumstances. It was a cynical and vicious act designed to cause death and destruction. In this it was successful and it has left two people dead and many more injured.  On behalf of Democratic Left I wish to express my condolences to the families of the dead and to sympathise with the injured.</P>
    <P>What can one say about the bombing of Canary Wharf &mdash; the forethought, planning and strategic discussions that went into making and setting the bomb in place, its detonation, when, on what pretext and by whose orders?</P>
    <P>The questions reverberate.  The timing of the bomb on 9 February has no external logic.  It cannot be related, for example, to the goal of the deadline for all-party talks set by the two Governments. Can it be related then to an internal logic of the republican movement, whether of a tactical nature or an infinitely more ominous struggle for ascendancy between the political and militaristic wings?  That is quite possible. It would not be the first time it has happened.</P>
    <P>Clearly, last Friday Gerry Adams and Pat Doherty appeared as shocked as other politicians and citizens in both Ireland and Britain, but this raises more questions than it answers.  What of authority within Sinn Féin?  What is the future of Sinn Féin?  I accept that Sinn Féin does not claim to speak for the IRA, but it is self-evident that it has used its special relationship with the IRA in establishing its place in the peace process.  The Irish Government accepted the good faith of Sinn Féin and welcomed it into the democratic family. With the agreement of the other parties in the Oireachtas, it set up the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation specifically to facilitate the transition to constitutional politics.  The Alliance Party took a leap of courage and imagination and also participated.  Gordon Wilson came to terms with history and magnanimously gave Sinn Féin his trust. <Col N="1150" /> Within the Forum and elsewhere the Government dealt circumspectly with those issues the republican tradition found most difficult &mdash; the principles of consent and of democratic endorsement of whatever settlement for Northern Ireland might emerge.  I have to say that our collective trust has taken a hammering. If it is not the case now that the Irish Government has been betrayed by Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin itself as an organisation has been dealt a devastating blow by the IRA.</P>
    <P>I accept that Gerry Adams believes he may have been double-crossed by John Major, although I think that belief is simplistic in the extreme.  Does Gerry Adams not, at this juncture, believe he has also been betrayed by the IRA?  It is not just a question of attributing blame or expressing outrage.  Of course we express outrage.  The IRA may regard Canary Wharf as a &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo;, or an economic target, but what of the lives of people blighted by the bomb?  What of the sense of foreboding engendered in the people of Dublin. London and Belfast as they go about their everyday lives?  What about the reborn fears of men and women in Northern Ireland for their children? The people of Northern Ireland are faced with the possible return to the deadly and futile violence which caused great pain and suffering over 25 years.</P>
    <P>The political aspect of the peace process has been thrown into disarray not by the dissembling of the British Government or the obdurate tunnel vision of the Unionists but by a planned operation by the IRA.  Let us be very clear about the whispered or implied culpability of the British Government in creating the conditions leading to this bombing.  There can be no moral equivalence between the conduct of politics &mdash; no matter how tedious, no matter how frustrating &mdash; and acts of terrorism. It is the IRA and the IRA alone which has devalued the currency of Sinn Féin and of republicans in the peace pocess. By the one act of aggression the peace process has been seriously wounded.  It is now in intensive care, and we all have <Col N="1151" /> to work hard for its recovery.  What cannot happen again is that the IRA switches off the respirator.  That is a crude metaphor for the situation we find ourselves in, but it is an authentic one.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  The big issue now is whether the republican movement &mdash; the IRA and Sinn Féin &mdash; will recommit themselves to a complete cessation of violence.  No sovereign Government of Ireland, freely elected by the people in democratic elections, has ever dealt with the representatives of private armies as if they were statesmen. Sinn Féin is now confronted with the practical though not the moral dilemma of deciding whether it is merely proxies for the IRA or a genuinely political movement, representative of republican politics and responding to the slings and arrows of politics in a political way.</P>
    <P>I believe those people in Sinn Féin who are genuinely committed exclusively to critical dalogue have the sympathy of the people of Ireland.  They face the daunting task of asserting their position in the context of a movement which has always denied accountability and which will not even share power and decision making with its own political supporters.</P>
    <P>I accept that Sinn Féin, or many people in Sinn Féin, desperately want the peace process to continue.  In that aspiration it will find no more resloute protagonist than the Irish Government. The Government has made it plain that we will maintain dialogue in all quarters which would help repair and reconstruct the peace process.  However, we will not accept Sinn Féin as a full player in the process if it abides only by the rules set for it by an unknown cabal of seven militarists.  Of course, the republican tradition must participate in the peace process, but that can hardly be if the movement will do so only on its own terms.</P>
    <P>Despite the delinquency of the IRA this Government will not allow the peace process to be blown to smithereens. We will also resist all threats to <Col N="1152" /> democracy and will defend the security of the State.  The safety and security of all the people of this island are our primary concern &mdash; a concern that is shared by all parties in this House.</P>
    <P>Certainly, this peace process has been much slower and more tortuous than people may have wished or anticipated, but it is no slower than other such processes on a global scale.  It took Nelson Mandela four years from his release from prison until his election as President of South Africa.  In the Middle East, how long has it taken the Palestinians to earn a modicum of self rule?  The lesson is that we have to hang in there to secure a settlement &mdash; unless, of course, the IRA sees its future as a kind of born again INLA rather than seeing its membership move into productive occupations and interests and allowing them to live a normal life with their familes.  That choice, as of now, rests with the membership of the IRA.  That onus of persuasion for a future in the interest of all the people of Ireland rests, to a large extent, with Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>The IRA ceasefire facilitated Sinn Féin's entry into the democratic political process.  Sinn Féin enjoyed access to Government at the highest level under both the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and the present Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation provided Sinn Féin with a public platform and an opportunity to engage with other political parties in addressing the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was progress on other fronts also.  The process of demilitarisation in Northern Ireland got under way and broadcasting restrictions were lifted.  A phased release of prisoners has taken place in the Republic.  One of the bitter ironies of the IRA's action is that nine prisoners from a paramilitary background were due for release on 10 February. These releases are now stalled. Releases also followed the remission of sentences in Northern Ireland.  Most importantly, the people of Northern Ireland demonstrated their support for peace in clear and unambiguous terms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> This Government has worked tirelessly &mdash; as did the previous Government &mdash; to advance the peace process, building on the good will and support of the European Union and the American Administration.  At every conceivable opportunity we have engaged the British Government on the urgencies and imperatives of the process.  Following on the work of our predecessors we brought the negotiations leading to the Framework Document to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>If the IRA thought the Canary Wharf bombing was a useful tactic to push the peace process forward, it shows how tenuous its grasp of reality is.  What it has done is to reactivate the political dinosaurs and give strength and succour to existing siege mentalities.</P>
    <P>A political solution and a permanent peace will require far more flexibility and willingness to compromise than has been evident to now.  Certainly there was frustration at the failure of the British to respond more positively to the new circumstances created by the ceasefire &mdash; and I publicly criticised the British response on a number of occasions. Where I and other democrats part company with Sinn Féin is that we do not regard frustration with the slow pace of political change as a justification for the detonation of a bomb in a busy city on a Friday evening at 7 p.m.</P>
    <P>It is also important to understand that the reaction of the British Government has not been the only factor in the peace process leading to frustration.  Sinn Féin has thus far failed to endorse the principle of consent and has declined to ratify the final report of the Forum drafting committee.  I feel frustrated by the failure, more than two years on, to state unequivocally that it has accepted the Downing Street Declaration with its key principles of agreement and consent.  I felt frustrated by Sinn Féin's failure to dissociate itself from the killings carried out under the umbrella of the Direct Action Against Drugs group, which we know was simply a flag of convenience for the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>There was frustration on the <Col N="1154" /> Nationalist side at the continued refusal of the Unionist parties to take part in all-party talks, but there was also frustration among Unionists at the apparent unwillingness of Nationalists even to consider proposals they were putting forward for an electoral process.  The blame for the failure to make more progress cannot be laid solely at the door of any one party.  We must all accept at least a share of the responsibility for not making more progress.  It is now more important than ever that the peace process should not only continue, but should be intensified.  The peace process predates the IRA ceasefire and it will not end because the IRA has announced an end to its ceasefire.  Much progress was made prior to the IRA ceasefire &mdash; for example, the Downing Street Declaration which was perhaps the single most significant political breakthrough on the Northern Ireland problem and Anglo-Irish relations for more than a decade.  The IRA ceasefire allowed Sinn Féin to become a full part of the process.  The process must continue and Sinn Féin can again play a full part when the IRA reverts to the position which applied from 31 August 1994 up to last Friday.</P>
    <P>The statement by the British Prime Minister in the Commons yesterday offered reassurance that the peace process would continue and that the two Governments can find a common basis on which to move things forward.  The clear indication by Mr. Major that an electoral process was just one option he was considering and that he was prepared to consider alternative proposals from others, including the Irish Government, was particularly encouraging.</P>
    <P>The past few weeks have been difficult for relations between the two Governments.  The indisputable fact is that most progress has been made on Northern Ireland when the two Governments have been acting in concert.  The indisputable fact is that there can be no solution to the problems of Northern Ireland without the co-operation of the two Governments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> Certainly, there have been difficulties. When differences arise, the onus is on democratic politicians to persevere with negotiations.  We do not need or want IRA bombs to concentrate our minds.  The best thing the Army Council of the IRA ever did was to call the ceasefire in August 1994.  The next best thing it can do is to restore the ceasefire now.  Let Sinn Féin realise that a democratic agreement can only be arrived at by democratic means.  There is no other way.</P>
    <P>I will summarise my contribution to this debate as follows: peace is the sovereign right of the Irish people; a violent minority will not be allowed to dictate the pace of political progress; bodies in the streets of London will not keep the peace on the streets of Northern Ireland; talk of peace and acts of murder are incompatible; the door is open to Sinn Féin talks with the Government, but there is only one requirement &mdash; a requirement no democrat can quibble with: no more violence.  You cannot have half a ceasefire, and you cannot be half a democrat; the Irish Government will not be deflected in its search for a just and lasting settlement, based on the principles of agreement and consent.</P>
    <P>That is the commitment this Government is making to this House and I know it has the support of both the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties in that endeavour.</P>

      <P>This morning as I drove to this House from Donegal I crossed the Border as usual at Lifford and then recrossed it into County Monaghan.  At the Donegal-Tyrone border I saw a group of workmen busily engaged in <Col N="1156" /> what I had learned to assume in recent times was the continued dismantling of all signs of what had been a major military check point.  In the meantime I discovered they were, in fact, erecting ramps which had been removed previously. I sincerely hope this is not a nightmarish sort of <i>déjà vu.</i> Cardinal Daly described 9 February as Black Friday. I could not agree more.  To plant a massive bomb in the heart of London is an act that must be condemned without the slightest hint of reservation.  This act, which was meant to be a gesture on behalf of Irish nationalism, can only cause further heartbreak to everyone who had laboured so hard in recent years to create peace and justice in our land.  To suggest otherwise is to approve of evil at its worst.  Let me repeat what I have said here many times: no political aim is worth the shedding of one single human life, except strictly in self defence.</P>
      <P>However, I refuse to join the chorus of unthinking people who leaped to the nearest microphone to put the blame for this bomb on Gerry Adams and his colleagues who, to my certain knowledge, have worked intensely during the past few years in the quest for peace.  The process began as far back as the late 1980s and involved such people as Gerry Adams, John Hume, Charles Haughey, Martin Mansergh, Reverend Roy Magee, Father Alex Reid and, of course, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  There were probably many others also of whom we have not heard.  Whoever gave the orders to plant last Friday's bomb would not be fit to lace the shoes of any of these people &mdash; his place in history will be in the darkness to which he belongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the leaders of Sinn Féin who say they were just as shocked as the rest of us by the news from the Provisional IRA that its ceasefire was over.  We have got used to the repeated statements from a variety of quarters that Sinn Féin and the Provos are one and the same.  I refer these people to an article by Gerry Adams in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times.</i> Referring to <Col N="1157" /> the decision by the Government to suspend talks with Sinn Féin he said:</P>
    <P>What of those whom we represent? Are they to be discriminated against by the Irish Government in a crude attempt by that government to pressurise an organisation for which Sinn Féin and our electorate have no responsibility or control?</P>
    <P>Whatever may have been the case in the past I believe this statement is essentially true and comes from a man who certainly supports the Provisional IRA in a broad sense but who has long ago come to realise the campaign of violence is totally unproductive as a method of securing political progress in Ireland. Deputy Harney stated that many people admitted that Gerry Adams was essential to the peace process.  She said, however, that without Gerry Adams and his associates, there may have been no need for a peace process.  May I remind Deputy Harney that perhaps without the intransigence of successive British Governments, where Nationalists were impoverished by a Stormont regime and denied their civil rights, there may have been no need for the formation of the Provisional IRA?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What Gerry Adams and his colleagues had achieved was their success in persuading the IRA to take the same view as them and we had the ceasefire of 18 months ago.  Immediately spokesmen for both the British Government and the Unionist parties declared that a period of three months of peace would be a necessary precondition before talks could begin.  From that day to this, the word &ldquo;preconditions&rdquo; has become one of the most familiar words in our everyday language.  As far as the London <Col N="1158" /> bomb is concerned, the blame can be directed only at the people who planted it.  Gerry Adams made that very clear. However, the excuse for breaking the ceasefire was handed to the hard men in the Provisional IRA by John Major and his Government.  They had long ago come to the false conclusion that the ceasefire was permanent &mdash; not because they were determined to remove the root causes of the troubles in the first place but because they had a simplistic notion that a lack of support would prevent a paramilitary group from again starting a terror campaign.</P>
    <P>Mr. Major and his colleagues saw no further need for urgency in pursuing the peace process.  They resemble a football team that builds up a ten point lead early in the game and then sits back in the arrogant belief that victory is secure. That is a foolish attitude to adopt in any sport; it is nothing short of criminal when it affects the lives and well being of generations of people.  If John Major's recent actions were solely because of domestic parliamentary problems I sincerely hope he soon realises he is in great danger of destroying something which he displayed a great deal of courage and skill in helping to create.  Many people have said that his rapid dismissal of the Mitchell report was the last straw.  That is not the case.  The sense of frustration had developed long before that and it is clear that plans for the bombing had been prepared for some time.  It may well be that the bombers would have hesitated had the Mitchell report been greeted in a more positive fashion but we will never know.</P>
    <P>It was fairly clear as far back as 12 December that the British Government was not in any mood to accept anything remotely radical that Senator Mitchell might suggest.  On that day Sir Patrick Mayhew said he would be one of the first people to meet the commission on their arrival in Belfast and he would remind them that they were there in the role of advisers only but the British Government would have the last <Col N="1159" /> word on decommissioning and Washington Three was carved in stone as far as they were concerned.  This was a snub delivered in a style beloved of the days of Queen Victoria's glorious empire. We should not have been surprised that the distinguished Senator's work was dealt with in such a summary fashion.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  My party leader has made it clear where Fianna Fáil stands.  We will do everything in our power to keep the channels of communication open with all those who may have the slightest influence in persuading the paramilitaries on both sides to pull back from the brink and to let the peace process proceed once again.  As regards formal talks with Sinn Féin, the Government may feel it is not a free agent at this time because of the importance of perception in these matters but I am glad to note that it is determined not to shut the doors completely.</P>
    <P>My party leader has proposed that Senator Mitchell be brought back into the equation as quickly as possible.  This is an excellent idea and has been widely welcomed.  I hope Mr. Mitchell will be willing to do so because he has already shown a remarkable understanding of the issues in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I hope John Hume's suggestion that a referendum be held on two very pertinent questions will be seriously considered. The two questions would have to be answered by everyone, including the extremists on both sides.  If 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the people of all Ireland give a positive answer, then no minority from whatever side can challenge the result.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to make a contribution on such an important issue.  I sympathise with the families of those who lost their lives in London last Friday in such a horrific incident.  The scale of damage to property was in the region of £100 million. That is a huge loss by any standard and I do not like to see that happen in <Col N="1160" /> any society or country.  I sympathise sincerely with the British people on this atrocity.</P>
      <P>However, the writing was on the wall a few weeks ago.  It appeared on the walls of Belfast, a city of realists enjoying peace while it lasted, hoping it would continue and knowing it was fragile. The street signs said simply: &ldquo;Permanence &mdash; Decommissioning &mdash; Elections &mdash; WAR&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Downing Street Declaration did not include these words, instead it presented promises that were meant to be broken and words that were not meant to be kept.  Rather than make it too obvious, a policy of excuse and delay practised for generations once more slipped into a smooth operating mode.  We were told we could not have all party talks because the peace was not permanent.  Sir Patrick Mayhew could not speak with Gerry Adams in peace time but even <i>The Economist</i> found this surprising bearing in mind that he managed to talk, in secrecy, with the IRA in wartime.</P>
      <P>More time was bought with President Clinton's very welcome and helpful visit.  The international commission, chaired with distinction by Senator Mitchell, was dispatched to the House of Commons refuse bin when the report was hot off the printing presses.  Such was the haste that even Sinn Féin was spared the embarassment of accepting or rejecting the report.</P>
      <P>Everyone in Ireland could see that elections were the next delaying tactic. The next excuse would be guaranteed followed by a special relationship, followed by more permanence, a little more commissioning and all the imagination of devious minds which seem to enjoy an indefatigable capacity for endless and meaningless negotiations as long as the bottom line remains the same &mdash; no improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the casualties is that the Taoiseach, in his honest approach and concern for peace, was dragged into this and the twin track approach and various <Col N="1161" /> communiqués were made more confusing, if not contradicted, at the press conferences at which they were presented. The IRA leadership gave Gerry Adams and his colleagues 18 months to see what they could do with peace.  On numerous occasions Gerry Adams warned, as far as he could without being accused of making threats, that the peace was very fragile and he could not sustain it without help.  The Government of the United Kindom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was and remains unwilling to give that help. Gerry Adams was joined in his warning by no less than the Chief Constable of the RUC and I have no doubt that the various security organisations in Britain and Northern Ireland were able to read the signs, even those written on the walls of Belfast.</P>
    <P>It is fanciful to think, though it is given much credence here, that the governing party in the UK is dependent on Unionist MPs for its continuance in office.  This ignores the fact that they recently voted against the Government in the House of Commons on the Nolan report.  No one here suggested that any member of the Labour Party in Britain or the Liberal Democrats would vote against the Government for the time being on a matter relating to Northern Ireland.  It is not for me to attribute motives to the Government of our neighbouring island &mdash; judge it by its actions, not by its words.  Gerry Adams delivered on his side and, with style and daring imagination, Deputy Reynolds delivered on his side.  The loyalist paramilitarits made their contribution to peace.</P>
    <P>The people in Northern Ireland want peace.  Some of their leaders have not been blessed with imagination.  &ldquo;Balance&rdquo; is a word they would apply to a trapeze artist and they appear to remain in office by generating fear.  The contradiction of Northern Ireland is that those who want peace and to live in harmony with their neighbours are the same people who, in the secrecy of the ballot box, vote in vast numbers for hard line politicians.  This is not because middle <Col N="1162" /> ground candidates do not stand but they do not poll enough to make a dent in the approach of their elected representatives. One can hardly blame the elected representatives for lacking any trace of forward vision as they cling to the proven recipe for topping the poll.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the sad fact that many of Northern Ireland's future leadership classes have been completing their education away from home in recent years and will not return.  This drain of educated people is a growing and serious loss to Ulster.  There is no justification for segregating children at kindergarden on religious grounds and expecting them to integrate 14 years later.  I know the leadership of the Catholic Church in Northern Ireland would not agree but segregation has not helped.  The British Government may have many faults but it does not deny minorities funds for education.</P>
    <P>The history of the former British Empire is littered with instances where Britain was forced at gun-point out of countries and the then terrorists became statesmen.  The late President Begin won a Nobel prize.  It does not suit the British establishment in terms of its army and various intelligence forces to vacate Northern Ireland.  It will not go. It has never gone voluntarily.  We are dealing with a fragile situation and if the Taoiseach seeks to measure those involved in the negotiations by his own high standards he will meet serious negotiating difficulties.</P>
    <P>It may perhaps be forgotten already that Prime Minister John Major has never spoken to Gerry Adams. However it is disappointing and a serious error on the part of our Taoiseach that he now refuses to speak to Mr. Adams who made a sincere and honest attempt to deliver peace.  It gives a very bad example to refuse to talk to people when we are encouraging others to do the opposite.  I appreciate the strain on the Taoiseach due to recent events and I ask him to reconsider this matter.  My party feels bound to support the Government line on this, but I feel <Col N="1163" /> confident that my party would reconsider its position if the Taoiseach reassessed his decision and decided to re-open dialogue with Sinn Féin.  The people of Northern Ireland have spoken time and again through the ballot box. The British Government will do absolutely nothing to change that.  It is unforgivable that in addition it enters into all these solemn declarations.  It is time for the Republic to say more openly what our real position is on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The plantation of Ulster may have been three centuries ago but the descendants of those planters are still there and they have made it clear time and again that they do not want to integrate with the rest of the island.  Quite a number of the remainder of the population of what is now known as Northern Ireland have made it clear that they want to remain in Northern Ireland and not be part of this Republic.  That is their choice and we respect it, but they should be able to live in peace.  It appears that many people would sign up to the aspiration of getting back the fourth green field and having the dream of a united Ireland made a reality. Those same people know it is only a dream and, indeed, do not want a united Ireland as the Republic cannot afford it. The great majority of the people of Northern Ireland do not want to be with us and we have stated on numerous occasions that we respect that right and view.</P>
    <P>We should be much more clear in the message that we convey to the IRA.  We condemn violence and we counsel peace.  We should bluntly tell them that the people here do not want a united Ireland &mdash; the people here want peace. The people in Northern Ireland do not want the British and they do not want the people in the Republic, and their wishes should be respected.  Many people here feel a responsibility for the nationalists in the North.  These people are entitled to Irish citizenship and they are free to move here.  A number of people have moved south in recent <Col N="1164" /> years, but it is clear that many more have not availed of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Our message to the people of Northern Ireland and the IRA should be more explicit.  The people of Ireland hold their destiny in their own hands. The paramilitaries on both sides have offered peace, but the people's representatives have refused to negotiate with them.  The people must decide whether these are the leaders they want. So far they have indicated that they are very happy with them and in 1997 they will have another chance to voice their views.</P>
    <P>On his election as Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Bertie Ahern made a historic visit to Belfast and met the two traditions there.  My party is committed to the peace process and without the tireless efforts of Deputy Ahern we would not have made such progress.  He has been diligent in his attendance at the forum and in recent times contributed to the Senator Mitchell peace process.  With the involvement of Senator Mitchell we will see a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Until the people decide on new leaders violence will continue, lives will be lost and time will be wasted.  Violence may be condemned, but that will not save lives.  The people of Northern Ireland should know that peace lies in their own hands and that any arrangements brokered in Washington, Dublin or elsewhere will be transient until they decide to talk to each other.  Gerry Adams took a big risk.  It did not work but I thank him for it.  I reiterate, in one of the noblest democracies in the world, that we condemn violence, we want peace on this island.</P>

      <P>The bombing of Canary Wharf last Friday is the most disappointing development to have taken place since I entered the Dáil in <Col N="1165" /> 1992.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this horrific incident and to the many people who were injured.  The Provisional IRA has engaged in a fundamental breach of trust with those of us who have been actively engaged in the peace process &mdash; much time and effort has been invested in that process by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the former Taoiseach, John Hume and many others.  More importantly it is a breach of trust and betrayal of the people of Northern Ireland, the Republic and Britain who are in full support of the process.  The attack was barbaric and unjustifiable, but of course that is nothing new.  The Provisional IRA has conducted its campaign in face of the overwhelming opposition of the Irish people since the early 1970s.  Its view of self-determination in this regard has always been hollow.  I agree whole-heartedly with John Hume and Deputy Bertie Ahern who stated umpteen times that if the Irish people have a right to self-determination they must also have a right to determine the means by which that self-determination is pursued.</P>
      <P>The position of the Irish people on this matter is clear and unambiguous, it needs no clarification.  I have discerned something new in the fall-out from last Friday's atrocity.  In the past Sinn Féin has been an unapologetic supporter of the Provisional IRA.  On this occasion, however, I detect a sense of desperation from these quarters, which is hardly surprising. Many Sinn Féin members have honestly pursued the peace process and worked hard on its development.  The IRA has added a new dimension to its betrayal, its own political wing.  Sinn Féin has failed to condemn the Canary Wharf attack &mdash; I wish it would do so &mdash; but I recognise the dilemma facing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since August 1994 we have formally entered dialogue with Sinn Féin on the basis that, through it, we spoke to the IRA.  That has been useful to the extent that any enduring settlement cannot be reached without accommodation of the <Col N="1166" /> republican movement, but to whom can we speak now?  It appears Sinn Féin no longer speaks for the IRA.  Its principal spokespersons do not appear to have known about last Friday's attack &mdash; at least that is the view of most political commentators.  Gerry Adams stated that a continuation of the peace process remains his personal priority, and I welcome that statement, but it counts for little in the context of a resumption of the Provisional military campaign.  We need to know, and only the Provisional IRA can tell us, whether Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin continue to speak for that organisation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the resumption of the military campaign puts Sinn Féin outside the realm of normal political debate and exchange.  Unless that position is reversed it renders useless almost two years of work by Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and many others.  It prevents any possible assessment by them of the Mitchell report, the basis on which the Irish Government worked to bring all-party talks to fruition.</P>
    <P>It has left Sinn Féin with two options: to convince the IRA to recommence its ceasefire on a permanent basis or to disassociate itself from the military wing.  I recognise the difficulties that would pose for Sinn Féin for personal and historic reasons, but unless the Provisionals can be convinced to call off their campaign, that is a decision it must make.  I would be pleased if Sinn Féin were to take that courageous step but, as a solution to the current impasse, it is a poor second.</P>
    <P>Much of what we have achieved thus far has been with the aid of a united republican movement.  United organisations are easier to deal with and decisions reached by them are easier to uphold.  Irrespective of whether Sinn Féin remains publicly within the republican fold, its capacity at present to speak on behalf of the IRA is severely damaged.  What has taken place is a split in every sense of that word.</P>
    <P>I support the Government's decision to break off ministerial contact with Sinn Féin.  I do so reluctantly because I <Col N="1167" /> believe we were in sight of a settlement. I know republican involvement is central to such achievement, but it is essential that a message be sent to Sinn Féin and the IRA.  That message should indicate that there can be no question of a resumption of a campaign of violence, be it tactical, strategic or otherwise, in conjunction with the peace process; it is all or nothing.  Sinn Féin needs to clarify its position; it supports the democratic process or it does not.  Neither is it fair to say, as some republicans have done, that the IRA has received little in return for its cessation of violence.</P>
    <P>In a statement earlier today the Taoiseach outlined the progress thus far.  He admitted we would like to have seen more, but he recommitted himself and the Government to continuing the search for further progress.  I wish to add a few points to those made by the Taoiseach.  He confined himself to political progress but, as we know, other benefits have been derived from the peace process.  For instance, the improvements in the economy and tourism, brought about by the ceasefire, have been considerable.  The Tánaiste outlined the extent of progress in those areas.  They have added to the considerable improvement in the quality of life of everybody in Northern Ireland and south of the Border including and, perhaps, especially those who support the republican movement.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the idea floated during the past few days that the IRA has embarked on a strategic campaign on the British mainland to invigorate the peace process.  The inference is that any campaign can be confined to the British mainland, thus not interfering with the lives of Sinn Féin supporters in the North and the South.  That is nonsense. The obvious retort, voiced during the past weekend and to me many months ago, if for loyalist paramilitaries to target the Republic in response.  If that situation develops, and I fervently hope it does not, I do not envy those whose job it will be to explain that to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> I commend the loyalist paramilitaries for the restraint they have shown since Friday and I appeal to them to continue to do so.  I welcome the commitment of the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic Party to continue to argue the case for the political process with loyalist paramilitaries.  The onus is on Sinn Féin to do the same.</P>
    <P>There are two options facing us.  We either return to the position of two weeks ago or that of two years ago, which would be unacceptable.  I, like others, have been frustrated with the recent approach to the peace process taken by the British Government.  I have also been frustrated at the Unionists' inability to do what is in their interests, to enter dialogue to lay to rest, once and for all, the divisions of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome John Major's contribution to the House of Commons yesterday. He did not close the door on the peace process.  I implore the Provisionals to do likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the condemnation of Friday night's bombing expressed in the House today and I share fully the sentiments of condolences to the bereaved, the injured and their families. I have heard more common sense spoken about Northern Ireland today in this House than I have heard for a long time.  It is sadly ironic that it takes an event like this to produce a debate of this kind in the House; we should have had it a long time ago.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck by what Deputy Bertie Ahern said about the substantive issues that face us and the people of Northern Ireland and the UK. He was clear, unambiguous and explicit. I refer to his comments on the substantive issues, not those about procedure or performance.  I am delighted to be able to say that and to have witnessed it.  Lest I appear to be following my usual political prejudice, I must also say that I was not surprised by what Deputy Harney said because I have always taken the view that she is very sensible on these particular issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> It is not going too far to say that what has been said so far in this House today by and large would be supported by the SDLP.  The odd man out in this process is Sinn Féin.  It is clear that party has a different view from other parties in this House involved in the three stranded talks or in the Forum of what constitutes the principle of consent.  That became clear on the day the Forum report was issued, and it did not surprise me.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report of the Mitchell Commission on not only the process of decommissioning but the politics of the situation are interesting. Paragraph 61 of that report states:</P>
    <P>Rigid adherence by the parties to their past positions will simply continue the stalemate which has already lasted too long.  In a society as deeply divided as Northern Ireland, reaching across the &ldquo;peace line&rdquo; requires a willingness to take risks for peace.</P>
    <P>I heartily endorse those sentiments. Today has shown that all parties in this House take the same view.  The parties in this House and, I believe, the SDLP have shown a considerable willingness to move away from their past positions and to accept it is people they must serve, not the ideas of yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell Commission identified two very different positions on decommissioning. I was about to say &ldquo;extreme&rdquo;, but I am speaking only in the sense of a spectrum.  One position holds that there must be complete decommissioning before any talks start.  The other is that there will be no decommissioning until talks have been satisfactorily concluded.  The Mitchell Commission concluded that neither approach could or would prevail.  I agree, even though personally, emotionally, politically, ideologically and literally I would be a supporter of the first view.  If we are ever to make progress, neither view can prevail.  What happens must fall somewhere between them on the lines set out by the Mitchell Commission at a pace to be agreed between the parties to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> The same logic would apply to a political settlement that would follow which is the aim of these talks.  There are two diametrically opposed objectives &mdash; one is the constitution of a Thirty-two County Republic and the other is the maintenance of a permanent union with the UK under unchanged constitutional arrangements.  Neither objective can prevail.  One does not need to think for long before coming to that conclusion.  As long as talks are seen to be aimed at achieving or making one or other of those objectives prevail, they are doomed to failure.  It does not matter how much understanding, patience or willingness to accommodate we show; as long as it is seen that the aim of talks is to make either one of those two objectives prevail, talks are doomed to failure.  We will not see either of those objectives prevail in the lifetime of anybody currently in this House, so we should stop trying to solve a problem that cannot be solved and trying to reconcile objectives that are fundamentally irreconcilable.</P>
    <P>We should turn our attention to what politicians are elected to do, that is to resolve today the political problems of today, to deal today with the needs of people in a way which makes sensible, prudent and democratic provision for tomorrow.  It comes from the logic of the Mitchell Commission.  I quote that commission for one reason above all.  It consisted of a group of people who are widely trusted for their judgment, who have heard all sides of the issues and who put forward what are to my mind a series of eminently sensible proposals. We do not all agree with every one of their proposals, we do not all agree even that any one of them is ideal, but we recognise the recommendations on decommissioning &mdash; as I think all parties in this House do &mdash; as being, in all the circumstances, a wise, acceptable and balanced way to go about dealing with the problem that confronts us.  We must take the same approach to the resolution of, what we have called for so many years, the northern issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> What can be realistically achieved?  It is realistic to talk of an objective defined as the constitution of a democratic, stable, pluralist and prosperous polity in Northern Ireland guaranteed by two neighbouring Governments which each have a clear, incontestable interest in its stability.  We should set as our objective the achievement of that kind of polity guaranteed by those two governments with each recognising, accepting and mutually respecting the burden of trust reposed on them respectively by the two communities in Northern Ireland.  The two Governments should guarantee that polity in every appropriate way for as long as the people of Northern Ireland, want it to continue.</P>
    <P>I say to the sincere, honest, peaceful and well-meaning people and Members in this House to whom I spoke in the last couple of days who &ldquo;condemn the bombing in London on Friday but ...&rdquo; and then go on to talk of their understanding of how people could be led to do it, that that is the most dangerous, specious nonsense and we should not fall into that trap.  Frustration with the slowness of the political process is not an excuse for bombing.  There is no excuse for killing or maiming in saying that we have not achieved what we would like to have achieved in 18 months.</P>
    <P>Let us look back over the life of one of the people who was most involved in bringing us to this, John Hume.  How much frustration has that man felt in over a quarter of a century of his work for peace?  Has it ever led him to violence? How much frustration was felt by former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who started the talks with the British in 1980, by former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, who went through a difficult period with Margaret Thatcher between 1983 and 1985, or by Deputy Albert Reynolds in all the work that he put into this.  Every one of them went on through reverses, difficulties and frustrations for far longer than 17 months.  If we have made any progress, as indeed we have and the Taoiseach outlined it here <Col N="1172" /> today, it has been because those people were firm in their resolve, they were committed to democratic, peaceful politics and they would not allow themselves to be deflected into violence. Surely, the lesson is clear.  That is the only way.</P>

      <P>I offer my deepest sympathy to the families of those killed in the bombing in Canary Wharf in London last Friday and, indeed, to the families of the 100 or so who were severely injured in this outrage.  I condemn the IRA for the action it took last Friday, which has been referred to as &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo;.  There will never be any justification for violence.  Democracy is the route of discussion, discourse and debate in solving our problems.  Those of us involved in the constitutional democratic process understand that democracy has many imperfections. Only in the context of a democratic society is there an opportunity for discussion, compromise and debate in resolving the problem.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, as others on all sides of this House have done, too.  I thought it was a speech of great substance, a speech which will stand the test of time.  It was challenging and direct but it was extremely balanced.  It raised many difficult points but it got to the heart of the matter in posing questions for all sides.  I congratulate Deputy Ahern.  He served Irish politics and this House well with that contribution today. It was a privilege and, perhaps, a once in a lifetime chance, for people like me to be here for such a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subscribe to the view expressed in simple yet stark terms by the former Taoiseach.  Deputy Albert Reynolds, when he wiped away all the waffle got <Col N="1173" /> down to the hard reality, and spoke about the choices.  The bottom line choices are either violence or talks.  Trying to keep the balance right is akin to balancing the scales of justice.  We only want all party talks.  Unless, as has been outlined, we speak to each other rather than at each other, there can be no way forward.  One can identify when and where, over the past 17 to 18 months, people failed to grasp the opportunity to realise that the only possible way to begin to solve the many insurmountable obstacles confronting them was in getting all parties to participate in talks around the table.</P>
    <P>One feature in all of this that must be highlighted for Unionists and loyalists in Northern Ireland is how much Nationalist and republican opinion has changed in recent years.  It has changed very substantially in one basic, fundamental way, exemplified by all parties in this House contending that the principle of consent must underpin any solution or way forward in Northern Ireland.  While, as an Irishman, I would love to see the island of Ireland united I accept, as does everybody on this part of the island, that such an achievement can come about only with consent and, without which, we must seek alternative ways forward.</P>
    <P>That same fundamentally changed opinion constituted a substantial contribution to the overall debate that has not been given the credence it deserves on either the British or loyalist side of the equation in Northern Ireland.  I ask people to dwell on that.  At the beginning of this peace process it was said that making peace was one thing but ensuring its long-term viability and stability would be very much harder.</P>
    <P>I say directly to Mr. David Trimble, the leader of the largest Unionist party in Northern Ireland, who has been put on the spot, was involved directly in this process, and is perceived by his electorate as a man of ability who could lead and find a way forward while protecting them, &ldquo;do not make the mistake of reaching into the rhetoric of the past to find your vision of the future&rdquo;.  That is <Col N="1174" /> the direction in which he has been moving over recent months and it is to be regretted.  I give that advice in the knowledge that he is a man of enormous ability, with huge responsibilities, representing the loyalist people of Northern Ireland in finding a way forward.</P>
    <P>We must always remember that it is easier to be on the outside throwing the bricks, it takes a far greater person, one of stature, to lead, to find new ground leading to solutions and to be at the cutting edge.  We have seen this more than adequately manifested recently in the Middle East, in former Yugoslavia and South Africa.  People there had the capacity to sit down with their bitter enemies in the realisation and understanding that violence contributed nothing but that, instead, talking openly and honestly in a hard, precise, confident manner constituted the only way of finding a solution to their problems.</P>
    <P>I appeal directly to Mr. David Trimble to seek a way forward in an honest, open fashion, by coming to the table to listen to what all sides have to say, forming his opinions first-hand.  In addition it is vital that Sinn Féin, and its leadership, who have contributed so much to this peace process, should not be marginalised in any way.  It is crucial that all means of communication, all doors be kept open to ensure that the blow to their credibility, wrongly dealt by the hard men within the IRA, is quickly remedied.  If that does not happen, the way forward will be very difficult.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by making two points.  I have grave doubts about some form of elected body constituting the beginning of the process.  No matter how limiting or well defined, from what I witnessed in the past such a proposal would be divisive and lead to hard positions being adopted.  Instead any electoral process must take place towards the end of discussions and negotiations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the approach adopted by President Clinton's Administration and that of former United States Senator, Mr. George Mitchell.  Representatives of all sides in the South, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom must <Col N="1175" /> and should have confidence in Mr. Mitchell's ability to help in finding a way forward.  I hope he will be appointed in the immediate future, time being of the essence because this vacuum cannot be allowed to widen.</P>

      <P>First, I offer my condolences to the relatives of those killed in the Canary Wharf bombing and wish those injured a speedy recovery.  Last Friday was a black day for them but also for people on both islands and representatives and politicians were confronted with the task of restoring the peace initiative.  There are but two options, violence or talks.</P>
      <P>Those who listened to contributions today know the commitment by all concerned to a resolution of this impasse and the need to get back on the road to peace.  While it is indeed a complex problem, with many obstacles to be overcome, there is sufficient commitment to ensure that all lines of communication are kept open, enabling all parties to move forward.  In this respect I must compliment Deputy Bertie Ahern who, since assuming the leadership of my party, has made a constructive, responsible contribution and demonstrated his true commitment to the resolution of the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Friday last was a black day for everybody, none feeling greater devastation than my constituents and others residing on either side of the Border.  I learned that from discussions with them over the weekend.  In that region people suffered much pain and grief from the atrocities perpetuated over the past 25 years. Since the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and on a smaller scale in Belturbet and Clones, residents south of the Border lived in fear of a recurrence whenever people attended functions or congregated.  Such fear was revived over the weekend with statements to the effect that were there to be a return to loyalist violence the South would be their target. <Col N="1176" /> On return to normal conditions the authorities North and South reopened Border road crossings, thus ending lengthy detours and general hardship for farmers who own land on either side. Their closure undoubtedly constituted a breeding ground for the IRA.  The way that matter was dealt with by the relevant authorities is to be commended. There was a reference to Senator Mitchell's report.  It is regrettable that more was not made of it as it provided the best opportunity for a way forward.  It would be a step forward if Senator Mitchell, as requested, made himself available as a peace envoy.  The turn-out, North and South, over two days for President Clinton's visit, was an indication of the importance of the peace process and certainly he made a great contribution to it.  It is regrettable that John Major did not make more use of the opportunity presented in Senator Mitchell's report.</P>
    <P>Good work is being done in a number of areas, including the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  This has proved to be of great benefit as a platform for both parties and individuals.  In the beginning there were 13 members on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation but this number has been reduced to 12 following the death of Senator Gordon Wilson.  Individual members represent the Seanad, Independent Members and the different political groupings.  Delegations from Church and State, trade unions, teachers' organisations and farmers made their contributions and were subject to strict questioning.  It was a beneficial exercise, some useful discussions took place and many probing questions were asked.  It had the effect of the Alliance Party, The Workers' Party and Sinn Féin intermingling and intermixing.  The same could be said of the British-Irish parliamentary body which did a number of reports on North-South trade and transport.  That body, with IBEC, CBI and the Chambers of Commerce, have organised conferences, as a result of which there was to be much networking between various companies.</P>

      <Col N="1177" /> Last week I asked the Taoiseach a question about trade North to South and South to North.  Industrialists in the North grasped the opportunity and increased their exports to the South by over 20.3 per cent while we had a 9 per cent increase into the North for the period up to September 1995.  There was a similar increase in cross-Border traffic and a big increase in tourism on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>Because of the commitment here allowances have to be made for people such as Gerry Adams.  I agree with the approach of the Government and the Opposition as far as bringing people into talks are concerned but the lines of communication must be kept open, if he has an influence &mdash; about which we were doubtful last Friday &mdash; on the IRA.  It is important to keep our lines of communication open.  We must do all we can.  There is no future for violence but there is a future for peace.  We have suffered long enough and hopefully the peace process will be brought back on the rail quickly.</P>

      <P>It is with a sad heart I take part in this debate.  We had all looked forward to a continuing peace process.  We had all listened with interest to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all the other Ministers involved in discussions with the British, the US and others that the peace would last.  Unfortunately, the IRA godfathers decided otherwise.  It is obvious Sinn Féin did not have the control over them to stop them.  It is sad that John Jeffries and Inan Bashir died on behalf of Irish people in Canary Wharf.  It is sad that people who had no contact or involvement with this country should die supposedly on the issue of Irish peace.  I sympathise with their families and the hundreds of others, some of whom are badly injured, who are damaged for life, <Col N="1178" /> as a result of being in or near Canary Wharf on Friday evening.  The IRA godfathers made that decision.</P>
      <P>Some people think this matter can be sorted out easily and that the ceasefire happened overnight.  Some previous speakers said this started in the early 1980s with the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey.  It was carried on by the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It was carried on again by the Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, and still further by the next Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in whose time there was agreement for the ceasefire.  I sat on the opposite side of the House at that time.  At the conclusion of his speech I walked across the floor and congratulated him on the enormous role he played.</P>
      <P>We must put this matter into perspective. Nobody thought on the night of the ceasefire that anything would be easy. There had and still has to be much discussion and negotiation.  It is important that those who were involved give assistance to those who are involved but in such a way as to be helpful and to ensure that the issue is above politics.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from what I heard here today that all the party leaders are at one in not only their condemnation but in their ideas about the way forward. There has to be a way forward, otherwise we would be in a state of depression.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, when he was in Opposition made every effort to get to know all the different groups in Northern Ireland who accepted democracy and talks as the way forward.  I was fortunate to visit the North with him on a number of occasions during that period while he was trying to make every effort to try to understand and get to know the problems. Little did we know then that he would be Taoiseach within a few short weeks.  It is important to note that he was and is able to deal with people.  He carried on where the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, had to leave off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> In his contribution today, the Taoiseach showed his extraordinary commitment to ensure to get out of this dark hour.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and all their colleagues are working night and day to ensure the peace process is brought back on the rails.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin, led by Gerry Adams, played a major role in the peace process. Credit must go to people such as John Hume, the clerics and all those involved.  If Gerry Adams is to be accepted as the leader he claimed he is, the IRA campaign must cease.</P>
    <P>We wish him well in that role because it will not be easy.  Once the ceasefire has been broken it will be more difficult to get it back on track but we must do so. All sides must act to move forward in the talks process, including Prime Minister John Major, the British Government and all the parties in Northern Ireland, including the Unionist parties.</P>
    <P>We must work harder to make sure each group understands the needs of the others because talking is better than war.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others have made it clear that those who consider the bomb and the gun have a role to play will have difficulty in sitting down at the talks table.  As the Taoiseach said, doors remain open and will be kept open if it can help solve the problem.  No doors have been shut but if people are not prepared to condemn acts of war, thereby condoning them, it is difficult for them to occupy a place at the table.  It is paramount that another ceasefire is put in place quickly.  Many ideas have been put forward in this debate and if Senator Mitchell or any other group can play a role they should be brought into the process.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and others have spelled out the political benefits of the last 18 months of peace.  I want to spell out the real benefits to the people of the Border regions and the Six Counties &mdash; the area where the greatest burden of <Col N="1180" /> the troubles has fallen.  The Border roads have been opened.  Tourism has bloomed.  I was in a hotel on Friday night and the faces of the staff were as if at a wake.  They had seen business boom in the last 18 months but now are desperate because they do not know what the future holds.  Local enterprise began to boom and foreign investment became possible.  There had been little foreign investment in the Border area because of the troubles over the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>People gained a freedom to travel the by-roads and main roads.  Social activities began to return to normal for sports and community groups, for example, where people could enjoy each other's company and talk freely to each other. There were no roadblocks and no army or police personnel evident.  Some people tried to make out that nothing had happened, that there were still roadblocks and structures in place.  I drove through Crossmaglen not so long ago using various roads to go in and out of the town and there were no army or police personnel evident.  I talked to some of the people there and they were happy that life was becoming more normal.</P>
    <P>The highlight of the process was the visit of the President of the United States, Mr. Clinton, especially his trip to Belfast.  It was good to see people of all communities together in the centre of Belfast with a feeling of joy that the President of the United States, the greatest power in the world, was there and they could unite across political and religious boundaries.  We cannot allow the IRA to undo it all in one fell swoop. We must give the people our leadership and call on the IRA and on Sinn Féin, if it has any influence on the IRA, to stop now before it is too late.  We do not want the next generation to grow up without knowing peace.  A generation of people now in their thirties and forties had not known a normal life before the cease-fire.</P>
    <P>I appeal to everybody to bring pressure to bear on this group which decides for itself to bring the country back into <Col N="1181" /> the dire straits of the last 25 years.  In the past Ireland was known abroad for the bomb and the bullet.  For the past 18 months we have been recognised for the visit of President Clinton and public figures from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Government must ensure that funding for the Border regions from the IFI, the Delors package and INTERREG is co-ordinated as quickly as possible to let people understand that there is a real peace benefit.  The peace may have been broken but I was delighted the Taoiseach visited Cavan yesterday in the midst of the problems. He made it clear that a Minister of State will be given the task of making sure any delays or problems will be solved quickly.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with those who have lost relatives.  There is fear in the Border regions and the North.  The Taoiseach, with the support of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the Opposition parties, will lead the peace process back on track and lead the country to great things in the future.</P>

      <P>It is tragic that this matter is before us for debate when we had hoped for the past 18 months that we would not have to do so.  I am glad the tone and content of the statements has been positive.  It is important that the House continues to be united against violence and terrorism and in favour of the need for all-party dialogue in a constructive fashion.  The unity of the political parties in the South over the past 25 years has been in stark contrast to the North.  It is more important than ever to keep a united front in our political approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Government's response to the difficulties caused by last Friday's dreadful events.  In the immediate aftermath of the bombing it would have been easy to have had kneejerk political reactions.  The Government has sent strong signals of its disapproval as a minimum response.  It has reacted in a positive fashion in ensuring <Col N="1182" /> that all doors remain open to the political parties who may be able to influence the IRA in calling another ceasefire. This is vital to allow dialogue recommence.</P>
    <P>Friday night last was a black night not alone for the people of London and the North but also for Irish people at home and abroad.  The joyous outpouring of emotion for much of the past 17 months, particularly during the visit of President Clinton last December, was suddenly replaced by much despair, doubt and fear.  The political parties and the two Governments must firmly seize the initiative.</P>
    <P>While we must always strongly condemn acts of violence and terrorism we should clearly indicate the alternatives. The only alternative to what happened on Friday night last is dialogue.  There is a heavy onus on all political parties and the two Governments in particular to ensure that inclusive all-party talks commence at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We must send a clear signal to the IRA and all those who perpetrate acts of violence and terrorism, through the political parties close to them, that these acts must cease and that there is a better way.  I hope, following this debate and the calm and reflective debate in the House of Commons yesterday, that it will be possible for the two Governments to clear up any misunderstandings and adopt a common position.  That should be the priority.  Everyone concerned must redouble their efforts in the days and weeks ahead to ensure talks commence at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Once inclusive all-party talks commence it is crucial that there be a place at the table for Sinn Féin.  As it is part of the problem, it will have to be part of the solution.  The Government responded in the only way it could on Saturday last when it indicated firmly that before dialogue could take place with Sinn Féin at ministerial level the IRA would have to call a further ceasefire. This needs to be done immediately. While one can knock walls by violence and destruction one cannot build bridges.  In the politics of this island we <Col N="1183" /> must be clearly seen to build bridges.  In this context, I call on Sinn Féin to use whatever influence it has to ensure a further ceasefire is called.</P>

      <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to the families and relatives of the people killed or seriously injured in the London Docklands bombing on Friday evening last.  On the 6 o'clock news this evening we saw the sad pictures of an old man in a community far removed from this country bury his son.</P>
      <P>Following 18 months of peace in the North we are back at the crossroads. Were it not for the efforts of brave men, namely, John Hume and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, there would not have been a cessation of violence.  Deputy Reynolds was berated in this House by those who now have responsibility in Government to resolve the difficulties facing us for giving a commitment to meet with Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin at Government Buildings if a ceasefire was called by the IRA.  That was a high risk strategy which required an element of trust and goodwill.</P>
      <P>Based on the attitude adopted by the new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, since the ceasefire was called it is difficult to be optimistic that risks will be taken from that quarter. The best that he could do following his meeting with the leader of the most powerful nation in the world was to indicate what should be done to curtail the activities of Sinn Féin in the United States.  On the 6 o'clock news this evening he dismissed the possibility of holding a referendum suggested by John Hume as a realistic option.  If that is the only response he can give in trying to find a way forward, the outlook is stark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all gave currency to the Mitchell report, but the ink was hardly dry <Col N="1184" /> before the British Government cherrypicked its recommendations, with the result that the peace process was put into a tailspin.  Unionist leaders have not been generous in their comments.  They have given no indication that they are prepared to accept the British Prime Minister's proposal that all-party talks should follow elections.  David Trimble has not confirmed that this would be the case.</P>
    <P>Elections are being foisted upon the people of the North who do not know what the working arrangements in an elected assembly would be or to where it would lead.  The Reverend Ian Paisley informed us following his meeting with the British Prime Minister that each party will receive a discussion document outlining the way such assembly would function.  The British Government put the cart before the horse in making an elected assembly its prime response to the Mitchell report.  If that was one of the six recommendations of the report, each political party might have believed there was something to negotiate at the table or that the British Government would act with the Irish Government in giving effect to the report's recommendations. Unfortunately, that did not happen and as a result the Provisional IRA changed direction, a move which was unacceptable and unjustified.  We must deal with the reality of the horrific bombing in London last Friday which led to the adoption of entrenched positions; we must find a way forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford, who represents a Border county, listed the positive effects of the ceasefire and I am sure Deputy Ahern could echo them.  The number of foreign tourists has increased significantly. However, we are now faced with a complex situation.  While we are obliged to highlight our reservations, with the practical and positive support of Members on this side the Government must ensure that the peace process is put back on line.  The Prime Minister was very sombre in the House of Commons yesterday and the response from all sides of the House was welcome.  The British Labour Party spokesperson <Col N="1185" /> stated on television this evening that whatever the British Prime Minister articulates by way of a discussion document on the assembly, it must be a joint co-operative arrangement between both Governments.  Therein lies the slim hope for progress on this complex issue.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs must come to grips with this dilemma.  The holding of elections appears to have been decided before the workings of the assembly were thought through.  In Strasbourg this evening John Hume expressed reasonable doubt about the complexity of holding elections.  The issue demands a more generous Unionist response.  It was Mr. Trimble who mooted the idea of elections, another way of unlevelling the playing pitch.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has a political mandate through virtually every local authority in the North.  Gerry Adams was once elected to the British House of Commons, but of course did not take his seat.  It appears the British Government, through the promptings of the Unionist Party, wants to hold elections for an assembly.  Unless the matter is clearly understood by all concerned, we will go down another <i>cul-de-sac.</i> I hope the Government will use its powers of persuasion to ensure that whatever emerges will bring about a possibility of a lasting peace and give the Nationalist community a sense of hope.  Unless John Hume, the Sinn Féin leadership and others in the North are committed to embarking on this course of action, we will not see the progress we want.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me an opportunity to contribute to the debate, the importance of which can be gauged by the fact that as Chief Whip I have been inundated with requests from Members &mdash; approximately 35 &mdash; who wish to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my sympathy, and that of my constituents, to the people who were injured and to the relatives and friends of those killed in that awful event last <Col N="1186" /> Friday.  Fianna Fáil abhors and condemns unreservedly the use of violence in that way.</P>
    <P>As the constituency in the Twenty-six Counties that suffered most from the ravages of the past 25 years, my constituents are shattered by this event.  Not only was London physically shattered and people injured and killed, the hopes and aspirations of the people of County Louth and other Border counties were also shattered.</P>
    <P>At the outset the British doubted that the ceasefire would last.  It is well known that British officials and politicians poured cold water on the question of a ceasefire in their negotiations with Irish Government officials at that time.  There were many road blocks put in the way of the ceasefire.  The word &ldquo;permanence&rdquo; was brought into the equation by the British Government and all efforts on this side of the water to get over that hurdle did not succeed until eventually the British Government accepted what is called &ldquo;a working relationship&rdquo;.  The question of clarification then presented another difficulty.  I recall Mr. Major stating that there would be talks after a three months decontamination period, but 17 months later such talks had not taken place.  Decommissioning was another huge hurdle and the Mitchell Commission and twin-track approach were launched by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister last November.  Unfortunately, in all its dealings in Irish matters, the British Government endeavoured to divide and conquer and succeeded in that regard in the last number of months.  To a certain extent it has succeeded in dividing and conquering the Nationalist consensus which had been painstakingly put together by Nationalist Ireland.  It also, in a surreptitious way, tried to divide and conquer the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in recent weeks.  That should be abhorred.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Mitchell report was to allow for decommissioning and all-party talks.  It would arbitrate on the decommissioning issue and before its publication our party leader stated that <Col N="1187" /> Fianna Fáil would accept its recommendations. He exhorted all parties, particularly Sinn Féin, to accept the six principles.  In November 1995 when the report was initiated he welcomed the twin-track approach and the fact that the two Governments had come together.  He hoped that effort would not lead to another road block but, unfortunately, that is how it turned out. When the report was published the British did as they usually do, they binned it, as they did with a number of other important European decisions which went against them.  They binned the decision of the European Court of Justice in the Gibraltar three case.  They went on to other business and disregarded it.  That is indicative of the British Government's attitude to matters relating to this country.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell report referred to a number of matters but did not make a recommendation in relation to an elected body or elections.  It merely commented on that and a number of other issues such as confidence building measures.  These measures always seem to relate to the building of Unionist confidence. It is a two-way process.  Confidence must also be built in the Nationalist community and this has not been manifest in the past 18 months.  The events of Friday night are indicative of the feelings of some of those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the important matter of the establishment of a child abuse register.  Nothing illustrates the need for a child abuse register as startling as the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Gerard Tiernan which was tried in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court two weeks ago.  Tiernan was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for the most horrific and savage assault imaginable on his infant son Paul.  The court <Col N="1188" /> heard that Paul Tiernan, aged five months, was admitted to Temple Street Hospital suffering from seizures, bruising and fractured ribs.  He has since been taken into care.  Paul Tiernan will spend the remainder of his life visually impaired and physically disabled.  This tragedy is made infinitely greater by the fact that the accused, Gerard Tiernan, was imprisoned for a similar offence against another infant son in 1990.  In that case, the baby suffered two broken legs and several broken ribs.</P>
      <P>The obvious question which arises is how an individual convicted for an assault in 1990 could be allowed unsupervised access to another infant. How could the probation service and the health board have proved so ineffective in monitoring a convicted child abuser?  The fact is, however, that they were ineffective and this represents a damning indictment of our system of child protection.</P>
      <P>A committee established in 1993, following the appalling Kilkenny incest case, was chaired by Catherine McGuinness, senior counsel, who is now a distinguished judge.  It was asked to advise Government on how best to protect children from sexual abuse and violence. This committee produced an excellent report which contained almost 90 recommendations.  Sadly, to date only seven of them have been implemented, despite the fact that the report has been in existence for almost three years.  This brings into question our determination to properly protect our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the Kilkenny Incest Report Committee which has not yet been implemented was the establishment of a child abuse register to include details of both young children at risk and convicted abusers. Such a register exists in most European countries.  It allows the State services to monitor children at risk and actual or potential abusers.  If that recommendation had been accepted and a register established, the possibility of Gerard Tiernan having unsupervised and unmonitored access to infants following <Col N="1189" /> his conviction would have been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the Tiernan case only came to light because it involved a criminal trial.  One is filled with apprehension when one considers the other cases of child abuse that are normally held in-camera in the family courts.  In the absence of such a register, people such as Mr. Tiernan will continue to have unsupervised access to infants with predictable consequences.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that it has taken such a horrific case to put the Government on notice of the absolute and immediate necessity of establishing a child abuse register.  If the Government refuses to implement this recommendation of the Kilkenny Incest Report Committee, I am prepared to give an undertaking that Fianna Fáil, on its return to office, will ensure that this glaring deficiency in our child protection system is rectified.  However, if the Government does not carry out its duty in this regard, and children become the victims of abuse and violence, which could have been avoided by the establishment of a child abuse register, it will have to bear a heavy share of the burden of responsibility for what happens to those children.</P>
    <P>Many people have correctly expressed great concern about the protection of the unborn.  Surely those who are born are entitled to the fullest protection that can be afforded by the State.  Young children such as Paul Tiernan are among the weakest and most vulnerable group in our society.  They deserve better from us.  I ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that the Government will at least provide the degree of protection which would be afforded by the establishment of a child abuse register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some confusion about what is meant by a child abuse register and I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight.  It has been suggested that <Col N="1190" /> health boards do not keep lists or registers of children at risk.  This is not the case.  In accordance with the child abuse guidelines issued by my Department in 1987, health boards maintain lists of suspected and confirmed cases of child abuse.  The objective of such lists is identical, in all but name, to that of child abuse registers.  Their purpose is to monitor and follow-up on reported cases of children at risk and to provide data for research and planning.  Such lists are reviewed annually by the Director of Community Care or a delegated officer in consultation with senior personnel from the community care teams. When families with children who are considered to be at risk change residence and move to another community care area, the information on the list is passed on to the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny Incest Investigation Report acknowledged current practice in this regard and recommended the standardisation of child abuse registers and the introduction of certain safeguards into the system.  The report also recommended the mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse by designated persons and the introduction of revised child abuse guidelines.  Since these three recommendations are interrelated they fall to be considered together rather than in isolation.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to mandatory reporting is that a discussion paper on the subject is currently being finalised and will be issued later this month as a basis for widespread discussions with the various interest groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a revision of the child abuse guidelines issued by my Department in 1987, the Deputy is aware that the procedure introduced last year by my colleague, Deputy Currie, Minister of State at the Departments of Health. Education and Justice with special responsibility for children, for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the gardaí represents a major amendment <Col N="1191" /> of the 1987 guidelines, in so far as the interaction between the two key players involved in child protection is concerned. It should also be noted that health boards have reviewed their own regional child protection procedures in the light of the recommendations of the Kilkenny report and have taken specific measures to improve arrangements in this area.  I share the view expressed by Deputy Currie in this House last Thursday that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the forthcoming consultation process on mandatory reporting before the current guidelines are revised further since that process is likely to throw up issues which will need to be addressed in any new guidelines.</P>
    <P>In relation to child abuse registers, I have already stated that the 1987 guidelines provide guidance on the collection, recording and exchange of information on suspected and confirmed cases of child abuse.</P>
    <P>However, I am conscious of the need to ensure a uniform approach on the part of the health boards and of the importance of incorporating certain safeguards into the system.</P>
    <P>It would be my intention that the recommendations in the Kilkenny report relating to the introduction of revised national child abuse guidelines and the establishment of standardised child abuse registers will be vigorously pursued as soon as the preparatory work currently under way in the Department for the implementation of the remaining provisions of the Child Care Act has been completed.  By that time, I hope that a clear consensus on the mandatory reporting question will have emerged and that all of the issues that need to be addressed in revised guidelines, including those relating to child abuse registers, will have been identified.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's <Col N="1192" /> commitment to putting in place a comprehensive framework for the care and protection of vulnerable children.  The full implementation of the Child Care Act is central to our overall strategy in this regard; 61 of the 79 sections of the Act are now in force.  These include the core provisions of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  The Kilkenny Incest Report underlined the need for the early introduction of these particular provisions which were brought into operation with effect from 31 October 1995, together with three sets of regulations governing the placement by health boards of children in foster care, residential care and with relatives.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the timescale set by the Government for the full implementation of the Act, it is my intention that the remaining 18 sections of the Act, which deal with the supervision of pre-school services and the registration of children's residential centres, will be commenced by the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, in the region of £30 million on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of an infrastructure to support the Act and to enable the health boards to cope with the new demands placed on them under the legislation.  The Health Estimate for 1996 includes provision for a further round of new service developments in the child care area.  These allocations represent the largest ever investment of resources in our child care services and demonstrate the commitment of the Government to strengthening those services and equipping them to respond to the needs of vulnerable children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise this <Col N="1193" /> issue on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, for his attendance in the House.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of months, the issue of rural crime against the elderly and their vulnerability has been referred to daily in newspapers and the media. Some horrific attacks have taken place which, in some instances, resulted in elderly people being killed while many other people living alone or with other elderly persons have been seriously injured.  In all cases, these people have been left traumatised and in fear for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>Many different solutions have been suggested, some of which must be implemented immediately &mdash; others would do nothing to eliminate such attacks.  The motivation for almost all the attacks on elderly people who often live alone in remote areas, two or three miles away from their nearest neighbours, is the selfish expectation of easy pickings as it is customary for many old people, particularly those in receipt of social welfare payments, to keep amounts of cash in their homes.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report presented last week to the Taoiseach by the Joint Committee on the Family, if implemented, would provide further encouragement to elderly people not to hoard cash sums in the fear of a corresponding reduction in their weekly social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>There are currently 3,000 repair schemes in operation to refurbish houses and to ensure that the lifetime of such housing stock in rural Ireland is extended, at least for the lifetime of their elderly inhabitants.  The disabled persons scheme is limited and does not fall within the terms of my Adjournment motion.  The essential repairs scheme &mdash; the replacement or repair of roofs, doors and windows or dry lining &mdash; with a maximum grant of £1,800, is valuable in that it allows an elderly persons employ a contractor to carry out the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing aid for the elderly scheme, operated by health boards, is a <Col N="1194" /> similar scheme but the work is carried out by health boards or their agents. Both schemes are designed so that only an elderly couple over 65 years of age or, in the case of the housing aid for the elderly scheme, a person living along over 65 years of age, are eligible.  As a general rule, if an elderly person has anyone under the age of 65 years living with them, it prevents that person becoming eligible for either scheme. This general rule has few exceptions.</P>
    <P>Despite the Government giving consideration in the past number of months to the question of how to provide added protection to vulnerable elderly people, the introduction of a crime package costed at millions of pounds and reconsidering the question of giving a tax allowance, which will not work, as against a grant for the provision of an alarm system for elderly people, the greatest protection an elderly person can have, namely, a son or daughter living with them, inhibits that person availing of either house improvement grant scheme because they are not living alone.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond the capacity of the Minister's officials to give urgent consideration to how both of these valuable schemes can be so structured as to permit, at the very minimum, a son, daughter or other category of person aged less than 65 years of age, reside with an elderly person or couple while permitting entitlement to either house improvement grant scheme.  The schemes are currently so structured as to prevent any person, eldely or otherwise, who has the means to carry out the work themselves being eligible.  Accordingly, I am not asking for an open ended cheque when I suggest that a person residing with an elderly person, where that person is also in receipt of a social welfare payment in addition to the old age pension coming into the household, should not prevent the activation of either scheme for the benefit of the members of that household.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> Many sons and daughters in the west go to England and elsewhere for work but they often return to take over the family farm.  In such cases the elderly parent often loses entitlement to a range of social welfare benefits and housing aid and, in time, that loss can become a matter of family discord or generate a feeling of discrimination in regard to how the State policy is implemented.</P>
    <P>People will always maximise their entitlements to State benefits.  One only has to consider the number of young people who leave the family home to avail of maximum unemployment assistance. Their rents are met from an increasing supplementary rent allowance bill costing millions of pounds.  We must promote inter-generational solidarity and caring community support for elderly people.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by giving an example of this.  An elderly mother who was traumatised by an ugly incident which occurred late one night and who lived alone requested her son to return from England to live out the last few years of her life under the same roof.  She had become fearful of living alone in a remote area and there was a possibility that she could shortly have become institutionalised.  Prior to her son's arrival from England, under the housing aid for the elderly grant scheme her application for the replacement of the door and windows of her house had been approved.  When the work was about to begin, the health board discovered that her son had returned from England and was living with his mother. Grant aid was subsequently withdrawn, the doors and windows still require replacement but her son, who depends on social welfare payments, cannot afford to replace them.</P>
    <P>If that man had not come home, his elderly mother could have had her house repaired and, in due course, would probably have been the beneficiary of the home help scheme, frequent <Col N="1196" /> visits from the public health nurse and earlier institutionalised care in a home for the elderly, perhaps costing many thousands of pounds.  The State's exposure to such costs have been minimised to an appreciable extent as a result of this man returning from England to live with his mother.</P>
    <P>There are many hundreds of such cases but, with a little imagination and a commitment at interdepartmental level, my suggestion could result in saving a great deal of money while providing a substantial degree of additional protection to those elderly people to whom I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hughes for raising this matter.  I share his concern for the security of elderly people living in isolated areas.  The Department of the Environment is represented on the recently established Task Force on Security for the Elderly which will report to the Minister for Social Welfare by the end of the month on the security needs of pensioners who are not in a position to avail of the tax relief on burglar alarms which was introduced in the recent budget.</P>
      <P>With regard to housing there is a range of social housing options now available to elderly persons living in substandard housing to bring their accommodation up to a reasonable standard. Some of these options are purposely aimed at elderly persons who wish to continue to live independently in their own homes.  Other measures are more general in nature and can be used to assist elderly persons where younger persons reside with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly and the essential repairs grant scheme are specifically designed to enable elderly persons living on their own, if they so desire, to remain in their existing accommodation. Accordingly, the schemes provide for the carrying out of basic repairs to prolong the useful life of the house so that <Col N="1197" /> it can continue to provide, for as long as is necessary, an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants.  I want to make it clear that these schemes are not solely confined to elderly people who live alone.  For example, elderly couples and elderly brothers and sisters living together are also eligible for assistance.</P>
    <P>Elderly persons residing in substandard accommodation with younger members of a household who cannot afford to have necessary improvement works carried out present a different set of circumstances.  These circumstances merit a different and longer term response, a response which I assure the House is available.  In these cases the provision of a local authority dwelling or the use of the improvement works in lieu scheme may be more appropriate options in meeting the needs of the household than the relatively modest repairs which are carried out under the task force or the essential repairs grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing enables authorities to improve or extend privately owned houses occupied or intended to be occupied by an applicant approved for local authority housing. The authority can arrange to have all necessary works of improvement carried out to the house at no cost to the occupants other than a small weekly or monthly charge, based on the cost of the works, for a maximum of 15 years.  The scheme can go further than just providing adequate accommodation for existing residents in the house.  In certain circumstances, necessary improvements to a house may be carried out under the scheme where, for example, a young family on a waiting list intend to move in with an elderly relative.  Equally, elderly persons in housing need who wish to move in with members of their family may have any necessary works carried out under the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> A range of other options is also available to help improve housing conditions generally.  These include the disabled persons grant, the means tested local authority house improvement loans scheme and the remedial works programme and bathrooms sub-programme in respect of local authority dwellings. There is, therefore, a range of assistance available to those who cannot afford to improve their dwellings to a reasonable standard, more especially so in the case of elderly persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>The recent outbreak of serious crime in rural areas is totally reprehensible and all right thinking people condemn it out of hand, whatever its source. Michael McDonagh, a traveller, speaking on behalf of the Irish Travellers Movement said: &ldquo;The crimes are horrific and those responsible have to be dealt with severely, whoever they are&rdquo;. Gearóid Ó Riain of Pavee Point Travellers Centre also spoke out very strongly against the crimes and those who committed them.</P>
      <P>A great deal of media attention has been devoted to the problem of serious crime following the tragic murders of three elderly people in rural areas and two women in Kildare and Dublin. What saddens me is that the travelling community is the only social group to be named in connection with the recent upsurge in horrific crimes.  This is totally unjust and creates a perception among the public that all travellers are potential wrongdoers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled by the article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 28 January last. One knew instinctively from its title &ldquo;Time to get tough on tinker terror &lsquo;culture&rsquo;&rdquo; that the travelling community were not going to get any sympathy, <Col N="1199" /> only less understanding, from the writer. In referring to a &ldquo;tinker camp&rdquo; the writer of the article said:</P>
    <P>Look at what it is, and what the intellectuals and the politicians say one should honour.  It is a life of appetite ungoverned by intellect.  It is a life which marauds over private property and disregards public laws.  It is a life of money without production, land without cost, damage without compensation, assault without arrest, theft without prosecution and murder without remorse.  It is a life worse than the life of beasts, for beasts at least are guided by wholesome instinct.  Traveller life is without the ennobling intellect of man or the steadying instinct of animals.</P>
    <P>This tinker &ldquo;culture&rdquo; is without achievement, discipline, reason or intellectual ambition.  It is a morass. And one of the surprising things about it is that not every individual bred in this swamp turns out bad. Some individuals among the tinkers find the will not to become evil.</P>
    <P>This disgusting statement is wholly inaccurate. Even the language of the writer confirms that she has no knowledge of travellers, their way of life, history and culture.  Writing such as this tends to justify the actions of those in our community who take the law into their own hands by driving travellers from one area to another.  Speculation like this completely undermines the ongoing work of traveller organisations in building links between traveller and settled communities.  Journalists and newspaper editors have a responsibility to ensure that reports of violent crime are balanced and fair and do not fuel prejudice and intolerance towards the travelling community.  I urge the media to exercise caution and to remember that many innocent travellers are endangered by irresponsible journalism.</P>
    <P>When speaking recently of the fear of retribution in which many travellers now live, Nancy Collins, a traveller, said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Our children are afraid in school. Adult travellers are being targeted for abuse on the street and in work. Painting us all as guilty leaves us all open to attack.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform should examine that newspaper article in detail with a view to initiating action within his Department under section 2 (1) of the Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989.  He must also ensure that the recommendations in the report of the Task Force on Travellers published in July 1995 are implemented as quickly as possible.  We must make much greater progress on the provision of accommodation to suit the needs of travellers, bearing in mind that an additional 3,100 units of accommodation will be required by the year 2000. We should take note during these difficult times for travellers that 1,100 travelling families live on the side of the road with nowhere to go while another 257 families live in temporary sites.  I hope the Minister of State will convey to her colleague the need to look at this newspaper article and initiate the appropriate legal action within his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with much interest to Deputy Flood's comments about this newspaper article but it is not appropriate for me as Minister of State at the Department of Justice to make any detailed comment about it except to say that if people wish to lodge a complaint with the Garda that there has been a breach of the Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, then they are entirely free to do so.  As with any criminal complaint, it will then fall to the Garda to investigate it and, if necessary, consult with the law officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the general issue of travellers and crime, I wish to make it clear that the fact that a small number of travellers have engaged in criminal activity does not mean that the entire traveller <Col N="1201" /> community should be tarred with the same brush.  Criminals come from all areas and all walks of life and it is invidious to single out any one group and associate them, as a group, with criminal activities.</P>
    <P>Travellers are as entitled to their good name as any other citizen and, as equal citizens, are obliged to assist the Garda in their work.  I spoke to many travellers following the dreadful murders in rural areas which I believe gave rise to this newspaper article and they were as horrified as I and every other member of the settled community at these outrageous crimes.  I welcome the statements by representatives of the travelling community which have sought to vindicate the good name of the overwhelming majority of travellers and urged them to co-operate with the Garda if they have information which could be of assistance in solving any of these dreadful crimes.  The greatest risk of murder that old people and others face is, unfortunately, from people within the family circle, because the vast majority of murders are what are classed as domestic murders.</P>
    <P>As to this article by one journalist who has set forth extremely forthright views on the most serious of issues on different occasions, I must also say that there are many Irish journalists who have both sympathetically and with understanding tried to portray traveller life and traveller culture, and to give the public the information which would enable the settled community to break down old fears, shibboleths and misunderstanding about travellers and their way of life, and to arrive at a situation where there could be mutual respect between both communities, with the settled community appreciating the needs of the travellers and the travelling community understanding the needs of the settled community and their requirements.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  Travellers are as entitled as <Col N="1202" /> anybody else to their good name.  It is the equivalent of what Deputy Flood must be familiar with, representing a part of west Dublin as I do, that is when a series of crimes occur in one area, regardless of the fact that the families or people involved in crime constitute a tiny minority, everybody in the area ends up getting a bad name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity of raising this important matter and for his co-operation as I was unable to be here on Thursday when I first tabled this matter. I would also like to thank the Minister for coming here this evening.</P>
      <P>This Government seems determined to take as much power and responsibility as it can from the south-eastern part of the country.  I could cite many instances if I had the time.  However, the recent decision of the IDA to locate their headquarters in Cork was a further indication of that policy.</P>
      <P>As to the Defence Forces, the original plan was that the 3rd Battalion in the Curragh would be amalgamated with the 30th Battalion in Kilkenny, with the headquarters based in Kilkenny.  A number of weeks before Christmas, the troops in that barracks were told that their future and their jobs were safe. Four weeks later they were again briefed by their commanding officer and told that the situation has changed and that the troops in Kilkenny were now to form part of the revamped 3rd Battalion. Perhaps the Minister, when replying, could explain why they were told one thing at the end of November and, a few weeks later, they were told the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has now been proposed would mean a reduction in the number of troops located there from 350 to 200 approximately.  Instead of increasing by, perhaps, 120, which was the expectation that had been created, there was now the possibility that numbers would fall by over 120.  I believe this it the thin end <Col N="1203" /> of the wedge and that this move will eventually lead to the closure of that barracks with the loss to the local economy of £8 million.  Not many areas could sustain such a loss these days.</P>
    <P>My concern is not only the further eroding of the economic welfare of the south-east but the effect this will have in my own constituency.  There are approximately 40 serving soldiers living in Waterford city who commute to Kilkenny on a daily basis.  There are also a large number of soldiers throughout the county who are stationed in Clonmel. Many of these people have families in Waterford.  They play their part in local activities and are part of the local community.  It appears that all this is to be taken from us.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a smaller knock-on effect in that the four full-time people who are currently stationed in the military barracks in Waterford city would also go and the four people who are full-time members of Slua Muirí in Waterford.</P>
    <P>It now seems that the barracks in Kilkenny is in competition with Army installations in County Kildare where there is much more room to manoeuvre and cut back if this is necessary.  There are huge installations in the Curragh and these are not under threat.  Just down the road from there, two miles away in Kildare and eight miles away in Naas, there are more barracks.  I cannot, therefore, see why the south-eastern part of the country should be again under threat.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem will be caused by the fact that any new battalion headquarters will be located in Kildare, which means that those stationed in Kilkenny can be asked to move there at a moment's notice.  I believe this has happened already with some of the serving soldiers in Clonmel who are being asked to report to Limerick, which is their battalion headquarters.  This will cause greater hardship for many of the soldiers who have entered into recent housing commitments and will not be in <Col N="1204" /> a position to transfer to Kildare or to commute daily.</P>
    <P>This appears to me to be a way of reducing the numbers in the armed forces by stealth.  I am calling on the Minister to ensure that the barracks in Kilkenny and Clonmel are maintained and that the £12 million they contribute annually to the economy of the south-east continues.  As well as the £8 million I have already mentioned in Kilkenny, in Clonmel the wage bill of the 12th Battalion is approximately £3.6 million. They employ as many as the factory of Merck Sharp and Dohme in the area. One gets suspicious when one sees that no money is being spent on accommodation in the area.  In Kilkenny there are only three personnel residing within the barracks.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the points I have put forward and to give an assurance that there will be no down-grading of the military barracks located in the south-east.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information the Deputy has just read into the record is factually incorrect. It is a terrible shame that this type of rumour is circulating because I am conscious of the fact that there are families involved, people with mortgages and children at school.  As long as there are rumours, fear will be instilled in the community.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that an officer of the Defence Forces briefed the troops in Kilkenny.  I do not know whether that is correct but if it happened, the officer was not entitled to do that.  He would not have the necessary information to back-up what the Deputy has just read out as facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has embarked on a review of the Defence Forces.  It has set up an implementation group.  That group has examined the structures, has proposed a voluntary early retirement scheme and has recently presented me with a report which I am in the process <Col N="1205" /> of examining.  When I have completed that examination I will be bringing the matter to Government for a final Government decision when I will ask the military authorities and my Department to implement the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government of July 1995 made no reference to the closure of any barracks. Let me repeat in this House, and have it on the record, that I operate on the basis of Government decision. There is no Government decision to close one single barracks.  I am only dealing with phase 1 of a plan that will run over a period of ten years and upwards.  Phase 1, the phase with which I am involved and on which I have a Government decision, does not include the closure of any barracks.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about here is restructuring the Defence Forces from a five-brigade structure to a three-brigade structure to make the Defence Forces more effective and more efficient, to provide greater job satisfaction and to give opportunities to people who choose a career in the Defence Forces to be engaged on operational duties rather than waiting on tables when they were trained to be soldiers and, in some areas, have civilians doing work that is at present being done by trained soldiers, by people in the Naval Service or the Air Corps.  That is the purpose of this exercise.  It is not a cost saving exercise. It is designed to introduce modern structures into the Defence Forces so that they are capable of carrying out the role assigned to them by Government. In 1993 the Government assigned the roles under which the Defence Forces currently operate, and any restructuring is for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I recently met a deputation from Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council.  I explained the process to them in detail and I am glad to say that they accepted in good faith what I told them.  No decision has been taken as to where the battalions serving Kildare and Kilkenny Barracks, where <Col N="1206" /> the headquarters will be located, will serve.  That is not part of the implementation plan report which has been presented to me.  That is a military matter. Whatever happens, Kilkenny Barracks will remain open, the structures there will be meaningful, and if we do have companies in Kilkenny Barracks, they will be proper companies with proper structures.  I assure the Deputy that the information supplied to him about the transfer of headquarters to Kildare is not accurate.</P>
    <P>For that reason I decided to depart from my script I had here.  If it has been circulated, forgive me but I wanted to address directly the question the Deputy put to me because it is only right and proper that I answer questions instead of reading out a script.  I am conscious of the fact that we are dealing with human beings, people who have families, mortgages, homes and I do not want them to be concerned about their future.  There is no question of transferring soldiers from Kilkenny to Kildare. I would ask those who persist in spreading rumours to cease, because all they are doing is upsetting people.  What we should do is await the outcome of the implementation group report.  I have already given an assurance to the representative associations, PDFORRA and to RACO, that I will have ongoing consultations with them.  There has been consultation to date, and there will be consultation in the future.  I do not see a major restructuring of the Defence Forces being carried out overnight.  All these new structures we are talking about will be phased in over a fairly lengthy period, but we must have a plan and we must operate to a plan.</P>
    <P>I have already got the agreement of the Government to a sum of £13 million this year to commence the voluntary early retirement scheme.  I have also got a commitment from the Government that the numbers leaving the Defence Forces will be 2,300 and those entering would be 1,000.  That is to address the <Col N="1207" /> age profile problem which was highlighted in the EAG report which was commissioned by the Deputy's party when in Government and which was a very worthwhile exercise.  I am glad to say that the military authorities accept that what is being done in terms of restructuring is in their interest and they accept that as fact.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair again for giving me <Col N="1208" /> the opportunity of replying.  I wanted to put people's minds at rest whether they are in Kilkenny or in Clonmel.  I repeat, the Government decision under which I operate does not allow for the closure of any barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>As the recommendations contained in the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community impact on a wide range of policy areas which are the responsibility of a number of Ministers, the Government established an inter-departmental working group of officials to consider its implementation, including in particular, the costs involved.  Any further follow up action in relation to the recommendations of the report of the task force will be determined after the Government has considered the report of the interdepartmental working group in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also kept progress in relation to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim progress report which the Task Force on the Travelling Community published in January 1994 under review.  On publication of that report.  I consulted with <Col N="927" /> the Minister for Education and also with the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with responsibility for housing, to identify the recommendations on which progress could be made pending receipt of the final report of the task force.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific recommendations concerning education provision for travellers, contained in the interim progress report, I understand from the Minister for Education that the following developments have taken place:</P>
    <P>(i) In April 1994, the Minister for Education published guidelines entitled &ldquo;The Education of Traveller Children in National Schools &mdash; Guidelines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(ii) The capitation grant for traveller children attending national schools was increased from £76.20 in 1993 to £130 in 1994 and to £137 with effect from September 1995, for those children under 12 years and from £316 in 1994 to £331 in 1995 for children over 12 years of age. This capitation grant will be further increased by 12.5 per cent with effect from September 1996.</P>
    <P>(iii) A school record system for traveller children is now being operated on a pilot basis by the visiting teacher service.</P>
    <P>(iv) The pupil teacher ratio for traveller children at primary level, has been reduced by one unit from 15:1 to 14:1 for special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister for Education that provision for children with special needs is being considered in the context of the report of the Special Education Review Committee, published in 1993, and in the specific case of traveller children, the interim progress report of the task force.</P>
    <P>In relation to traveller housing, during March 1994 the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment announced that the special grant for travellers purchasing their first house for their own occupation had been <Col N="928" /> increased from £1,500 to £3,000.  In addition, funding for new group housing schemes for travellers is being provided by the Department of the Environment separately from the general local authority housing allocation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendations in the report of the task force in the area of discrimination, I can confirm that I am committed to taking initiatives to end discrimination against members of the travelling community and to ensure that they are provided with opportunities for equal participation in all aspects of Irish society.  New employment equality legislation will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds including membership of the travelling community.  Work on the Employment Equality Bill is progressing in my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it before Easter.  During the year I also hope to publish the Equal Status Bill which will outlaw discrimination on a range of grounds in non-employment areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities expects to present its report to me in April 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good progress has been made towards the establishment of a Council for the Status of People with Disabilities. In April 1995, I set up an <i>ad hoc</i> establishment group to facilitate the process.  The establishment group was asked to identify the actions needed to facilitate the development of a constituent base from which a provisional council, which would act in a caretaker capacity pending the formal establishment of a representative council, could emerge.  It was also requested to draw up a draft provisional constitution which <Col N="930" /> would serve as a mandate for the provisional council, pending the adoption of a formally-agreed constitution in conjunction with the setting up of a properly constituted council.  In addition, the establishment group was asked to make the necessary arrangements for the holding of a national convention of relevant interests at which the membership of the provisional council could be agreed.</P>
    <P>At this point, the establishment group has developed a proposed structure for the new council and this model is being presented to individuals and organisations for information and consultation. A total of 13 consultation meetings are planned for February and March at venues throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on a draft provisional constitution and an election process is being finalised.  In order to put the provisional council in place, it is intended to hold a national convention in Dublin Castle on 25 June next.</P>
    <P>I am firmly of the view that there is an urgent need for a Council for the Status of People with Disabilities which will act on behalf of the various interests involved in promoting the welfare of people with a disability.  The formation of the provisional council will constitute an important step on the road towards establishing a permanent council.</P>

      <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission will obviously be a key document when it comes to making decisions on policy changes in the area of defamation.  However, in deciding on such important matters, the <Col N="931" /> Government would also wish to be in a position to draw on the work of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which has been established with very comprehensive terms of reference which include an examination of the laws of defamation as they affect that industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to any legislative proposals which may be brought forward, my Department is already committed to a programme which involves fundamental reform in the broad area of family law and equality law.  These have been, and they remain, priority areas for me and until such time as the necessary progress has been made on them, the reality is that the attention which can be paid to certain other areas such as defamation must, of necessity, be limited.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The waiting periods for legal applications in each of the full-time law centres of the Legal Aid Board as of 31 December 1994 and 1995 are set out in tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report. <Col N="933" /> In 1994 there were 21 centres and in 1995 the number was 26.  In 1994 the waiting time in four of the centres was one month or less, in six centres it was two months, in four centres it was between three and four months, in five centres it was between five and seven months and in two centres it was between seven and eight months.  I am glad to inform the House that the reductions in waiting times which had been achieved by the board in 1994 continued in 1995.  In 1995, six of the centres had a waiting time of one month or less, in another six centres the waiting <Col N="934" /> time was two months, in 11 centres the time was between three and four months and in three centres the waiting time was between five and seven months.</P>
    <P>The part-time centre in Cavan was established in February 1995 and while the intention is to make it a full-time centre as soon as possible this year, the necessary accommodation and staffing arrangements are being assessed in the context of budgetary constraints and an ongoing review of the board's services as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for programme refugees only, i.e. refugees admitted to Ireland under the terms of Government decisions.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, more than 500 Bosnians have come to Ireland as programme refugees.  A Government decision of July 1995 provided for the admission of an additional 250 refugees from the former Yugoslavia, with their close relatives, of whom almost 80 arrived here in December 1995.</P>

      <P>I have given a full statement of the Government's position on the current situation in Burundi in my reply to Questions Nos. 32 and 34, on Tuesday, 6 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to recent developments, <Col N="939" /> the UN Secretary General has proposed the deployment of a military intervention force which would be stationed in Zaire, ready to act immediately in the event of a sudden deterioration of the situation in Burundi.  This is one option among many which the UN Security Council may have to consider if the situation continues to deteriorate. However, our view remains that an agreed, internal, long-term solution is preferable to an interim one forcibly imposed.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in my reply last week, there are continuing, intensive diplomatic efforts at national, regional and international levels to establish a political framework to promote peace and stability in Burundi and the Great Lakes Region.  We are giving every support possible, both bilaterally and with EU partners, to the numerous, ongoing efforts at preventive diplomacy.  The EU decided at the General Affairs Council of 29 January to appoint a special envoy to the Great Lakes Region in support of these efforts.  They are being facilitated also by the UN Secretary General's Special Representative to Burundi, former Presidents Carter and Nyerere, the OAU and others.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department are due to return from the capital of Burundi today where they have participated in a high-level EU Troika Mission to that country.  While there they have had meetings with senior Hutu and Tutsi leaders in government and other key figures.  The Troika Mission had the objective of promoting substantive political dialogue between the parties in Burundi and will help evaluate measures which can be taken to avoid further violence and human suffering.</P>

    <P>Ireland has been persistent in its efforts to seek from the UN an early payment of these arrears in full.  I had the opportunity to raise this matter personally with the Secretary-General of the UN, Dr. Boutros Ghali at our meeting in New York in September 1995 and to express to him our concern that a full settlement of these arrears be made as early as possible.  Ireland's Permanent Mission to the UN has subsequently pursued the matter on a continuing basis with the UN Secretariat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> The non-payment of arrears for peacekeeping operations, which are owing to many troop contributing states, is of course a direct consequence of the current serious financial crisis facing the UN system.  This crisis has been brought about by the non-payment by certain member states of their assessed contributions to the UN budget and led to the decision taken in June 1995 by the Secretary-General of the UN to put a temporary freeze on reimbursements due to troop contributors, including Ireland.  Since then the financial crisis within the UN has deteriorated even further.  Ireland, along with her EU partners, has called on all member states to honour in full their financial contribution to the UN budget.  We will continue to urge them to do so and thus ameliorate the current financing crisis.</P>
    <P>Ireland and her EU partners have been equally firm in their view that notwithstanding the current crisis, the UN has a clear obligation to make an early and full settlement of the arrears owing in regard to peacekeeping to member states.  For our part we have made clear to the UN that it is particularly important in the case of a smaller state such as Ireland, which has made, and continues to make, a significant commitment in resources to the general peacekeeping role of the organisation, that the UN in turn honours its obligation to reimburse the costs owing as early as possible.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at present to give an accurate estimate of when our arrears will be fully reimbursed.  We will continue to press the UN on this matter. We would also hope that current efforts under way to seek to resolve the financial crisis within the UN will have a positive outcome and lead to an early clearing of the present peackeeping deficit.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as a member of the European Union, the Government is constrained as regards the provision of preferential rates of tax and that tax incentives generally are required to respect EU rules governing competition and the internal market.</P>
      <P>An extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the air transport industry would constitute a State aid under EU law, capable of distorting competition, and therefore would require the approval of the EU Commission. Given the rigorous enforcement of State aids rules in so far as the air transport industry is concerned, it is most unlikely that such approval would be forthcoming and no useful purpose therefore would be served in approaching the Commission on this matter.</P>
      <P>As regards extending the BES, the review of the scheme as promised in the Government programme has been completed and I announced changes to the scheme in my recent budget statement. I have no plans at present for any futher extension of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The 10 per cent corporation tax rate applies to profits arising from the manufacture of goods in the State.  The question of whether the processes carried out by a company constitute manufacturing activity, and so entitle the company to the 10 per cent rate, depends on the facts to be determined in each case.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the sorting, cutting and bailing of waste paper for further use in the recycling industry does not, of itself, constitute a manufacturing activity within the meaning of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Any amendment of the legislation to specifically extend the 10 per cent rate to selected services activities would constitute a State aid which would require prior EU Commission approval.  It cannot be taken that such approval would be forthcoming at this time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in my recent budget I announced a significant improvement in the taxation of all companies which are currently taxable at the standard rate.  From 1 April next, a new reduced rate of corporation tax of 30 per cent will apply to the first £50,000 of a company's taxable income.  This move will be of benefit to all companies in the services sector, including those referred to by the Deputy.</P>

As part of their ongoing auditing of tax returns, audits have been conducted into a small number of farmers who have received payments for milk which they did not record on their tax returns.  For reasons of confidentiality the Revenue Commissioners are precluded from disclosing any information in relation to their audits.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their audit and investigative programmes are designed to identify cases where tax is at risk. They have programmes in place to detect and pursue those who try to evade their statutory responsibilities. These programmes are also designed to maximise voluntary compliance by the selection of a number of returns for examination.  In deciding what cases to investigate or audit Revenue do take account of information made available to them from various sources.  If the Deputy has any information which he feels is relevant to a tax matter, he should make this known to the Revenue Commissioners who will consider any such information in the normal way.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, that are in place to develop a pilot general practitioner centre in Cork as outlined in the blue-print for general practice in 1992 in view of the decision by the Southern Health Board not to go ahead with a £1 million general practitioners' medical centre at Mayfield, Cork; whether the £150,000 which had been committed by his Department out of its central funds to the initiative in Cork is now lost to general practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I understand from the Southern Health Board that some of the doctors involved in the original development project at the Mayfield site have submitted alternative proposals for a smaller development and these are being considered by the board at present.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the board has plans in place for a pilot project for the development of general practice in the north western part of Cork city.  The board is hopeful that considerable progress will be made on this project in 1996.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has been informed that the £150,000 earmarked by the Department for the Mayfield development can be allocated towards other general practice projects in the board's area subject to the approval of the Department in relation to individual proposals.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As part of the implementation of the Health Strategy, health boards are involved with general practitioners in improving patient record systems, including the computerisation of records.  It is accepted that computerisation of records will be of great assistance to general practitioners in the management of their practices and in improving the quality of services provided for their patients.</P>
      <P>In general terms, where transfer of patient data to hospitals or health boards is proposed, the provisions arising from the Data Protection Act, 1988, and the Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations, 1989, pertaining to data banks and disclosure of personal data should be applied.</P>
      <P>The Department has been in discussion with the Data Protection Commissioner's office in relation to clarification of procedures to be applied and the Department intends to circulate, in the near future, Protocols for the guidance of health boards and general practitioners on transfer of patient data.</P>

These include the introduction of a group medical indemnity scheme in 1992 which provides cover for non-consultant hospital doctors, public health doctors, and dentists employed by health boards and some others.  A number of risk management pilot projects have also been established in health agencies around the country with the object of identifying and eliminating adverse incidents which give rise to claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>With the childhood immunisations currently available it is possible to eradicate the diseases in question if an uptake level of 95 per cent of the child population is achieved and maintained. The objective, therefore, of the national primary childhood immunisation programme is to achieve and maintain an uptake level of not less than 95 per cent in the total childhood population to eliminate conditions such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hib disease, measles, mumps, rubella and pertussis.</P>
      <P>The 1994 report of the Review Group on Primary Childhood Immunisation recognised that the general practitioner was ideally placed to deliver the primary childhood immunisation programme. Agreement has been reached on the delivery of the primary childhood immunisation programme by general practitioners.  This scheme will cover all children, irrespective of whether they are covered by the GMS scheme.</P>
      <P>Under this agreement every child will be assigned to a general practitioner with a contract with the health board for the delivery of the immunisation programme. Contracting general practitioners will be responsible for ensuring that, as far as possible, there is an uptake level of 95 per cent among the children assigned to them.  To facilitate routine monitoring of uptake levels and, in particular, to identify children who have not been immunised, a contracting general practitioner is also required to notify the health board of the children who have been immunised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of a number of deficiencies in the previous method of delivery of the primary childhood immunisation programme which related to the system of delivery, the absence of computerisation in some areas and an <Col N="962" /> inadequate system of reporting by general practitioners on vaccinations carried out, it is not possible to assess uptake levels accurately.</P>
    <P>As a result of the introduction of the revised system of delivery, each health board will be in a position to make an annual report to my Department on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the system of delivery;</P>
    <P>(b)  the immunisation uptake in each region;</P>
    <P>(c)  the number of children who have not been immunised;</P>
    <P>(d)  the measures taken to promote immunisation and, in particular, the measures taken to follow-up the children who were not immunised; and</P>
    <P>(e)  the cost of the immunisation programme.</P>
    <P>With a view to promoting the importance of immunisation and to provide parents with information to enable them to make an informed decision regarding immunisation, an immunisation-awareness campaign is to take place in the coming months.  In addition, health professionals are being urged to take every opportunity to encourage and advise parents to immunise their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EC Regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The decision on whether a person is regarded as a <Col N="964" /> dependent or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.  Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that when assessing the medical card entitlement of parents, the income guidelines include an allowance for each dependant and where that dependant is in full-time third level education and is not grant-aided, this allowance is doubled.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons, parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> One of the basic principles of the General Medical Services <Col N="967" /> scheme is that every eligible person has a right to choose any participating doctor practising within a reasonable distance of the patient where the doctor concerned is willing to accept that person as a patient and who has not already a full list of patients.</P>
      <P>Regulations relating to the scheme made in 1972 (S.I. 88 of 1972), stipulate that &ldquo;in so far as is practicable, a person availing himself of the service shall have a choice of medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms and conditions governing the operation of the scheme, a medical card holder must, save in exceptional circumstances, be living within seven miles of his-her chosen doctor's main centre of practice. A medical card holder is obliged to choose a doctor who has a contract with the relevant health board for the provision of services under the GMS scheme.</P>
      <P>Within the parameters mentioned above, medical card holders have the right to change their doctor of choice under the scheme.</P>

The current complement is one physician and one surgeon.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has been considering the recommendations of this report and is in the process of preparing a comprehensive plan for the acute hospital services in the region.  In relation to Bantry Hospital, a report will shortly be presented to the Southern Health Board for their consideration outlining plans for the future of acute hospital services in Bantry Hospital. The unique geographical location of Bantry demands special consideration in the light of the distance to the major centre in Cork, and this will be reflected in the proposal shortly to be presented to the board.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving a copy of these proposals when they have been approved by the board, and I can assure the Deputy that they will be given full consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also wish to know that, in January, the acute psychiatric unit for the West Cork catchment area transferred to Bantry Hospital as the final stage in the development of psychiatric services in West Cork.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.  There is no lung transplant programme in Ireland at this time.  The establishment of a successful transplant programme for any speciality is an extremely complex and difficult task.  It is essential to have appropriate trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes. The Department's recent experience with the successful liver transplant programme and its establishment in Ireland bears this out.</P>
      <P>Patients in need of lung transplantation at present are referred to UK centres.  It is not possible to set out the number of transplants which will be undertaken in the next three years as this information is subject to many variables such as the availability of donor organs and the organ matching process which has to be undertaken before organs can be transplanted.  For these reasons it is also not possible to say when a person will be called for a lung transplant.</P>
      <P>At present there are approximately 33 patients awaiting lung transplants. My Department has been in discussion with the Mater Hospital for some time on the question of the possible development of a lung and heart-lung transplantation programme in this country.  The Mater Hospital has submitted an outline preliminary proposal on that basis.</P>
      <P>The cost of the proposal from the Mater Hospital which would include additional cardiac surgery activity is:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have, on a number of occasions, affirmed my commitment to the conservation of the corncrake and in 1996 I am demonstrating this commitment by virtually doubling the amount of money allocated to corncrake measures.  The corncrake grants scheme has been operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy with funding from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Royal Society for Protection of Birds.  I have now arranged to continue for 1996 the same level of funding for the scheme as was spent in 1995, i.e., £64,000.</P>
      <P>I have been seeking for some time to incorporate the existing corncrake conservation measures into the rural environment protection scheme which was initiated to facilitate and encourage environmentally-friendly farming practices. It is quite appropriate that this scheme should include measures to protect corncrakes and I see no reason why funding of such measures through REPS would affect the corncrake adversely.  Indeed, I would ultimately hope to have a higher take-up under REPS because of the greatly increased payments which farmers would receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take-up of REPS has been slow in &ldquo;corncrake areas&rdquo; and I have arranged that officials of my Department should meet the farming organisations to clarify and agree the measures required to protect corncrakes under REPS.  I accept, however, that not all farmers wish to participate in REPS and to help meet these cases, I have approved a proposal to allow the NPWS to purchase some corncrake sites.  These sites will then be leased back to farmers to be <Col N="983" /> managed in a corncrake-friendly way.  I have allocated £60,000 in 1996 to purchase these sites, to be jointly funded from the Exchequer and from the EU Life Fund.  I am hopeful that these measures will improve the status of the corncrake and I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <Quest>the works, if any, that will be carried out on the Royal Canal in the neighbourhood of Abbeyshrule, County Longford, in each of the years 1996 or 1997; if so, whether these works will encroach on any adjoining property or affect adversely the rights of land owners adjoining the canal; when it is proposed that the stretch of the canal at Abbeyshrule will be open to navigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is not planned to undertake any work on the Royal Canal in the vicinity of Abbeyshrule, County Longford in 1996.  It is too early to say what work, if any, will be undertaken in the area in 1997 as this will depend on the funds available.</P>
      <P>Any works to be undertaken in the neighbourhood of Abbeyshrule may necessitate encroachment on to privately owned land, in particular the replacement of the so-called Webbs culvert and reconstruction of the Embankments across Ballymaglavy Bog.  These works, which are unlikely to proceed before 1998 have not yet been designed in detail, so it is impossible to say at this stage what encroachments, if any, will be necessary.  In general any interference with privately owned lands will be temporary and the landowners will be fully consulted in advance.  Removal of the culvert may necessitate acquisition of a small piece of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of work remaining to be done before the <Col N="984" /> canal is navigable as far as Abbeyshrule. This includes in addition to the items referred to above, the removal of the culvert at Morans Bridge, Mullingar, replacement of two footbridges, installation of lock gates and completion of dredging on the summit level.  It is, therefore, likely to be 1998 at the earliest before the canal is open to navigation.</P>

      <P>Details of projects which have benefited from national lottery funding in the areas of arts and culture, heritage and the Irish language during the years 1987 to 1994 are contained in the Appropriation Accounts for those years.  Prior to 1993 moneys for projects in the arts, culture and heritage areas were disbursed through the Vote of the Department of An Taoiseach.  Details in respect of projects/organisations to which national lottery funding was provided by my Department in 1995 are set out in Appendix 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the funding of heritage projects, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 8 of 26 October 1995, in which I outlined the position regarding projects which benefited from national lottery funding from the former non-statutory National Heritage Council in 1995 (to 9 July).  I also explained in that reply that the new Heritage Council, which I appointed on 10 July 1995 under the Heritage Act, 1995, is an autonomous statutory body whose functions include powers to provide assistance (including financial assistance) and advice to persons and bodies in matters relating to its functions. A detailed list of any grants <Col N="985" /> approved or paid by the statutory Heritage Council in 1995 and 1996 will be <Col N="986" /> published in its annual reports for those years.</P>

      <P>Details of the 1996 non-national road grant allocations and the percentage increase for each county <Col N="1008" /> over the 1995 allocations are contained in a booklet entitled <i>Non-National Road Grant Allocations, 1996</i> which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The length of the non-national roads and the amount of the 1996 grant allocations per kilometre for each county is set out in the following table.  The major variations are largely accounted for by the fact that allocations under the schemes of EU co-financed improvement grants, including INTERREG, are project related, and can vary substantially from one area to another, and from year to year, depending on the <Col N="1009" /> projects selected for funding.  Grantallocations under the remaining headings <Col N="1010" /> are based in the main on the road lengths in each county.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the concerns that the relocation of the planning and building units of her Department to Tullamore, County Offaly will damage the capacity of the unit to function by breaking up the current team of officers with specialised knowledge; if her attention has been further drawn to the fact that the positions of project planner architect and project planner quantity surveyor are not to be advertised; whether the relocation of the unit to Tullamore is likely to increase rather than decrease the total numbers in the Civil Service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am satisfied that the relocation of the planning and building unit of my Department to Tullamore will not damage the capacity of the unit to function.  A number of the existing staff of the unit are among those who have already transferred to Tullamore and are providing an effective service. Arrangements will be made to ensure that the remaining staff who are to relocate to Tullamore will be satisfactorily trained on the work of the unit.</P>
      <P>The positions of project planner architect and project planner quantity surveyor were introduced to the planning and building unit during the 1970s to meet specific requirements relating to building projects financed through a World Bank loan.  My Department has reviewed the needs of the unit in the context of its current work and decided that appointments at senior architect and quantity surveyor grade 1 level best meet current requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the 1996 Estimates on public service expenditure the Government has decided to restrict recruitment to the Civil Service.  Staff surpluses arising from decentralisation, such as the transfer of the planning and building unit to Tullamore, are provided for under that Government decision on <Col N="1018" /> condition that these staff are redeployed to meet priority needs as directed by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>St. Vincent's School, Lisnagry, Limerick is a special school catering for children with moderate and severe-profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The school currently has 24 pupils in the severe-profound category.  These children are catered for in four special classes.  Each class has the services of a teacher and a child care assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been approached with a request that it make educational provision available for an additional 27 severely-profoundly handicapped children from the area.  The provision in <Col N="1033" /> question would necessitate the establishment of an additional five classes to cater for these children.</P>
    <P>My Department is fully committed to ensuring that an adequate education service is made available to these children. The matter of providing child care assistant support as part of this service is being actively considered at present.</P>

      <P>While I am aware that a number of primary schools experience difficulties in this regard, I am satisfied with the general arrangements for substitution at both primary and second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, a pilot scheme has been in operation for some years <Col N="1034" /> whereby a supply panel of teachers has been established in selected areas to cover absences of teachers on sick leave. This scheme has proved to be very successful, and it is my intention to broaden its scope as resources permit.  In second level schools, substitute teachers are employed by the managerial authorities of individual schools.  There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.  The question of the pupils admission to a second-level school is a matter in the first instance for discussion between the parents and the appropriate school authorities. However, I am arranging for my Department to have the case in question investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with Down's syndrome <Col N="1035" /> attending second-level schools can avail of the visiting teacher service.  The role of the service is to assist in meeting the special education needs of children with certain types of disabilities, including Down's syndrome.  The visiting teacher service is just one of the support services available for pupils with special needs.  Pupils with learning difficulties are also supported by the remedial and resource teacher services.</P>
    <P>I allocated an additional 56 resource posts to second level schools with effect from the beginning of the current school year.  Four of these posts were allocated to schools in the north Dublin area.  A total of 19 second level schools in the north Dublin area now have the services of a resource teacher.</P>

    <P>A furniture grant in the amount of £510.99 is being paid to the school.  The Department's records indicate that approval was given to the school in January and July, 1995 to invite tenders for new furniture.  The school was advised to accept the lowest tender and furnish the relevant documentation to the Department, following which 85 per cent grant-aid would be allowed.  No communication has been received to date.  If the furniture was acquired, the supporting documentation should be furnished to the Department in order that payment may be generated.  The <Col N="1037" /> school authorities were apprised of this on 8 February 1996.</P>

This has always been done with the consent of the parties involved.</P>
      <P>While growth in recent years in the number of family law cases together with the increase in statutory criminal law workloads has meant that priority has to be given to criminal law work, the probation and welfare service are willing to provide reports, if requested by the residing judge, as staffing resources become available.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether there are grave anomalies in the Garda pension scheme; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that gardaí who retire before 1 October 1982 are treated less advantageously for calculation of pension purposes than gardaí who retired between 1 October 1982 and 31 October 1992; if her attention has been further drawn to the fact that gardaí who retire between 1 October 1982 and 31 December 1992 are in turn treated less advantageously than gardaí who retired on and after 1 January 1993; her views on whether the net result is that the Garda pension scheme is discriminatory; and the action if any, she proposes to take to rectify these anomalies.</Quest>

      <P>The question refers to changes made to the basis for calculating Garda pensions in 1982 and 1994, which came into effect from the date the change was made but which did not have retrospective effect to include pensioners.</P>
      <P>The first, the pensionability of certain Garda allowances in 1982, arose out of a finding by the arbitrator that a number of Garda allowances, which had previously been non-pensionable, became reckonable for pension purposes with effect from 1 October 1982.  This was accepted by the then Minister for the Public Service and by the then Minister for Justice.  Garda pensioners who retired before that date were not covered by the arbitrator's finding, and the finding was not extended to them because of the considerable additional costs involved.  Any concession in this case would, of course, have costly repercussions elsewhere in the public service.</P>
      <P>The second change made to the basis for calculating Garda pensions, the decision in 1994 to make unsocial hours allowances pensionable, was done as part of an agreement reached under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and was in return for agreement by Garda associations to contribute to flexibility and change within the force. The agreement was subject to an overall limit on cost of 3 per cent of basic pay. The agreement, and the cost parameters within which it was negotiated, did not provide for backdating of any of the improvements in conditions it contained, nor for their extension to pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the Commission on Public Service Pensions, announced recently by the Minister for Finance, is to examine and report on the pension terms of all public servants, including the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Under sub-section 172 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, people in full-time education are excluded from entitlement to assistance, including rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  However, subsection 172 (2) allows a person in full-time education an entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance in respect of their adult or child dependants.  Sub-section 172 (3) of the 1993 (Consolidation) Act allows for the payment of a supplementary welfare allowance to a person in full-time education in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>In addition, persons participating on a second chance educational scheme may continue to receive their full weekly payment, and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, which they may have been receiving prior to participation.</P>
      <P>The second chance educational schemes include: the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS); the second level initiative scheme; the third level allowance scheme; and the part-time education initiative scheme.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the second chance educational schemes are that the applicant must be at least 21 years of age, and must have been in receipt of an unemployment payment or lone parent allowance for at least six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme is designed to assist with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear.  People in full-time education who have children and who are in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment may qualify for assistance. The scheme operates from 1 June to 30 September every year and people can make an application for assistance any time during this four month period. The amount payable in respect of a child attending primary school is £40, and £55 is payable in respect of a child attending post-primary school.  These amounts will be increased to £43 and £58 respectively from the start of this year's scheme in June. <Col N="1047" /> The cost of extending entitlement to SWA rent supplements to parents in full-time education would have resource implications which I am unable to meet at present but I intend to keep this matter under review.</P>

      <P>In December 1995, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution on the observance of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty 1996 and proclaimed the first UN Decade for the Eradication of Poverty.</P>
      <P>The international community, through the auspices of the UN, has already reached a consensus on and committed itself to the eradication of poverty.  In terms of the iniatives at the level of member states, the emphasis of the resolution is on the implementation of the programmes of action arising out of the recent UN conferences, most notably at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Copenhagen Summit, I obtained Government approval for the development of a National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  The strategy is being developed by a high level inter-departmental policy committee. The Government decision on the setting up of a National Anti-Poverty Strategy provided for a number of stages, including the preparation of an overview statement setting out in broad terms the nature and extent of poverty, social exclusion and inequality in Ireland; recommending what type of institutional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that the issue of reducing poverty, social exclusion and inequality is firmly on the agenda of all <Col N="1048" /> Government Departments and agencies, and that there is appropriate co-ordination across and between Departments on policy in this area; and specifically including the people directly affected by poverty in these processes of policy formulation and implementation through a wide-ranging consultative and participative exercise.</P>
    <P>A wide-ranging consultation process has taken place and 241 submissions were received which helped inform the preparation of three discussion papers. These papers formed the basis for discussions at a series of seminars around the country last month.  The committee is now moving on to a further key stage of the process which involves selecting key themes which must be addressed if poverty is to be tackled in a &ldquo;root and branch&rdquo; way, and setting specific targets for poverty alleviation in the key areas to be identified.</P>
    <P>The inter-departmental committee has been charged with preparing a report which will form part of the National Report for the United Nations, to be completed before the end of 1996 to demonstrate national progress in implementing the UN Commitment and I am confident that the wide-ranging activities being undertaken by the committee and the overall strategy which is being pursued represent the most effective and meaningful response during this United Nations Year for the Eradication of Poverty.</P>

    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, a Chara,</P>
    <P>I am writing to you about the matter which gave rise to disorder in the House last Thursday, 8 February.</P>
    <P>The basis of that disorder was in the replies I gave to questions in the Dáil on 14 December, 23 January and 6 February, about the Research Unit I set up in my Department with five temporary contract staff.</P>
    <P>When I informed the Dáil on 23 January that the positions in the Research Unit had not been advertised I was making a statement in good faith consistent with my understanding of that term. As I have stated previously, I do not regard a notice in <i>Forum,</i> an internal Democratic Left newsletter, circulated privately and free of charge, to be an advertisement in the commonly accepted understanding of the word.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that my understanding of the term advertising is the only understanding possible, but I do believe it is a valid understanding.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that any member would think that my reply was intended to mislead the House.  In so far as some members may feel they were misled, I apologise for that.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is the principal source of EU grant aid for the tourism industry.  Measure 5 of the product development sub-programme provides for specialist accommodation-related developments such as conference and leisure facilities and a selective hotel refurbishment scheme.  Some £12 million has been provided for this measure for the duration of the programme and this is now largely committed. Hotels are also among the tourism operators who can bring forward proposals under the special interest holiday facilities measure, can avail of assistance towards marketing and can benefit from training programmes undertaken under the aegis of CERT.  Further details on each of these measures and the amounts of grant funding available are set out in the Operational Programme, a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the hotel industry is <Col N="1056" /> amongst those who may apply for grant assistance under other EU initiatives, such as INTERREG Northern Ireland, the International Fund for Ireland and the special programme for peace and reconciliation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1995 a total of 22 electronics-software projects, with an employment potential of almost 7,000 jobs, were approved by IDA Ireland.  A list of the projects is beneath.  Electronics companies develop, market and manufacture a wide-range of leading edge products in Ireland.  The companies are engaged in a range of sectors, from wafer design and fabrication, systems, components and peripherals, to communications, networks and software.</P>
      <P>The electronics industry has formed the core of Ireland's development in the high-technology manufacturing sector. Our ability to attract global semi-conductor players such as Intel, Xilinx and NEC together with the new networking companies such as 3 Com and Cabletron, illustrates Ireland's capabilities at the technology forefront.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 IDA Ireland estimates its overall share of all greenfield inward manufacturing investment was 14 per <Col N="1057" /> cent.  This is a strong market position for an economy with a population representing less than 1 per cent of Europe. In electronics, it is estimated that we secured 22 per cent of greeenfield and expansion projects.</P>
    <P>The attraction of inward investment is a very competitive business.  Capital intensive, large scale strategic projects are becoming more and more difficult to secure.  Nonetheless, Ireland continues to win high tech projects against very strong competition from many sources including Scotland.  In these circumstances, I would not agree with the Deputy's suggestion that we are only securing low-tech industries.</P>

While it is true that milk was produced in the past in excess of quota, superlevy was incurred and duly passed on to the EU Commission.  Should any breach of the milk quota rules come to light as a result of the controls conducted by my Department or be brought to my attention in the context of the Revenue Commissioners' tax audits within the dairy sector, it will be dealt with in accordance with the law governing the milk quota regime.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to say precisely to what extent sheep grazing has altered the pattern of mountain side vegetation as the level of information available in this area is limited. Clearly it has had an effect in certain areas but there are a number of other factors which have an impact on mountain side vegetation.  The principle other factors are soil type, rainfall, wind and temperature.</P>
      <P>To establish more accurately how mountain side vegetation reacts under different climate and farming conditions, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has undertaken a research project at the Teagasc Hill Farm, Leenane, County Mayo.

      <P>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which is present in the atmosphere as a result of the decay of uranium.  It is the alpha particles emitted by radon and its decay products which, when inhaled, may eventually lead to lung cancer.</P>
      <P>The radioisotopes produced by nuclear installations are only artificial in the sense that they do not occur in large amounts in nature.

Exposure to these isotopes can give rise to different cancers.</P>

      <P>The limits for exposure to ionising radiation are laid down in the European Communities Ionising Radiation Regulations, 1991 which are enforced by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. These limits reflect the latest recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and also those contained in the Basic Safety Standards of the EU and the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Any new safety limits agreed at Community level will be transposed into Irish legislation.</P>
      <P>All applications of ionising radiation require a licence from the institute and the institute is empowered to attach conditions to ensure the safety of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no function in relation to dangerous chemicals.  However, the <Col N="1070" /> Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has responsibility for this matter, has advised me that safety limits for dangerous chemicals are governed by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Chemical Agents) Regulations, 1994, the scope of which are set out in a code of practice issued by the Health and Safety Authority.  I am advised that the adequacy of these limits is kept under constant review and that the code of practice is changed periodically.</P>

      <P>An arrangement is in place between the Department of Defence and the Department of Health whereby the Air Corps operates an air ambulance service for the health boards for emergency cases.  Established procedures exist for the requisitioning of a helicopter for air ambulance missions by authorised personnel of health boards.</P>
      <P>While no individual request for an air ambulance has been refused over the last three years, it has, however, not always been possible to undertake air ambulance missions at the time of request due to adverse weather or other circumstances.  In such situations, a mission is usually undertaken at the earliest opportunity unless the requesting authority decides in the interim to transport the patient by road.</P>
      <P>There is no set provision within the Defence Vote for air ambulance missions. The costs to the Department in carrying out these missions are met from the appropriate subheads of the Defence Vote under a general sanction from the Department of Finance.  The arrangement is accounted for by way of notes in the Appropriation Accounts of the Department of Defence and the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>The Oslo Commission guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration in the disposal of dredge spoil.  Under the guidelines surveys of both the dredge spoil and the dump site may be undertaken at the expense of the applicant.  If the proposed site is unsuitable for any reason alternative sites are investigated, and if the material itself is found to be unsuitable for dumping at sea, the application is refused.</P>
      <P>The marina at Malahide is being developed in two phases.  A proportion of the dredge spoil from the first phase, which is already completed, was used for reclamation purposes and the balance of the material was put in temporary storage in the phase II marina basin. This material together with the dredge spoil arising from phase II of the development will be disposed of at sea.</P>
      <P>The developers, Malahide Marine Village Ltd., applied for a permit under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, to dispose of dredged material associated with the marina development at a site some 7.5 kilometres east of Malahide inlet.  Following assessment of the surveys of both the dredge spoil and the proposed dump site as provided for under the Oslo Commission guidelines, the Department's Marine Licence Vetting Committee was satisfied that the dumping operation would not have an adverse affect on the marine environment and the required permit was duly issued.</P>
      <P>I attach copy of the permit for the Deputy's information.  I would draw attention in particular to condition 3 (n) which provides for the marking of the dump site position with buoys and condition 3 (o) which refers to the use of a Marine Position Recorder.</P>

      <P>Application for licences under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, were received in my Department recently from Drogheda Harbour Commissioners in respect of annual maintenance dredging works and disposal of dredge spoil resulting from the proposed capital dredging project at Mornington. A similar procedure is applied in respect of each type of project.</P>
      <P>The Oslo Commission guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration in the disposal of dredge spoil.  Under the guidelines surveys of both the dredge spoil and the dump site may be undertaken at the expense of the applicant.  If the proposed site is unsuitable for any reason alternative sites are investigated, and if the material itself is found to be unsuitable for dumping at sea, the application is refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> In making the application the applicant, in this case Drogheda Harbour Commissioners, is obliged to give details of the proposal disposal site; the quantity and constitutents of the material to be dumped; the dumping vessel; why no suitable land-based alternatives exist.</P>
    <P>Applications are examined by the Department's Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC) which is composed of a chemist, biologists and an oceanographer from the Marine Institute, a marine surveyor and an engineer from this Department and a biologist from the Central Fisheries Board.  Each application is examined to ensure that the disposal site is acceptable from a fisheries and navigational point of view; the quantity and constituents of the waste are such that they will cause no harm in the marine environment; there are no suitable land-based alternatives; and the vessel to be used in disposal of the waste is properly licensed and certified.</P>
    <P>Following careful consideration of Drogheda Harbour Commissioners' application, a licence for the disposal of dredge spoil resulting from annual maintenance dredging work was granted with effect from 1 January 1996. The dump site is situated at the Boyne Bar.</P>
    <P>As there are extensive fishing grounds in the vicinity of Drogheda Harbour, problems arose in identifying a suitable dump site for dredge spoil from Mornington.  Officials from the Department have been actively seeking a site which will not impact on fisheries and have recently identified a site which has some possibilities.  Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have been given details of the suggested site and confirmation of their interest in that site is awaited.  It is not possible to say if the site being considered will be suitable until an Environmental Impact Study has been carried out.  Land reclamation and beach nourishment options, which could reduce the scale of the proposed dumping at sea operation quite significantly, are also being actively investigated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> Drogheda Harbour Commissioners are currently preparing an EIS in respect of the Mornington project.  They will be required to include in the EIS a study of both the waste to be dumped at sea and the dump site to ascertain the potential impact of the dumping on the marine environment and on fisheries. The onus is on the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners to prove that dumping on this site will not impact on the environment and fisheries.  On receipt of this study the application will be assessed further by my Department in consultation with all relevant parties.</P>
