      <P>Before commencing business today I am sure Members would very much wish to join me in extending a most warm Irish welcome to a delegation happily with us from Albania, led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr. Dybler Vrioni.  We express the hope that their visit to Ireland will be most happy and successful.  On behalf of Members I bid them a hearty céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of my visit to Washington and Newfoundland, as with all such visits, were: to maximise international backing for the peace process; to promote Ireland's economic interests; and to maintain the closest possible contact with Irish people abroad.  With these objectives in mind, my programme for Washington included meetings with the major US political leaders, with the key people actively involved in developing US-Ireland commercial relations and with the many other Irish-Americans who have a profound interest in Irish affairs.</P>
      <P>In particular, I had two useful meetings with President Clinton.  I also had detailed discussions with Vice-President Gore, Speaker Gingrich and Senator Kennedy as well as numerous other Members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat.  Other major engagements included a meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board and attendance at the American Ireland Fund dinner where, as is my normal practice, I spoke, on the basis of a prepared script, <i>ex-tempore</i> to the audience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Northern Ireland situation generally and the information that I conveyed while abroad, I will, for <Col N="504" /> the information of the House, summarise the Government's position.  Currently both the British and Irish Governments are fully committed to the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and will continue to operate them fully unless and until the agreement is transcended by new agreed arrangements. Meanwhile, both Governments and the Northern Ireland political parties are seeking to arrive at new agreed arrangements.  As Deputies are aware, at my meeting in London on 28 February with the British Prime Minister, both Governments committed themselves to 10 June as the fixed date for all-party negotiations, thus meeting a long-standing demand.  Both Governments want those negotiations to be as inclusive as possible and I hope that the IRA will make it possible to achieve this goal by re-instating the ceasefire unequivocally and thereby enabling Sinn Féin to make its unique and necessary contributions to the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The communiqué issued following the 28 February meeting makes clear that the Prime Minister and I are committed to work for a lasting peace and a comprehensive settlement on the basis of the fundamental principles shared by the two Governments and set out in the Downing Street Declaration and in the Joint Framework Document.  There can be no exclusively internal Northern Ireland settlement.  The negotiations must address the totality of the three sets of relationships and give adequate recognition and expression to all three interlocking strands.</P>
    <P>Both Governments and, I believe, the Northern Ireland parties, want the agenda for the negotiations to be comprehensive, allowing all of us to put our basic concerns on the table and have them considered in a constructive and meaningful way.  As the February Communiqué recognised, confidence building measures will be necessary, both in relation to the Mitchell report and also, no less importantly, to reassure parties that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being <Col N="505" /> offered to address the legitimate concerns of all the participants and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.</P>
    <P>The priority being given to the Mitchell report at the beginning of discussions must not be construed to mean that this issue can be used to block discussion of other issues.  No one side or group can dictate the agenda which must necessarily be addressed in full if negotiations are to be truly meaningful.</P>
    <P>The ground rules paper sets out the views of both Governments on how negotiations should be organised.  While the Governments have invited consultation on it and no doubt others will express their views, the document contains a number of principles which are of their nature essential to the prospect of a successful negotiation and are, therefore, in effect not open to renegotiation.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns among Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland that the elective process proposed by the British Government may polarise opinions further.  In particular, I am aware of concerns that the proposed forum could be exploited in some way as a rival focus to the negotiations or skew these negotiations towards an exclusively internal settlement.  It is for this reason that I have made it clear, and will continue to make it clear, that there can be no exclusively internal settlement. I will continue to do everything possible to insulate the proposed forum from the negotiating process and to ensure that this insulation is further strengthened in the practical arrangements remaining to be made for the 10 June negotiations.</P>
    <P>This then is the approach of the Irish Government which I outlined on my recent visits abroad.  I am happy to report to the House that I received privately and publicly from President Clinton a strong message of continuing support for this approach by the Government in moving the peace process forward.</P>
    <P>The President commended the loyalist leaders on their restraint at this time <Col N="506" /> of significant challenge and I concur with this.  I do not think that at this stage it would be helpful to comment beyond this on every individual statement issued by parties relevant to the Northern Ireland issue.</P>
    <P>I was invited in the course of my visit to Washington DC to address a joint session of Congress later this year.  This again testifies to the strong and ongoing US political interest in matters relating to this country, particularly on Northern Ireland, and the Government will continue to build on this.</P>
    <P>Regarding the 11 March meeting in Dublin with the Ulster Unionist Party, I refer Deputy Harney to the reply given to Question No. 1 on 12 March.</P>
    <P>On the question of the chairmanship of the all-party talks, this matter remains under consideration and I do not propose to comment further at this stage.  The question of our holding a parallel referendum here relating to the peace process in Northern Ireland is one to which the Government is favourably disposed, but Deputies will appreciate that it is related to developments in discussions with the Northern Ireland parties.</P>
    <P>In relation to the case for the repatriation of Mr. Patrick Kelly, I can assure the House that the Government has availed of every appropriate opportunity to pursue this.  I have raised the matter on a number of occasions with the British Prime Minister.  I raised it with President Clinton during my visit to Washington and the Minister for Justice has raised it with the British Home Secretary.  The Government's intensive efforts on this case will continue until there is a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>The 15 March meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board was attended by chief executive officers or chairmen of 16 leading US corporations. I should emphasise that each of these participants gave freely of their time, expertise, experience and contacts to assist in the promotion of our economic interests and continue to do so.  I took the opportunity at my meeting with the board to give its members an update on <Col N="507" /> economic developments here.  The main issues that arose for discussion were measures to assist the continued development and expansion of the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin, additional steps which might be taken to continue the growth of US and international tourism to Ireland, a review of developments in the Irish telecommunications sector over the last year, an examination of the Irish venture capital market and follow up to the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland.  The US Commerce Department will host a further conference to promote trade and investment, focusing in particular on Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The conference is planned for early autumn in Philadelphia.  The conference will focus on public-private sector partnerships and efforts to spur growth in the Border region and Northern Ireland through trade, investment, joint ventures and strategic alliances.</P>
    <P>My visit to St. John's, Newfoundland, enabled me to fulfil engagements that had been curtailed last September. While there I met the recently appointed Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Mr. Brian Tobin.  I conveyed our thanks to the Canadian Government for its particular assistance in relation to the Mitchell body.  I also expressed our appreciation for Canada's continued and very clear support of the Irish Government's efforts to achieve a new and agreed political settlement here.  My other engagements in Newfoundland included attendance at the major St. Patrick's Day events organised by the Irish Newfoundland Association and the Benevolent Irish Society.</P>
    <P>I was most heartened by the goodwill and support shown throughout my visit to Washington and Newfoundland for the Government's efforts in relation to the peace process and Ireland's economic development.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach <Col N="508" /> agree that notwithstanding any reservations we have about the elective process it would be counterproductive for any party to boycott those elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should allow parties in Northern Ireland the space to make their decisions on this important matter.  I have been asked questions of this nature on a number of occasions during the past week.  The advice I have given to all concerned is to keep in focus the main objective, to remember the overriding purpose of the effort we have all been making.  That purpose is to start inclusive negotiations on 10 June. Everything that can be done should be done to ensure those negotiations are inclusive and successful and anything that might be contemplated that would not be helpful towards that objective should be avoided.  Beyond offering that general advice, it is best that I should not become involved in giving specific advice to parties about their situations other than reminding them that the overall objective is successful talks starting on 10 June.  Never before has a specific date for the starting of such talks been agreed.  Given that this is genuinely an historic opportunity, it is important that it should be taken.  I repeat what I said yesterday in another context, that Sinn Féin has demanded peace talks now and now will arrive on 10 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why, given all his efforts to work with Mr. Trimble and his colleagues, relationships between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Mr. Trimble are so poor?  All he has received in return for his major effort to persuade him is insults.  Having met and discussed matters with Mr. Trimble on a number of occasions recently, does the Taoiseach believe that is what he deserves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a somewhat more thick-skinned approach to these matters than perhaps the Deputy.  I disagree with some comments the Deputy makes from time to time, but that does <Col N="509" /> not mean I do not have a good working relationship with him.  I approach my relationships with other political party leaders in the same way.  I replied to the remarks made by Mr. Trimble, which I regard as truly bizarre.  They belong in some leprechaun's book of unusual Irish statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are certainly not serious and I have replied to them in that manner.  However, I have no doubt that Mr. Trimble has a sense of humour and perhaps he was endeavouring to exercise it on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Taoiseach said in response to Mr. Trimble's remarks.  Does the Taoiseach not believe that the Irish Government should encourage parties to participate in the elective process and not merely sit on the fence?  Does he not believe that the Government has an influential role to play and should begin to do that now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why the Deputy is putting that question and I sympathise with the point that lies behind it, but my overall objective is to ensure that the talks start with everybody concerned on 10 June.  We need everybody to do everything possible to ensure that they and all the others concerned are present.  That conclusion would best be drawn by the parties concerned. There is always a risk involved in others telling any political party what it should or should not do in respect of what is best for the electorate it represents. Therefore, I deliberately confined myself to a general statement.  I informed those involved that this is a truly historic opportunity and they should not do anything which would make it difficult for themselves or other parties to attend all-party negotiations. It is important to grasp this opportunity <Col N="510" /> because it was not easy to achieve agreement on a fixed date for all-party talks with the British Government.  It is important that people recognise the magnitude of the difficulties involved, avail of the opportunities presented and make the necessary compromises to ensure that everyone attends such talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Mr. Trimble did not discuss with the Taoiseach the subject of the internal forum.  Will the Taoiseach urge Mr. Trimble to cease boycotting the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body?  Will the Taoiseach agree that, if the Ulster Unionist Party continues, under what is effectively Strands II and III, to boycott these important bodies, it would be easier to convince Nationalists that there is some value in the Strand I process &mdash; the internal forum?  Is it the Taoiseach's understanding that the negotiations are separate from the forum?  Is Mr. Trimble's recent statement, that the forum will be used as a springboard to see what progress is being made during the negotiations, out of line with the contents of the communiqué and contrary to the wishes of the Government and Fianna Fáil?  Could such statements cause trouble in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply was very long.  Will be clarify the point that the negotiations are separate and that neither a filter nor a conduit will be used at the forum on any matter which will be discussed during the negotiating process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I stated in my original reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the concerns among Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland that the elective process proposed by the Government may polarise opinions further.  In particular I am aware of the concerns that <Col N="511" /> the proposed forum could be exploited in some way as a rival focus to the negotiations or skew these negotiations towards an exclusively internal settlement.  It is for this reason that I have, and will continue to make clear that there can be no exclusively internal settlement.  I will continue to do everything possible to insulate the proposed forum from the negotiating process and to ensure that this insulation is further strengthened in the practical arrangements remaining to be made for the 10 June negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the forum must not and will not be used to skew the negotiations or create difficulty for the negotiators.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Ahern's inquiry about the contents of my meeting with Mr. Trimble and other Unionist delegates, it would probably be better if I did not list, item by item, the matters which were discussed.  The Deputy asked about the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, but it would be better if I did not enter into much detail.  We had a very comprehensive and lengthy discussion on all important matters which affect the process of political progress in Northern Ireland at present.  I must limit my reply because our discussions were, of their nature, confidential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that the proposed forum will have no role in adjudicating on the talks process?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss the Framework Document with Mr. Trimble and his colleagues?  Did the Taoiseach outline to Mr. Trimble the benefits of that document and how it might work in ongoing developments during all-party talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the <Col N="512" /> Framework Document in most of the discussions I had with the various parties. It must be recognised that this document represents an agreed understanding between the two Governments of a possible outcome to the negotiating process which would be acceptable to both of them.  The Framework Document was agreed between the two Governments, not between the Governments and all parties.  It is, therefore, a guide to the parties, for their negotiations, as to what is acceptable to both Governments.  It is also a challenge in so far as its various contents represent the things which the Governments believe must be done to ensure the establishment of a properly balanced, three-cornered relationship, North-South dimension, east-west dimension and context for arrangements within Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document will be a very important ingredient when the negotiations begin on 10 June.  At this juncture we must ensure there are all-inclusive negotiations.  In this regard, the IRA must reinstate its ceasefire to ensure that Sinn Féin can take part and the best possible agreements must be reached with all parties on the procedures to be put in place during those negotiations.  When the negotiations begin, the subject matter of the Framework Document will be of considerable importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <P>The Taoiseach will accept that there are many outstanding questions in relation to the mechanisms and procedures, elections, negotiations, appointment of negotiating teams and the role of the forum.  It is essential that these crucial questions are clarified at the earliest possible date because polling day, 31 May, is fast approaching.  I accept the Taoiseach's view that the forum and negotiations will not be linked.  These matters must be clarified through definite statements of policy from both Governments and legislation, not by means of a wish list.  When does the Taoiseach expect that such clarification, and legislation to enable it, will be forthcoming?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also inform the House with regard to the position, within the negotiating process, of the referendum suggested by Mr. John Hume?  This was not fully clarified in last week's statement by the British Prime Minister.  How does the Irish Government view the matter?</P>

      <P>The Irish Government will be happy to have meetings with all parties to offer clarification on any specific questions they may wish to raise.  Where such clarification must be given jointly by both Governments, or by the British Government alone, we would be anxious to ensure that every question is put to the quarter where it can be fully, immediately and completely answered.  We are willing to provide clarification, through the appropriate channels, to any party seeking it. Any queries with which we cannot deal will be conveyed to the quarter where they can be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to when a definitive statement will be made, the detailed arrangements for the election which are a matter within the competence of the British Government will be dealt with in legislation, which has yet to be presented. Obviously, on the presentation of that legislation certain questions will be answered.  I urge anybody who has any particular queries to put them on the <Col N="514" /> record so that we can have them answered. I do not want anybody to be in doubt because of the absence of clarification on any matter.</P>
    <P>The question of a referendum was one of the matters dealt with in the paper published by the British Government.  For our part we are willing to hold a referendum in parallel with the referendum to take place in Northern Ireland.  Arguments about the wording will arise and there may be more than one proposal in this regard.  There may be difficulty in obtaining agreement on a particular proposal, but the British Government will be providing in the legislation for the possibility of holding a referendum.  If they do that, obviously we will have to provide for the possibility of a referendum but getting agreement on the wording across all the parties is another matter and is a task that requires a considerable degree of work. It is not possible at this stage to say whether an appropriate degree of agreement will be possible.  As I said at the time, I see a lot of attractions in the proposal for a referendum as tabled by Mr. John Hume.  I think it would have considerable merit but as the Deputy is aware there are parties on both sides of the traditional divide in Northern Ireland who do not share that view.</P>

      <P>I think the participation of Sinn Féin in the negotiations will certainly be dependent on the restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  As to the forum, I am not in a position to make a statement on that matter at this juncture. I cannot answer precisely the Deputy's question.  The important thing is that the IRA should restore the ceasefire. Mr. Adams said at the weekend that the tasks are now primarily democratic and that the problem is not a military problem.  If that is the case, what is <Col N="515" /> the point of the IRA maintaining military operations?  IRA military operations are not relevant even in accordance with the words of the leader of Sinn Féin, Mr. Adams who said that the tasks are democratic and the problem is not military.  I believe that is something the IRA needs to think about.</P>

      <P>I had a meeting with Senator Mitchell during my visit to Washington and I told him privately what I had already said publicly that this Government and all the parties in the Dáil have immeasurable respect for the contribution he has made, not just in terms of his conciliatory and careful approach but in terms of the lucidity of his thinking, his ability to sum up a difficult problem in a few simple and plainly understood words.  I believe he is somebody who can make a major contribution to facilitating the resolution of the difficulties.  However, it is too early at this stage to make a prognosis about a role for Senator Mitchell beyond expressing our appreciation of his continued willingness to be of assistance. The House will recollect the colloquial term used by President Clinton at the joint press conference that he and I held on the matter &mdash;&ldquo;Senator Mitchell is still on the case&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I object in the strongest possible way to the Taoiseach transferring a question I tabled to him on negotiations with the British Government on the form of elective process in Northern Ireland to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to be answered, I believe, on 17 April.  It begs the question as to who is in charge of the peace <Col N="516" /> process on behalf of the Irish Government. The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, supports the elective process whereas at the same time the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is objecting to it.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this confused double-speak or treblespeak is very damaging at this critical time and that it is time for him to take charge of the peace process on behalf of the Irish nation?</P>

      <P>The reality is that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, is dealing on a day-to-day basis with the negotiations with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland in regard to the political strand, the discussions about the nature and format of any possible elective process and all of those matters.  It is not at all inappropriate that he should answer the questions, given that he is the man who is dealing with it.  Of course, everything that the Tánaiste does is concerted with me just as everything I do in regard to Northern Ireland is concerted with him and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  We are working effectively on these matters and that is as it should be. Democratic Left operates in both parts of Ireland and that party in Northern Ireland has its own views as one of the parties contributing to the dialogue in Northern Ireland.  It is entirely reasonable that the views of their members in Northern Ireland are not necessarily the views of the section of the party that is a participant in Government here whose views, of course, are entirely concerted with those of the other two parties in Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 25, 30, 40, 145, 147 and 152 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An employment equality Bill which will prohibit discrimination in employment on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin or <Col N="519" /> membership of the travelling community is being prepared in my Department at present.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill shortly.</P>
    <P>The proposed equal status Bill will prohibit discrimination, on the above mentioned grounds, in non-employment areas such as education, provision of goods and services and disposal of property and accommodation.  Services will be defined broadly to include access to public places, banking and insurance services, entertainment, facilities for refreshment and transport.  Access to sports grounds by persons with a disability will thus be among the issues covered in the legislation.  The Bill is currently being drafted and is expected to be published during the latter half of this year.  Ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination cannot take place prior to the enactment of these Bills.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable consultation on the proposed equal status Bill and a discussion paper was circulated to 80 bodies in July 1993.  My officials and I have met numerous groups and interests to discuss the proposed legislation. Since the beginning of the year I have met the Campaign for Equality, the Licensed Vintners' Association, Vintners' Federation of Ireland, Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the Irish Antique Dealers' Association. Further meetings between my Department and interested groups will be arranged as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that last week about 20 organisations representing disadvantaged people called on the Government to publish these Bills urgently?  The Bills were indicated in the Programme for a Partnership Government and reiterated in A Government of Renewal.  Is the Minister also aware there is widespread disappointment and confusion about the Bills and the matters they will cover? There is an urgent need to remove discrimination at work, particularly against <Col N="520" /> women, disabled people and travellers. Can the Minister be more precise about when these Bills will be brought forward? He tells us the employment equality Bill is being prepared and will be available shortly.  Will the Minister be more definite?  Is it possible the equal status Bill will be before the House before the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no possibility the equal status Bill will be ready before the summer.  Priority is being given to the employment equality Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation. However, as is evident from the range of groups who seek protection under that legislation and the nature of the items it will cover, it is extremely complex and difficult.  It is at an advanced stage of drafting and legal opinions are being taken in connection with it.  There is ongoing consultation on it between my Department and the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
      <P>It is always difficult to try to predict exactly when legislation will be published. My best estimate is that the employment equality Bill will be available for publication in the next Dáil session, that is, after Easter.  I hope to have the equal status Bill published towards the latter part of this year, but I cannot be more specific at this stage.</P>
      <P>I am aware a number of groups are anxious this legislation should proceed as quickly as possible and I share their anxiety.  The Department and I have been working hard on this legislation for some time.  However, it should be recalled that I began the work on these measures from scratch.  No previous work had been done on them by any Government.  They are complex Bills and we have made substantial progress.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister that the chairperson of the equality campaign last week used the words &ldquo;anger&rdquo; and &ldquo;frustration&rdquo; in relation to these items of legislation.  As a result of what the groups see as an inordinate delay in publishing this legislation &mdash; the equal status Bill in particular &mdash; they have <Col N="521" /> fears about the form it will take.  Concern has been expressed to me that it will be minimalist legislation.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister confident the equal status Bill will be in the House before the end of this year?  The equality campaign has expressed the concern that the Bill has been put on the long finger. They are afraid one lobby group in particular is responsible for the delay. Those fears may be unfounded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fear may be that if Deputy Keogh's party was in Government there would be extensive delays in bringing forward this legislation.  I share the anxiety of the groups concerned that the legislation should be brought forward as quickly as possible and I am doing that.  I had to begin work on these measures from scratch.  Until I took office as Minister for Equality and Law Reform with the previous Government and began work on these two Bills, nothing in the way of preparation on these matters had been undertaken.</P>
      <P>It is complex and difficult legislation and great care is needed.  As soon as the Bills are ready they will come before the House and the details will be discussed. The best estimate I can give will be the next session of the Dáil for the employment equality Bill and the latter part of this year for the equal status Bill.  I cannot be specific on any date because the final production of the material is not entirely in my control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Groups have expressed great concern about the delay.  Deputies appreciate the matters involved are complex.  The Minister circulated his proposals in 1993 and began the process of consultation.  So satisfied were the groups that they set aside their campaign because they thought everything was going according to plan and there <Col N="522" /> was a real and genuine commitment to bring the legislation forward.  Frustration at the delay led to their reinstating their campaign about a week ago. Naturally questions arise about the composition of the Government and whether that has given rise to delay in producing these Bills.  While nobody doubts the Minister's commitment, that suspicion is so widespread some 20 organisations have joined to reinstate their campaign to exert pressure on the Government to produce this legislation as quickly as possible.  I plead with the Minister to proceed as quickly as possible with their production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputies Woods and Keogh that both Bills are being progressed by my Department and by the drafting office and advisory section of the Attorney General's office with all possible care and speed.  I am anxious to introduce them in the House at the earliest possible date.  I thank Deputy Woods for his co-operation and look forward to debating their provisions with him.  Both Bills will have the full support of the Government and, I hope, of Members of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fully aware of the degree of frustration felt by the many organisations involved in the equality campaign?  While fully realising the complexity of this legislation, it was promised in 1993.  Does the Minister understand their perception that they are victims of inaction and delay?  While he said he could not give a specific date for the publication of the equal status Bill, the Minister's reassurance of its introduction next autumn will do much to alleviate the suspicions in the minds of many organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Had preparatory work been undertaken on this legislation by the Deputy's party in Government, before the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition Government took office, the timescale would have been considerably reduced but I had to undertake this task from <Col N="523" /> scratch.  While I understand the frustration of the relevant groups, it must be remembered that the legislative provisions will cater for a wide range of groups and facets of human activity and that necessitates great care in their drafting.  The drafting and advisory offices within the Office of the Attorney General are proceeding with all possible speed in consultation with the various lobby groups.  As soon as the legislation has been cleared by both those offices and approved by my Department and the Government, it will be introduced. My best estimate for the introduction of the Equal Status Bill is the latter part of this year.  I cannot be any more specific. It is not a matter entirely within my control but I will continue to press for its introduction with all possible expedition.</P>

      <P>I hope to publish shortly an Employment Equality Bill that will prohibit discrimination in employment on a wide range of grounds.  The Bill will outlaw, among other grounds, discrimination on the grounds of age in employment, subject to certain conditions, including discrimination in relation to recruitment and promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a commitment was given by the then Government to a policy of substantially raising recruitment age limits throughout the public service. Since early 1991, upper age limits in open competitions for posts in the Civil Service have reflected that commitment. <Col N="524" /> This has meant that posts in general service grades, which had previously been advertised with upper age limits ranging from 20 to 30, have been advertised with an upper age limit of 50.  Upper age limits for recruitment to most posts in the health boards and local authorities have also been raised to 50.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister hopes to eliminate the serious upper age limit discrimination in the Employment Equality Bill.  I was approached recently by a man of 51, who is extremely fit, healthy with good qualifications, <i>vis-à-vis</i> an advertisement published in the careers opportunities section of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 25 February last for a post within the local government service, requiring applicants to have a pass leaving certificate.  Since this man has an honours leaving certificate, that would present no difficulty in his case but the advertisement also stipulated that applicants must have been born between 2 March 1946 and 1 January 1980 which he considers very discriminatory.  He could apply for a post as, say, manager of the relevant local authority in respect of which there is no age limit, at a considerably higher salary &mdash; £70,000 per annum &mdash; as against that of a clerical officer beginning at £9,000 rising to £15,500.  Since these jobs are being advertised and interviews being held can the Minister ensure that applicants aged, say, 51, 52 or 53, who are fit and healthy, may apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The post to which Deputy Woods referred appears to fall within the responsibility of another Minister, to whom the Deputy might table a parliamentary question.  The matter of age discrimination will be addressed in the Employment Equality Bill but, even within that context, there cannot be an absolute prohibition on discrimination on age grounds in any circumstances; there must be some flexibility.  To take one example, if a candidate for a position that involved a lengthy period of training was close to retirement age, the possibility of undertaking extensive <Col N="525" /> lengthy training would have to be allowed.  Considerations such as that have to be taken into account in the legislation and that is just one example of the kind of flexibility and complexity that exists in connection with legislation of this type.  All these factors must be provided for and dealt with carefully in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Age Action Ireland stated to a Dáil committee recently that too much stress should not be placed on differences based on chronological age.  Younger and older people have the same social and economic needs, not least in challenging ageism.  It pointed out that over the next 30 years the number of people over the age of 60 will increase by 67 per cent, so there will be a substantial increase in the upper age groups whereas the numbers between the ages of 20 and 59 will increase by only 2.7 per cent.  There is a change which needs to be accommodated but, even more important, is the change in relation to work.  Contract type work is becoming more common throughout society as a whole and employees need to be able to combine different aspects of work over a career period to make up, say, an occupational pension.  If people are not allowed back into the system from the age of 50, they will be unable to have an occupational pension.  This matter is urgent because what is happening in our society is quite alarming.  I accept the Minister's point about difficulties arising if one's health is not satisfactory but for the many people who are healthy he must be seen to press their case strongly and I ask him to have an active programme in that regard.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Woods has said.  Indeed, for that reason I decided to include the question of age discrimination as one of the discrimination grounds in the Employment Equality Bill in recognition of the fact that, all too often, arbitrary recruitment age limits are set without reasonable cause or without a reasonable base.  It is <Col N="526" /> my intention to address that question in a generalised way in the Bill but account will have to be taken in that legislation and a reasonable balance struck between the interests of employees and intending employees and the viability of the enterprises concerned.  I will strike a reasonable balance in that legislation but we can discuss it in detail in the House.</P>

There is real change, employees do not have the security they had in the past and if the change is coming from industry and business, the Legislature must ensure that people have an opportunity to get back into the system.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My employment equality priorities for women centre on putting in place a range of legislative measures to strengthen equal pay and equal treatment provisions and to support reconciliation of work and family responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming Employment Equality Bill, which will be published shortly, will add to the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, in this respect.  In addition, a parental and family leave directive is under consideration at EU level which I hope will form a basis for Irish legislation on the subject.</P>
      <P>Promotion of employment equality requires more than legislative measures. Accordingly, the stimulation of greater provision of childcare support for working parents and gender proofing of Structural Fund measures have been important concerns for my Department. The provision of childcare support is particularly important to facilitate working mothers to continue in or return to the labour market.  Gender proofing Structural Fund measures seeks to ensure that women benefit from these programmes on the same footing as men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to publish the equal status Bill in the latter half of the year.  This Bill will deal with discrimination on grounds of gender and on other grounds in non-employment areas.  I intend to put a structure in place to follow up on implementation in Ireland of the actions agreed at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.  My objective is that, before the end of the year, a report will be published on this.  I monitor progress towards gender balance on State boards and my objective is to see the fullest implementation of this policy.  My Department is operating the action for <Col N="528" /> equality awards scheme, currently in association with RTE, to recognise and encourage good equality practices in Irish society, including in relation to gender.</P>
    <P>All these objectives and activities are being implemented or advanced during the course of this Government.  Their progress will be closely monitored by means of a number of monitoring mechanisms such as the Central Review Committee on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the Committee on the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  The second progress report of the latter committee is due to be launched on 27 March.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a recent ESRI study indicated that overall, women earn 80 per cent of the male hourly wage?  As far as women are concerned, there is a 20 per cent deficit in wages of which 10 per cent is attributed to lack of experience and the shorter length of time working compared to their male counterparts.  The remaining 10 per cent, which is totally unexplained, pointed to a definite discrimination against women in respect of wages.  I understand the ESRI is examining this matter further to see if it can specify the problems.  Will the Minister give his view on this matter and outline the progress he has made on the increased child care provision so that the playing field for women can be levelled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the ESRI report to which Deputy Woods refers and the comments made therein in connection with the differential that continues to exist.  It is a complex question and there are many professional views on the reasons for the differential.  Part of the differential is referable to the fact that the legislation from the mid-1970s needs updating and that is one of the reasons I set about updating it.  Many improvements will appear in the new employment equality Bill which I hope <Col N="529" /> will go a substantial way towards remedying some of the matters that need amendment and updating in the 1970s legislation.  I am happy to confirm that the childcare initiatives are proceeding well.  Some 73 applications were provisionally approved for funding subject to certain conditions specified by ADM, who administer the scheme.  As a result of those grants, a considerable number of new childcare projects were set up throughout the country and are operating well.  I have visited them and it is heartening to see the large numbers of children attending the childcare centres set up under the scheme.  This has enabled many mothers, in particular, to avail of employment and education opportunities which they would not otherwise have had.  Funds have again been provided for the scheme in 1996.  ADM is examining applications which have been received for the current year.  It has turned out to be a successful scheme.  The take-up has been excellent and has exceeded my expectations. This is the type of scheme we have to provide and I hope it will be proceeded with on a permanent basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said here about the frustration in the organisations but one can overplay that line. Certainly, there is anxiety in the organisations to have the legislation brought in as quickly as possible and that is <Col N="530" /> understandable.  I have received every possible support and encouragement from those organisations in connection with this legislation.  I have had meetings with many of the constituent groups who fully understand the work being done.  As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, £7.7 million has been ring-fenced in the human resources operational programme for the period 1994-99 and is being put in place by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. That was done as a result of ongoing consultations between myself and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and is now an integral part of that operational programme.  If Deputy Woods would like further details on how the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is operating, I suggest he table a question to him.  That sum is secured and specifically written into the programme.</P>

      <P>When the Minister hears from Opposition spokespersons about the anger and the frustration of the various organisations, we are only quoting what has been said to us.  People who feel they are being discriminated against are anxious to have the protection of the law.  From that point of view it is understandable that any delay to them seems inordinate and they are extremely concerned about it.  What format does interdepartmental liaison on equality take?  I have tabled a separate question regarding the implementation of the recommendations on the Second Commission on the Status of Women. Specifically in relation to Government Departments and Ministers what type of liaison is there in relation to equality measures?  Is there a proactive approach rather than simply responding to various items of legislation?  Is there a methodology by which the Minister can make Ministers more aware of gender equality in their Departments?</P>

As far as upcoming legislation is concerned, the impact of any item of legislation on women is dealt with in memoranda on legislation to Government and the matter is monitored in that way.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to raise the consciousness of the positive contribution of women in the home; the practical measures, if any, that are planned to facilitate women returning to the workforce and in achieving equality with their male counterparts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6331/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The positive contribution of women in the home is already well recognised in Irish society.</P>
      <P>The accommodation of women returning to the workforce is primarily an issue of labour market policy.  It is integral to labour market policy generally and, accordingly, specific measures in this area are pursued under the aegis of the labour market services of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. In addition the evolution of more flexible employment arrangements and growth of employment opportunities in the services sector has greatly facilitated women returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>My interest in this area has focused on promoting greater reconciliation of family and work responsibilities.  In particular I had legislation enacted on maternity and adoptive leave and I am currently pursuing agreement on a parental leave proposal at EU level which would form the basis for introduction of such leave in Ireland.  These provisions while facilitating women already in employment will also reduce barriers for women not in the labour market to return to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> In addition facilities for childcare support for working parents are being promoted through my Department's pilot scheme for childcare projects in disadvantaged areas.  This scheme is particularly targeted at parents who would otherwise have difficulty in taking up training, education or employment.</P>
    <P>Participation of women in the labour force is increasing whether resulting from married women returning to the workforce or from reductions in numbers leaving the workforce.  This increased participation by women will enhance the more effective use of skills and experience of women and should, in due course, lead to them achieving greater equality with their male counterparts.  Progress on equality will be reinforced by the forthcoming employment equality legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The forthcoming employment equality Bill will be marvellous and I certainly look forward to it.  The Minister referred particularly to the labour measures under enterprise and employment which would encourage and support employment.  Will he agree that what is needed is a recognition to raise the consciousness of the positive contribution of women in the home as well as practical measures to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce? There is great concern among homemakers about their pensions, their rights to individual entitlements and the need to recognise the contribution they make in the home, as well as the contribution they can make by participation in the workforce.  It is likely that in future women will want options and it is important to provide ones which recognise the choices they wish to make. They should be comprehensive options which would support them in those choices, whether it is to work full-time in the home, to be full-time in the work-place with support for the home and child care, or a mixture of work and time spent in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what <Col N="533" /> Deputy Woods is suggesting.  My intention is not so much to raise consciousness about the position of women but to raise their status and I have indicated ways we are doing that.  FÁS also operates a return to work programme, aimed at people wishing to re-enter the workforce having been absent for a long period, which attracts a high percentage of women.  Funds are being ring-fenced for the first time in the development plan of the human resource operations programme of the EU, targeted at employment and training courses for women, including those returning to work, those training for non-traditional work, management, training of child care workers and managers, guidance and information initiatives for women, etc.  The objective is to raise the status of women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the FÁS return to work programme and the £7.7 million funding from the EU.  Is any portion of that for women in the home who wish to participate in self-employment, or must we inquire elsewhere about that?  I would have thought the Minister for Equality and Law Reform would set the criteria and terms of reference for other Ministers and specify the issues which need to be addressed.  Many of the women do not feel they are low in status, they just want practical help.  They feel their status is quite high &mdash; a woman whose family is growing up usually feels her position in society is good but she would like money to go with the status.  This is where matters like entitlement to pensions arise because such women are excluded as their position is interrupted by virtue of time spent in the home caring for children.  Those practical considerations need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods has long experience in the provision of pensions; I have no brief in that area but I deal with the recommendations in the Second Commission's report, on all aspects of women's lives.  The implementation of those is proceeding apace. The up-to-date report of the monitoring <Col N="534" /> committee will be published tomorrow and Members will see a good basis for satisfaction with the level of implementation of those recommendations since the report was published in 1993.</P>
      <P>The Structural Funds money is administered by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and, according to my information, it is broadly targeted at employment and training courses for women, including those returning to work, those training for non-traditional work, management training, training for child care workers and managers, and guidance and information initiatives for women.  Those are the parameters of those ring-fenced funds but further detail on any specific item can be obtained from the relevant Minister.</P>

      <P>Many women will be pleased to hear about the EU funding of £7.7 million.  However, I would like to return to something which was basic to all women and also to the Minister's plans, the Matrimonial Home Bill, which was held to be unconstitutional, not due to the fault of anyone in this House.  Does the Minister consider that putting a similar Bill on the Statute Book to cover the joint ownership of the family home would raise the consciousness of the positive contribution of women in the home and would be a major acknowledgement of their contribution to society and to their families? Has there been any progress on this matter?  The Minister said he was re-examining it and I realise it is a fraught issue but has he found a solution to the difficulty with the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking for ways to deal with the Supreme Court's constitutional decision but that has not proved possible.  My intention in bringing forward the Matrimonial Home Bill was to secure the position of women in the home &mdash; the Bill had been around for 13 years before I sought to advance it.  It was found constitutionally wanting by the Supreme Court, which I regret. Having regard to that decision, it is not <Col N="535" /> possible to achieve that result in any other way.  I regret that and have looked at the matter from all possible angles. The Supreme Court has given its interpretation of that aspect of the Constitution and unless there is to be an amendment to the Constitution the matter cannot realistically be addressed.  I have no doubt the constitutional review committee will look at all aspects of the matter and I hope it will take this item into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot revisit the Matrimonial Home Bill but does the Minister believe it will be possible to introduce legislation to deal with this difficulty?  He said he was re-examining it but is he now saying it will not be feasible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in this House some time ago that he was re-examining the issue, not specifically the Bill.  He realised it was important that women felt they had ownership of their family home and acknowledged this by bringing forward the Bill.  Does he now believe he cannot progress it in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking if I can devise a method to deal with the finding of the Supreme Court on that constitutional issue, the answer is that it is not possible.  That is the Supreme Court's interpretation of a measure which would have vested the provisions of the Matrimonial Home Bill in both spouses.  Unfortunately, that has not proved possible and it is regrettable a similar result cannot be achieved by devious means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstood my question.  When Members acknowledged the difficulties that arose, the Minister undertook to examine the position of joint ownership, or a degree of ownership, of the family home by women.  I accept the Bill was declared <Col N="536" /> unconstitutional and I do not expect him to bring it before the House again. However, can we acknowledge the contribution of women in the home by giving them a share in the family property? This may not constitute joint ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Having examined all aspects of the matter I found no acceptable basis on which I could devise a measure that would achieve what I wanted to achieve under the Matrimonial Home Bill.  However, I will continue to examine the matter and to consider any suggestions put to me.  The nub of what Members on all sides sought to achieve under the Matrimonial Home Bill is not now achievable because of the Supreme Court's decision.  I explained this in the House on a previous occasion but I will clarify the matter again.</P>

      <P>The decision was clear cut.  Automatic joint ownership of the matrimonial home is not possible because of the Supreme Court's decision and I have not found a reasonable or satisfactory means of getting around that, but I will continue to examine the matter.</P>

In pursuing any such claim a person may apply to the Employment Equality Agency under the aegis of my Department for advice or assistance.</P>
      <P>While matters relating to the format and wording of recruitment forms used by State and semi-State agencies are, in the first instance, for the organisations concerned and their parent Departments, I have an interest in ensuring that access to redress is available to persons who consider that recruitment forms in respect of employment may be discriminatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I tabled this question because of the insights gained into the recruitment policy of the Department of the Marine at a recent Committee of Public Accounts meeting.  Will the Minister comment on, for example, the suggestion that applicants must be free from any defect which would render them unsuitable for recruitment.  What constitutes a defect?  The recruitment policy states that a person must be of good character.  That is a very subjective argument. Does it mean a daily communicant or person who attends Mass every Sunday has a good character?  Are those who do not attend Mass every Sunday deemed to have doubtful characters? We all know that a teacher lost her job because of her character, presumably because she was cohabiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister examine the form of recruitment in the various Departments? Is he familiar with the outrageous questions asked on the vocational education committees' VO2 form which female applicants must complete before recruitment?  The medical examiner must ask them if they are free from stammer and other serious speech defects, how many of their teeth are <Col N="538" /> decayed or missing, if they have any evidence of adenoids, enlargement of tonsils or scars and if they suffer from varicose veins or piles.  They are also asked if their monthly periods are regular and normal in all respects.  That should not be relevant to a female's employment prospects.  Why is there a VO2 form for females and a VO1 form for males?  The answers to the questions on those forms may determine an applicant's success. Have those who are unsuccessful on medical grounds access to the medical records which resulted in their not being recruited?</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the application forms to which Deputy Byrne referred.  He can table questions to the Ministers responsible for the particular agencies.  If the format or wording of a recruitment form is discriminatory, those aggrieved or affected by it can pursue a claim under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  The Employment Equality Agency will advise such people on how to pursue a claim to the tribunal based on the terms of the 1977 Act.  I encourage people to do this.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree his Department should adopt a proactive role in this area?  Given that the vocational education committees were established in the 1930s, the documentation which accompanies the medical examiner's report is obviously out of date.  The documentation which must be completed for recruitment to the Department of the Marine was formulated in the 1920s.  As the role of women in State and semi-State agencies has changed substantially since the 1920s and the 1930s, the Minister's Department should request those agencies to update their recruitment forms.  The term &ldquo;defects&rdquo; could be termed racist. A 3 per cent recruitment quota for the disabled now applies in such agencies. <Col N="539" /> As attitudes and legislation have changed dramatically since those forms were formulated, it is a cause of concern that many State and semi-State bodies continue to use recruitment documentation that is long out of date.</P>

      <P>As State and semi-State bodies are responsible to particular Ministers, the Deputy should table questions to the relevant Ministers. There must be a large number of such forms in circulation.  If the Deputy sends me a copy of the form about which he is concerned, I will examine its content. Primary responsibility for this issue rests with the Minister in control of the agency.  If Deputy Byrne sends me the form to which he referred I will look at it and communicate, as may be appropriate, with the relevant Minister.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Byrne is interesting and I am sure the Minister is amazed at the wording used in the VO2 form.  Will the Minister take up Deputy Byrne's suggestion and initiate a revision of these forms within Departments?  He could do this either through the interdepartmental committee to which he referred or by asking his colleagues in Government if they would agree to such a revision so that the forms could be updated to reflect the gender equity we are entitled to expect in this day and age.</P>

      <P>It is not only the Minister for Equality and Law Reform who has responsibility to ensure that forms etc. are prepared in a proper manner, are gender neutral and inoffensive.  This is the responsibility of many organisations and all Departments.  It is appropriate, therefore, for a Deputy who has a complaint regarding a form alleged to have been prepared under the ambit of a Department or semi-State organisation to raise the matter in the first instance with the organisation or Minister concerned. It is not within the ambit of my Department to do a trawl through the <Col N="540" /> hundreds or more of these forms which must exist at all levels in the Civil Service and public service.  I have invited Deputy Byrne to send me the forms to which he referred so that I can see what action may be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the Government's stated intention for some time that it will make arrangements for the publication of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill with all possible speed when it is in a position to do so.  However, as Deputies are aware as of now the result of the November 1995 referendum is still the subject of challenge before the courts and, pending the determination of that challenge.  I cannot go further than I have already done <Col N="541" /> in pinpointing the precise timescale of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that any legislation will be similar to the format already published before the divorce referendum in the Government's referendum information publication entitled &ldquo;The Right to Remarry&rdquo;.  The draft Bill contained therein is very detailed and comprehensive and includes the grounds for divorce as voted on by the people in the referendum and provisions in relation to the support of spouses and children, custody, property, succession, pensions, court jurisdiction and procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information he has given the House about the format of the legislation.  Is he in a position to say how soon after what we presume will be a positive result in the appeal before the courts the legislation will be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to bring the Bill to Government at the earliest possible date after the matter is disposed of by the courts, assuming that the decision of the High Court is affirmed, and to introduce the Bill in the House at the earliest possible date thereafter.  Subject to clearance by the courts, I am anxious, and regard it as important, to enact the legislation into law at the earliest possible date given that the referendum was passed by the electorate as far back as November.  I will look for, and know I will receive, the co-operation of Deputies on both sides of the House in achieving this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the court proceedings be completed and when will the Bill be brought before the House?  I am happy the Minister confirmed that the legislation will be similar to the format published before the divorce referendum as other issues raised and other commitments given prior to the campaign will also have to be taken into <Col N="542" /> consideration during the debate in the House.  I am sure the Minister recalls the commitment given by the Taoiseach to provide special protection for children, such as the appointment of a commissioner for children or the setting up of a system to ensure that children's interests are properly looked after.  We would expect any legislation to be similar to the format published before the divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the legislation will have to be in that form as this was the commitment given to the electorate before the referendum; the legislation was published in that form so that people would know what precisely they were voting on.  The legislation should not go beyond the issue of divorce and some ancillary matters may have to be dealt with in separate legislation.  I am not saying that particular matters may arise but the Bill was specifically published before the referendum and this will have to stand.</P>
      <P>On the question of the timescale, the Supreme Court has fixed 29 April for the hearing of the appeal which could take two or three days &mdash; I am speculating here &mdash; and I imagine that the Supreme Court would reserve judgment on it.  I cannot say how long it will take to deliver the judgment but I hope it will be delivered reasonably quickly after the hearing having regard to the lapse of time since the referendum.  When the issue is cleared by the Supreme Court, and assuming it affirms the High Court decision, I will bring the Bill to Government immediately and introduce it in the House a few weeks later.</P>

This is something I have urged in the House during the last three or four weeks.  I hope the parties take up the opportunity.</P>
      <P>The light rail transport Bill to be published before the summer recess will provide a framework for the construction, development and operation of a light rail system.  However, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and individual business people on the proposed route of the light rail system have many objections and have prepared a costly report. When will the Bill be prepared, and rather than getting involved in unnecessary conflict, will the Minister consult the Chamber of Commerce and the people who have spent this money prior to the Bill coming before the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak to the House on the recent developments on BSE.  I recognise that this is an important and sensitive issue and that it merits a serious and considered debate in the House.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it necessary to go into the full details and history of BSE. However, there is a number of salient points which must be highlighted.  BSE was first identified in the UK in November 1986 and the first case in Ireland was in 1989.  The scientific view is that BSE was caused by cattle consuming infected feed, more than likely due to the inclusion in cattle feed of protein derived from scrapie infected sheep. That scientific view remains and the development of the disease in the UK and in the small number of cases here supports the case that contaminated meat and bonemeal was the primary source of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> The incidence of BSE in Ireland is at a totally different level to that in Britain.  Since 1989, there has been a total of 124 cases in Ireland, representing an annual animal incidence of 0.0002 per cent in a cattle population of over seven million.  All cases were aged four years and over and this age profile of cases continues to increase.  In other words, cases identified in latter years tended to be in even older cows.  By comparison, there have been almost 160,000 cases in Britain which has a cattle population of about 12 million.</P>
    <P>We have in place strong and clear-cut control measures both to protect consumers and to maintain and safeguard our trade.  Among the most important control measures in place are that BSE is a compulsorily notifiable disease and set procedures ensue from that classification; a comprehensive surveillance system is in place, in abattoirs all animals are examined ante-mortem for signs of diseases including BSE by an official veterinarian, and all obvious nervous lymphatic tissue is removed from the carcases; BSE confirmed animals are destroyed and buried <i>in situ</i> or incinerated and market value is paid by the State in compensation; the entire herds in which BSE occurs are depopulated at full market value and paid by the State; feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminant animals has been banned since 1990 and importation of cattle from UK and Northern Ireland is banned under EU legislation.  Ireland has an extremely low incidence of sheep scrapie and the balance between its cattle and sheep population significantly reduces the risk factor.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about one element of our controls, namely, what happens the meat from depopulated herds.  The original decision to depopulate herds was taken for trade and certification reasons.  It was not taken for veterinary or scientific reasons because BSE is a disease of individual animals; it is not a viral or herd disease.  There was no sleight of hand about this policy, indeed it was publicised on a number of occasions.  Specifically, in January I <Col N="894" /> announced by way of reassurance that we would carry out skull tests on suspect animals in depopulated herds and those test results did not show any incidence of BSE in the animals tested. However, in recent weeks we had been reviewing our policy and in regard to the most recent depopulations it had been decided to condemn all this meat. It should also be understood that depopulations are not a very frequent event &mdash; roughly one per month &mdash; and, therefore, the amount of meat involved is insignificant in the context of overall throughput.  Over a period of six-and-a-half years, out of a total of 3.5 million tonnes, this would involve some 3 million tonnes.</P>
    <P>The origins of the current problems can be linked to the announcement in the House of Commons last week which has generated a great deal of interest and a certain level of concern.  Its impact has been felt right across the beef industry and not only in the UK but also in Europe and in third countries.  This information should be seen in the proper context but this is proving difficult in the current wave of hysteria.  It is part of an ongoing review of BSE by various scientific groups.  That review has expanded into possible connections with CJD, a rare neurological disease in man. Over the past decade new information has emerged and a good deal more is known about BSE now than when it first emerged in 1989.  It is vital that this information is properly assessed and that wrong or hasty conclusions are not arrived at.  This latest information is being examined by our authorities and, in particular, by the Food Safety Advisory Board which involves veterinary and medical expertise.  What is at issue is a cluster of ten CJD cases which have shown a previously unrecognised disease pattern.</P>
    <P>The discussion and decision at the Standing Veterinary Committee yesterday was a recognition of the difficulties in the UK and showed the clear intention of member states and the EU Commission to ring-fence the problem until the situation has been further clarified. <Col N="895" /> The implementation of that decision may need to be clarified but the position is clear; there is a ban on UK cattle, beef and beef products.  Ireland is not included in that ban and this is clearly a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>The restriction on exports from the UK raises the very important issue of preventing illegal cattle movements across the Border and protecting the integrity of our product.  The level of Garda and Customs activity has been very significantly increased and no effort will be spared to prevent such movements.  There have already been two seizures of suspected illegally imported cattle and arrangements are being made for their slaughter and their removal from the food and feed chains. This is not just an issue for the control authorities alone; the entire industry will have to close ranks and ensure that such cattle will be neither purchased nor processed in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that a degree of concern has been aroused in third country markets and that problems currently exist in a number of important markets.  The full resources of my Department, the Diplomatic Service and of An Bord Bia are being devoted to assuring the authorities in those countries and protecting our market position there.</P>
    <P>Veterinary officers are currently <i>en route</i> to the Middle East; arrangements are being made for other markets to be visited in the next few days.  An urgent priority is to resolve the problem in Egypt and Libya.  I have just come from a meeting with the Iranian Ambassador and I am taking steps to have further direct dialogue with the Iranian Agriculture Minister tomorrow morning.  My senior officials will talk to some of the Iranian officials who are here to clear up any misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that policy in regard to the Irish cattle and beef sector is designed to ensure the highest possible standards of public and animal health and to provide the strongest possible guarantees to customers and <Col N="896" /> consumers of Irish beef.  I have already outlined the comprehensive series of controls in place in relation to BSE. These controls go beyond what is recommended by scientific evidence or by international organisations.  They are enforced through clinical examinations of all animals prior to slaughter or export, through the disease being compulsorily notifiable, ongoing surveillance, a Government diagnostic service, the compulsory slaughter policy and the banning of meat and bone meal as a cattle feed.  The difficulties at present are not of our making.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the current situation regarding four shipments of live cattle to Egypt and other third country markets.  I spoke to one of the key exporters this afternoon and we will be communicating with the Egyptian authorities at the very highest level.  The confusion in Egypt arose out of a European ban.  My strategy, and that of the Government, is to try to implement yesterday's decision of the European Veterinary Scientific Committee &mdash; by 14 votes to one &mdash; that a ban on UK beef and beef products is the appropriate response.  I encourage the Commission to implement this decision.  The committee to which I referred has reconvened this afternoon to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>Media reports have made it clear that, in conjunction with the customs authorities and Garda Síochána, we have stepped up surveillance on movement of animals in the Border region.  The Government decided at the weekend that any movement of animals in this area would be treated as suspicious. This action was necessary because of the difficulties relating to the lack of outlets for people living in the UK and Northern Ireland to sell cattle, beef and culled cows there.  The Government also believed that there would be a major incentive for such people to attempt to use the Republic as an outlet.  It was, therefore, appropriate to step up our vigilance, which yielded results in counties Louth and Donegal.  The animals impounded in these areas will be destroyed as soon as possible.  Earlier <Col N="897" /> today I signed an order which implements a ban on imports of all British beef and beef products.  Ireland joins every other member state in Europe which has taken similar legal steps.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting this afternoon, following a series of meetings between the trade and the Irish Food Board, which focused on the arrangements required for different markets in Europe and elsewhere.  A strategy is being finalised in this regard and representatives from my Department and the Government will be visiting our key markets in Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Britain to explore the possibilities and provide necessary assurances <i>vis-à-vis</i> country of origin labelling and other particular advertising and promotional efforts which will safeguard those markets.  At present delegations from Sweden and other member states are actively engaged in dialogue to provide reassurances about Ireland's veterinary and high animal health status.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the media and the public not to engage in the level of hysteria, panic and confusion witnessed in Britain.  We must have a common-sense approach to this problem.  Ireland enjoys a grass-based, generally green image in relation to livestock production and a very high animal health status.  Since 1989, we have had the strictest possible policy for dealing with BSE.  I remain open to implementing any further steps recommended at scientific, national or EU level with regard to a ban on specified offal or other procedures relating to killing lines.  There is no need for panic or knee-jerk reactions.  However, if our trade customers deem it appropriate to further tighten regulations, they will be pushing an open door as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>This is undoubtedly a difficult situation. There is some evidence of confusion in third countries such as the UAE, Kuwait, Egypt and elsewhere. Ireland has been caught in the loop of confusion relating to a ban on British products.  We must ensure that the state purchasing importers and government <Col N="898" /> authorities in such countries receive the veterinary information they require.  It is significant to point out that Ireland exported beef to over 80 countries last week.  There is no additional evidence of increased BSE in Irish cattle.  The available evidence shows that the problem relates to elderly cows and is diminishing. With the controls in place and the policies deployed by successive Governments, we believe that Ireland is in a very strong position to reassure those 80 trading countries of our bona fides in that regard.</P>
    <P>Comments have been made in relation to the attachment of the Deparatment of Food to the Department of Agriculture.  Other member states in Europe, with one exception, have integrated their Departments of Food and Agriculture.  The reality of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; and all products &mdash; requires a level of integration between food processing and agricultural production.  Even if a separate Department of Food existed, all the key reassurances required on these issues relate to animal health, on-farm activity, veterinary and meat inspection procedures as opposed to food processing. By their nature, the key critical issues of confidence are agricultrual and veterinary. This matter is a red herring with regard to the central issue of reassurance. There is already a national advisory food safety board under the remit of the Minister for Health, in close liaison with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I am anxious to facilitate any adjustments or developments to this, if deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>I will be glad to respond to questions at the end of this debate.  I hope that, notwithstanding the inevitable pressures arising out of global panic with regard to beef consumption, we will have an orderly development of our market.  I also hope that, within a reasonable period, the opportunities to increase our market share in some countries will be fully availed of so that this major threat can be converted into a genuine opportunity.</P>

Fad agus a bhí mé ann, chonaic mé an caighdeán marfheola atá ar fáil sa tír seo.  Ina theanta sin, chonaic mé cé chomh cúramach is a bhí an Stáit ó thaobh galaire 'sna h-ainmhithe.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I served for two years as Minister with responsibility for food in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. During that period I saw the very high quality of our product and witnessed implementation of the measures outlined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have listened carefully to what my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has just said and I am sure they will have been reassured by the information he has provided, especially on Irish beef.  I would like to draw attention to a number of what I consider to be significant differences between the position in Ireland and the UK.</P>
      <P>First, in relation to animal feed, in Ireland, we had not adopted the production process that is considered to have given rise to the problem.  Second, we imported only small quantities of UK produced animal feed before a ban was put in place several years ago.  Irish farmers, in any case, are much less reliant on feeds than their UK counterparts, due to the abundance of grass here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our responses to BSE have also been different.  The ban on use of suspected offal in animal feed was introduced at a very early stage and enforced rigorously. Ireland has also adopted a depopulation policy for herds in which this disease occurred.  That has now been tightened.  All these responses should give the consumer at home and abroad confidence in the safety of Irish <Col N="900" /> beef, which is, of course, the prime concern and interest of my Department. The Food Safety Advisory Board and its predecessor, the Food Safety Advisory Committee, have been monitoring the situation very closely since the late 1980s and have kept the Minister for Health and his Department abreast of all the latest information.  The board had already commenced further review at my request before these latest developments and it will meet again within the next few days to review and update its advice.</P>
    <P>My Department has also been in continuous liaison with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and a high level discussion took place as recently as last Thursday when my Department sought and was provided with details of the controls in place.  My Department is fully satisfied that the controls operated in Ireland are satisfactory to meet the concerns currently expressed by consumers.</P>
    <P>I want to address the question of the possibility of a link between BSE and CJD.  The bottom line is that at this time no scientific link has been established between BSE and CJD.  This was repeated most recently in the SEAC report last week in the UK.  It is worth noting that even in the UK the incidence of CJD is still very low and in line with levels elsewhere in Europe. However, even a very remote risk justifies precautions and the steps taken at EU level and nationally in several member states of the EU must be seen in that context.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, we have had fewer than 20 cases of CJD, almost all of them in the older age group.  The chief medical officer of my Department is undertaking a detailed study of all those cases and will be reporting his findings to me shortly.  However, no evidence has emerged which suggests any unusual developments in the pattern of the disease here.</P>
    <P>All Departments and agencies involved in this issue will continue to treat it as a top priority, to ensure that the consumer, the primary focus of our <Col N="901" /> concern, is given the necessary information and assurance to maintain confidence in Irish beef.  The focus of our efforts, singly and together, over the days and weeks ahead will be to ensure that we put beyond doubt any concerns people may have regarding the safety of the product and that our inspection, evaluation and control systems continue to be implemented at the highest possible level of effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important debate and I am somewhat disappointed by the content of what we have heard so far from the Government side.  It denotes complacency at Government level in coming to grips with the problem. There seems to be no realisation that the confusion and hype, which has been rightly criticised, about the treatment of this matter in the UK and elsewhere since this scare erupted again last week has an impact on Ireland.  Confidence in our industry is being eroded because of the treatment of this issue elsewhere.  The best example of that, as we are aware from talking to butchers and others, is that consumption of beef is down by 30 to 40 per cent.  That may be an initial reaction but it is a serious reaction to the problem by our own people.  How will we come to grips with the problem elsewhere &mdash; 85 per cent of our product is exported to non-Irish citizens &mdash; when our own citizens have not got the message that this is not a problem in Ireland?  All the evidence suggests that the message is not getting through.</P>
      <P>I am very surprised that at a Cabinet meeting this morning it was indicated this issue might be discussed; it was not put at the top of its agenda.  I had hoped that as a result of such a meeting a co-ordinated approach would be adopted and a coherent information campaign introduced which would enable Irish citizens to be reassured in the first instance before undertaking successful ventures abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few minutes I received from a constituent in Dubai a fax on the <Col N="902" /> Gulf news which is headed &ldquo;Municipalities to Ban Import of Irish Beef: Possibility of Mad Cow Disease Reaching UAE Blocked &mdash; Official&rdquo;.  There is a lack of distinction between Irish and British beef in those markets, in Egypt, Libya and Jordan &mdash; people are also very testy today because of rumours about the Iranian position.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government came to grips with the fact that our essential national interests are at stake in terms of our £1.7 billion industry.  It should get its act together quickly and communicate the good news about Irish beef.  Not only is that news not getting through to Irish consumers, it is not getting through to other consumers upon whom the industry depends.  Let no one think &mdash; I do not believe anybody does &mdash; that the fact that the British are experiencing difficulties in this regard is to our advantage. About 30 per cent of British processing capacity is Irish owned and &mdash; given the ban &mdash; the impact this issue is having in Britain will have an impact on those processors and their ability to deal with the domestic market.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been the only Minister to speak in public on this issue.  The Minister for Health and his Minister of State have been invisible since this health scare about British beef arose last week.  It is unbelievable that there has not been a co-ordinated Government approach.  This is not just an animal health issue; it is a public health issue.  The Department of Health and the agencies under its remit should be actively involved in reassuring the public. They would be perceived as independent of the agribusiness industry. However, the Minister, Deputy Yates, is not seen in that light regardless of how well he may try to argue otherwise.</P>
    <P>I wish to be supportive, I have looked for the campaign to ensure our industry is saved and enhanced but I cannot see it.  No co-ordinated effort is being made to inform the public that Irish beef is safe.  I have heard a number of individual statements but there is no co-ordinated Government response.  A Cabinet <Col N="903" /> subcommittee should have been formed last week to pull all the strands together to get the message across at home and abroad.  The evidence so far suggests that message is not getting through.</P>
    <P>It is important when our national interests are at stake that we get out act together.  The Taoiseach suggested yesterday that he would consider making a telephone call to President Mubarak if he thought it would be helpful.  He should make it his business to find out if it would be helpful and then make the call.  With due respect, the Taoiseach can campaign in Dublin west at any time but the situation in Egypt must be addressed now.  I accept that our veterinary officers have been sent out there but a political response is required to safeguard these markets.  Political decisions are being taken in Egypt, Libya, possibly in Iran and in Dubai this evening, on the basis of an information gap.</P>
    <P>Where is the evidence of the diplomatic initiative we have been told about having been effective in the United Arab Emirates when they still do not know the difference between Irish and British beef?  Where is the urgency? The Minister should go on a political mission to those markets to inform them there is nothing wrong with the Irish beef processing industry and stand over Irish beef as a pure and premium product.  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach has not sent the Minister to do so as I am sure he would be willing to do it if he was asked.  There seems to be an appalling complacency in some quarters of Government although I exclude the Minister from that because he seems to know what is going on.  However, other members of Cabinet have no idea of the potential seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>In the Irish beef industry we need a far more co-ordinated response than we have had to date.  We have good news to tell.  The Government's response in 1989 was more than adequate.  It was over and above what was scientifically required to maintain trading status and consumer confidence at home and <Col N="904" /> abroad in this essential industry.  Unfortunately, it has become the currency of political debate in recent times to have a swipe at the beef industry.  We all realise now how important it is to defend and support it.  It is also important to recognise that the professionalism of our Department in maintaining the disease free status of our herd has been exemplary.  It has played a leadership role here and in Europe.  Our standards have been adopted in Europe because the highest possible standards were and are maintained here by successive Governments, simply because of the dependence of the economy on the agri-food business.</P>
    <P>We have no apologies to make to anybody about the purity and premium quality of our beef.  However, we need to communicate that message more effectively and we have not been doing that.  An integrated approach was started in 1987 when the Department of Agriculture and Food was established. We decided it was not only the producers who had to be involved in the agri-food business but that processors and consumers had to have confidence in the business if we were to develop the business at home and abroad.  We know now the importance of that consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>When this Government was formed it was a retrograde step not to give a Minister of State responsibility for the food section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, whose job would be to look after the consumer. The Minister mainly looks to producer and processor interests although he may claim also to have consumer interests in hand.  A sharp focus had been built since 1987 by successive Ministers of State with responsibility for food who were successful in dealing with the modernisation of the food business.  That was forgotten about when the Government was formed.  It was a retrograde step because it failed to keep the consumer focus in the Department as it had been since 1987.</P>
    <P>With regard to domestic consumer confidence, when the Minister had the <Col N="905" /> chance to put two extra people on the board of An Bord Bia I asked him not to surrender to vested producer interests for the sake of it.  However, he did.  We need consumer interests as well as producer and industry interests represented in An Bord Bia.  We need that credibility at home and abroad.  The Minister should redress that situation and put a recognised consumer interest on the board of An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>We are all consumers.  Farmers and their families are consumers like everyone else.  The Minister should act to restore confidence and ensure what is happening elsewhere does not have an impact here.  It may be unfair that events elsewhere affect us in this way but with modern means of communication and international media it is inevitable.  A co-ordinated Government approach is vital as is the establishment of a Cabinet subcommittwe recognising the importance of this industry and the Minister and others must be prepared to take a political initiative to safeguard markets essential to our national interests.  We need to examine our marketing strategy in the United Kingdom given that we do not have our own branding of beef there.  Where will the resources be found to ensure that we have our own brand and what will we do now about pressing the argument for improved export refunds to non-European Union markets?</P>
    <P>What are we doing about all of those initiatives in respect of which the Minister has been silent in the House today? I recognise the importance of not talking down the industry, but want to know what is the proposed programme of action to safeguard our essential national interests and the thousands of livelihoods at stake, the 70,000 exclusively beef farmers who know that their products are not banned from other markets but wonder what markets will continue to be available to us because of the collapse of consumer confidence, not just within the United Kingdom but within Europe?</P>
    <P>We have already witnessed a decline in the consumption of red meat which <Col N="906" /> no doubt will continue to deepen but, if we want to increase our market share, we must take the necessary marketing initiatives, backed-up by the requisite resources and the co-operation of everybody in the industry.  Those initiatives are not simply references thereto in this House or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister called together all interests within the industry to discuss the present position as a matter of urgency, to ensure co-operation, and to ascertain where the requisite resources will be found to implement precautionary measures because they will not be implemented voluntarily.  There are political heads of Government Departments to take such decisions, to make things happen before the industry is allowed to deteriorate to a condition from which it may not recover.  These are issues on which the Minister should not be silent, as he has been to date.</P>
    <P>Where has the food safety advisory committee been for the past two weeks, indeed for the past two years?  All the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, could tell me was that that committee will report to him again shortly.  We do not want that committee to report to the Minister but to the public.  There is urgent need for an independent assessment, freely and publicly available, which would allow people to accept there is not a problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> Irish beef, which fact has been confirmed not merely by the Minister but by that regulatory committee.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, does the Minister for Health not feel he has a role to play in these circumstances?  I have watched debates in the House of Commons where it appears their Secretary of State for Health, Stephen Dorrell, is as central to this issue as is their Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Hogg.  Yet there was not even a Cabinet decision taken here this morning on a co-ordinated approach, to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>We have already experienced bans imposed by North African markets.  It took very intensive diplomatic initiatives by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture to have them lifted.  We <Col N="907" /> all know how critical were those successful initiatives to the development of our beef industry, particularly the live trade.  Much greater urgency must be injected into our present deliberations. While accepting the BSE epidemic cannot affect us, the problem is that insufficient numbers of people within our own or in international markets know or understand that.  Our first responsibility must be to our citizens, to whom the issue must be explained much more thoroughly than it has been to date.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue this <i>laissez faire</i> approach.  This crisis has highlighted the need for us to be extremely careful in any deregulation of animal health issues which perhaps has been the rock on which the British authorities have perished. In the case of the changes the Minister implemented in the programme for eradication of TB from our national herd, we must be very careful, regardless of cost, that voluntaryism is not allowed at the expense of maintaining the disease-free status of our national herd.  If we lose credibility on that issue, our peceived savings will prove very costly in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>My party when in Government introduced an animal remedies Bill in 1994. Have any regulations been drawn up under it to assure people that the quality and safety of our meat products is maintained?  Despite many fallacious perceptions, we cannot underestimate the economic consequences or potential dangers of any question mark being placed over the quality of our beef or beef products.  In this age perceptions have become more important than reality, particularly when it comes to consumer choice.  Therefore, we must attack such misconceptions more aggressively, in a much more co-ordinated, coherent fashion than we have. Too much is at stake.  We have spent very many years building up this industry in which we appear to take some perverse pleasure in criticising.  Yet, when we perceive our major national interest in jeopardy, we begin to wonder <Col N="908" /> about the perception problem and why it is not being solved.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be assured that we on this side of the House will support any meaningful, effective measures the Government is prepared to take to safeguard our beef industry, its jobs and the market share for our products at home and abroad.  We will be constructive in pressurising the Government to honour its responsibilities in this respect and bring forward precautionary proposals as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Likewise, should there be any complacency or inability in the Government to produce constructive political initiatives to resolve these matters, the Minister can be assured we will be the first to come in here and underline that such responsibility lies fairly and squarely on the shoulders of Government.  If the Minister wants to be successful in his attempts, he must get cracking immediately, use all the authority at his command, and lobby in those countries where we have critical export interests, where his presence will have greatest effect.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for the veterinary officers of the Minister's Department, who will afford him the necessary technical assistance.</P>
    <P>What is now needed is to use the political muscle of this Government to ensure that Irish beef is saved from any further scare tactics.  Many competitors will see in this crisis an opportunity to increase their market share, and will adopt whatever tactics they deem necessary to avail of any opportunities arising from the British difficulty.  We need to market our premium quality beef, a grassland-based product more environmentally friendly than the product of any of our European or other competitors. Despite the fact that as of last week we exported beef to some 80 countries, some do not appear to be able to draw a distinction between Irish and British beef.  What does that say about our marketing strategy and our ability to maintain customer loyalty at this critical time?  These fundamental issues must be addressed with far more vehemence than has been the case to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my party spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, and thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Government for having allowed this debate on the crisis in the beef industry.</P>
      <P>The BSE crisis has come as a shock to the consumer and a major challenge to producers.  Our first duty is to provide the maximum, well-founded reassurance to our customers, the basis of which has been in place for many years. I applaud the prudent, far-sighted and radical policy of former Ministers for Agriculture, Senator Michael O'Kennedy and Deputy Joe Walsh, from 1989 onwards on the slaughtering of herds within which any infected animal was found and banning the importation of suspect foodstuffs from Britain.  We are greatly in their debt, since they took the right action to protect consumers and producers.  People who advised them at that time can share in that commendation, even if it was the more expensive, inconvenient policy option then available to them.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil always recognised the importance of a pure, green food industry and was ready to take action in its defence.  Many people have been all too ready to denigrate the management and integrity of our beef industry, and talk of scandals.  Perhaps they will now recognise that, on this bigger issue &mdash; on which the overall survival of the industry depends &mdash; former Fianna Fáil Ministers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry got it right, whereas their British counterparts took the easy option resulting in a strategic blunder of catastrophic proportions. The lesson is all the more clear for us, that our food industry must be consumer rather than producer led; that, if we give priority to the safety and quality concerns of our consumers, we cannot go far wrong.  That approach is, equally, in the longer term interests of the producer. The consumer demands guaranteed certainty but Government scientists who talk about there not being any established links perpetuate doubt and uncertainty; we must do everything to actively create greater certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> While our basic policy is right &mdash; and the French followed our example by slaughtering a whole herd with one BSE cow in Brittany in the past few days &mdash; we must ensure we can provide the watertight assurance the consumer needs.  The Minister correctly, but perhaps belatedly, instructed that all meat from an infected herd, not just from the infected animal, be destroyed.</P>
    <P>We need more information about the incubation period of the disease, the feasibility and reliability of systematic tests on all carcases, guarantees that the infection might not be harboured in meat tissues and whether any form of heat treatment could be effective in excluding that possibility.  We also need to know whether the type of feedstuff now barred for cattle is being fed to other types of farmed animals, such as pigs or poultry, and if there is a danger of problems arising there.  Are we actively promoting our own medical and veterinary research into BSE and CJD and possible links between the two?</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty, for the time being at least, to ensure that no cattle are smuggled across the Border from Northern Ireland.  That will be a difficult but essential task.  This is a deeply regrettable situation as we have always tried, where possible, to allow Northern Ireland farmers share in the advantages enjoyed by Irish agriculture under the CAP and to share in joint food promotions abroad.  I sympathise with their plight but, unfortunately, Northern Ireland has a higher incidence of BSE than ourselves, though much lower than in Britain.  The main problem is that at present they are wide open to imports from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The present situation should underline for everybody concerned the advantages, particularly in relation to agriculture, of the approach recommended in the Joint Framework Document which recommends that North and South should adopt a joint or harmonised approach in sectors involving a natural or physical all-Ireland framework and in areas such as animal welfare, as well as an integrated approach <Col N="911" /> to other EU-related issues.  It is clear that integration with the rest of UK agriculture at this time is a disaster for Northern farmers.  If the approach in the framework document were in place in relation to animal health, Northern Ireland farmers would be in a strong position to seek an exemption from the ban on the rest of the UK.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in the spirit of friendship and good neighbourliness, to explore with the Northern authorities and farm bodies in the days and weeks ahead the means by which this approach could be put in place with the appropriate safeguards to protect our own consumers and the beef industry.  I fully accept that until something is worked out, the Border must be closed to all cattle imports, the reputation and credibility of our food industry may depend on this being done effectively.</P>
    <P>We have a £1 billion beef industry. The current situation presents both challenges and opportunities.  A vigorous diplomatic effort will be required, led by the Taoiseach, to ensure the lucrative Middle East market remains open to us.  As of now there is a great danger that the markets, which we made strenuous efforts to reopen with eventual success, as outlined by Deputy Cowen, will again be closed, with a depressing effect on Irish cattle prices. We must ensure that all continental markets are fully aware of the difference between Irish and British beef.  I accept there are important variations in market needs, and places where it will be advantageous to have Irish beef branded as such, and others where it may not, but there is potentially a great opportunity to make a breakthrough in the emergence of a distinctive brand of Irish beef, not least on the British market, and to associate the highest standards of quality, hygiene and natural grass-based production with Irish meat. We have long been seeking to do that in this country and it is time for the Minister, and everybody else concerned <Col N="912" /> in politics and the media, to stop denigrating the Irish beef industry and to recognise it as one of our most important and valuable assets.  Our future welfare and prosperity as a nation depends on our being able to come through this crisis with our heads high and our reputation for quality enhanced.</P>
    <P>The key issue for the Minister is to gain the confidence of consumers.  By doing that he serves all purposes because it saves the industry, agriculture and the difficulties of those involved in exports, and it will change the way people look at us.  In wishing the Minister well, those of us on this side of the House would like the focus of the Government to be put on this issue.  As I came into Leinster House today, I was almost knocked down by Ministers taking off to the four corners of Dublin West when they should have been here to support their colleague.  That is the wrong way to deal with a crisis of this degree.  The Taoiseach and other key Ministers, who have more contacts than the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry through our embassies, etc., should be here focusing on this matter. They would have the support of this side of the House for positive constructive action but if Ministers are not showing an interest in the issue, consumers will believe we do not have a policy in this regard.  That is the danger and it is a matter for the Minister to articulate those policies in the House tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the Far East over the weekend and last week and, to my amazement, this issue was the lead story in much of the international media.  It was the lead story on CNN for several days as well as on the BBC World Service.  It is difficult to believe that an issue as important as this evinces so little interest in this House, that there is such a degree of complacency about it and, in particular, that there is a strong concentration on the potential financial losses to this country rather than on the potential serious risk to public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an interesting letter in <Col N="913" /> today's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, written by Dr. Norman McMillan of the Regional Technical College, Carlow, in which he refers to a summer school on scientific topics which he and the regional technical college in Carlow organised in 1992.  The keynote speaker at the conference was Professor Rechard Lacey, a microbiologist, who has been dealing with some of the potential medical problems arising from what has now come to light in Britain. It is frightening to realise he forecast that the British Government would be forced into the position it found itself in last week, that he was pooh-poohed by the veterinary and medical establishments on both sides of the Irish Sea, that he was marginalised, as he put it, and that it was sought to convey to the public that this man was talking rubbish. It is quite clear now that he was not.  He forecast what has come to light four years later and it is interesting that in debates in the past few days on British radio and television between himself and the chairman of the British Government's advisory committee on this matter, Professor John Pattison, they spoke about the possibility of more than 5,000 deaths per annum from the year 2005 onwards.  These are extraordinarily serious matters and their consequences will not be put right simply by the introduction of more administrative or veterinary controls.  Even if everything was properly done for a change, and it certainly has not been, in respect of this and other matters the public perception, not only in Britain and in this country but throughout the entire world, is such that if it cannot be changed the outlook for beef consumption must be a cause of great concern to producers here, in Britain and in many other places.</P>
    <P>One of the curious ironies of this latest crisis in Britian is that it opens up a unique marketing opportunity for the Irish beef industry.  Consumer confidence in the British beef industry has collapsed right across Europe.  British beef has been removed from supermarket shelves and denied entry to continental markets.  Exports markets that <Col N="914" /> have taken years to develop have evaporated almost overnight.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile in Britain retail chains and fast food chains are competing with one another to delist British beef and to assure their customers that it will not be served.  The next 12 months will tell us whether Irish exporters are able to exploit the tremendous opportunity with which they have been presented. The key to success for the Irish beef industry lies in quality assurance and customer assurance.  As long as market confidence can be maintained in the Irish product all doors will be open to it.  We take great pride in the clean and green image which our beef enjoys, but this favourable image will rapidly disappear without proper verification standards. We have an advantage but we are throwing it away because of our inability to convince international consumers of how good and safe our product is.</P>
    <P>The organisation charged with responsibility for maintaining public confidence in Irish beef is the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. It is fair to say that the Department's record in policing that industry over the last decade has left much to be desired. Taxpayers will this year face a bill of up to £100 million in EU fines because of the Department's maladministration and its total failure to control widespread abuse and systematic fraud throughout the beef processing industry. Taxpayers and consumers might have hoped the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry had put that era behind it.  Revelations during the past week are hardly encouraging.</P>
    <P>First, we learn that a senior veterinary officer in the Department is facing criminal proceedings.  I am surprised the Minister did not advert to that well publicised fact in his contribution.  Very serious allegations are made against this man.  Apparently it became known to the Department in January and he was suspended at that time.  The potential damage that can be caused to Irish beef by his alleged actions is immense because the whole disease-free status of <Col N="915" /> Irish beef is put at risk by his actions and by the publicity which, apparently, they have got.</P>
    <P>Second, we learn that Irish beef from BSE infected herds has been sold for human consumption.  The reaction of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to that revelation was extraordinary. He tried to explain it away by saying this beef was exported.  Is the Minister not aware that the Irish beef industry is export driven and that its ability to sell on foreign markets is crucial to its survival?  We have prided ourselves greatly in recent years on the tough slaughter-out policy which we have adopted in relation to herds in which an animal was found to be infected.  The whole purpose of the slaughter-out policy surely was to prevent beef from infected herds finding its way into the human food chain.  This point was made clearly at the weekend by the expert group of European Commission officials who were asked to look into the BSE problem.  Neither of these cases casts a particularly favourable light on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Both call fundamentally into serious question the Department's ability to police the beef processing industry in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Our beef industry is now at a crossroads. If it can command consumer respect and allay any possible fears on the part of international customers the industry could be on the verge of unrivalled prosperity.  Ireland could become the major export supplier of beef to the markets of continental Europe.  A stable high quality business could be developed to the advantage of producers, processors and all those who work in the beef plants.  The net result would be higher returns for producers, higher profits for processors, higher and better paid employment in the factories.</P>
    <P>If the Irish beef industry fails to command consumer respect, then the future is bleak.  Irish beef would be tarred unfairly with the same brush as its British counterpart.  Our exports would plummet with drastic consequences for <Col N="916" /> all sections of the industry &mdash; producers, processors and factory workers.  Sales on the home market would also be affected, posing a threat to the livelihoods of many in family businesses in the retail butchery trade.</P>
    <P>The onus on the Government is great. It has to show that our beef industry is being properly and vigilantly policed.  It has to ensure that Ireland's reputation as a producer of natural and wholesome high quality meat is protected and verified. There has to be a major question as to whether the current arrangements in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are satisfactory and capable of satisfying these objectives.  I think not.  We need to look afresh at the whole question of quality assurance, product traceability and customer confidence in the food industry as a whole. The present set up is heavily biased in favour of the producers and processors. This might seem a cosy enough arrangement when things are going well.  Now that the industry is facing a major crisis, transparency and credibility will have to take precedence.  If foreign buyers cannot have confidence in our policing of the beef industry they will not buy our product.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of all those involved in the beef industry, including producers and processors, that a new system is put in place.  In the free market, post intervention era, producers and processors must recognise that unless they are seen to put the interests of the consumer first their industry has no long-term future.  In the context of public service reform my party recently put forward proposals for the devolution of departmental responsibilities in many areas of Government to newly created executive agencies.  An agricultural and food inspectorate was one such area which we identified.</P>
    <P>There is now a strong argument for the creation of a national agency, independent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to oversee the whole area of food hygiene and quality.  Producers and processors could be represented on the board of such an <Col N="917" /> agency but so also would people from the retail trade and consumer interests. The consumer is supposed to be sovereign in a market economy.  If that is the case, then it should be reflected in our policies for policing the food industry.</P>
    <P>The creation of the new agency need involve no increase in the overall size of the Government's bureaucracy.  It would simply involve a transfer of functions from one area of Government to another but in such a way that efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, independence and accountability were drastically improved.  A new agency reporting to the Minister for Health or to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment would command more respect and credibility internationally than the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, whose reputation has been badly tarnished by a succession of regrettable scandals.</P>
    <P>New arrangements of the type I have outlined here, though urgent, would take some little time to put in place.  In the meantime there are more immediate questions facing the Minister to which he should address himself.  First there is the question of bonemeal.  In 1990 the feeding of animal-based bonemeal to cattle was banned because of the fear that this was the route through which the BSE agent was transmitted from sheep to cattle.  Since then, I understand the practice of feeding bonemeal to pigs and poultry has continued.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should assure consumers that this poses no threat to human health and that the meat products involved are safe to eat. Is it wise to allow bonemeal to be fed to any animal which will be consumed by humans?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of Border security.  Consumers of Irish beef, at home and abroad, must be assured that the product they are eating comes from disease-free herds.  We are in the somewhat unfortunate position of being the only European country sharing a land frontier with the United Kingdom. While Northern Ireland appears to have a relatively low incidence of BSE, Irish <Col N="918" /> Border security is essential to prevent infected herds from Great Britain being brought into this State via the North.  If we are not vigilant in this area, we could allow a few unscrupulous people to smuggle in infected cattle, destroying the positive image of the entire beef industry in the process.  It is suggested that this may have already happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also take action in the area of food labelling.  Customers are entitled to know what they are eating but the complexity and technological advancement of the modern food processing industry means that this is not always the case.  It should be possible, without imposing huge cost burdens on manufacturers, to devise a clear and simple labelling system so that people know what types of meat were included as ingredients in particular products.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the great marketing opportunity which has now presented itself to the Irish beef industry.  The magnitude of that opportunity should not be under-estimated.  Britain exports over 190,000 tonnes of beef every year to continental European markets and this trade is worth almost £500 million sterling.  The British product now faces an indefinite ban from these markets and even if the ban was lifted, consumers would be slow to return to the British product if a better alternative was available.  There is no reason Irish exporters should not be able to fill the gap left by their British counterparts. We already sell almost 160,000 tonnes of beef into continental markets and now have considerable scope to increase that.</P>
    <P>Britain's main markets in Europe are ones where Irish beef exporters have already established a solid presence.  For example, the British sell about 85,000 tonnes per year to France, 42,000 tonnes per year to Italy and 17,000 tonnes per year to the Netherlands.  Irish exporters have good links with supermarket chains and wholesalers in all those countries. In Italy, CBF, the forerunner of the present Bord Bia, made major strides in promoting the image of the <Col N="919" /> Irish product, and Irish beef is the only beef identified on a country-of-origin basis in Italian supermarkets.</P>
    <P>An even bigger opportunity will open in Britain itself.  This is already Ireland's biggest export market, taking over 100,000 tonnes of product every year. With the British industry in disarray, Irish processors now have a chance to capitalise on the disease-free status of the Irish herd and move in to fill the gap.  Market dynamics are working in their favour.  In the British market the trend is for butchery to move back up the line from the retailer towards the processor.  Supermarkets want the product to be delivered direct to their outlets in ready-for-sale form, or nearly ready for sale.  This provides processors with new opportunities for adding value and could lead to a substantial increase in employment in the processing industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Irish exporters have fared best on export markets where retailer power is strong, particularly in Britain.  This trade has been built on developing long-term relationships with major customers such as Tesco, Sainsbury and other supermarket chains.  The development of this type of stable, high quality trade in added-value product is in the long-term interest of the Irish beef industry.  For one thing, it would help to reduce our dependence on the volatile third country trade.  This trade, in both live animals and carcase beef, is conducted mainly with middle eastern and north African countries and is highly artificial, being driven by export refunds &mdash; without these subsidies from Brussels it simply would not exist.  For instance, the average cash price of each live animal sold to Egypt last year was only just over £300.</P>
    <P>The disappearance of intervention over the last few years has given the impression that we now have a truly market-driven beef industry but this is not the case.  The beef industry might be export-oriented but it is not market-oriented. It is important that we avoid <Col N="920" /> deluding ourselves into believing otherwise. Intervention has been largely replaced by the subsidised export of live and carcase beef to the Middle East. This trade is very volatile, low in added value, and involves no long-term relationships with retail customers.  The third country trade, both live and carcase, represents a convenient mechanism by which the bureaucrats in Brussels can flush Ireland's seasonal surplus out of the European beef market every autumn.</P>
    <P>The future of this trade is not secure. The Common Agriculture Policy will come up for review at the end of the decade.  With enlargement of the European Union imminent, the costs of maintaining the CAP as it stands at present may prove prohibitive for the taxpayers of Germany, who pick up most of the tab.  The cost of extending the benefits of the present CAP to the five aspirant member states &mdash; the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia &mdash; is estimated at £10 billion per year.  This bill may prove too high for the Germans and if it does, something has to give.  We will probably see a complete overhaul of the CAP and major movement in the direction of a free market in food.  We will not see entirely free trade but we are likely to see the dismantling of some of the more expensive subsidy programmes.  The general world trend towards free trade will also nudge Europe in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Irish beef industry as structured at present would be singularly ill-equipped to cope with the challenges posed by a substantial reduction in or withdrawal of export refunds.  Last year, about 50 per cent of total beef cattle disposals for export, including both live trade and carcase, went down the subsidised third country route.  We must reduce our dependence on this artificial market and concentrate instead on the development of real commercial markets in Britain and continental Europe. Otherwise, we will have failed completely to capitalise on the opportunity presented by our original entry to the Common Market 25 years ago.  We will <Col N="921" /> go into the next millennium with a beef industry that still has a fatal weakness in marketing terms, apart from its image problems and the failures of its supervision.</P>
    <P>We should be willing to confront this issue now and recognise that, in the context of GATT and CAP reform, the long-term prosperity of the Irish beef industry will ultimately depend on its ability to sell into commercial markets on the basis of price and quality, and without subsidies.  Farmers, therefore, have a strong vested interest in ensuring that we develop a market-driven beef industry and they must recognise that, in our current heavy reliance on third country markets, we might be storing up trouble for ourselves down the road. The clear strategic objective of the Irish beef industry should be to achieve maximum penetration of the British and European markets, aiming as far as possible to sell added-value products through stable trading relationships with the main supermarket chains.</P>
    <P>Ireland produces about 500,000 tonnes of beef per year in excess of the requirements of the domestic market.  We must not continue to view this as a surplus to be flushed out of the system by whatever means possible but as a valuable resource from which the national economy should seek to derive maximum benefit.  There has been no shortage of reports, committees and expert groups over the last ten years stressing the need for a market-oriented approach to the development of the beef industry.  Thanks to the latest BSE disaster in Britain, we now have a tremendous opportunity to put all that theory into practice.  An Bord Bia must convince consumers, retailers and wholesalers in our major British and European markets that Irish beef is clean and wholesome, a product that is safe to eat.</P>
    <P>Consumers should be involved in this process.  For that reason, when the An Bord Bia Act was going through the House, the Progressive Democrats proposed that a person should be appointed <Col N="922" /> to the board to represent consumers' views.  We suggested that such a move would strengthen the focus of the board and assist it to market effectively. Unfortunately, the amendment was not accepted by the then Government, even though I heard some of its representatives refer today to the appropriateness of such a provision.</P>
    <P>If An Bord Bia succeeds in marketing Irish beef effectively on this basis it will have more than justified its existence. The country will reap the reward in increased exports to high quality, high value markets.  If it fails to do so, it will be due in no small part to our failure to put in place satisfactory arrangements for the policing of the beef industry that would command the confidence of consumers across Europe.</P>
    <P>Last week when this matter of national importance was debated in the Seanad neither the Minister, Deputy Yates, nor the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, was available.  I impress on the Minister the importance of treating this issue with somewhat more urgency from now on and of realising that it is of fundamental concern from the point of view of public health and the future welfare of beef producers and processors and their employees.</P>
    <P>The problem will not go away.  It is pointless to hope that public concerns can be assuaged by expert veterinary or medical opinion.  The widely advertised elimination of British beef from McDonalds and Burger King will have serious consequences for all of us if it causes a lack of confidence in beef and a fear on the part of consumers &mdash; irrespective of whether it is justified &mdash; that they stand in danger.</P>

      <P>The beef industry and the food industry more widely are essential parts of the Irish economy. They are a source of employment on farms and in processing plants.  They are also a key part of our exporting economy and the products of our food industry have a very high international standing. The industry has secured very substantial support from the Irish taxpayer over the years.  It is therefore central to the success of the food industry and of our economy that the customer is satisfied, whether the customer is at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>The very basis for the success of the Irish beef and food industry generally is consumer confidence.  Respecting consumers and retaining their faith and trust must be fundamental among the concerns of Government and industry. The consumer is not a passive entity at the end of a chain.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; hardly captures the essence of the inter-dependent cyclical relationship which exists between producer and consumer. Today's consumer is a discerning one. Consumers have rights.  Our home consumers are also citizens and taxpayers and while our international consumers may not be our citizens they also place a trust in us as regulators and Government. We are all consumers.  It is the business of Government to act in the public interest and, in an industry like food, the public interest and the consumer interest are one and the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am totally committed, as Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs, to ensuring that the consumer interest is recognised at industry and Government level.  The Consumers' Association of Ireland has highlighted this important dimension in recent days.  Essentially it has advanced two central arguments: the need for a separation between producers and the regulatory-promotional agency for the food industry; and the <Col N="924" /> need for a distinctly consumer representation on An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>There is merit in both those arguments apart entirely from the context in which they have been advocated by the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  I have never been slow in impressing upon and reminding my colleagues in Government of the need to measure the effects of all Government policies on consumers and to ensure that in framing such policies the interests of consumers are adequately taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is important in offering reassurance to consumers on the safety of Irish beef to refer to the range of existing measures which provide extensive protections. There is no information available to me as Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs to suggest other than that consumers can have full confidence in Irish beef.</P>
    <P>While not applying exclusively to beef or meat products, the accompanying labels on all prepacked goods must give the name of the food, the list of ingredients, the net quantity by number, weight or volume, the date of minimum durability or &ldquo;use-by&rdquo; date, any special storage instructions, name and address of packer, manufacturer etc., country of origin, but only if its absence is likely to mislead consumers, instructions for use, where necessary; and indication of irradiation or treatment with ionising radiation.</P>
    <P>These requirements are stipulated in a number of food labelling regulations which are enforced with constancy and rigour by the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I am happy to tell the House that the director's work has not revealed or disclosed any breaches or violations of the regulations in the case of Irish beef.  Labelling is an important measure to enable the consumer to make an informed choice with certainty and confidence.</P>
    <P>As a further safeguard, the Consumer Information Act, 1978, combined with the Misleading Advertising Regulations of 1988, makes it an offence to advertise or indicate a product, including beef, as being of Irish origin when in fact it is <Col N="925" /> not.  The Director of Consumer Affairs is also very active in enforcing and policing this legislation.</P>
    <P>Protections do not end here.  In 1991 the Houses of the Oireachtas passed into law Directive No. 85/374 of the European Economic Community.  The Liability for Defective Products Act, 1991, entered into force in December of that year.  The Act, which represented a significant milestone in the advancement of consumer rights, introduced into Irish law the remedy of damages for negligence based on the principle of strict or no-fault liability.  The legislation imposes liability on a producer for damages caused wholly or partly by a defect in his or her product irrespective of whether the producer was negligent. Damage as defined in the Act relates to personal injury and damage to personal property.  The Product Liability Act supplements in a very substantial way the existing remedies available under civil law on product liability in tort and contract law.  In tort where damage is caused to a person because of a defective product the manufacturer or supplier can be sued for negligence, but negligence must be proven.  Thus, under tort the burden of proof resided with the consumer.</P>
    <P>In contract law, as enshrined in the Sale of Goods and Services Act, 1980, there are two main implied conditions in every sales contract.  The goods or product must be of merchantable quality and must be reasonably fit for the purposes for which they are intended.</P>
    <P>Under the Product Liability Act the plaintiff is required only to prove that the damage caused is the result of a faulty or defective product.  These protections apply not only to finished products but also to the producers of raw materials used in the manufacture of or incorporated in the finished products. Thus, producers of beef products which have undergone any form of initial processing would leave themselves open to challenge, without limitation as regards liability, if defects in their products result in damage or personal injury to consumers.  The same structures apply <Col N="926" /> for other finished products incorporating beef by-products or extracts.</P>

      <P>This debate on the recent BSE controversy is necessary and important if we are to alleviate consumer concerns and minimise the potential impact on our cattle and beef exports which were valued at approximately £1.7 billion last year.</P>
      <P>Last week's announcement by the House of Commons has given rise to much comment, some of it hysterical, which must be looked at in context.  The scientific evidence and information have been examined by independent scientists from the 15 member states who have concluded that there is no evidence of a direct link between BSE disease in animals and CJD in humans. However, to allay the concerns which have arisen and to allow further time to study the information, the Scientific and Veterinary Committee recommended that certain measures should be adopted in the short-term.  The Standing Veterinary Committee subsequently voted 14 to one to ban the export of UK live animals, beef and veal products, including products used in veterinary medicinal products, pharmaceuticals, etc.  These measures are necessary if the problem is to be confined to the UK and consumer confidence in beef and beef products is to be restored.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the differences between the situation in Ireland and the UK and gave details of the measures in place to deal with BSE, including the steps taken in recent days to prevent smuggling along the Border.  These measures will ensure the restoration of consumer confidence in the beef industry. The Department, with An Bord Bia, will carry out an intensive promotional campaign in the coming weeks to ensure that consumer confidence in beef is restored.  This campaign will be carried out not only in Ireland but in our foreign markets.  The Minister and I will devote all our energies to the restoration of this confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> Deputy Cowen referred to the need for a co-ordinated approach to the problem. There has been a co-ordinated approach to this problem since it arose six days ago and continuous meetings have taken place with the trade and An Bord Bia and between the trade and An Bord Bia.  They have also been working with the Departments of Health, Foreign Affairs and Justice and there has been considerable interaction between the various Departments.  It is important to realise that there are different problems in the various markets and we must adopt different strategies and give the necessary assurances.  Subcommittees have been set up to consider the different aspects of the problem and the approaches which need to be taken.  I stress the importance of the Standing Veterinary Committee's meeting yesterday.</P>
    <P>We have set clear goals for ourselves in dealing with this problem.  To protect our market we must reassure consumers. Much information has already been given out by An Bord Bia while spokespersons for the industry and Departments have assured consumers that they can have every confidence in Irish beef.  We must also secure our markets in Europe.  This is being done and special trade promotions will follow, including back-up by the Minister and me in the coming weeks.  We must also defend our position in third countries. Action is being taken at present in countries where there are problems, and the Minister outlined the initiatives he has taken in relation to Iran.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out to Deputy O'Malley that there is no such thing as a BSE infected herd and no scientific or veterinary organisation has recommended that herds should be depopulated.  We decided to introduce this policy of our own volition and it was the right one at the time.  The extension of this policy by the Minister will strengthen our position at home and abroad.  Work on the regulations on animal remedies is well advanced and should be finalised in the coming weeks.  Deputy O'Malley <Col N="928" /> referred to feed products for species other than cattle.  Meat and bonemeal are permitted for species other than cattle and the scientific view is that these present no risk.  Nevertheless, the issue is being kept under ongoing review and if there is any threat to the poultry or pig industries action will be taken. There is no scientific evidence available to justify taking action at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the irregularities by a senior veterinary inspector in the Department.  The Minister expressed his outrage at the action taken by this officer and I support his view.  This man was in a position of responsibility and should not have taken this action.  I assure the House that all the appropriate judicial and disciplinary action will be taken in this and any other cases uncovered.  We are unable to give details of the case at this stage at it might prejudice the outcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy O'Malley about our dependence on export refunds.  We tend to hold whatever surplus Europe has and are very dependent on refunds. However, we need to reduce this dependence and build up a presence in the valuable retail outlets in the European consumer market.  This is a slow process but progress is being made.  As Deputy O'Malley correctly stated, the problems in the English market present us with a great opportunity to win a greater share of the £600 million European market. However, to do this we will have to convince our markets that we have a credible product which we can stand over. Virtually all the major beef processors have a strong focus on European markets and, with An Bord Bia, are devoting much time and effort in trying to cultivate the multiple retail outlets and develop these niche markets.</P>
    <P>This debate is very important in terms of reassuring consumers that we can stand over the Irish beef product.  The message we should send out to the home and foreign markets is that we can stand over the quality and credibility of Irish beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Tom Kitt.  I am frightened for our beef industry.  This is not just a question of beef but of the livelihood and culture of a whole rural community. There has been a shock reaction to the British announcement last week but we have heard little from our Government. What Government Ministers from city areas said did not reassure people.  It is unacceptable that neither the Minister nor Minister of State attended the Seanad last week to hear the initial reaction.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we read in the newspapers that the Taoiseach was thinking of making a telephone call to Mr. Mubarak and that the Cabinet would discuss the beef crisis this morning.  If the Government does not have the money for a phone call the Opposition will provide it.  What is happening is a far cry from the action taken by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, in travelling to Libya to secure a market for our beef.</P>
      <P>A fax from Dubai this evening reveals that Irish cattle may be banned there. The Minister should use his political influence to ensure that consumer confidence is not further damaged by the refusal of more countries to accept Irish beef because they do not know the difference between it and English beef. There is no reason the Minister should not fly immediately to Egypt, Jordan and the Arab Emirates to give those countries his personal assurance that our beef is safe.  If the Minister can get the Government jet from the Tánaiste for a while, he should use it because if other countries see that the countries I mentioned are accepting Irish beef they will realise it is safe and is distinct from British beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has the full support of this side of the House in dealing with what is potentially the greatest crisis in Irish agriculture.  The industry is still reeling from the effects of a long hard winter and there is a state of absolute depression among farmers.  At marts last Friday not 25 per cent of the usual number of cattle was for sale; farmers knew they would not get a good price <Col N="930" /> because of the reaction to the BSE revelations. Carriage and haulage contracts have been cancelled.  All those involved, including consumers, are worried and need reassurance from all Ministers that Irish beef is clean, good and fit to be eaten.  If that is not done the effect on the rural population, workers in meat factories, butchers and staff in butchers' shops will be devastating in a short time.</P>
    <P>The banks are never exactly liberal in time of crises and tend to close shop.  I hope the Minister will encourage his colleagues in Government, particularly those who come from the cities, to reassure people that our beef is fit for human consumption.  There is a need for urgent action.  A campaign should be started immediately.  People with an international reputation should go on radio and television, take part in promotions outside the country and link their names with the good name of Irish beef.  If we nip this crisis in the bud and advertise the distinction between British and Irish beef we can overcome the problem.  The already depressed meat market will be further hit if immediate action is not taken.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of the Minister taking action as should the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am not referring to officials who do their job.  Political relationships that have built up over the years should be used as there is nobody in this country who will not be affected if we take the same tumble that the English are taking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most unhappy with the way this matter is being dealt with. We have heard the views of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other Ministers, but I am not convinced that this issue is being dealt with as it should be, as a public health issue.  The Minister for Health has not participated in this debate.  The Government is failing on two fronts, on the health front, and on getting the message across about the safety of Irish beef.  The news from Dubai indicates that our diplomats are not doing their job in promoting the quality of Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> Now that the ban on British beef has been reaffirmed by the EU veterinary committee, another related matter must be addressed, that is, the question of beef-based gelatine sourced in the UK. Will the Government seek the removal from the supermarket shelves of products such as confectionery and medicinal products that contain beef-based gelatine sourced in the UK.  When we talk about beef-based gelatine we are talking about a product that is used in Easter eggs, wine gums, vitamin capsules and so on.  We are talking about products that have serious implications for the health of consumers young and old. Which Minister is responsible for this?</P>
    <P>Will the Government ensure there is proper labelling of food products to clarify beyond doubt the source of products, and even get into the area of quality control on farms or at factory level? Will the relevant Minister confirm that this will be dealt with on a national basis and that the Minister involved will not use the argument used by the British Government, that the question of labelling is an EU responsibility?  That is a most irresponsible attitude and it amounts to hiding behind EU bureaucracy. Will the relevant Minister reassure this House that the Government will introduce a strict labelling system for our food products that will allay the fears of consumers?</P>
    <P>This debate presents a challenge and opportunities.  The challenge is to finally face up to the concerns of consumers.  I do not need to repeat what my colleagues said about how a Fianna Fáil Government dealt with similar problems in the past.  We can stand over what was done.  The Minister responsible should respond to the challenge he faces on consumers' rights and take the opportunity to advertise Irish beef abroad as a good product.  He should use every diplomatic channel possible. That is not being done if we are hearing worrying messages from countries like Dubai where there is utter confusion about the Irish and British beef markets.</P>

The Department of Health has been in contact with my Department since last Wednesday and has co-ordinated a panel of people with technical expertise to be available to the media to give reassurance in terms of the safety of Irish food, particularly Irish beef.

      <P>The disease has been caused by feeding animals with imported meat and bonemeal or by imported cattle.  Meat and bonemeal is no longer fed to bovines but I understand it is being fed to pigs and chickens. Are pigs and chickens not susceptible to this disease?  Has research been carried out that shows they are not, and if not, does the Minister intend to prohibit feeding those animals meat and bonemeal products?</P>

      <P>In all cases we will adhere strictly to the EU scientific veterinary regulations and advice and in many cases we have surpassed them.  Meat and bonemeal is permitted in feeds for species other than ruminants.  The scientific view is that this presents no risk to those species.  Individual tests have been carried out using very strong dosages on pigmeat in particular and my understanding is that this does not pose a risk.</P>

      <P>I have an open mind on the question of specified offal.  I understand in recent days, Britain has tightened its own procedures in this regard.  It is important that we do not react in a knee jerk manner. If the EU veterinary and scientific committee recommend either the extension of the specified offal ban beyond the spinal cord and brain tissue and so on or the extension of the species ban based on new scientific evidence, then we will be happy to implement it.  As of now all the scientific evidence is that this poses no risk to pigmeat and poultry meat.</P>

      <P>Am I correct in suggesting that a marketing campaign to communicate the high health status of Irish beef in the European and Asean countries into which Irish beef is sold would run to hundreds of millions of pounds?  Is it not time to establish in the Department a strategy to deal with the recurring series of food scares?</P>
      <P>What is the herd slaughter policy in the case of an animal sold from a herd in the 12 months or less prior to the diagnosis of BSE in that herd?  Is it planned to follow the animal to its new destination, pick it out and slaughter it or will the Minister authorise the full slaughter of the herd into which the animal was sold or the number of herds through which the animal has passed since it left the herd where BSE occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that a very effective marketing, advertising and promotion campaign in Europe would cost tens of millions of pounds?  The advertising campaigns we are running in Europe as I speak cost in the order of £250,000 each day.  I advised An Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board which is involved in this, that I am prepared to give it the extra resources necessary to reassure the general public in our key European markets.  The Deputy is correct in saying this is an extremely costly exercise.  We will follow up this campaign by meeting the key buyers.  A strategy has been finalised and itineraries drawn up whereby there will be a ministerial and diplomatic trade presence to meet the key buyers in our important European markets, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Germany and Sweden in particular and that is separate from the campaign in the non-EU states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised the issue of food scares.  I agree this is a constant feature of the high level of consumer and media interest in all elements of food safety and there will have to be an ongoing plan to deal with these issues.  I raised this matter in the Council of Ministers <Col N="935" /> in Brussels and sought the establishment of a promotional fund for red meat and a panel of experts to be available. In Ireland, in conjunction with the Department of Health medical personnel and my Department's veterinary officials, we have a panel of people available on demand for radio and television to try to answer the public's queries.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked what would happen when it became know that the herd from which an animal had been sold subsequently had a case of BSE.  BSE is a disease of animals, not herds.  Animals can exist side by side for many years, eating and bedding down together and there is not a scintilla of a suggestion in any body of veterinary science that the disease is laterally transmissible.  The origins of the disease go back to the consumption of infected meat and bonemeal product.  It would be a waste of resources and time to try to extend beyond clincial surveillance for the symptoms of BSE and subsequent testing and kill out of those animals.  That is the best way to track down disease.  It would be wasteful and irrelevant in terms of assurances for food safety to pursue a policy of what would be fairly indiscriminate culling of healthy animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told me in reply to a question I tabled on 30 January that the Department had at that time paid out a sum of approximately £11.5 million to herd owners for herds that were, to use the trade cliché, depopulated, which means killed. According to official figures only 124 cattle were found to have BSE. However, other animals identified as not directly affected in those herds were put back into the food chain, released for human consumption and processed by the factories involved.  Given that the Department paid for those 7,000 or 8,000 cattle, did it recover that money in full from the factories or did the factories benefit from it?  If the money has not been recovered in full, will the Minister <Col N="936" /> take steps to do so?  Will he confirm that cattle not identified as suffering from the disease will be destroyed and disposed of in the same way as those identified as suffering from it?  Public confidence will be eroded if the majority of animals in an herd that is slaughtered are put back into the food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The depopulation policy has been in place since 1989 and it has served us well.  It is important to explain the rationale behind it.  For export certification purposes we guarantee that our herds are BSE free.  We can give that assurance because we extinguished the herds within which BSE was found. Therefore, the value of the policy is not that we took animals at risk in depopulated herds out of the food chain, but that herds are free of BSE.  That is the important distinction.  In January the matter became a cause of public concern. I said we would extend the skull tests to any elderly cows in herds affected.  This matter is about perception being more important than reality. Over the weekend I decided to go further and ensure that such animals will be taken out of the food chain and the entire herd will be denatured.</P>
      <P>Some 16,485 cattle have been slaughtered under the depopulation policy since 1989 at a cost of £11.569 million. Many of these were young animals including calves, weanlings and so on. The meat factories paid the salvage value of them.  I understand that meat did not end up in the food chain in Ireland.  The salvage value paid by the factories since 1989 is some £3.6 million.</P>

      <P>The results of skull tests carried out on animals at risk showed that they were free of BSE.  I do not have any evidence to suggest that the meat from those depopulated herds was in any way infected.  The reason we are taking matters further is not science but to give greater reassurance.  In a consumer society matters can be explained only in a sound bite and, therefore, depopulation is being explained now in the context of extracting herds entirely from the food chain.  In my view, there was and is no risk from that meat.</P>

      <P>I wish to put two questions to the Minister that I raised in my brief contribution.  In light of the current situation, will he ensure that confectionery and medicine products, containing beef-based gelatine sourced in the UK, are removed from supermarket shelves? I remind the Minister that British beef derivatives are used in Easter eggs, wine gums and vitamin capsules.  Will the Government address the labelling issue on a national basis and ensure food products are properly labelled to clarify beyond doubt the source of a product and quality of control on farms and in factories?  I remind the Minister that the British in addressing this problem have hidden behind the EU.  They claim it is an EU problem that should be dealt with at that level.  Will the Minister reassure Members and allay the fears of consumers that the Government will properly address the issue of labelling now to ensure that consumers will know precisely what they are buying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a level of confusion about a wide range of products allegedly infected or contaminated that, to some extent, a stable argument no longer surrounds the issue.  We should not contribute to the confusion <Col N="938" /> by suggesting that a number of products, which have an extremely tenuous link with the beef industry, should be regarded as suspicious.  That is my personal observation.</P>
      <P>Legislation on labelling is clear.  The legal and statutory requirement for labelling necessitates the name of the food, the list of ingredients, the net quantity by number, weight or volume, the date of minimum durability or &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date, any special storage instructions, name and address of packer or manufacturer, county of origin only if its absence is likely to mislead consumers, instructions for use where necessary and indication of irradiation or treatment with ionising radiation.  I am sure my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Rabbitte, will be pleased to review that legislation and expand on its detail.</P>

Products imported before the ban are legal, but I understand those in the trade, principally fast food outlets, supermarkets and retail chains, have already taken their <i>de facto</i> decisions from a marketing position, and the Deputy will be aware of their announcements.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that in general we have been to the forefront in handling this matter for the past number of years.  The quality of Irish beef is recognised internationally as of the very highest order.  It is particularly important to give every assurance in that regard.  As the Minister stated, there is a great deal of difficulty with people's perceptions and it is important that the Government acts swiftly and decisively.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that the Minister of State at the Department of Health made the sole contribution in relation to public health.  He stated that his Department was fully satisfied that the controls operated in Ireland are satisfactory to meet the consumers' concerns.  Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry request a more definitive statement from the Minister for Health in this regard as it is disappointing he did not provide reassurance?  Members may be aware of the scientific facts and the way in which the authorities are dealing with this situation, but it is particularly important that the Minister for Health provide direct and immediate reassurance to consumers.</P>

      <P>I am not certain regarding the matter to which Deputy Woods alluded.  I do not believe there is any ambiguity about the comments of Deputy O'Shea, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, who stated that no evidence has emerged which suggests any unusual developments in the pattern of CJD in Ireland.  The Minister of State referred to statements made by the chief medical officer and stated there is no proven scientific link between CJD and BSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all stages of this matter, the Department of Health has been very closely involved in seeking a solution.  It must be remembered that the Food Safety Advisory Board reports to the <Col N="940" /> Minister for Health.  Staff from neurology departments in hospitals and other doctors have appeared on media and radio programmes and forcefully defended the food safety of Irish beef. People should not believe their is any ambiguity about the messages emanating from our health authorities.</P>

      <P>What plans are in place to nationally brand Irish beef for export?  If the Minister is not receiving the necessary co-operation from the organisations involved, does he have the statutory right to enforce a brand image on Irish beef?  Members are aware that Irish beef is being sold in 80 foreign countries, some of whom sell it as their native beef.  Our national herd is under continuous threat from the importation of live animals.  The roll-on/roll-off ferry system means that there is no mechanism in place to protect our herd.  Will <Col N="941" /> the Minister seek a derogation from the European Union to prohibit the import of all livestock?  One such importation in the past brought this scourge upon our cattle herd and the economy.  It is vitally important to establish safeguards to protect the national herd.  Ireland has the best derogation possible in that it is surrounded by water which makes it practically impossible to import livestock without permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is ongoing dialogue between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and DANI in relation to closer liaison between the veterinary and agricultural authorities, North and South.  In many cases my Department has received windfall gains from Brussels which DANI has not. However, the incidence of BSE in Northern Ireland is 40 times greater than that in the Republic.  I would not favour a situation of harmonisation when DANI has access to animal movements from the UK to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>While Ireland will always comply with EU harmonisation, I wish to make it clear that &mdash; in association with the Garda, army and customs authorities &mdash; we are upgrading surveillance of suspicious movement of animals.  A total of 70 animals with Northern Ireland identification markings were discovered in Counties Donegal and Louth.  I wish to inform the rogues who smuggled those animals into the Republic that they will be destroyed at a loss to the owners, who cannot be traced.  We will not permit the reputation of our beef industry and the high quality of animal health in Ireland to be jeopardised in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to branding, it is illegal to nationally brand Irish beef at present. The Deputy is aware that there is a &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark containing a shamrock which identifies quality assurance in relation to pigmeat and beef and denotes traceability, infra-testing, no residues, etc. We are considering an extension of that system because consumers throughout Europe will demand greater country of <Col N="942" /> origin and traceability requirements in the future.</P>
    <P>Different strategies will be invoked to deal with individual markets.  The multiples in Britain have a major grip on the market and it is unthinkable they will abandon British beef.  Therefore, we will work in conjunction with them.  We cannot work any other way than with the trade.  The British multiples will obviously be supportive of the indigenous situation.  In other countries such as Germany and Sweden it will be the norm that there will be branding by virtue of country of origin.  In France there is effectively a trade ban by the French trade which prevents any other meat from entering the country.  This quite nationalistic attitude is not helpful. Different strategic approaches are necessary for different markets.  For example, trade buyers from Sweden were involved in discussions with senior officials from my Department this afternoon. A tailor-made strategy is being put in place for individual markets which will be aggressively pursued by myself, the Department and An Bord Bia.</P>

      <P>On Deputy Cowen's questions, I am acutely aware of the difficulties with regard to live shipments to Egypt and Libya.  We have reached a satisfactory solution in Libya where boats can be unloaded.  In Egypt the importers are sympathetic and anxious to facilitate the unloading of cattle, but neither the technical officials nor the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry have made a statement in that regard.  President Mubarak made a presidential decree stating that all European beef and dairy produce was to be banned, despite the fact that the Scientific Veterinary Committee in the UK and Europe specifically stated there is no threat to dairy produce.  In a public declaration, he said he does not eat red meat and encouraged his people not to eat it.  I and my Department have been constantly updated on the position in Port Alexandria through the diplomatic services in Cairo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon I spoke to the <Col N="944" /> exporter referred to by the Deputy.  It is intended that there will be the earliest possible contact at the highest level.

      <P>On the Deputy's question about the senior veterinary officer.  I pay tribute to the officers of my Department and the Garda, as a result of whose involvement in extremely elaborate investigations, this matter was brought to light.  Were it not for their efforts the subsequent possible criminal and certainly disciplinary proceedings, which I do not wish to prejudice, could not take place. I am satisfied that false certification of what are effectively young calves going to Europe, which in no way affects our Third Country export market, has been stopped.  We will certainly deal ruthlessly with any such activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary duty of any democracy is to provide effective structures to preserve and protect the fabric of society.  It is our duty to ensure that sensible and necessary laws are enacted and enforced.  That requires a vigilant Legislature, an efficient policy force and an adequate court system.</P>
      <P>Our system of constitutional justice requires, by virtue of Article 40.3.1 of the Constitution, that the State guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen. Our task as a Legislature is to enact laws which protect the rights of the citizen and at the same time discharge our constitutional duty under Article 40.3.2 to vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.  The performance of these obligations requires that a balance be set between the rights of the accused on the one hand and the rights of the victim on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past I referred to my belief that the growing body of jurisprudence which deals with the rights of accused persons has all but eclipsed the rights of victims.  That is most obvious in the delays that exist in the trial of serious criminal offences and the cumbersome statutory procedures which contributes substantially to those delays.  The delay in our court system has become <Col N="946" /> endemic.  On 21 February this year the Minister for Justice informed the House in a written answer that 19 murder cases, two attempted murder cases, 47 rape cases and two cases of aggravated sexual assault were awaiting trial before the Central Criminal Court.  Last Thursday, 21 March, each of the people charged with those serious offences appeared before the Central Criminal Court in order to have dates fixed for the next court sessions.  Of the 70 cases on the list, it was not possible to provide a trial date in respect of 49.  A further eight cases had only a provisional date fixed, and a large proportion of those will not be heard on the fixed date.</P>
    <P>The allocation of two High Court judges to the Central Criminal Court is wholly inadequate.  Complexities in the law and developments in the area of forensic science have resulted in many Central Criminal Court cases taking protracted periods of time.  In the last legal term one murder case lasted for 44 days and in this term a case has exceeded that length, and is continuing. Delays in the Central Criminal Court are so well established that even if both of the new High Court judges to be appointed under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, were to be assigned to the Central Criminal Court it would take more than a year to clear existing cases.  As matters stand the delay between return for trial and trial may be two years.  This is unacceptable to victims, their families and to society because it comes on top of protracted delays caused by cumbersome and unnecessary procedures at the pre-trial stage.</P>
    <P>The combined results of the listing and procedural delays are that a person arrested and charged with murder or rape today, if released on bail, is highly unlikely to be tried for that crime before 1999.  The maxim &ldquo;Justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo; is as true today as when first spoken.  Delays of the magnitude being experienced are unacceptable as they result in people being able to get away with murder for years before being dealt with by the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> This House has an obligation to introduce laws and to provide sufficient judges and courts to vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.  This Bill which I present to the House on behalf of Fianna Fáil is such a measure.  It is directed at reforming the preliminary and preparatory stages of indictable crime.  These are governed at present by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  The scheme of criminal procedure as envisaged by that Act and operated at present is wasteful of resources and gives rise to substantial delays, which is recognised by everybody involved.</P>
    <P>Speaking to this House on 11 May last &mdash; Official Report, col. 1568 &mdash; the Minister for Justice stated:</P>
    <P>I am concerned at some of the present procedural arrangements for dealing with criminal cases and, in particular, the amount of Garda time which is spent unproductively in court.  Preparation of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will address this problem is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of outdated procedures and practices which come to light as requiring change.  I have arranged for a list of these to be prepared on an ongoing basis with a view to introducing a new Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill each year.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, to say the least, that over ten months after the Minister announced the preparation of legislation to be at &ldquo;an advanced stage&rdquo; no legislation has been produced.  It is equally regrettable that having identified a need for an annual criminal law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill she has let 1995 come and go without introducing one.  Presumably by now the required legislation has progressed from being advanced to &ldquo;very advanced&rdquo;.  If this is the case then no doubt after the passage of a further ten months the Minister will describe it as being &ldquo;nearing completion&rdquo; and thereafter at ten <Col N="948" /> monthly intervals it will progress from being &ldquo;virtually complete&rdquo; to being &ldquo;imminent&rdquo;.  The Minister has a thesaurus of excuses.  Nobody has ever applied so many adjectives in an attempt to disguise inactivity.</P>
    <P>The standard course of criminal justice legislation through this House over the last 15 months has been for Fianna Fáil to publish a Bill and within three weeks the Minister comes, scissors in hand and with a bucket dripping with paste, to announce that she is to introduce a thinly disguised version of that Bill as her own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil published this Bill last year.  Regrettably, despite the legislation being at an advanced stage, the Minister has failed to respond.  Members who wish to reduce court delays are thus left with one option &mdash; to support this Bill.</P>
      <P>The present course of a person accused of an indictable offence through the courts is tortuous and slow.  Swift and effective justice is needed as a deterrent.  Our present system is slow and tends to defeat the interests of justice. On arrest a person is brought before the court and remanded.  On the first remand he will be placed on election and the issue of whether the offence is minor and fit to be tried summarily may be dealt with.  Frequently, the case will again be remanded for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Thereafter, it will become necessary to prepare a book of evidence. It is unusual for the book of evidence to be available on the date initially fixed and at least one further remand is generally needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the book of evidence is served it is necessary to again adjourn the case to enable the accused and his legal advisers to consider its contents.  Thereafter, either side may as of right require <Col N="949" /> one or all of the witnesses to give evidence on deposition.  This is a mind numbing statutory procedure whereby a witness gives oral evidence and it is reduced to writing in longhand by a District Court clerk.  The entire Dickensian charade is presided over by a District Court judge.  It is important to note that the right to have depositions taken is statutory; there is no constitutional imperative for having such a system.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the depositions being taken the case is frequently remanded for legal submissions to be made.  In the vast majority of cases no submissions are made and only a handful of cases are dismissed by a judge at the conclusion of the preliminary examination. The entire procedure can stretch over eight or ten separate court appearances. The prosecuting Garda is obliged to attend and wait, sometimes for hours, on each occasion.</P>
    <P>It is a procedure which has no place in the late 20th century and we propose its abolition.  In its place this Bill requires that, not later than the second appearance of an accused before the court, the judge must conduct an examination as to whether the case will be dealt with ultimately on indictment or by summary hearing.  There is no point in endlessly adjourning a case before the District Court.  Cases which will be dealt with ultimately on indictment must immediately be sent forward to the court of trial.  This provision will remove at least half a dozen expensive remands and cut over six months off the length of time it takes for a trial to begin.</P>
    <P>Within 14 days of being returned for trial the case must be listed for mention before the court of trial, whether that is the Central Criminal Court or the Circuit Court.  On that day or within one month of that day the book of evidence must be served.  This will require an efficient and speedy response by the DPP and his staff.  It may require on occasions that complex books of evidence will be prepared by counsel rather than State solicitors who already have a substantial workload.  The cost <Col N="950" /> savings involved in operating the District Court in the manner envisaged by this Bill are enormous and will more than pay for any increased expenditure required to ensure proper expedition.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to prevent pre-trial delays.  Section 6 (4) of the Bill limits the late service of evidence on the defence.  A notice of additional evidence, which, if served late, can frequently result in the adjournment of the trial, cannot be served without leave of the court within seven days of the date of trial.  This will require the prosecution to have its case fully prepared, on paper at least, seven days in advance of the trial.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that serious sexual offences fall into a special category. The Oireachtas recognised this in 1990 when it required that all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases be heard in the High Court.  An unintended consequence of that decision, designed to bring about uniformity in sentencing and to mark the seriousness of the crimes, has been that a significant delay problem has now arisen.  Section 8 of the Bill provides a special fast track procedure for specific serious offences specified in the schedule to the Bill. Offences of rape and serious sexual assault need to be tried quickly, as do cases of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The most recent statistics indicate that 71 people were convicted for drug dealing in 1993.  Such offences need to be tried quickly to demonstrate society's determination to stamp out this type of criminal activity.  Robbery offences, frequently perpetrated by drug abusers, also need to be dealt with in a speedy manner.  These offences would have to be heard within 90 days of the accused's appearance before the District Court.  If an extension of that period is necessary, it could only be granted by a High Court judge satisfied by evidence of that fact. This would provide for a proper system of control by the High Court over important cases.</P>
    <P>In the Schedule to the Bill are listed the offences to which section 8 relates. <Col N="951" /> These include: (1) rape; (2) rape contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990; (3) aggravated sexual assault contrary to section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990; (4) robbery contrary to section 23 of the Larceny Act, 1916 as inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 and (5) possession of a controlled drug for the purposes of sale or supply contrary to section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that other cases can be tried by the Central Criminal Court whenever there is a substantial point of law or public importance involved or if the interests of justice require that a case be tried in that court, which power of transfer I envisage being used sparingly.  Its need was highlighted by comments made by Mr. Justice Carney, an acknowledged expert in the area of fraud within the European Union, to the effect that the European Union might not be satisfied by serious fraud cases, perhaps involving tens of millions of pounds, being tried before a court with a civil jurisdiction of only £30,000.</P>
    <P>This is not an isolated Bill but part of a carefully prepared overall plan for the administration of our criminal justice system.  My party has demonstrated over the past year or so, through our various criminal legislative proposals, that we are the only party with a plan to tackle the very serious crime levels.  An example is our proposal for a constitutional amendment to alter our bail laws so as to permit an accused deemed likely to commit indictable offences if released to be remanded in custody for a limited 90 days.  The same time limit applies to the trial of offences scheduled under this Bill.  It is a coherent, focused plan which differs enormously from the type of recent by-election baloney we have heard from the Tánaiste, whose Pauline conversion to the view that our bail laws have to be tightened no doubt was prompted by Labour's discovery on the doorsteps in Dublin West and Donegal North East that it had utterly <Col N="952" /> lost touch with the electorate.  Fianna Fáil has been drawing the attention of this rainbow coalition Government to people's concern at the very serious levels of crime.</P>
    <P>It is of considerable importance that the public knows that the measures recently proposed by the Tánaiste to tighten our bail laws were contained in a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill which he and his partners in the rainbow coalition voted down in May 1995. The Minister for Justice said at that time that the measures were only tinkering with the problem.  Fianna Fáil responded to that challenge and proposed an amendment of the Constitution to provide that a person could be refused bail if a judge was satisfied that, in all probability, he would commit a serious criminal offence if admitted to bail.  Let the record show that this Bill was also voted down by the Tánaiste and his Cabinet colleagues in the rainbow coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that the Tánaiste proposes measures which the Minister for Justice has condemned. The Minister is proposing a referendum on bail with which the Tánaiste does not agree.  Who is in charge of the rainbow coalition's policy on crime and who is responsible for framing that policy?  We now know that the answer to both those extremely important questions is precisely the same &mdash; nobody.</P>
    <P>The electors of Donegal North-East and Dublin West will not be fooled by the Leader of the Labour Party whose Minister for Finance cancelled the construction of prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy in the absence of the Minister for Justice.  Their answer to our crime problem was to give a tax incentive to a tiny minority of old age pensioners for the installation of a burglar alarm.  An elderly person has to be living alone in order to qualify.  When one takes into account the fact that a burglar alarm in a remote rural area is unlikely to be heard by anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The tinsel town antics of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance are about as impressive as the legislative famine over which the Minister for Justice has presided since taking office.  The Tánaiste's cramming of knowledge prior to the 2 April by-elections will lead to even the most hardened cynics and sophisticated political connoisseurs choking back howls of derision.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare might as well square the circle and answer the hard question everybody wants answered.  Will they support Fianna Fáil's proposal to restrict the right to bail of individuals who in all probability &mdash; in many cases definitely &mdash; will commit serious criminal offences while on bail?  Alternatively, do they propose to continue to support a system which allows those accused of the most heinous crimes, who in all probability will commit similar crimes while on bail, to roam our countryside for at least two years before being brought to trial?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is doing our citizens and her own party a grave disservice by conniving with this Machiavellian couple to hide the truth.  The phrase openness, transparency and accountability surely must enter the lexicon of Irish political mythology as the epitaph of the rainbow coalition Government.  Whereas it becomes the Tánaiste, who has been the single greatest obstacle to the holding of a referendum on bail, ably abetted by the Minister for Social Welfare, to utter opportunistic and contradictory demands for tough bail laws, the reality is that he is a member of a Government which refuses to operate the existing bail laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court issued 187 warrants for the arrest of persons who had failed to turn up in court in compliance with the terms of their bail.  Would the House care to <Col N="954" /> guess in how many of those cases applications were brought to estreat the bail money?  There has been a single application.</P>
    <P>This Government is operating our bail law as a licence to abscond and has failed to pursue bailsmen for the money pledged after courts have issued warrants. This Government, in particular the finger-wagging Tánaiste, ably abetted by the Minister for Social Welfare is fond of proclaiming this to be a Government of openness, transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>The people want to know who will be accountable for the Government's abysmal failure to tackle the serious crime problem.  Will this be yet another instance of the Government preaching one thing while doing another and yet another instance of double standards, or will some member of the Government be made accountable for this scandal? Why was only one application to estreat bail made in 1995 when it was abundantly clear that the problem had become extremely serious?  One wonders why the Tánaiste is not engaged in his well known hobby of political headhunting. Could it be he now realises that the Minister of State in his office, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, retains her position because the Fine Gael poodles were prepared to bark but not to bite? Their resentful yapping was in marked contrast to the manner in which the Labour Rottweiller sunk its teeth into the political careers of the former Minister of State, Deputies Coveney and Hogan?</P>
    <P>This is a Government of proven hypocrisy.  It proclaims ethics while seeking to sell access to the Minister for Finance.  It blocked a bail referendum while proclaiming the need for tough bail laws.  On crime it is the softest Government this country has ever had or is likely to have again.  That we are assembled today to debate a Private Members' Bill to reform criminal procedure is proof that this Minister for Justice, who continuously promises that this legislation is &ldquo;at an advanced stage&rdquo;, has fallen asunder.  That is not <Col N="955" /> entirely her own fault; she is shackled by the denizens of the so-called left.</P>
    <P>This Government does not have any criminal justice legislative programme. In 15 months in office, the Minister for Justice managed to create the greatest legislative drought in the history of the State.  She has introduced one crime prevention Bill during that time and that was an ill-copied replica of an earlier Fianna Fáil Bill.  The only conclusion one can reach is that this Government simply does not care to introduce legislation or to operate existing laws.  It will continue, with the same sense of ethical mobility displayed by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to preach criminal law reform and to make promises which will not be delivered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time our Legislature faced up to its responsibilities and took positive action to combat the rash of lawlessness which has come on to our streets in recent years.  We must prove we are serious about tackling the growing crime problem.  This Bill is another attempt to do that but perhaps it is a futile one as the Government votes down every measure put forward by this side of the House, particularly in this area by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>I spent a great deal of time in the past week in the constituency of Dublin West and crime is the issue raised on most doorsteps.  If the Minister and the Government have not grasped that reality, they are sadly out of touch.  I note from a Dublin chamber of commerce report that the annual cost of crime to Dublin's retail sector is approximately £30 million per annum. In addition, those businesses spend in excess of £20 million per year on preventative measures.  Crime seriously hampers business in Dublin as it does throughout the country.  Not only does it endanger citizens, but it reduces profits and threatens jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons for the prevalence of crime ranging from underlying social problems to the allocation of insufficient resources to the <Col N="956" /> gardaí.  What the Minister said on 11 May in respect of the amount of time gardaí spend in court was referred to. Has an analysis been carried out in the Department of Justice on the number of Garda man hours lost by this procedure? One only has to attend the local district or circuit court to see the number of gardaí who are required to sit around day after day waiting for cases to be called which often take only one or two minutes.  That is a ridiculous use of a scarce resource.</P>
    <P>A crucial factor is the inadequacy of our legal system which makes securing convictions difficult.  There is a low incidence of prosecutions for crimes against business and most business people are dissatisfied with the courts and sentencing.  Clearly there are weaknesses in these two elements of the criminal justice system which need to be urgently addressed.  The fundamental problem is that the system is unfairly weighted in favour of the accused.  This Bill, which I welcome, is a positive step towards providing the kind of security which the people not only demand but have a right to expect.  It provides an opportunity for the Minister to implement some of the policies we know she favours but which she is prevented from implementing by Cabinet pressure from the parties of the left who seem more concerned about the rights of the criminal than those of the victim.</P>
    <P>One of the main thrusts of the Bill is towards speeding up trials which, on the face of it, might appear to be an effort to accommodate the courts on the State side but that is not necessarily the case. It is also to the benefit of a defendant, particularly one who claims innocence, as it will give them justice at an early date.  We have already heard this evening about the old maxim that justice delayed is justice denied.  This is an attempt to ensure justice is not delayed and an accused person can have his case heard within a reasonable period.  It is only the criminal who will not be enamoured with such measures as he or she will always try to delay proceedings <Col N="957" /> as much as possible to frustrate the judicial system.</P>
    <P>We have not sufficiently availed of the advances in technology to assist both the administration of justice and the conviction of criminals, for instance, the use of tape recorders for the taking of depositions.  Other countries saw the benefit of such basic machines decades ago yet we are only now beginning to approve their use.  Is it any wonder there is such a huge backlog in our courts?  I shudder to think when computers will get official sanction.  It would be foolish of us not to take every opportunity to update the manner in which our courts conduct their business.  While business and commerce make the best use of new technology for communication, office procedure, word processing and retrieval, so too must we bring the administration of justice not only into the 20th century but further into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>We had a costly lesson in recent years in the Office of the Attorney General where not only were thinking and attitudes outmoded, but the procedures and systems also.  We do not need a rerun of that elsewhere in our Administration and the time has passed when the effect of the introduction of new technology in our courts should have been assessed.  I realise we are making strides in that direction but much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the abolition of the ineffective and costly preliminary examination which currently takes place in the District Court.  The Bill provides for the replacement of that procedure with an immediate return to the court of trial.  On modern technology, to which Deputy O'Donoghue alluded in his contribution, we must realise there have been great advances which, of necessity, will slow up court cases but we do not seem to provide for that.  There is no reason the operation of the courts should be so slow, except that its service has consistently been denied proper funding and resources.  The operation of the planning and development Acts is a case in point where people have to be <Col N="958" /> dealt with within a specified period.  In comparison with the courts, this is a relatively stress free system and a jail sentence is not pending on the result. With enough personnel and resources there is no reason the courts could not be equally speedy.  There is no point in tackling one area of the criminal process if progress is not made in other areas to streamline procedures, prove detection and provide additional places of detention. A more integrated approach is necessary and this Bill is only one piece of a much larger jigsaw.</P>
    <P>If we can achieve a speedier process through the court, which we all desire, criminals will be convicted earlier than has been the case up to now.  As matters stand, it will mean that the prisons' revolving doors will move even faster with the danger of coming completely off their hinges.  Additional prison spaces are needed and, with better management of the available prison spaces, we should be able to provide low security prisons for those who have committed minor crimes.  While I accept that some efforts are being made in this regard, they have come late, having been frustrated by the junior partners in Government.</P>
    <P>On the integrated approach, I previously welcomed the decision to increase the number of judges which was another part of this larger jigsaw. The provisions in the Courts and Court Officers Act are complementary to those proposed by Deputy O'Donoghue in this Bill.  I welcome the schedule included with the Bill which specifies those offences which must come to trial within 90 days according to section 89 (1).</P>
    <P>Our record of the treatment of women in society has been dismal, at least until relatively recently.  The first three offences named in the Schedule refer to assaults usually carried out against a woman.  A number of these cases are perpetrated by means of domestic violence.  Previously there have been recorded delays of more than a year in getting such cases to court.  This is totally unacceptable and the Minister <Col N="959" /> will have to ensure that such cases are dealt with speedily.  It would mean that the trauma of a court appearance experienced by the victim would not hang over them indefinitely, as at present.  As matters stand, almost at the whim of the perpetrator, such cases can be delayed.  Section 9 (1) is welcome because heretofore cases were transferred for trivial reasons, often because the defendant did not like the judge involved.  This made a mockery of our judicial system.</P>
    <P>I spoke previously in this House about the moving of civil trials from one Circuit Court area to another.  We did have the practice, which I spoke against, of defendants opting for transfer, often for no legitimate reason.  At the time this was their entitlement.  In this legislation an attempt is made to prevent this abuse of the system with the proviso that an application can be made to the High Court for an order directing the transfer of a trial from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court, but only in the most restrictive of circumstances.  This is a sensible provision. Fianna Fáil, through Deputy O'Donoghue, has again introduced legislation which attempts to tilt the law in favour of the victim and away from the criminal.  I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is again to be commended for bringing forward this further attempt at criminal law reform. The main purpose of the Bill is to abolish preliminary hearings.  It also seeks to set down timescales in which a trial must take place in relation to specified offences and allow either the defence or the prosecution to seek to have a trial transferred to the Central Criminal Court from the Circuit Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Bill was not assigned any particular priority by the Deputy's party in the sense that it was published last June and it is only now that his party has decided to have it debated in Private Members' Time.  Far <Col N="960" /> be it from me to say in a cynical way that this Bill has been brought forward for debate tonight and tomorrow night rather than for the usual four periods of Dáil sitting time that a Private Members Bill would get.  I wonder why?  Could it be that the Fianna Fáil party would dare to use it cynically because of the forthcoming by-election and would want to have a vote tomorrow night so that it could use it cynically to circulate something to the electorate in Dublin West.</P>

      <P>I am sure this was not its motive and that it has nothing to do with the fact that a by-election campaign is taking place.  The people I have been meeting in the by-election canvass are not fooled by the fact that Fianna Fáil seems to be convinced that the only way to fight crime here is to turn out Bills endlessly.  For the love of God, if Acts, on their own, on our Statute Book could stop crime there would be no crime here because our Statute Book is full of legislation.  The public knows it takes more than legislation to tackle crime.  That is why I am glad to be able to tell them on those same doorsteps of the many other measures the Government has put in place to tackle crime.  It is not only laws we need.  We set up a national drugs unit, a national bureau of fraud investigation and provided additional prison places over and above the number proposed by the outgoing Government in 1992.  From this Thursday there will be drug treatment units in our prisons and many other mechanisms to stop drugs getting into our prisons. Through the Minister for Health more drug treatment centres for drug addicts have been provided.  Those measures help to fight crime in society.  I wish the Opposition would grow up and realise it takes more than publishing Bills to fight crime.</P>

      <P>It also takes more than publishing a tiny card which was being pushed through the doors of the houses in Castleknock today.  Some child forgot to put one in a letterbox and it was blown on to the footpath.  The card seemed to imply that because a particular candidate was a well paid barrister who happened to spend most of his working time defending the self same criminals that somehow he alone knew how to tackle crime.  If all our fine barristers combined their expertise I wonder whether they could solve the crime problem?  The public is not gullible and will not be fooled by these statements as Deputy O'Donoghue seems to think. This Bill provides us with an opportunity to debate the issues to which it gives rise but it demonstrates once again the futility of pretending that simple steps can be taken, without very careful consideration, to address the complexities of the crime issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is not satisfeid that the case has been made for the complete abolition of preliminary hearings in the District Court and such an approach would contradict the consistent advice received down the years from the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, an eminent body comprising members of the Judiciary, experienced legal practitioners and lay people, which was in existence long before I took office.  What is being proposed might hamper the prosecution of offences and far from reducing court delays could, in practice, add to them.  In the circumstances the Government has no option but to oppose the Second Stage of this measure, which at the very least would be unlikely to have the benefits claimed by its proponents.  That is not to say that the Government has a closed mind in relation to possible improvements to criminal procedure.  Deputy O'Donoghue ignores the substantial changes made in this regard in the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  The preparation of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will contain further procedural improvements, is at an advanced stage &mdash; the <Col N="962" /> Minister who preceded me in this Department promised this Bill many times.  The reason it has taken longer than I envisaged last May, when I said what the Deputy quoted, is that every day I found another element of court and miscellaneous other procedures which should have been transformed before I took over this office but had not been.  The cumbersome procedures of the courts did not come into being today or yesterday.  As a practising solicitor, the Deputy knows how many frustrating hours he spends with judges, barristers and courts paraphernalia. Why did he not break down the door of the last two Ministers and ask them to do something?  I am now taking action and he will be pleased with my Criminal Justice (Misceallenous Provisions) Bill, which will get rid of many cumbersome and antiquated procedures.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to tell the House that I will shortly publish a Criminal Law Bill which, among other things, will place powers of arrest for members of the Garda Síochána on a modern statutory basis.  I received approval for this at Cabinet this morning.  Other legislative measures which are at an advanced stage include a Non-fatal Offences against the Persons Bill, a Juvenile Justice Bill, which is with the Attorney-General for drafting, and a Fraud Bill.</P>
    <P>I am also at present consulting my colleagues on comprehensive proposals to deal with the problem of offending while on bail.  I must disabuse Deputy O'Donoghue of his views on this but when he gets into his Kerry mode, everything gets lost.  Nothing goes beyond Kerry if he wants to attack a colleague and when he is back in Kerry he attacks the Tánaiste.  I can assure him the Tánaiste has never tied my hands on any of my criminal law proposals.  As a former practitioner he knows full well the need for changes in our criminal law procedures.  I am consulting about my comprehensive proposals but the simplistic way the debate has developed, primarily led by a small number of Fianna Fáil Members, has not taken into account the complexity of the <Col N="963" /> examination of the bail issue.  I am doing so, as I assume the former Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was doing by sending the issue to the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has been critical of the Government's record of criminal law reform and seeks to contrast this with his own record in bringing forward legislative proposals. The reality is that much of the extensive work I have undertaken since becoming Minister for Justice in relation to a comprehensive programme of criminal law reform is now coming to fruition and I assure the Deputy that over the coming months he will have little to criticise on that score.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>It is simply not an option for the Government to throw together <Col N="964" /> various half-baked legal proposals, based on gossip and pub talk, without the necessary analysis and research having been undertaken and then pretend that these will in some way alleviate our crime problem.  I do not favour such a game of mirrors.  I will be more than happy to have my record judged on the quality of the many legislative proposals I will have introduced rather than participating in some imaginary legislative league table with the Deputy where points are scored irrespective of the impracticality or undesirability of the measures which are put together and labelled a Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about crime generally.  Effective law reform has a role to play but there is a wide range of practical measures which need to be taken to ensure the effective operation of the criminal justice system. Developments are taking place in this area every day which often, of their nature, go relatively unnoticed.  Giving the gardaí new legislative powers is clearly of little value unless we ensure at the practical resource level they have all that is needed to tackle crime.</P>
      <P>An important issue is the question of adequate accommodation for gardaí. For example, before I became Minister for Justice I visited a station, which I am sure the Deputy has also seen, in Blanchardstown&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and was concerned about the lack of proper accommodation. I represented part of that area before I became Minister.  When I was appointed I was glad to make this issue a priority, which it had not been before my appointment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and plans to replace the station in Blanchardstown are, I am pleased to say, well advanced.  Negotiations with Fingal County Council <Col N="965" /> with a view to acquiring a site known as the &ldquo;Clonmel site&rdquo; are well advanced and I fully expect construction of the new station to begin before the end of the year.  There is a real danger that our efforts at criminal law reform will be far less effective than they could be if we do not provide this type of resource.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's Bill seeks to improve court procedures and notwithstanding the practical difficulties with what is proposed, it has a laudable aim. However, it is equally important to do what we can to prevent young people becoming involved in crime in the first place and being part of the criminal justice system and trial procedures the Deputy seeks to reform.  In this context I will briefly mention the series of youth 1 diversion projects under way at present, a good example of which is the WEB Project &mdash; Working to Enhance Blanchardstown. The Deputy has raised it often so I anticipated he would do so again.  I was happy to pledge substantial funding to this project.  It should considerably enhance the quality of life in the area and we all hope that a number of the ten to 16 year old age group involved with the project will be helped at the beginning to avoid getting involved in crime and becoming another crime or court statistic.  It is a truism to suggest that delays in court proceedings which the Bill seeks to address can be alleviated if we manage to achieve a reduction in criminality, which is a basic aim of the type of projects I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make clear in relation to preliminary hearing &mdash; the issue at the centre of what the Deputy is proposing in the Bill before the House &mdash; that the Government does not have a closed mind about possible improvements in this area.  I have been examining this in the context of measures which might be taken to reduce delays in cases being tried.  The recent Prosecution of Offences and Punishment of Crime Bill, introduced by the Progressive Democrats and supported by Deputy O'Donoghue's party, also contained proposals for change in this area which were of <Col N="966" /> a substantially different nature from the outright abolition proposed in this Bill. Deputy O'Donoghue is hedging his bets by supporting the Progressive Democrat Bill and moving his own, although they are different proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  As I mentioned earlier, the consistent advice of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure has been against the abolition of preliminary hearings in the District Courts.  In all the circumstances and in the light of what is said on this Bill, the proposals contained in the Progressive Democrats' Bill and the review I have undertaken in this area, I am prepared to consider referring the question of the abolition of, or improvements which might be made in the procedures surrounding, preliminary examinations back to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, the appropriate body to examine the totality of the proposals of Deputy O'Donoghue and the Progressive Democrats.  We must get it right if we intend to make these changes.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the preliminary examination system has existed in this country in some shape or form since 1634.  I am sure the House would wish to be spared a complete history of how the preliminary examinations have developed since then, but I should refer to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, which is essentially the statutory basis for the system as it operates now. Indeed, Deputy O'Donoghue seeks to repeal much of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that the legislation followed on from a report issued in 1963 by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  This was the committee's first report and it was entitled <i>The Preliminary Investigation of Indictable Offences</i>.  The committee recommended against the abolition of preliminary examinations but suggested <Col N="967" /> various changes in procedure which were largely reflected in the 1967 Act.</P>
    <P>The committee listed what were perceived to be both advantages and disadvantages with the system of preliminary examinations.  Among the advantages which it identified was that the procedure required that the case against the accused must be investigated and weighted by a judicial officer who is independent of the prosecution and defence alike before the accused can be put upon his trial.  As such it was a valuable safeguard to the citizen against speculative prosecution and protected him or her against the ordeal, expense and distress of a public trial by a jury merely upon accusation.</P>
    <P>The committee also considered that the procedure afforded the accused an opportunity of hearing and knowing the evidence against him or her, of testing such evidence and possibly breaking it down in cross-examination and of giving evidence himself which may possibly result in his being discharged.  However, the committee also found that the procedure was not all one sided in the sense that it also assisted the prosecution in the preparation of the case for trial.</P>
    <P>Among the disadvantages, the committee mentioned that the procedure was expensive, time consuming and cumbersome, although I should stress that that comment was made in the context of the system as it operated at the time, in other words, prior to the 1967 Act.  Among the extensive changes introduced by the 1967 Act was that an accused could waive the right to a preliminary examination &mdash; before that a preliminary examination was compulsory in all cases &mdash; and that the taking of evidence by deposition was discretionary.</P>
    <P>In their conclusions, a majority of the committee were of the opinion that it was a fundamental and inherent feature of our concept of justice that an accused person should not be put on trial for a serious offence merely upon accusation. That is a fundamental issue which needs to be addressed in looking at possible <Col N="968" /> changes in this area.  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to this.  The Deputy's Bill would ensure that a person would be put on trial for a serious offence merely upon accusation.  It may be that a case can be made for that approach in the context of the fact that, in the Director of Public Prosecutions, we have an independent prosecution authority. There is also the point that accused persons now have widespread access to criminal legal aid.  These measures were introduced since the 1967 Act and obviously they have an effect on an accused person's rights.</P>
    <P>However, for whatever improvements might be made in the operation of preliminary examinations, do we really want to bring about a situation through their complete abolition where it would no longer be possible for an innocent person to say to a court: &ldquo;The evidence against me does not stand up.  I should not be subject to a trial&rdquo;?  In this context I note that what was proposed in the Progressive Democrats' Bill would allow a person to have the equivalent to a preliminary examination at the court of trial.  There is a major difference here between the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats approaches.</P>
    <P>In 1989, the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure was asked to specifically look at a suggestion that a preliminary examination of indictable offences should take place in the court of trial.  What it said at the time is relevant to the PD and Fianna Fáil proposals. The committee concluded:</P>
    <P>It is suggested that if this proposal were implemented it would reduce delays and lead to speedier trials.  The Committee does not agree with this view.  It is its opinion that there is no undue delay as a result of the conducting of the preliminary examination of indictable offences in the District Court.  The Committee felt that delays more often than not were attributable to the compiling and furnishing of the Book of Evidence and were not procedural.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue, for obvious <Col N="969" /> reasons, recognises in his Bill that, even with the abolition of preliminary examininations, a book of evidence will have to be prepared and served on the accused. Obviously there will always be some lapse of time before a book of evidence can be served.  I am prepared to examine what measures might be taken to remove undue delay but it will be clear that the abolition of preliminary hearing of itself would not bring about any reduction in the time taken to complete a book of evidence.  Accordingly it is difficult to see how, as a matter of general practice, the abolition of preliminary hearings would contribute very substantially to the reduction of delays in bring cases to trial in the great majority of cases.</P>
    <P>It is the case that where a preliminary examination takes place either side may seek the attendance of witnesses for the purpose of taking sworn depositions.  In other words, a prospective witness in the main trial can be examined, cross-examined and the evidence adduced is transcribed and attested to there and then by the witness and the District Judge.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has been particularly critical of the procedure involving the taking of depositions &mdash; a procedure that has existed since 1967 &mdash; but the reality is that it would appear that sworn depositions are the exception rather than the rule.  In the majority of cases, the preliminary examination consists merely of the District Judge reviewing the book of evidence.  As part of my examination of this area I recently obtained statistics in relation to cases dealt with by Dublin District Courts 4, 5 and 6.  These show that, out of 354 cases sent forward for trial in the Circuit Court, in only 27 cases were sworn depositions taken, and in the majority of those 27 cases only a small number of potential witnesses were called for a deposition.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it would be difficult to accept as well based any contention that existing practice was a major contributor to delays in cases being brought to trial in the great majority of <Col N="970" /> cases.  Most of the delays that people complain to me about are by solicitors, barristers and those involved in the legal process, preparing witnesses, looking for delays in court hearings and seeking adjournments.  These issues take a great toll.  Deputies have raised cases which, upon examination by me, reveal that the delays have nothing to do with gummed up court lists but with somebody who does not want to give the evidence needed to progress the case to the next stage.  Often, we must look to these procedures and the procedures by the lawyers involved as to why some of the delays are being incurred.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue might like to reflect further on the fact that abolishing the right to take depositions cuts both ways and his proposals carry with them the danger that they could deprive the prosecution of a valuable tool.  For example, under our present law such depositions can be used as evidence in specified circumstances where the person who gave the evidence might not be available to attend the trial itself.  I doubt that this would be perceived by the Deputy as a problem he was trying to remedy in proposing the abolition of preliminary examinations.</P>
    <P>There may, on the face of it, be cumbersome aspects of the procedure for the taking of depositions in the infrequent situations where this arises and I am prepared to see if any improvements can be made in this regard.  However, the fact is that it is because depositions are taken so relatively rarely that it is difficult to justify on economic or practical grounds measures such as the provision of special transcription facilities.</P>
    <P>I hope I have demonstrated that what the Deputy is proposing is by no means straightforward and that it is by no means clear that its effect would be to achieve what he claims for it.  As I mentioned earlier, I am prepared to consider in the light of this debate the review which I have been carrying out and the proposals contained in the Progressive Democrats Bill and this Bill, asking the Committee on Court Practice <Col N="971" /> and Procedure to have another look at this matter.  I am sure that, given the composition of that committee, the House will be prepared to accept that the committee would be uniquely well placed to offer considered recommendations on this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill proposes that a trial for an offence specified in the Schedule to it must take place within 90 days from the accused's first appearance in the District Court unless a High Court judge is satisfied as to why an extension &mdash; which can be applied for by either the defence or prosecution &mdash; can be granted.  The Schedule lists various sexual offences under the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1990, robbery under the Larceny Acts and possession of a controlled drug for the purposes of supply. This proposal may well have its origins in the magic circle of law reform, whereby a wave of a magic wand will ensure that everything will be ready for a trial which is declared to take place within 90 days.</P>
    <P>The abolition of delays in cases being brought to trial cannot in practice be achieved by legislative fiat.  In the real world it is through the provision of adequate resources that the issue of delays in trials needs in practice to be addressed and this, as the House will be aware, is being done in the context of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  Deputies will be aware that today the Government approved the appointment of three new Supreme Court judges and three new High Court judges having observed the procedures relating to the Judicial Appointments Board outlined in the Act.</P>

      <P>For example, the Schedule would cover a person assaulted during a robbery but not a person attacked equally badly or worse where robbery was not involved.  This, of itself, is indicative of the difficulties inherent in taking this type of approach in legislation and, in any event, what is being proposed could waste court time in hearing applications under the section rather than dealing with substantive matters.  It could be seen as representing an unwarranted interference in the role of the presidents of the various courts in scheduling court business.  Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy O'Dea, being practising solicitors, will know this is a matter for the presidents of the courts and not for me or them.</P>
      <P>Section 9 proposes that either the prosecutor or the accused may have a case transferred from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court on the basis of the seriousness of the offence or there being a substantial point of law of public importance at issue.  This is somewhat similar to an amendment put down by Deputy O'Donoghue during the debate on the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, and it was suggested in the context of alleviating the pressure on Dublin Circuit Court.  This problem was, in fact, addressed in the Act through ending the automatic right of the accused to transfer trials to the Dublin Circuit from outside it.  This problem was particularly relevant to Cork.  The likely practical effect of what is being proposed in this Bill would be to increase delays in the Central Criminal Court which, as the House will be aware, deals with some of the most serious criminal cases.  Leaving aside issues of policy in relation to the most appropriate jurisdictions of the courts to hear particular types of cases, I am opposed to this part of the Bill on the practical grounds I mentioned.</P>

    <P>Work is continuing on an extensive <Col N="973" /> Government programme of criminal law reform.  The House already has before it the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill and I will shortly introduce the Criminal Law Bill.  Progressing those measures, and other measures I will bring before the House in the near future, represents the most effective way of getting comprehensive, modern and effective measures onto the Statute Book and I look forward to debating them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has consistently tried to imply that the only measure of my record and that of the Government is to be found by comparing the number of Bills I have introduced with the number he has tried, not very effectively, to introduce and that this is the only way the public will judge that record.</P>

I hope such areas will not have to wait until by-elections take place for the Minister to give this approval.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister I have been knocking on doors in rural and urban areas of Donegal.  People ask me and politicians from all parties what we are going to do about crime and what is happening to criminals.  People are living in fear.  Not only are the elderly afraid to open their doors at night, they are almost afraid to do so during the day.  Violence involving shootings and killings is rampant. People greatly appreciate the work of the Garda Síochána but they feel too much of its time is spent dealing with court cases, issuing summonses and warrants and putting people who do not pay small fines into prison.  There is a need to seriously look at the role and operations of the Garda.</P>
      <P>It is generally felt by the public that the rights of criminals seem to be more important than those of victims.  Last Sunday a newspaper named drug barons and people involved in drug related crime but they seem to be able to freely walk the streets of our cities and towns without being apprehended by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Our administration of justice is outdated, outmoded and in the dark ages. It needs to be updated, modernised and brought into the 21st century.  Modern technology must be brought into operation immediately to speed up court cases.  Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill leads the way in this area.  It will ensure that modern swift procedures will be available to courts.  The existing procedures, which are governed by the Criminal Procedures Act, 1967, are cumbersome, unwieldy and out of date.  They are not in keeping with modern society as it enters the next century and they need to be changed.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the Government to accept the Bill and to allow it to proceed to Committee Stage where it can deal with the problems which contribute to the slowness in the operation of our courts.  The present process of bringing a person through the courts is tortuous and slow and is not in the interests of putting criminals behind bars if this is necessary.  I hope the Bill will be taken on board, even at this late stage, by the Government.  The Minister rejected it out of hand but this is not good enough. Deputy O'Donoghue has proved over the last six months by the Bills he has introduced that he and Fianna Fáil are leading the way to put in place a modern system which will deal once and for all with criminal activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy O'Donoghue on his initiative and ingenuity in producing this necessary legislation. The absolute right of the accused to insist on depositions being taken down in long hand by a District Court clerk, which is like something out of <i>Bleak House,</i> is inappropriate to the <Col N="976" /> Ireland of today as we approach the end of the millennium.  I accept the Minister's point that written depositions are insisted on in a minority of cases.  The point the Minister missed is that this procedure is now being abused by clever, resourceful and habitual criminals to frustrate the criminal trial process by delaying the trial for an inordinate and unjustifiable period. Hardened, clever, resourceful and well advised criminals who consistently and skilfully play the system to the frustration of victims and the law abiding will benefit from the Minister's refusal to accept this reasonable and narrow Bill; Deputy O'Donoghue will not fall out with me if I describe it as such.</P>
      <P>As any practising lawyer knows, the abuse of the deposition system has now become a formidable weapon which a minority of resourceful criminals have developed to frustrate and delay the system. What mandate has the Minister to allow them to continue to abuse the system in this way?  Any experienced garda will say that the innocent do not resort to these tactics.  It is predictable that clever, resourceful and habitual criminals, who have succeeded in reducing the preliminary examination system introduced for the protection of the accused to a horrendously expensive parody, will resort to such tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's reply which listed unsustainable excuses why this necessary legislation could not be accepted.  We were told that my party did not introduce such legislation when in Government.  Perhaps it should have done so but no Government can do everything.  We were told that this legislation was being introduced because there is a by-election.  That is hardly a reason for rejecting it and for bringing in the champions of social democracy, the Labour Party, and a handful of redundant Marxists to vote it down.  We were told the legislation would not tackle crime.  Nobody, including Deputy <Col N="977" /> O'Donoghue, has suggested that it will do so.</P>
    <P>Legislation has its place but if it is outdated, inadequate and inappropriate, it is a hindrance to those trying to enforce law and order.  That cannot be gainsaid.  We were told the proposals in the Bill could add to court delays but no explanation for this was given.  We were told the Minister's Bill was at an advanced stage; live horse and you will get grass.  We were told innocent people could be put on trial if the horrendously expensive, cumbersome and much abused preliminary examination procedure was swept aside.  Is the Minister not aware that people are put on trial for serious offences each day and that no day passes when a verdict of not guilty is handed down?  We could describe such people as innocent.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the book of evidence still must be served.  Of course it must be, but what has that got to do with anything?  The Minister said it might take a long time to produce the book of evidence.  If it does, we will not have constant remands in and out of court like Lanigan's Ball.  Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill contains time limits in which these things must be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister said one of the main reasons for delays in criminal trials was requests from lawyers for adjournments. Again, the time limit in the Bill will deal with that issue.  Lawyers cannot delay the procedure by seeking adjournments, except in the narrow circumstances set out in the Bill.  As a member of the legal profession I deeply resent the fact that the Minister has effectively accused both branches of the profession of aiding and abetting criminals in their nefarious activities and in frustrating and delaying the trial process.  I believe the profession would resent that also.</P>
    <P>We accept that written depositions are the exception rather than the rule. We are trying to avoid a situation where habitual and skilful criminals use this <Col N="978" /> devise, originally introduced for the protection of the accused, to delay and frustrate the criminal justice system.</P>

      <P>The Minister raised the issue of the by-election.  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the Tánaiste's Pauline conversion at the start of the by-election that suddenly something must be done about the bail laws.  The Minister said the Tánaiste never tied her hands and was never an obstacle to changing the bail laws.  I remind the Minister that last March, in advance of the Law Reform Commission's report, she unilaterally announced that she would hold a referendum on the bail laws.  The Tánaiste rubbished her in the media by describing her as the &ldquo;weak link in the Government&rdquo;. As usual he did not say this to her face but out of the side of his mouth. The great ventriloquist dispatched his puppet, Mr. Finlay, a first class honours graduate of the Joseph Goebbel's school of news management, to the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While reading the weekend newspapers, I noticed that Mr. Tom Morrissey, the Fine Gael by-election candidate, has produced a plan to defeat crime in Dublin West and elsewhere. The first item on his agenda is a system in which the trial procedure could be fast tracked, that is, people could be <Col N="979" /> brought to court more quickly.  The proposal before the House will do that, but the Minister, a member of Mr. Morrissey's party, has announced that she will marshal her troops to vote it down. What message will that send those who are already cynical about politics and politicians?</P>

What message will that send to a cynical public? The Minister, who has raised prevarication to an art form, has now institutionalised cynicism about politics and politicians.</P>
      <P>It is a sad night for the victims of crime and for the law abiding.  However, every cloud has a silver lining and it is a good night for criminals, especially habitual and well advised criminals who have used and fashioned the preliminary examination procedure into a formidable weapon to delay and frustrate the criminal trial procedure.  Criminals have a reason to celebrate, despite the first item on Mr. Tom Morrissey's crime agenda.  It is a sad night for Mr. Morrissey because his proposal to fight crime has been rubbished and rejected out of hand by the Minister.</P>

    <P>It is also a sad night for the law abiding, victims of crime for those cowering behind their front doors afraid to go out at night.

The Government is locked in paralysis; the Minister is locked into a programme of relentless inactivity and mentioned her formidable criminal justice programme on which she will be able to look back. <Col N="980" /> She is taking her time about producing it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important topic.  Nothing is as frustrating for the ordinary law abiding citizen as the apparent immunity from the law, including the tax law, enjoyed by some of the major crime figures in this country.  This is graphically illustrated by the report in <i>The Sunday World</i> of 24 March 1996 concerning the tax affairs of an individual known as &ldquo;the Monk&rdquo; who was described as &ldquo;Ireland's wealthiest gang boss&rdquo;.  According to the report, the individual in question was discovered to have paid no income tax between 1987 and 1991.  The Revenue estimated he had earned approximately £115,000 in that period and issued a tax assessment of £57,600.  Shortly afterwards, his file disappeared mysteriously.  Apparently, that resulted in the tax assessment of £57,600 being withdrawn.  He then assessed himself, apparently, and finished up paying £1,537.80 instead of the original sum of £57,600.</P>
      <P>For the past six years he has paid a total of £7,925 in tax according to the newspaper report, that is, an average of £1,300 per annum.  This raises the following questions which I want the Minister, or his Minister for State, to answer tonight.  First, was the theft of this tax file reported to the Garda?  Was there a Garda inquiry?  What was the result? Was there an internal Revenue inquiry? The circumstances of this theft are extremely suspicious, in particular, in view of the fact that the exact afternoon of the file's disappearance can be pinpointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, did the Revenue not have a copy of the file data on computer?  Was any effort made to reconstitute the file &mdash; I am informed that this would be quite easy to do?  Third, on what basis was the original assessment of £57,600 withdrawn?  It is my understanding that an assessment cannot be withdrawn or <Col N="982" /> changed without evidence being produced by the taxpayer which would justify that withdrawal or change.  Did this individual submit a set of accounts which would justify a change in the assessment?  Did a hearing take place before the Taxation Appeal Commissioners which would justify a change in the assessment?</P>
    <P>Fourth, in view of the fact that the original information is still available to the Revenue, why has a new assessment not been raised?  Fifth, on what basis has this individual's income for tax purposes been calculated in the meantime?  Does he submit accounts or is his annual tax based on Revenue estimates?  Sixth, has this individual been audited since 1991? If not, why not?  The Revenue invests a great deal of time and effort auditing approximately 30,000 individuals and businesses per annum.  Is it not true to say that many of these are small and medium sized businesses?  Will the Minister accept that much of this effort is not yielding proper value for money to the taxpayers?  How many PLCs have been audited?  How many multinational companies have been audited? How many Tsars of organised crime have been audited?</P>
    <P>Seventh, did this individual avail of the tax amnesty?  Is it not true that earnings from criminal activity are excluded from the ambit of the tax amnesty? Finally, what does the Revenue propose to do now?  What steps do they propose to take to recover the original tax assessed of £57,600?  What steps do they propose to take to raise realistic assessments for the intervening years?</P>
    <P>Revenue has a vast array of powers available to it to bring recalcitrant taxpayers to book.  These include powers to enter premises, even a private dwelling; powers of arrest; powers to seize assets and documents and powers to inspect property.</P>
    <P>The Government should give consideration urgently now to constituting a task force drawn from the Garda, the <Col N="983" /> Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare to target organised crime.  If a major criminal cannot be prosecuted successfully for any breach of the ordinary criminal law, then it should be, and often is, possible to prosecute them for tax evasion or social welfare fraud.  The latter day bosses of organised crime in Ireland are even more fearless, ruthless and arrogant than Al Capone.  In effect, they seem to be untouchable.  It is long past time for us to create our own untouchables to deal with them.</P>

He will also be aware that the Revenue Commissioners are precluded, for reasons of confidentiality, from disclosing details of their dealings with individuals.  There is a long standing tradition in this House of not commenting on the personal tax affairs of individuals and of not responding to media speculation about them.  That tradition has stood us in good stead and I do not propose to depart from it.  The Deputy will understand that there are good reasons for following that course in all cases.  For these reasons, I do not propose to comment on specific details in the reports to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say, however, that the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that no files or papers of the kind indicated in the newspaper article mentioned by the Deputy are known to be missing or to have been stolen from the Revenue Commissioners' offices.  In answer to the Deputy's question, therefore, the Revenue Commissioners have had no reason to institute an inquiry or to <Col N="984" /> report any theft of such files or papers to the Garda.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that access to Revenue offices is carefully controlled and that Revenue files are stored in secure conditions.  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed to me that security arrangements are kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>The newspaper report mentioned by the Deputy also refers generally to the acquisition of assets by criminals from the proceeds of crime and suggests there is a lack of determination to tackle this problem.  I want to reassure the House that this is not the case.  Where Revenue becomes aware of unexplained income, it will always seek to secure any appropriate tax and it has the necessary powers for this purpose.</P>
    <P>As regards the investigation of unexplained sources of income, Revenue's ongoing audit and investigation programmes are partly driven by matching information regarding asset acquisition, lifestyles, etc. with tax returns and by identifying individuals holding substantial assets who have not filed tax returns.  This strategy will continue to be pursued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I noted Deputy O'Dea's references to the need for a task force comprising the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice.  There is merit in that idea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  This motion arises from two separate incidents of attempted burglary at a geriatric hospital in County Louth.  It is not necessary to labour the seriousness of the implications of an attempted burglary of a hospital which cares for elderly people.  This is happening in a context where, in many parts of the country crime is effectively out of control and those who indulge in this type <Col N="985" /> of activity can do so at will.  There is no doubt that an attempt to break into a hospital and perpetrate a robbery is the lowest level to which crime can reach.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to have ease of access to hospitals for relatives of patients but the time has come to balance such access against the risks involved in having an open door policy.  We simply cannot allow the elderly or the sick to be exposed to situations where people can break into hospitals and attempt to rob patients of their belongings.  While hospitals are most vulnerable at night, there is also no immunity from those practices during the day.</P>
      <P>What type of training or tuition is available to hospital staff to cater for attempted robberies?  Is there a particular drill?  Are the staffing levels in our hospitals such that adequate protection can be given?  The time has come to review the idea &mdash; it is a new concept &mdash; of examining security in our hospitals. We used to regard them as safe havens and that those who indulged and involved themselves in crime did not touch them.  Apparently, that safety seems to have disappeared.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the particular incident to which I am referring is an isolated case; there may have been attempted robberies in other hospitals. I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider asking the health boards to examine the safety and security of our hospitals to ensure that these types of incidents do not happen again.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Health and I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this issue which is of great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of security in hospitals is a matter in the first instance for the health board concerned.  However, I understand that health boards and voluntary hospital authorities have been putting security arrangements in place in hospitals over the past number of years.  These initiatives have been supported by the Department of Health.  In <Col N="986" /> the provision of hospital security, it is important to strike a balance so there is ease of access to services for patients and their families while at the same time endeavouring to protect staff, patients and the public as far as possible where this is necessary.</P>
    <P>The hospital in question falls within the remit of the North-Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the board has taken preliminary action in dealing with the problem by providing a permanent security presence on the site itself.  The board has also recently undertaken a security review of its region as a matter or urgency.  Issues under consideration by the board in this regard include more secure night parking, improved door locking systems and access control methods, additional alarms and employment of security personnel.  The board is currently in consultation with each of the board's hospitals to assess the financial implications of the various options outlined and to draw up a specification for tendering for the region and its hospital as a whole.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Kirk will wish to know that the Department of Health will continue to provide technical and professional advice as required to assist health boards in drawing up security plans to ensure that local security requirements are satisfactorily met.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Accommodation for the Elderly.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities operate the housing policy for family and old people's dwellings.  Their system involves processing applications on a priority basis and within their resources, they allocate housing.  Their resources are never adequate to provide sufficient in-house building.  Local authorities also operate the essential repairs scheme, which is limited to emergency repairs. They also operate the disabled person's grant &mdash; two-thirds of the cost is met by the Department &mdash; which provides for renovations of floors, bedrooms, toilets, showers, etc.  This is also limited because <Col N="987" /> it is restricted to those with a level of disability which is assessed by the medical officers for the area.  The allocation of housing aid for the elderly is currently around £4 million.  I asked about this last year on the Adjournment when the figure had been reduced to £3 million. While I am glad to see it has returned to its 1994 level, it is still not adequate.</P>
      <P>This scheme gives good value for money and is in great demand.  It is administered by the health boards and FÁS is responsible for the manpower.  It has been effective in extending the useful life of houses and in allowing old people to finish their days in their homes.  Their work consists mainly of refurbishing, replacing doors and windows, draught proofing, roof and chimney repairs and, in some cases, covers sanitary services.  However, the allocation of sanitary services for 35,000 elderly people living in a four county health board area is only £450,000.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance provides rent and mortgage supplements and the amount paid has increased by leaps and bounds from the late 1980s.  In 1995, £60 million was paid in subvention to rents and mortgages and 39,000 householders were in receipt of supplements in any given month. Many of these increases are due to aspects of the social welfare system which provide disincentives for unemployed persons to remain in the family home.  Most of them are moving out to avail of the higher allowances and supplements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While £60 million is being spent providing apartments, mainly by the Eastern Health Board in the Dublin region, there is only an allocation of £4 million to provide adequate sanitary services for elderly people living on their own. Some of their houses still do not have basic sanitary, water and sewerage services. The Minister must either increase housing aid for the elderly to a more realistic level, which would be higher than £4 million, introduce some type of <Col N="988" /> grant to provide them with these sanitary services or provide funding to local authorities to do something about it. The present situation is unacceptable.  It is reasonably easy to provide many of those services now that fibre glass septic tanks are available.  However, the biggest problem is in providing piped water.  Many group water schemes are looking for connection fees of up to £1,500, although some local authorities give this facility free to older people who want it.</P>
    <P>The document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, stated that all forms of social housing assistance will be administered by the local authority.  The claim that the issues involved in transferring the administration of rent mortgage supplements to the local authorities were examined by the Departments of the Environment, Social Welfare, Health and Finance.  The review group on the role of supplementary welfare in relation to houses stated that an integrated approach to the assessment of housing needs and the allocation of housing resources should be addressed within a single legislative framework.  I take it that this involves local authorities. How are they proceeding with implementing Government policy in this regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The accommodation needs of the elderly are important and require a sensitive and flexible approach to ensure that the needs of each individual are met in the most appropriate way.  This may involve the provision of accommodation specifically designed to meet the needs of elderly persons or improvement works to their existing accommodation reflecting their desire to retain independence and live in their own homes for as long as they wish and are able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accommodation for elderly persons <Col N="989" /> may be provided under the local authority housing programme or the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme. In addition, there are a range of improvement schemes for those wishing to stay in their own homes and communities, each designed to meet different needs and different circumstances. The essential point is that all but one of these measures are directly under the control of the local authority in each area and the remaining scheme &mdash; the task force for the elderly &mdash; is operated by the health board in consultation with the local authority as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Local authorities carry out assessments of housing needs on a regular basis, including the needs of the elderly. They have regard to the level and composition of housing needs in their areas when making their schemes of letting priorities and when determining the type and scale of additional accommodation which they should provide.  The next assessment of needs is being carried out to show the position on 29 March.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional accommodation to meet the needs of the elderly, which are identified in the assessment, will primarily be a matter for local authority which can meet these needs either directly in its building programme or indirectly through the voluntary housing programme.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly is specifically designed to enable elderly persons living on their own, if they so desire, to remain in their existing accommodation. The scheme provides for the carrying out at no cost to the occupier of basic works to prolong the useful life of the house so that it can continue to provide, for as long as is necessary, an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants.  The scheme is operated at local level by health boards under the direction of community care programme managers who have responsibility for decisions in individual cases. <Col N="990" /> There is regular co-ordination between the health board and the local authority in regard to cases which might be assisted under the task force or for whom one of the other social housing measures might be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The other social housing options available include the disabled person's grants scheme, the essential repairs grants scheme and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing.  The disabled person's grant scheme assist necessary adaptation works to a house to meet the needs of a disabled person.  In the case of a private house, the grant may amount to 66 per cent of the cost of the work, subject to a maximum grant of £8,000.  In the case of a local authority house, the local authority may meet the full cost of the necessary work.</P>
    <P>The essential repairs grant scheme is a long established social housing option. It is a modest but very worthwhile measure as it enables people in accommodation, which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost, to have basic repairs carried out to their houses so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants.  The scheme is generally used to secure essential repairs to dwellings occupied by elderly persons, often in isolated rural areas.  I should also mention the local authorities ongoing programme for the provision of bathrooms which is of benefit to certain elderly people throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing enables authorities to improve or extend privately owned houses occupied or intended to be occupied by an applicant approved for local authority housing. The authority can arrange to have all necessary works of improvement carried out to the house at no cost to the occupants other than a small weekly or monthly charge, based on the cost of the works, for a maximum of 15 years. Indeed, the scheme can go further than <Col N="991" /> just providing adequate accommodation for existing residents in the house.  In certain circumstances, necessary improvements to a house may be carried out under the scheme where, for example, a young family on a waiting list intend to move in with an elderly relative.  Equally, elderly persons in housing need who wish to move in with members of their family may have any necessary improvement works carried out under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the range of different situations which the housing needs of an <Col N="992" /> elderly person may present, the local housing authority, in consultation with the local health board as appropriate, is in the best position to consider the various options and to determine the most suitable response to each individual elderly person's accommodation needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has now considered the Report of the Interdepartmental Working Group which was established, in accordance with a Government decision, to consider the implementation of the Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  Follow up action to the report will be announced shortly.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education has set out in the White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, the Government's policy in relation to traveller education.</P>
      <P>The White Paper recognises that travellers are a community whose culture has deep historical roots within Irish society.  That as a distinct group they have rights to participate fully in it educational system and to have its traditions respected.</P>
      <P>The White Paper also states that the placement of traveller children in special schools and classes will be done only on the basis of special educational need.  If they need extra help, this will be given, as it is to other children with learning difficulties, through withdrawal from the ordinary class for a limited period, or through support teaching within the ordinary class.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out the following objectives:</P>
      <P>&mdash;That all traveller children of primary school age be enrolled and participate fully in primary education according to their ability and potential, within five years.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Within ten years, all traveller children of second-level, school-going age will complete junior cycle education and 50 per cent will complete the senior cycle.</P>
      <P>These objectives will be supported by:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" />&mdash;the inclusion in schools' plans of an admission policy in relation to travellers, in accordance with national and regional guidelines;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the education boards putting in place induction programmes involving the family, the primary school where the student is enrolled, and the second-level school to which s/he is about to transfer;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the provision of modules on travellers and traveller culture in pre-service and in-career development programmes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continuing development by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment of appropriate curriculum and assessment procedures to meet the special needs of traveller children, including the provision of appropriate texts and materials;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continuing development of the visiting teacher service;</P>
    <P>&mdash;comprehensive and regularly updated surveys of traveller education;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the monitoring of school attendance patterns.</P>
    <P>I know that FÁS has a long experience of working with travellers through its involvement with senior traveller training centres and other training and employment initiatives.  While FÁS is conscious of the separate culture of travellers, it is are aware that many of its training and employment needs are common to other disadvantaged groups within our society for which FÁS also carries responsibility.  Over the years FÁS has developed valuable contacts with the various travellers' representative bodies and the experience gathered from these relationships will contribute to the achievement of a balance between maintaining the culture of travellers and their integration into mainstream training and employment activities.</P>

      <P>According to the Department of Finance which reviews equal opportunities developments in the Civil Service on an annual basis, the proportion of men to women appointed to senior positions in the Civil Service has been increasing in recent years.  In 1993 the numbers appointed to senior positions in administrative, technical and professional grades comprised 11 per cent women and 89 per cent men.  In 1995 this had risen to 16 per cent women.  While much remains to be done within the Civil Service the systematic annual review of such appointments is ensuring a continued focus on women's under-representation at this level.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office indicating that women still earn substantially less than men in virtually every area of industrial employment; the proposals, if any, he has to address this ongoing discrepancy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The most recent figures from the CSO indicate that in June 1995 the average female hourly earnings in industry were just over 71 per cent of the male hourly rate, with an average female weekly earnings at just over 63 per cent of the male rate.</P>
      <P>I should point out that a smaller wage gap was identified in a report in 1994 by the ESRI on pay differentials across all employments.  As the CSO figures are drawn primarily from manufacturing industry which includes only one third of all employees and less than one fifth of female employees the CSO statistics do not reflect the level of male-female wage differentials in employment generally. The ESRI analysed earnings of all male and female employees and found that female hourly earnings were approximately 80 per cent of men's, almost 10 per cent higher than the current figure for industry.</P>
      <P>While there may be limits to the extent to which Government can intervene in the operations of the labour market which give rise to pay differentials a number of approaches are being pursued which should prompt further progress.</P>
      <P>One approach is to combat pay discrimination and unequal treatment of women in employment and this will be pursued through strengthening employment equality legislation.  Another approach involves facilitating greater participation by women in the labour market over the life cycle so that productivity related differences with men can be reduced.  In this regard the ESRI study identified employment experience as a significant factor explaining pay differentials. In response to this I have sought to enhance family leave measures such as the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, and I also intend pursuing provision of parental leave which is currently under consideration at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> In addition to legislative steps, facilities for childcare support for working parents are being promoted through my Department's pilot scheme for child care projects in disadvantaged areas.  Of course employers and workers also have important contributions to make to advancing women's participation in employment through equal opportunities policies and programmes including appropriate positive action measures.  Advice on such matters is readily available from the Employment Equality Agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In deciding issues concerning the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child the court must, under the law contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  That important criterion, which is common to many other jurisdictions, is a matter which falls to be dealt with by the court in the context of all the circumstances of each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of agreement between the parents, the court will inevitably have to make hard and difficult decisions and almost always it will include the granting of custody to one parent and access to the other parent. That is the arrangement which seems to work well in most situations where each of the parents co-operate fully with the terms of the court order.  The court may grant joint custody of the child to the parents and my understanding is that it <Col N="551" /> has done so in some cases.  Moreover, orders made by the court regarding the custody of a child or the right of access to a child are not final and may, upon application by either parent be varied by the court if it is in the best interests of a child that a variation order be made.</P>
    <P>Of course, the best arrangements for all concerned is normally the one agreed by both parents without the need for court intervention.  The law is fully supportive of those arrangements.  Where judicial separation proceedings are in question, there is an obligation on solicitors to advise their clients of the possibility of entering into an agreement on the terms of their separation including what should happen to the children.  The courts may adjourn separation or custody proceedings to allow parties to work out agreements in relation to their children.  The Family Mediation Service may be of assistance and is being developed to extend its services nationwide. Where the parties are entitled to legal aid the Legal Aid Board will, through its law centres, be in a position to assist parties in the drawing up of agreements.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present preparing proposals for legislation to update aspects of the law in relation to children, including guardianship.  The details of changes, if any, in relation to the subject matter of this question, will be announced in the context of publication of those legislative proposals.</P>

      <P>As I outlined in the House on 28 November 1995 the Government is committed to initiating Constitution amendment Bills on votes for emigrants and Cabinet confidentiality. Since then, the Minister for the Environment published a consultation paper, incorporating the text of a proposed constitutional amendment on 12 March 1996, which will be considered by the Seanad and the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs. The Constitution amendment Bill on Cabinet confidentiality is being drafted. I expect that the necessary referenda will be held sometime this year.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Justice, having examined the Law Reform Commission report on the Law of Bail which was published in September 1995, will shortly bring proposals, including <Col N="553" /> options for a possible constitutional amendment, to the Government for consideration.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a programme of reopening of Border roads in both jurisdictions has been in progress since the announcement of the lifting of all Border road closure orders in mid-October 1994.  The most recent information to hand indicates that this project is now over 90 per cent complete.  I hope to see the remaining work completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The particular crossing raised by the Deputy was closed in the early 1970s.  I understand that Donegal County Council completed the reopening of the portion of the road laneway in question in this jurisdiction in early 1995.</P>
      <P>On my instructions, the matter of reopening that portion which lies in Northern Ireland has been raised through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  I am informed that the delay in its reopening has occurred due to the wish of the landowner in question not to reopen this laneway.  I understand that there have been contacts regarding this crossing involving the British authorities, Derry City Council and the landowner in recent months.  We have been advised through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat that it is hoped to have bollards obstructing it removed and the crossing reopened within a few weeks.</P>

      <P>A significant part of the Iveagh House complex at 78-81 St. Stephens Green, Dublin 2, which houses the administrative headquarters of my Department, predates 1843. Whenever possible, my Department responds positively to requests from individuals and groups who have an interest in viewing notable interiors in Iveagh House.  The question of opening Iveagh House to the public is under review.  The attached list sets out the interiors listed by Dublin Corporation of these buildings.  The interiors comprise the representational areas and three offices of my Department.  There are no notable interiors other than those listed.</P>
      <P>Two buildings used by my Department abroad also predate 1843.  These are the Villa Spada in Rome, built in 1639 which is used as the Chancery/Residence of the Embassy to The Holy See and the Palazzo Capizucchi building also in Rome, which is a 16th century building and houses the Chancery of the Embassy to Italy. While the chanceries of both embassies are open to the public for normal business purposes, these buildings are not open for public viewing.</P>

      <P>Details of the trips undertaken by me in the period 31 January 1992 to 16 December 1995 and by Ministers of State Burton and Mitchell in the period 1 January to 18 October 1995 have already been made available to the House in replies given on 7 October 1993 &mdash; Questions Nos. 16 and 32; 29 March 1994 &mdash; Question No. 86; 11 October 1994 &mdash; Question No. 117; 18 October 1995 &mdash; Question No. 64 and 27 February 1996 &mdash; Question 64.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the trips undertaken by me in 1996 and by Ministers of State Burton and Mitchell since 18 October 1995 are as set out in the tables below.  The costs involved in ministerial travel are normally borne by the Department of Foreign Affairs; costs for personnel or <Col N="570" /> facilities provided by other Departments are met by the relevant Department. Costs, where appropriate, are also paid by the European Union, by receiving Governments in the case of bilateral official visits and by the Industrial Development Authority in the case of IDA promotional visits.</P>
    <P>On my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs I arranged for the allocation to my office for travel purposes to be reduced by approximately 12 per cent on that of my predecessor. This reduction has been maintained each year to date.</P>
    <P>Details of the trips undertaken by the Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste are also attached.</P>

Information relating to the years from 1987 to 1992 is not readily available.  Detailed research would be required to collate this information at a disproportionate cost in terms of staff time and resources.</P>
      <P>The costs have been broken down between the Department's own Vote and the second Vote which comes under the aegis of my Department, i.e. the Vote for International Co-operation.</P>

    <P>Since 1993 the costs of consultants on the Foreign Affairs Vote have been, in the main, related to the upgrading of the Department's financial management system and library service, the legal division and training.  However, in 1994 a consultant was also engaged to advise on the preparation of the Department's strategic management plan.</P>
    <P>The bilateral aid programme is funded by the Department's Vote for International Co-operation.  Specialist consultants are employed to assist in identifying, designing, appraising and evaluating aid projects funded under the programme.</P>
    <P>Details regarding consultancies in the Office of the Tánaiste since its establishment in 1993 are as follows: 1993, nil; 1994, £2,534.13; 1995, £26,920.87.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> Expenditure in 1994 relates to a consultancy undertaken in the context of the strategic management initiative.</P>

      <P>An official car is made available to each head of diplomatic mission for official use and solely within the area of accreditation.  Official cars are used by heads of mission and other officers in connection with official representational functions.  They also serve a wider function and are used, for example, to deliver and collect urgent messages and to transport members of Irish delegations in the course of official visits.  Because of the particular functions attaching to the roles of Permanent Representative and Deputy Permanent Representative at the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union, an official car is assigned to each.  Heads of mission in embassies located in countries with which Ireland has bilateral aid programmes function at Chargé level and have the use of official vehicles.  Each mission has a messenger driver whose responsibilities go beyond driving duties.</P>
      <P>Attached is a list which provides the total cost in the Mission year 1995, October 1994 to September 1995, of each embassy official car inclusive of current value and running costs.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995 the trade-in value of official cars had to be surrendered to the Exchequer and the full purchase cost of each replacement car was borne by my Department.  Cars may now be traded in as is the norm.  In the light of this and given the taxation arrangements which apply to the purchase and resale of official diplomatic vehicles, cars can now be replaced over a shorter time span than previously.  This will ultimately lead to significantly increased cost effectiveness in all purchases of official vehicles.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to my previous answers of 18 October and 7 December 1995 on this matter.  The Deputy can remain assured that I am satisfied with the ongoing efforts of the State agencies in following up actively those business contacts which were made at the Washington Conference and subsequently.</P>
      <P>Departments and State agencies are continuing to ensure that appropriate resources are dedicated to the enhancement of efforts to assist in establishing partnerships, technology transfers and joint ventures and other forms of business contacts between US companies and those in the Border region.  My reply of 7 December outlined the extensive follow-up activity already undertaken by Departments and State agencies and which has considerable potential to benefit companies in the Border region and beyond.  I have no doubt that the conference will lead, in the medium and longer term, to concrete results in terms of increased US investment on the island of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to be further assured that Departments and State agencies will play a full role in the follow-up conference announced by the White House on 15 March, during the Taoiseach's visit to Washington.  The <Col N="579" /> conference will take place in Philadelphia this autumn and will focus on public-private partnerships and efforts to spur growth in the region through trade, investment, joint ventures and strategic alliances.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under a specific provision of the Taxes Acts, meals provided in a staff canteen, where the canteen is available to staff generally, are exempted from a charge to tax as a benefit-in-kind.  Luncheon vouchers are also regarded, on an extra statutory basis, as being exempt from the charge up to a specific limit per day.  The possibility of raising that limit has been the subject of many representations in recent years.  However, I do not consider that any such increase is possible as it could lead to abuse and would lead to inevitable demands for concessions in relation to other benefits-in-kind.  This would be unacceptable as it would be contrary to the general objective of broadening the tax base.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 86 together.  Last year I established an inter-departmental committee to thoroughly investigate the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers and to make recommendations. Shortly before this year's budget, the committee presented its report to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee's main finding was that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax is fair and reasonable <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers.  Consequently, the committee felt that there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers. However, the committee recommended the following: that cross-Border workers should be exempted from paying the 1.25 per cent health contribution and the 1 per cent employment and training levy on their Northern Irish income; cross-Border workers should avail of the direct debit system as a means of paying their Irish tax liability which should help ease the compliance problems; and that consideration should be <Col N="582" /> given to the renegotiation of the Irish/UK 1976 Double Taxation Treaty with a view to resolving differences of interpretation which exist at present, (i.e. the precise categories of workers covered by the Governmental Service Article).</P>
    <P>Having studied and accepted all the findings of the committee, I announced on budget day that from 6 April 1996 the Northern Irish earnings of cross-Border workers will be exempted from the payment of the health and employment and training levies.  For a person with a yearly earnings of £15,000, the savings is £337.50 per annum.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the direct debit system which cross-Border workers can avail of in order to pay their Irish tax liability now applies for the preliminary tax payment due on 1 November 1996 and on 1 November of subsequent years.  Full details of this system, including an explanatory leaflet, are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners have been in negotiations with their UK counterparts with a view to resolving the differences of interpretation which exist in the present treaty.  Given that these negotiations are ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate at this stage as to the possible outcome of such negotiations.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to put on record that I am satisfied that the committee on cross-Border taxation approached the issues involved in a fair and reasoned manner.  I have accepted the committee's findings and recommendations and, where possible, I have acted upon them without undue delay.</P>

      <P>The total EU funding available for the initiative to support the peace process in Northern Ireland and Border counties (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo) will be 300 million ECU (IR£240 million) over three years (1995-97).  Funding for a further two years is likely subject to a Commission review.  Up to 80 per cent of the funding will be available for activities in Northern Ireland and at least 20 per cent for activities in the Border counties.  At least 15 per cent of the overall amount will be devoted to activities carried out in a cross-Border context.  The European Community will finance up to 75 per cent of the cost of measures under the initiative.  The balance of the cost will come from the Exchequer and other national sources.</P>
      <P>In September 1995, ADM Ltd and CPA set up a joint management committee (JMC) to take responsibility for the joint implementation of the ADM and the CPA measures within the peace and reconciliation programme.  These two intermediaries, particularly since the formal signing of the global grant agreements on 8 December 1995, have been busy setting up structures to carry out their responsibilities under the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is in agreement with the concept of a single tax clearance certificate for companies doing business with State organisations as a means of reducing unnecessary tax compliance burdens, especially in the case of small to medium-sized enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first stage in the process was the announcement in the 1994 Budget Statement of the introduction of a scheme of single tax clearance certificates for public sector contracts which was implemented with effect from 15 August 1994.  The scheme provides that a single tax clearance certificate will be valid for all public sector contracts awarded to contractors within a 12 month period commencing with the first issue of the certificate.  The single tax <Col N="586" /> clearance certificate can readily be renewed at the close of the 12-month period by direct application to the Collector-General. The indications are that this scheme is working well.</P>
    <P>The single tax clearance scheme currently applies to the award of public sector contracts only.  However, my officials are now working with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to extending the scheme to grants and subsidies paid by the State.  As many companies are also in receipt of such payments, the extension of the scheme in this area would further ease the tax compliance burden on business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provides for, <i>inter alia,</i> the making of annual written statements by senior civil and public servants of relevant personal interests which could materially influence them in performing their official duties.  In addition, the Act requires the making of an <i>ad-hoc</i> statement where a direct conflict of interest may arise, and prohibits the individual from performing the function in such circumstances, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act establishes a Public Offices Commission which will provide advice and guidelines on compliance, and will investigate possible contraventions.  As things stand, all civil servants at Principal Officer level or equivalent and <Col N="587" /> upwards, and other officers in commercially sensitive positions, have been required to make their first annual written statements and must now comply with the legal requirements regarding proximate conflicts of interests. Arrangements to impose similar requirements on comparable positions in the wider public service are currently being made.  Arising from the Act, effective procedures and mechanisms are being put in place across public bodies so as to ensure that the highest standards apply.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive legislative framework satisfies the intention of the statement in paragraph 23 of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> and supersedes the need to extend the remit of the committee on State-sponsored bodies for the specific purpose of examining allegedly unethical behaviour. In addition, the statutory provisions in the companies Acts are also <Col N="588" /> applicable to certain State-sponsored bodies.</P>

      <P>The position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The introduction of new zero rates is forbidden.  Nor would reduced rating be an option: the items in question are not on the reduced rate list in the Sixth EU VAT Directive; nor were they at a reduced rate here on 1 January 1991 (in which case a reduced rate could legally be applied on a temporary basis). Any attempt by Ireland to apply a zero rate or a reduced rate to safety equipment, which is currently at the standard rate of 21 per cent would be open to challenge in the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>However, VAT-registered fishermen would be able to recover any VAT borne on safety equipment in their normal VAT returns.  Commercial fishermen who are not registered are, nevertheless, generally able to recover the VAT borne on safety equipment in accordance with regulations made under the VAT Act.</P>

      <P>Unemployment as measured by the annual Labour Force Survey, the only reliable measure of employment and unemployment, fell from 218,000 to 192,000 between April 1994 and April 1995, while employment increased from 1,182,000 to 1,231,000 in the same period. Average employment in 1995 is estimated at 1,238,000; up from 1,193,000 in 1994.</P>
      <P>The yield from direct taxation including income tax, corporation tax, income levies and training and employment levies, increased from £5,195 million in 1994 to £5,432 million (4.6 per cent) in 1995 reflecting the increase in employment in 1995.</P>
      <P>The average number of persons on the Live Register fell from 282,000 in 1994 to 278,000 in 1995.  The total paid out by the Department of Social Welfare in unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance also fell, from £1,015 million to £1,001 million in the same period.</P>
      <P>In view of data constraints, it is not possible to give a precise estimate of the amount of taxation, if any, which would have been paid by persons who became unemployed in 1995, or the cost of unemployment compensation paid to persons who came onto the Live Register during that year.  Therefore the specific information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>Overall, the Government's macroeconomic policies, which are designed to promote low inflation and low interest rates, to which wage moderation has contributed, have underpinned strong growth accompanied by increased employment and reduced unemployment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that interest earned on moneys in the hands of sheriffs pending transmission to the Collector-General accrues to the benefit of the sheriff.  The sheriff is not required to provide particulars of this interest in the monthly return he makes to the Collector-General and, consequently, statistics of the amount of the interest are not available to Revenue.</P>
      <P>The background is that sheriffs have been permitted to retain interest on short-term deposits, as is the norm in financial transactions between solicitor and client.  In effect, this interest has been a major source of their income. The basic fees paid to the sheriffs were set in 1926 and the sheriff operation would have become non-viable if they had not been permitted to supplement their income with such interest to defray the substantial costs they incur.  A review of the statutory fees is in train and has made substantial progress.  I hope to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice shortly for revised scales of fees.  When these fees have been improved to a realistic level, sheriffs will no longer be permitted to retain interest on amounts held pending transmission to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>In the case of quarrying, where a company extracts rock from a quarry and crushes it to produce an end product, the Revenue Commissioners have agreed that this type of activity constitutes manufacturing.  The company has produced a commercially saleable product which is tangibly different from the original material.  By contrast, where a company is engaged in the extraction, washing and grading of sand and gravel, it is considered that these activities are specifically excluded from the scope of manufacturing relief by virtue of section 39 (5) Finance Act, 1980.  This type of process does not bring about any appreciable change in the character of the original product.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of correspondence from people with post polio syndrome and am aware of the symptoms of this condition which is accepted as a definite neurological diagnosis.  I have examined the case made by people with post polio syndrome for the establishment of a trust fund but, as I have already stated in this House, I consider that the range of schemes available to all people with disabilities are sufficient to meet the needs of people with this condition.  These include entitlements to apply for medical cards, drug cost subsidisation scheme, drug refund scheme, disabled person's maintenance allowance and mobility allowance.</P>
      <P>People suffering from post polio syndrome have reported a range of physical problems such as respiratory or speech difficulties, unusual fatigue and pain in muscles and joints.  The management of these symptoms is possible through health services available for people with disabilities such as orthotic services, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy services as well as home based services such as home help and aids and appliances.  In addition, patients with post polio syndrome can be assessed and their condition monitored by a neuromuscular neurologist with experience in LEP at the Neuromuscular Clinic in Beaumont Hospital.  There are no particular circumstances in relation to this condition which would warrant making special financial arrangements above those available to other people with physical disability.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The administration of the registration system for marriages is a matter for An t-Árd Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. The duties of registrars of marriages appointed in accordance with the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, are set <Col N="611" /> down in the various marriage Acts and include the taking of notice of marriage, the solemnisation of and the registration of marriages.  Each registrar is required under the marriages act to maintain an office within his/her designated district (there are currently 30 such offices within the State).</P>
      <P>A registrar may solemnise a marriage either in his own office or may register a marriage solemnised in his presence in a building, used for religious worship, which is registered for the solemnisation of marriage in accordance with the provisions of section 27 of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844.  The registrar may also solemnise a marriage at a place outside his office on foot of a special licence issued by An t-Árd Chláraitheoir in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of the Marriages Act, 1972 (number 30 of 1972).  However, an t-Árd Chláraitheoir may only grant such a licence on being satisfied that one of the parties to be married is unable to attend the office of the registrar because of serious ill health.  There is no provision in the Marriage Acts enabling a registrar to solemnise a marriage at a hotel, nor is there any provision for the registration of hotels for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office of the Registrar of Marriages for Dublin is located in a solicitor's premises at 31 Molesworth Street. I am aware that misgivings have been expressed as to the capacity of the office in relation to large wedding parties.  An t-Árd Chláraitheoir has advised, in relation to that office, that the room used for the solemnisation of marriages can accommodate between 15 and 20 guests with varying degrees of comfort. It is understood that the parties attending the majority of marriages solemnised by the registrar can easily be accommodated and that it is only in a minority of cases that the accommodation may impose a limit on the number of guests which can be accommodated. However, it is understood that within these constraints every effort is made to facilitate couples who wish to enhance the brief civil ceremony by <Col N="612" /> incorporating poetry readings or music in the occasion.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the whole area of registration law, including marriage law is under review.  The general issue raised by the Deputy is being addressed as a matter of some priority within the context of that review.</P>

      <P>In response to this Declaration a diabetic action group, with representation from professional groups and voluntary organisations (including the Irish Diabetic Association) which deal with the condition, was established.  The Department of Health has observer status on the group.</P>
      <P>In December 1995 a preliminary workshop was held by the group to investigate the current services which are available to people with diabetes. Another workshop is scheduled to take place in the near future.  The reports of these workshops will be valuable to my Department in assisting it to more effectively plan the provision of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime my Department's Health Promotion Unit has granted funding over the past few years to the Irish Diabetic Association to run diabetic awareness campaigns aimed at the general public.  My Department also continues to liaise with the World Health Organisation in order that it can <Col N="614" /> work towards achieving the targets set by the Declaration.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of concerns over possible health hazards from non-ionising radiation associated with microwave emissions from communications masts.  Telecommunications companies here are licensed by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications which has advised that companies operate within safety limits recommended by the International Radiation Protection Association.  Non-ionising radiation emissions measured here have been well within the recommended limits.</P>
      <P>All significant research into non-ionising radiation associated with electro-magnetic fields from power lines, electrical facilities and communications masts is monitored by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the ESB.  The chief technical adviser to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications provides specific technical advice in this area to my Department.  A deputy chief medical officer in my Department also maintains liaison with that Department in relation to the human health aspects.  While the general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship.  For this reason, the results of international research and studies in this area are carefully examined on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards ionising radiation, my <Col N="617" /> Department maintains close liaison with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, formerly the Nuclear Energy Board, which was established in 1992 and is the statutory body responsible for monitoring ionising radiation levels in the State.</P>

      <P>In accordance with law the VHI is a &ldquo;not-for-profit&rdquo; organisation and premium levels are set accordingly.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996, places a duty on the board to notify the Minister of proposed increases in premia.  It provides that the board can apply increases automatically after a specified short period has elapsed unless the Minister expressly issues a reasoned direction against the implementation of the increases.  I have not received notification pursuant to the Act from the <Col N="619" /> VHI of a proposed increase in premium charges this year.  It would not be appropriate for me to state what view I would take of any such proposal in the absence of full details relating to same.

      <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991, it is a function of every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  Since 1993 financial resources totalling £35 million have been made available to the boards specifically for child care developments.

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the Ballinasloe area is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  While the Western Health Board does provide some services, I understand from the board that the principal service providers in the area are the Brothers of Charity Services and the Galway County Association.</P>
      <P>Service developments to meet identified priority needs in the Western Health Board region are agreed by the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee.  This committee is representative of the Western Health Board, Western Care Association, Brothers of Charity Services, Galway County Association and three parent-family representatives nominated by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, NAMHI, one of whom is from the Ballinasloe area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brothers of Charity Services and <Col N="624" /> the Galway County Association have, in fact, carried out an examination of the needs of persons with a mental handicap in the east Galway area.  While these needs have been clearly identified, the provision of alternative locally based services has not to date been among the urgent priority needs as identified by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, on completion of the validation process in respect of the national mental handicap database later this year, to initiate a review of the implementation of both policy documents, Needs and Abilities and Services to Persons with Autism, with a view to preparing an overall medium term development plan for the services.  The development of services in the Ballinasloe area, including the provision of locally based day and residential services, will be incorporated in the plan which is being prepared by the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee and which will be submitted by the Western Health Board to my Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>A pay claim submitted by IMPACT on behalf of environmental health officers for a salary revision was processed through the standard industrial relations procedures and was the subject of two hearings by an arbitration board under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authorities and health boards.  The local government staff negotiations board, representing the health boards and the environmental health officers' union, IMPACT, agreed to refer the claim to arbitration.</P>
      <P>The claim was given detailed consideration by the arbitration board which rejected the claim on the basis that it had no merit.  By longstanding convention, decisions of the arbitration board are accepted by both sides. However, IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, rejected the arbitration report and initiated industrial action in the spring of 1995. The industrial action was eventually suspended following agreement to process the claim under Clause 2 (iii) A &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a lengthy series of meetings these negotiations ended without agreement and environmental health officers recommended their &ldquo;work to rule&rdquo; with effect from 15 January 1996.  Despite the fact that such industrial action is precluded under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i><Col N="626" /> the management side remains available for talks with the union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Indicative Drug Target &mdash; IDT &mdash; scheme was introduced in January 1993 following agreement between the Department, the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation arising out of the review of the general medical services scheme the previous year.  All parties to the agreement recognised that there was scope for an improvement in prescribing practices leading to better patient care and better use of finite resources.</P>
      <P>The IDT scheme forms part of an integrated strategy to rationalise the cost and make more effective use of prescribed drugs and medicines within the State.  The scheme encourages doctors to examine their prescribing practices with a view to availing of opportunities to achieve more effective prescribing. To assist in this process, from 1993 onwards, doctors were provided with indicative drug targets each year constructed on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted by age and sex factors.  General practioners who make savings against their targets are allowed to use a portion of the amount saved for investment in their own practices while the remaining portion is used by the health boards for investment in general practices in their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All parties to the agreement recognise that the IDT scheme provides a <Col N="630" /> realistic mechanism for securing investment funding for general practice. Consequently, there is a co-operative approach taken to the implementation of the scheme between the Department, the health boards and the IMO.  It is evident that the greater the number of doctors involved in the scheme, the greater is the benefit to general practice nationally.  To this end the IMO plays its part, at local meetings, in encouraging GPs to become more involved in the scheme.  However, the IDT scheme is purely voluntary and the individual general practitioner retains the right to prescribe as he-she considers necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Western Health Board is responsible for the management of services and deployment of staff at St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar, County Mayo.  Current personnel policy for the health service provides that health agencies which are managing <Col N="633" /> resources within allocation may fill non-consultant replacement posts, including nursing vacancies, without recourse to the Department.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, nine permanent staff nurse posts were recently filled by nurses who had previously been employed on a temporary basis. The remaining 23 temporary nurses have been accommodated on a relief panel from which temporary and locum staff are drawn in rota.</P>
      <P>The panel will continue until July this year.  No decision has been made by the Western Health Board on the extension of the panel beyond July 1996.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The approval of the EU Commission for Structural Funding for the Tallaght Hospital was given on the basis that proper management and financial controls for the projects were in place.  The Commission did not request the setting up of a Monitoring Committee.</P>
      <P>The Tallaght Hospital Board, appointed by the Minister for Health, has as its main task the planning, building and commissioning of the new Tallaght Hospital.  A project director and project management staff have been employed by the board to ensure proper management and control of all aspects of the project.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of admissions to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and each case is assessed to determine medical priority.  Should the patient be concerned that his condition has deteriorated, he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A standing committee on air ambulance services under the aegis of the Departments of Defence and Health was set up in mid-1995 on foot of the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service.  The standing committee's terms of reference are:&mdash; (a) to regularly review the operation of air ambulance services; (b) to ensure appropriate medical input and advice; (c) to specify Protocols in order to obtain maximum cost benefits and ensure the appropriate use of aircraft, and (d) to consider the adequacy of resources for air ambulance missions and jointly put forward any proposals for the improvement of the air ambulance service.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group also recommended that the question of having dedicated and purpose-equipped air ambulance aircraft should be considered within the context of the Standing Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee is currently engaged in an examination of all the options <Col N="648" /> regarding the most appropriate arrangements for the provision of air ambulance services, having regard to the recommendations of the ambulance review group, with the aim of ensuring that all available resources are utilised in the most cost effective manner possible.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the Air Corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases and this arrangement has been in place since 1965.  This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill persons over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance.  It is also provided for the removal from islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions are such as to make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient.  In addition since August 1991, the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine is also available for air ambulance transport in cases of emergency.  This service has been used at times by health boards.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is necessary to put detailed arrangements in place to ensure that an integrated service operates between the air ambulance, ground based ambulance services and hospital based accident and emergency services. All of these matters fall to be considered by the standing committee and I am of the view that any development in this area should await the recommendations of the standing committee on air ambulance services.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, my Department has also been assisting the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the preparation of the information to be supplied under EU Directive 92/117 on zoonotic diseases.  This is now an ongoing requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several zoonotic diseases are, of course, already classified as notifiable and are reported to my Department under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, as amended.  Staff from <Col N="650" /> the food unit as well as medical staff from my Department deal with issues arising from zoonotic diseases as part of their areas of responsibility.  In addition, a large number of staff employed by the eight health boards are also engaged on this work as part of their overall duties. It is not, therefore, possible to give precise information on the number of people engaged on this work.  I want to assure the Deputy, however, that the control of these diseases will continue to be regarded as a priority.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for examinations and the recruitment of people with disabilities into the Civil Service are the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission, which is an independent statutory agency operating under the aegis of the Minister for Finance. In the case of the health boards and local authorities, it is a matter for the Local Appointments Commission, which is also an independent statutory agency and operates under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment.

    <P>I have been informed by the Civil Service Commission that there are at present panels dedicated to people with disabilities in respect of the posts of clerical assistant (clerical), clerical assistant (data entry) and visually impaired telephonist.  I understand that <Col N="653" /> there were recent competitions for the posts of typist and executive officer, part of which were confined to people with disabilities, and that the results are awaited.  In addition, a new competition for the post of visually impaired telephonist has recently been advertised. People with disabilities are not restricted to applying for special competitions but are free to apply for all competitions for which they have the necessary qualifications. If notified in advance, the Civil Service Commission will make appropriate arrangements to facilitate them in participating in competitions.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities has been reached in the Civil Service and my Department has been in regular contact with the Departments of Health and the Environment with a view to maximising job opportunities for people with disabilities in the health boards and local authorities.  An officer from my Department is a member of the monitoring committee for the employment of people with disabilities which operates under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>I am awaiting the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which I expect to receive in April.  I am aware that the commission has included the area of work and training for people with disabilities in its deliberations.  When the report has been received, I will give it very careful consideration with a view to identifying what further action is required by me or my colleagues in Government, to improve the employment situation for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I undertook a total of three foreign engagements, to Strasbourg, Toronto and Beijing, between December 1994 and January 1996.  The approximate cost of these trips was £3,300, £5,700 and £42,900, respectively.

    <P>Since then I have undertaken a further three foreign engagements, the <Col N="655" /> details of which are as follows: (i) On 9 February 1996 I attended the European Women's Lobby Conference in Brussels on the Implementation of the Beijing Platform For Action, at which I was accompanied by three of my officials, Ms Margaret O'Connor, Ms Anne Kinsella and Ms Orlagh O'Farrell.  The total cost of the trip was approximately £2,300.  I was also accompanied on this trip by my spouse, at our own expense. (ii) On 9 March 1996 I attended the inauguration of President Sampaio in Lisbon at which I was accompanied by two of my officials, Ms Catherine Sheridan and Ms Anne Kinsella.  My party travelled on the Government Beechcraft.  I am advised that the approximate total cost involved, including costs incurred in the use of the aircraft, is £3,100.  (iii) On 14 March 1996 I travelled to Cleveland, USA to attend a range of official functions.  I was accompanied on this trip by my spouse. The cost of flights for this trip was approximately £3,100.  Other associated costs are not, as yet, available to my Department.</P>

      <P>The family mediation service was established in September 1986 and operated under the auspices of the Department of Justice. In the period since 1993, when my <Col N="656" /> Department took over responsibilities in relation to the service, funding of the service has more than doubled, from £134,000 in 1993 to £300,000 in 1996. Expenditure incurred by the service in 1995 was £260,000.</P>
      <P>This increase in allocation is for the purpose of implementing a programme of expansion and development of the service.  This programme comprises the employment of additional family mediators, the setting up of a second family mediation centre, at Limerick, and the use of private mediators on a contract basis to facilitate delivery of a family mediation service at other locations throughout the country.  A premises has been acquired at Limerick and services are being provided there on an occasional basis pending recruitment of staff.  The remaining measures will be phased in during the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>No projects have been assisted to date under the cultural development incentives scheme 1994-99.  On 27 February 1996, however, I announced details of the first eight arts and culture projects which I approved in principle for funding under the scheme. The projects approved in principle will on completion involve capital investments of almost £8 million, including the matching funds to be provided by the successful applicants.</P>
      <P>Details of the eight projects and the level of grant aid funding, subject to satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues with applicants, which I have approved in principle for each are set out as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the provision of a modern theatre facility in Letterkenny, County Donegal; funding of £1,500,000 approved in principle;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the provision of a modern arts centre in the Old Courthouse, Portlaoise, County Laois; funding of £1,300,000 approved in principle;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of, and extension to, existing facilities at the Cork Public Museum; funding of £900,000 approved in principle;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the renovation and extension of the Waterford Theatre Royal, an unique victorian horseshoe theatre, bringing the venue up to modern contemporary theatre standards; funding of £562,000 approved in principle;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the restoration and refurbishment to contemporary theatre standards of the Everyman Palace Theatre, Cork city; funding of £350,000 approved in principle;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of the Limerick City Gallery of Art into a modern gallery through a comprehensive conversion of, and extension to, the existing facilities; funding of £687,500 approved in principle;</P>

      <Col N="667" />&mdash;the provision of a 200 seat art house cinema in Cork city; funding of £100,000 approved in principle; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the provision of a modern arts facility in Edenville House, Roscommon; funding of £250,000 approved in principle.</P>
    <P>The total amount available to me under the scheme during the period 1994-99 is £19.7 million, which, together with matching funds to be provided by successful applicants, will enable a total capital arts and culture infrastructure of at least £26 million to be put in place under the scheme in the period up to 1999.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate the likely year by year phasing of drawdown of grant-aid by the various projects approved or yet to be approved.</P>

      <P>The Media II programme of the European Union is now effectively in operation with a total budget of 310 MECU over the five year period 1996-2000.  This level of funding represents a significant increase over the 200 MECU which was assigned to the Media I programme covering the period 1991-95.  For 1996, the first year of operation of Media II, the budget allocation is 60 MECU.</P>
      <P>Media II will operate under three areas of activity which have been identified as requiring priority attention in the development of Europe's film and television production industry.  These three areas are:&mdash; training, development and distribution.  Three administrative bodies corresponding to these three areas of activity, known as intermediary organisations, are currently being established by the European Commission and these will be assisted in their task of selecting beneficiaries in the three priority areas by juries of experts to be drawn from panels submitted by the member states.</P>
      <P>A Media II management committee, which is chaired by the European Commission, has been established whose membership comprises the EU member states and associate states which are involved in the programme.  Ireland is represented on this committee by an official of my Department and a member of Bord Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board.</P>
      <P>The Media II programme must take account of the needs of countries and regions with low levels of audiovisual production capacity and with less widely spoken languages, thereby ensuring continued support for individual projects as well as for small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 171, 189 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities, which was adopted in Washington in November 1995, is intended as a source of conceptual and practical guidance for national and-or regional authorities in devising and implementing action to preserve the marine environment.  The implications for individual countries will vary, depending on the progress made by them in putting in place strategies to deal with pollution sources affecting the marine environment, including the extent of their participation in regional agreements which share the overall objectives of the global programme.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a well developed legislative system to regulate effluent discharges and emissions containing dangerous substances through the operation of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  These controls will be strengthened on the enactment of the Waste Management Bill, 1995, which will, <i>inter alia</i>, deal with the potential threat to the marine area posed by the collection, storage, movement and disposal of hazardous waste.</P>
      <P>My Department has drawn up a national programme for implementation of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive involving total investment of an estimated £1.3 billion up to the end of 2005.  A significant proportion of this investment will be made in estuarine-coastal areas for the benefit of the marine environment.  This approach is consistent with one of the key objectives of the Global Programme of Action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the regional level, Ireland is a party to the Paris and Oslo Conventions <Col N="671" /> which have as their objective the protection of the North East Atlantic Ocean. We will participate in the work of these conventions, and of the OSPAR Convention which will replace them, in taking forward relevant recommendations of the Global Programme for Action.</P>
    <P>As regards measures to control persistent organic pollutants (POPs), the programme acknowledges that international action is needed to develop a global, legally binding instrument, for the reduction and-or elimination of emissions and discharges of these substances. The programme also recognises that it may be necessary to continue the use of certain POPs until viable substitutes are available.  Ireland is supporting international efforts directed at POPs. We are at present, together with the other contracting parties to the UN Convention on the Long-Range Transport of Air Pollution, assisting in the elaboration of Protocols to deal with persistent organic pollutants.</P>
    <P>Ireland also supports the European Union statements to the forthcoming meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development which calls for the endorsement of the conclusions of the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment on the need for an international instrument to regulate POPs.  The EU statement also seeks action in this area by the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety and UNEP.</P>

      <P>The Public Art Development Trust only very recently submitted its report to the Steering Committee established for the purposes of the public art research project.  The steering committee are considering the report and will, in turn, report to the Ministers involved. Arrangements for publication can be considered at that stage.  The trust consulted widely for the purposes of the project, including Government and non-Government agencies, arts organisations and local authorities.  The trust also consulted many interested individuals and artists, either directly or by way of round-table discussions, and carried out eight case studies to examine specific areas of public art practice.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996 provide, with effect from 1 May 1996, for the registration with local authorities of certain rented dwellings.  The fee payable by the landlord is £40 per annum for each registered dwelling.  The fee is designed to provide resources to local authorities to enable them to improve their enforcement of the range of statutory requirements (registration, rent books and standards) applicable to the private rented sector.  The fee is an allowable expense against tax and it should directly result in little, if any, <Col N="677" /> increase in rents.  Overall, the new regulations should lead to improvements in the standard of rented dwellings and benefit their tenants.</P>

      <P>I have received written submissions from residents of the Monasterboice area in relation to the matter referred to following the public consultation process in relation to the Northern Motorway (Gormanston-Monasterboice) Motorway Scheme, 1995.  A public local inquiry is being arranged into this motorway scheme at which interested persons can make their views known to the inspector.  My Department will give prior notice in the press, and inform those who made written submissions, of the date, time and venue of the inquiry.  I will consider the report of the inspector, and all written submissions received before the prescribed closing date and not withdrawn, before reaching a decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>There are up to 230 group water schemes at an advanced stage of planning at present.  These are being considered for grant approval at present in the context of the finances available for new starts in 1996.  There are a limited number of applications on hands for some time now which cannot be further progressed for various reasons including the non-availability of a suitable source of water supply, insufficient membership and overall economic viability.  Given the variable circumstances affecting group scheme applications, the variations in the manner in which different applications are progressed by their promoters, and the number of cases which may be inactive, it would be impracticable to seek to determine the longest application outstanding.</P>

      <P>In recent years there has been an increased interest in sign language and its central role in the lives of many deaf people.  This is also reflected in the education of deaf children nowadays and appropriate attention is paid to the development of sign language in individual pupils, according to their needs.  Decisions in relation to methods of communication are normally taken by schools in the context of a flexible child-centred approach which is sometimes described as total communication.</P>
      <P>Teachers who are employed in a permanent capacity in special schools and in special classes for the hearing impaired in ordinary schools are encouraged to take the diploma course for teachers of the deaf in UCD.  My Department facilitates attendance at this full-time, one-year course by providing funding for the course itself and by employing substitute teachers while continuing to pay the salaries of those participating in the course.  This course incorporates a module on sign language. The vast majority of teachers of the deaf in this country have completed this course.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department, by funding school-based courses for teachers and other courses organised by vocational education committees, has provided further training and development in sign language.  A significant number of teachers other than those directly involved in teaching the deaf, have also availed of such courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, it is not possible to ensure that training in sign language is available for all teachers and pupils in all primary schools throughout the country. However, it is my intention to continue the existing training and to develop and <Col N="700" /> extend it as much as possible.  I will be most anxious to respond favourably to applications which might be made by teachers for additional training in sign language.</P>

The intention is that measures will be put in place to improve accessibility significantly by September 1996.  Architectural planning of the additional permanent accommodation will also take full account of this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> The community school will commence operation in September 1996 and temporary additional accommodation is to be provided in the meantime to facilitate its opening.  My Department is currently examining the question of provision of permanent accommodation to meet the school's long-term requirements.</P>
    <P>A key consideration in the selection of a location for the new community school in Moate was the precise extent, configuration and cost of the sites on offer to my Department.  Initially, my Department's approach was to ask the Mercy and Carmelite Orders for sites of similar size, so as to be able to make an accurate cost comparison.  Further discussions were held to determine the precise layout of the Carmelite site because the configuration of the original site being offered was not ideal for the development of a community school and ancillary facilities.  It was in the context of these discussions that, among other matters, the question of car-parking facilities arose and the Carmelite Order decided to offer a larger site.</P>
    <P>I have already given an undertaking to arrange for a deputation to meet with officials from the planning section of my Department, to explain the decision, if such a meeting is required.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department met with the Carmelite Order or their representatives on 3 and 12 January 1996 regarding the availability of a site for the new school.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to disclose the details of these meetings.</P>
    <P>Safety is of paramount concern in the planning of all school buildings.  The combined Mercy and vocational site is located in the middle of the town of Moate and, as such, could hardly be described as adjacent to a major motorway. Prior to the amalgamation process and, in particular, the selection of a site, no concerns in relation to road safety were brought to my attention.  Nonetheless, architectural planning will take full account of the need for a safe set-down <Col N="709" /> and pick-up point for pupils being transported to the new school.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the control and management of a vocational education committee's financial scheme lies with the committee. Day to day control and management functions are the responsibility of the chief executive officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As there was over-expenditure by County Westmeath vocational education committee in each of the years 1989 to 1994, such over-expenditure was approved by the committee since, at <Col N="710" /> each of its monthly meetings during those years, it approved the monthly expenditure as presented by the acting chief executive officer.  Approved budgets were not exceeded in 1995.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the inspector appointed to examine the management of its financial affairs by County Westmeath vocational education committee found that the financial information furnished to the committee &mdash; and as recorded in the minutes &mdash; was not adequate for the proper exercise of the control function.</P>
    <P>Chief executive officers have a statutory duty under section 61 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1925, to make objection at the relevant committee meeting to any action proposed by the committee which would result in an illegal payment or a deficiency or loss in or to the committee's funds.  There is no evidence in the minutes of the County Westmeath vocational education committee meetings that the acting chief executive officer exercised his function in this regard in relation to the over-expenditure.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the inspector's report on the management of the financial affairs of County Westmeath vocational education committee the Minister has serious concerns about the operation of the vocational education committee.  A letter was issued by the Department to the acting chief executive officer expressing the concerns of the Minister.  The letter also stated the Minister's intention to consider whether it would be in the best interest of the vocational education committee if the acting chief executive officer were to cease acting in that capacity.  Following subsequent correspondence and submissions on the matter the acting chief executive officer was informed by letter dated 8 May 1995 of the Minister's intention to remove him from the office of acting chief executive officer.  He was invited to make any further representations he might wish before the Minister proceeded with his removal.  On 23 May the acting chief executive officer's solicitors conveyed <Col N="711" /> his decision to take early retirement with immediate effect.</P>
    <P>Section 108 (1) of the Vocational Education Act, 1930 provides for the dissolution of a vocational education committee by order of the Minister.  The following extract outlines two of the circumstances in which a Minister may dissolve a vocational education committee:</P>
    <P>If and whenever</P>
    <P>(a) the Minister is satisfied after the holding of a local inquiry that the duties of a vocational education committee are not being duly and effectively discharged by such committee; or</P>
    <P>(b) a vocational education committee wilfully neglects to comply with any lawful order, direction, or regulation of the Minister;</P>
    <P>the Minister may by order dissolve such committee and, as he/she may think fit, either order ... a new election of members of such committee or transfer the property and the several powers and duties of such committee to any body or person or persons.</P>
    <P>County Westmeath vocational education committee has been directed to comply in the future with its statutory requirement to operate within its approved budget.  The committee has been informed that non-compliance with this direction will be regarded as wilfully neglecting to comply with a direction of the Minister under section 108 (b) of the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  In such circumstances, the Minister could take action to dissolve the committee.  I have received from the committee an undertaking that, in future, it will adhere to its statutory obligation to remain within its annual approved budget.</P>

      <P>County Westmeath vocational education committee, at its meeting of 11 January 1993, approved the sealing and signing of an agreement to purchase a building adjacent to the courthouse in Delvin in order to expand the existing youthreach centre.  The agreement was signed in January 1993 by the chairperson of County Westmeath vocational education committee, Mr. Henry Abbot and Mr. Padraig Dunne, acting chief executive officer. The purchase price agreed was £30,000 and £10,000 of this was paid on 11 January 1993.  An engineer/architect's report was not received prior to the agreement.</P>
      <P>The proposals for use of the premises was to provide a youthreach centre and residential/catering facility when the building had been renovated.  However, the premises has not been used for either of these purposes, and my Department has now approved the disposal of this property.  This will not affect the delivery of the youthreach programme which is housed in an adjacent building.  My Department approved this provision and funding, under the usual conditions, of a youthreach centre in Delvin but did not sanction the purchase of a building for this purpose. Youthreach is usually provided in rented premises.</P>

      <P>History and geography is a core subject for junior certificate pupils in secondary schools.  It is not a core subject for pupils of vocational or community or comprehensive schools, but in fact 740 out of a total of 772 second level schools offer history at junior certificate level.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the Education White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> the primary objective of the junior cycle is for students to complete a broad balanced and coherent course of study in a variety of curricular areas relevant to their own personal development and to allow them to achieve a level of competence in these which will enable them to proceed to senior cycle education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper also indicates that the curricular framework at junior cycle has as one of its objectives that all students in accordance with their abilities and aptitudes will have experienced <Col N="714" /> or achieved &ldquo;a knowledge and appreciation of their social, cultural and physical heritage and environment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The White Paper states that the programme for all pupils in all schools at junior cycle will include a core of Irish, English, mathematics, a science or technological subject and at least three further subjects from a wide range of full and short courses.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to look at the current curriculum provision as outlined in <i>Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools</i> and realign in accordance with the objectives of the White Paper.

      <P>The White Paper on education, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> sets out Government policy in this area. The vocational education system plays and will continue to play, through the education boards, a significant role in the development and provision of education services.  It has been decided that there will be legislative reform and rationalisation of the vocational education committee system.</P>
      <P>The White Paper states an important factor in considering the geographic remit of vocational education committees was the need for a sufficiently large area to provide for the effective concentration, rather than a wide dispersal, of resources.  Judged by this criterion, the areas of jurisdiction of many of the existing vocational education committees would appear to be too small to be cost effective.</P>

    <P>The commission on school accommodation needs, which commenced work <Col N="716" /> on 1 March, will, as a first task, examine the existing vocational education committee structure and report and make recommendations on the rationalisation of vocational education committees. The report and recommendations will be set in the context of the establishment, functions and responsibilities of the education boards.  The commission will also have full regard to the key principles and policy aims set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The commission will report within three months of its establishment and its report will be published.  The legislative rationalisation of vocational education committees will be implemented in advance of the formal establishment of education boards, taking full account of the recommendations of the commission.</P>

      <P>Provision has been made for an additional 450 Youthreach places in the educational sector in 1995-96.  A district approach is being implemented in the allocation of these places, which seeks to ensure, as far as possible, complementarity with the activities of other agencies in the area and with the plans of the local area based partnerships under the Local Urban and Rural Development Operational Programme. In addition, as part of the expansion, innovative proposals have been requested which pilot new arrangements for progression for Youthreach trainees to higher levels of training, and which cater for groups with special needs, such as lone parents, young offenders, drug addicts etc.</P>
      <P>My Department has written to all vocational education committees requesting their proposals for new places on this basis.  The closing date for receipt of vocational education committee proposals is 29 March 1996.</P>
      <P>On receipt of these proposals my Department will enter into discussions at national level with FÁS and Area Development Management Ltd. before making final decisions in the matter. The application for the provision of a new Youthreach centre in County Cork will be examined in this context.</P>

      <P>In 1995 I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to undertake a review of our current approaches to the selection and support of pupils suffering educational disadvantage.  The outcome of that study was a comprehensive and complex report which was published in summary form in December 1995.</P>
      <P>In making the report publicly available, I invited interested parties to make further submissions on the subject and my invitation has attracted a significant response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently considering the findings of the Combat Poverty study as part of the process of developing a revised approach to the <Col N="729" /> selection and support of pupils suffering educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The needs of the school mentioned by the Deputy will be considered in the context of any further expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that 12 men were prosecuted under section 7 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, between 7 July 1993 and 31 December 1994.  This section makes it an offence for a person who, in a street or public place, solicits or importunes another person or other persons for the purposes of prostitution. The section does not, as can be seen, make any distinction between a person who solicits and a person who importunes.

      <P>The concept behind the new regional command structure was to provide an operational span of control which was wider than the Garda division, yet more focused than the centralised method of controlling cross-divisional operational matters from Garda headquarters in Dublin.  The new regional structure is based upon co-ordinating the activities within a group of adjoining divisions. No changes have been made to existing Garda district or divisional headquarters as a result of the new regional structure.</P>
      <P>The main factor which the Garda authorities took into account in choosing the headquarters for each region, given that the thrust behind the initiative was to co-ordinate the activities of a number of divisions, was that it be centrally located within the region.  The decision for the location was one taken by the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities considered Kilkenny to be the appropriate location because it is more centrally located within the south-eastern region.  This region includes the counties of Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford as well as a large part of County Wicklow.  Waterford will, of course, continue to be the location of the divisional headquarters of the Waterford/Kilkenny division.</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate to provide the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of gardaí involved in Operation Shannon on the grounds of security and crime prevention generally.

The question as to the likely duration of this operation is an operational one for the Garda authorities and is being kept under constant review by them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cost of Operation Shannon I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they would have to divert gardaí and other staff from normal duties to compile the information sought.

I understand however, that most of the gardaí involved in this operation are rostered for normal duty and do not, therefore, represent an additional cost.  Gardaí involved who are not rostered for normal duty would be in receipt of overtime payments.  Other costs arise from additional allowance payments e.g. subsistence, unsocial hours etc.</P>

      <P>I am recruiting 350 gardaí to the force this year and a further 350 in 1997. There are approximately 700 clerical civilian staff employed in the Garda Síochána at present which maximises the number of gardaí available for outdoor policing duties.  An information <Col N="738" /> technology plan for the force is also being implemented at present at a cost of £26 million which is expected, in due course, to lead to the release of additional gardaí from administrative tasks to operational policing duties in both urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have already implemented certain measures to control the amount of time spent by the gardaí in relation to court appearances. These measures include:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;increased use in the Dublin Metropolitan Area of the summons as an alternative to the charge procedure.</P>
      <P>&mdash;computerised summons application and issuing procedures which allow for court dates to be fixed for a rostered working day of the Garda concerned.</P>
      <P>&mdash;computerised scheduling of court cases so that cases relevant to a particular Garda are listed together for hearing.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the vehicle rectification scheme in the Dublin Metropolitan Area which allows motorists to repair vehicle faults within a specified period as an alternative to prosecution and consequent attendance in court.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the number of Garda requests for remands is kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I will also be making changes on the legislative front to reduce the amount of Garda time spent in court.  A Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation, will make changes in criminal procedure particularly with a view to reducing the amount of time gardaí spend in court.  The proposed Bill will streamline arrangements in relation to remands in custody and will provide for the giving of certain Garda evidence by certificate thus reducing the amount of Garda time spent in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> Towards the end of last year I established a working group to review the operation of the courts system and to consider the establishment of a Courts Commission which would act as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy.  The Working Group, which is being chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, has advisory and recommendatory functions and will ultimately be submitting a report to me on its findings.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the Commissioner has made recommendations to the working group concerning Garda involvement in the courts system.  This submission is expected to be taken into account by the working group when compiling its report.</P>

      <P>I am recruiting 350 gardaí to the force this year and a further 350 in 1997.

    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Of course, I am anxious to have as many gardaí as possible living in the areas in which they work, particularly in rural areas, and I understand from the Garda authorities that members of the force are encouraged to reside in, or close to, the districts in which they work.</P>

One warning telephone call has been received by a resident relating to the fires.

      <P>The practice is to provide the information sought on a divisional/district basis with the strength as at 31 December for each year.  I am informed by the Garda authorities, however, that Garda strengths are not available on a district basis prior to 1992.  I am circulating two tables.  Table A shows the strengths of the Louth/Meath Division for the years from 1985 to 1991.  Table B shows the strength for each District within the Louth/Meath Division from 1992 to 1995.  It should be noted that Ashbourne Station is within the Balbriggan District, Dunboyne and Dunshaughlin Stations are within the Trim District and Athboy and Ballivor Stations are within the Kells District.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not maintained <Col N="752" /> in a manner which would enable the details requested to be provided.</P>
      <P>The general position for disability benefit claimants in the context of equal treatment payments is that arrears of adult and child dependant increases are payable on paid claims during the period 24 December 1984 to 15 November 1986.</P>
      <P>The effective date for entitlement to transitional payments for people who were in receipt of disability benefit is 17 November 1986.  In order to qualify for transitional payments, a person is required to have been receiving payment, inclusive of an adult dependant increase, on any day in the week prior to that date and to have lost the adult dependant increase under the new conditions which came into effect on that date.  A claimant not in receipt of disability benefit in respect of 17 November 1986 did not qualify for transitional payments.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a retirement pension) registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account in satisfying the first two conditions but <Col N="753" /> cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
    <P>A majority of the National Pensions Board in its final report &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System&rdquo; made a recommendation that the arrangements for pre-1953 contributions should be abolished.</P>
    <P>A majority of board members, however, considered that this facility should be retained and allowed to end naturally (which will happen at the end of the contribution year 2002-2003).</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board report is at present being studied in detail within my Department.  I will bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report based on detailed considerations and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as substituted by paragraph 3 of the 6th Schedule to the Act, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in the case of a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The legislation also enables the Minister to make regulations prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which a supplement may be paid, the class or classes of persons to whom a supplement may be paid and the amount of supplement that may be paid, and this has been done in S.I. 382 (Social Welfare (Consolidated SWA) Regulations) of 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> Article 9 (2) (g) (iii) of the regulations requires the health board to be satisfied, in deciding entitlement to a rent supplement, that the rent payable by the applicant &ldquo;is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To comply with this legislative provision, each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of the various classes of persons, as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
    <P>In addition, Article 12 (1) of the regulations specifies that the amount of weekly rent supplement paid will be calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.  However, the legislation requires that the health board must be satisfied that the amount of rent supplement payable must not exceed such amount as the health board considers reasonable to meet the applicant's residential needs.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the legislative requirements of both these Articles, all health boards set maximum rent limits in respect of the various classes of persons (e.g. single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc.).  Such limits are set by the health board using local knowledge of reasonable rents for private rented accommodation within and across the health board area.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has advised that, in respect of single persons the maximum rent level on which a supplement will be based is £35 per week. The board is of the opinion that suitable accommodation is available to single people throughout the health board area at this level of rent.  On this basis an applicant whose means do not exceed the SWA rate, and who meets all the requirements of the legislation, would receive a rent supplement of £29 per week.</P>
    <P>An applicant who chooses to live in accommodation costing above the set <Col N="755" /> limit will generally be expected to pay the additional costs themselves. However, in very exceptional circumstances, for example where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances, the board will consider basing the supplement on the higher rent level having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Exchange rates can fluctuate frequently.  In view of this and the fact that a considerable number of Irish non-contributory pensioners are in receipt of British pensions, it would not be practicable to reassess entitlement to old age non-contributory pension each time currency exchange rates move.  A realistic approach for resolving this problem has, therefore, been adopted by my Department. When calculating means based on EU pensions, the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism which is used within the EU in relation to certain social security transactions between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in the value of sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pensions from my Department provided <Col N="756" /> their means do not exceed IR£66 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension and whose means have reduced as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment at any time.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions, who, for instance, may be waiting for the non-contributory old age pension application to be processed, or who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind he may wish to give me the details so that it can be investigated to ensure that the claimant is in receipt of full entitlements.</P>

No fax machines have been provided for their homes.  The cost of each mobile telephone was approximately £400 and the average monthly cost including rental, call charges etc. amounted to £96 for the two phones over the past year.</P>

      <P>No civil servant in my Department is provided with a car by the State.</P>
      <P>Of the three bodies which are in my area of responsibility, only the Chief Executive of the Pensions Board is provided with a car.  In accordance with the arrangements recommended in report 30 of the Review Group on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, the officer is permitted to use the car for private as well as for official purposes. In accordance with the provisions recommended by the Review Group, an annual deduction equivalent to 20 per cent of the list price of the car is made from the salary of the Chief Executive in respect of private use of the car.  In this respect, an amount of £2,646 has been deducted annually since 30 July 1991.</P>
      <P>I might mention that, as the Pensions Board is a self-funding body, no cost arises to the Exchequer from this arrangement.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that, in accordance with long standing arrangements, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Durkan, provides his own car in place of a State car. Under these arrangements, two civilian drivers are employed by the Department.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  In 1994, the scheme was extended to include survivors of pass-holders who are 60-65 years of age.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.7 million.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the free travel scheme to all people aged 65, or over, would have cost implications which would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be interested in the following measures in place to support the role of women in rural society: Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99 under the Structural Funds, Teagasc are committed to providing training for promoting the role and active participation of women in rural society.  In order to facilitate the participation of women in Teagasc training courses, a number of the adult courses will be reserved for women in 1996, with an anticipated enrolment of about 700 women.</P>
      <P>The training needs of women were the subject of a study commissioned by Teagasc and carried out in 1995 with funding under the EU NOW initiative. Their training programme covers the following areas: the certificate in farming now includes a module stressing the importance of involving women in the whole decision making process in relation to agriculture and rural development; specific courses are provided for rural women on personal development, start-your-own business, food enterprise, etc; since 1994 under the Operational Programme, new rural enterprise courses have been provided in the food, tourism, horticulture and horse development areas and it is encouraging to note that 78 per cent of the participants in 1994-95 were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc, in association with FÁS and <Col N="800" /> CERT, are engaged in a project to develop a gender proofing system in their organisations.</P>
    <P>Progress in all of these areas is monitored by this Department and will come up for discussion at the next meeting of the Monitoring Committee of the Operational Programme on which the social partners are represented on 28 March 1996.</P>
    <P>No new measures are proposed.  In the programme as it operates, while there is no specific emphasis in favour of women, all of the approved groups must give equal access to women in all of their training and project activities.</P>
    <P>A target of 40 per cent representation of women on the boards of the approved Leader groups has been set.</P>
    <P>Training: the Rural Training Advisory Committee (RUTAC) is well advanced in establishing a new rural development training course in business establishment and development which will be provided by Teagasc and other training agencies &mdash; FÁS, CERT, etc. Particular provision will be made to encourage women to participate in the new course.</P>
    <P>Rural Development Policy Advisory Group: This broadly representative group has been established to advise on the formulation of future policy.  Among the issues which the group will report to the Minister on is the involvement and participation of women in rural development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish pig industry has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past decade.  A rationalisation programme has been undertaken which resulted in the replacement of a large number of outdated and small-scale slaughtering plants by eight high-standard large scale plants.  Over £90 million in total has been invested, by the industry itself, by the State, and by way of FEOGA grants, in this programme.  Currently the industry is one of the most modern and efficient in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The pigmeat sector now has the structure and capability to achieve further market driven expansion.  Our current level of production of pigs more than covers our home consumption needs and therefore the industry needs to find markets for a growing exportable surplus.</P>
      <P>A key requirement will be the expansion of our current range of products. Consumer trends are moving towards prepared foods and the industry will have to react to this.  In this regard, through a marketing and promotion programme, An Bord Bia, in conjunction with pigmeat processing companies, have been giving greater attention to marketing strategy and have made significant progress in improving the appreciation of the quality and image of their product.  The market for added value product has been identified as possessing the most potential for expansion. Prepared consumer foods for direct retail sales and for the catering trade is another category which is being targeted.</P>
      <P>EU aid is available via the Food Sub-Programme 1994-1999.  The programme provides EU aid for the improvement of cutting and processing capacities in the pigmeat sector, subject to certain limitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> Forbairt, which now sees the Irish pigmeat processing industry in a competitive rather than an expansionary phase, is engaged with the principal firms in the pigmeat industry in an exercise to determine the relative competitiveness of the Irish pigmeat processing companies against key overseas competitors. They are also working closely with industry in the identification and development of new products and processes.</P>

      <P>Under section 4 of the Agricultural (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988 Teagasc is charged, <i>inter alia,</i> with the provision of educational services in agriculture and horticulture.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Teagasc will receive a grantin-aid of £45.882 million from my Department, representing an increase of 2.7 per cent on 1995.  It is expected that the organisation will receive a further £25 million approximately from EU and other sources.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for Teagasc to prioritise the allocation of the resources at its disposal to the various programmes and activities for which it is responsible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the private colleges, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 77, 227, 237 on 30 January 1996.  I am pleased that, in the meantime, Teagasc has decided to allocate £200,000 to these colleges for maintenance works.</P>

      <P>Up to 31 December 1995, after which date the administration charges payable in respect of forestry development grants no longer applied, 4,500 persons had paid charges in relation to private afforestation grants.  Under all grant schemes in the forestry sector to which these charges applied, 8,500 applications paid charges resulting in a total of £4.5 million collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 23 January, 1996 the removal of this charge, with effect from 31 December 1995, was carried out in order to promote the development of the forestry sector, particularly with regard to farmers, by reducing input costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379, 380, 381, 382, and 383 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the judgment of the High Court of 14 December 1994, which upheld the legality of certain veterinary fees, agreement was reached between <Col N="830" /> my Department and the Irish Meat Processors' Association on an amended system for the recovery of the cost of the meat inspection service.  The main terms of the agreement were: (i) the EU standard charges for the supervision of slaughtering and cutting would be imposed; (ii) an overtime charge of £10-person-hour would be imposed in respect of supervision undertaken outside of the hours 7.30 a.m.-6.30 p.m. on weekdays and at weekends or public holidays; (iii) a charge of £7.50-person-hour would be imposed in respect of supervision on cold stores attached to slaughter-cutting plants; (iv) all of the arrears of the veterinary inspection fees, subject to a percentage reduction in respect of the overtime element which had built up during the period of the dispute over the implementation of S.I. 177 of 1992 would be paid in three equal instalments during 1995, 1996 and 1997; (v) the Department agreed to engage a consultancy firm to (a) isolate the costs related to market control within the overall cost of the meat inspection service and (b) make recommendations for the more efficient delivery of the service; and (vi) the IMPA agreed to withdraw their Supreme Court appeal of the High Court judgment.</P>
    <P>This agreement took effect from 13 March 1995 but it did not involve any time limit.</P>
    <P>My Department has received payment of moneys in respect of the arrears referred to at (iv) above.</P>
    <P>With regard to the status of this agreement, I am prepared to continue with those aspects not affected by the new arrangements for the recovery of the costs of the meat inspection service which I announced on 12 March.  I should point out that the Irish Meat Processors Association have not fully complied with the terms of the agreement in that they have not withdrawn their Supreme Court appeal of the December 1994 High Court judgment.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements are fully consistent with the EU Directive 93/118/EC on the recovery of meat inspection costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> The consultancy report by Ernst and Young on the meat inspection service has not yet been completed.  It is my intention to publish this report when it is finalised.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court heard the appeal on behalf of British Nuclear Fuels on 24 and 25 January 1996, against a previous High Court ruling that an action against the company can be heard in the Irish courts.  The Supreme Court has reserved its judgment on this particular preliminary issue.  Although Ireland and the Attorney General are named as codefendants in a substantive case to be taken by the County Louth residents, the Government has in fact supported the County Louth Group in resisting British Nuclear Fuels' application in both the High Court and Supreme Court.</P>

    <P>I understand, however, that An Post already operates job-sharing and has recently tabled proposals for discussion <Col N="841" /> with the principal union which would widen that availability of arrangements to facilitate employees who wish to work reduced hours.  The company is disposed to consider requests for any such facilities from individual employees, on their merits, having regard to the degree of need of the employee concerned and to it being possible to make satisfactory arrangements in agreement with the employee and others concerned to cater for the work without additional cost or detriment to the quality of work performance/service provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1988, my Department has grant-aided the Dublin based charity Energy Action, which provides energy conservation and advice services for the elderly and low income groups in the Dublin area free of charge.  The services provided by Energy Action include attic insulation, draught proofing, the fitting of lagging jackets and smoke alarms and the provision of practical energy conservation advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre is currently involved in a pilot initiative, through the local area partnerships, which will see the Energy Action model replicated in various parts of the country.  As a result of a call for tender issued in 1995, four new groups will receive support as part of this initiative.  These projects were <Col N="842" /> chosen after a rigorous evaluation process and will be part funded to operate an effective energy conservation programme for low income groups and the elderly in their areas, free of charge. The programme will operate for six months on a pilot basis starting in mid-April and will result in improvements to 500 homes.</P>
    <P>While none of the four groups to be supported in this instance is located in the Cork area, I must emphasise that this action is a pilot only.  A further call offering support over a longer period will be considered following an assessment of the outcome of the pilot stage.</P>

      <P>I would again refer the Deputy to my earlier reply of 18 October 1995 to Deputy Callely on this matter.  Details of trips made by the Minister of State and I since October 1995 to date are in the following table.</P>
      <P>All trips have been funded from the Department's budget other than where a refund of airfare is recoverable from the EU.  The total cost of such trips, which are indicated by an astirisk, takes account of the recoverable air fare.  I should add that the total cost of some recent trips has yet to be finalised as hotel bills that are processed through the relevant Irish Embassy have yet to be received for payment in my Department.</P>

      <P>There are no plans in existence or proposed for nuclear shelters in Dublin and throughout the country for use in the event of a nuclear accident in peacetime. In the event of an accident involving a nuclear installation, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will provide advice to the Government on measures to be taken for the protection of members of the Irish public.  These measures will depend upon the severity of the accident and the degree to which Ireland would be affected.  It is not envisaged that such an accident would require the provision of special nuclear shelters.</P>
      <P>Details of the nuclear accident emergency plan are set out in the booklet &ldquo;National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents&rdquo; published in 1992 by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Defence that in a wartime emergency situation, special purpose-built shelters are not considered necessary and policy is based on the idea of domestic refuge rooms prepared by householders themselves with the aid of advice provided by the Department of Defence.  Such advice is conveyed in a booklet which is available from the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>A major reform of the Defence Forces based on the report of the efficiency audit group is now taking place.  On 5 March last the Government approved the plan drawn up by the implementation group, which was established to <Col N="859" /> prepare a fully costed three year implementation plan covering phase 1 of this reform process.</P>
      <P>The plan proposes the relocation of the Air Corps element currently located at Gormanston to Baldonnel.  This proposal will be considered in the context of the overall reorganisation plan and the implementation group's recommendation that the Air Corps should be the subject of a special study to be carried out during the first phase of the plan.  It is expected that this review will commence shortly.  The question of the closure of Gormanston Camp, or indeed any other military installation does not arise.  Besides the Air Corps, there are other Permanent Defence Force units located at Gormanston.  It is not the practice, for security reasons, to give details of the numbers of personnel located in military installations.</P>

      <P>Twenty six empty canisters were found on our shores this year.  They posed no danger whatsoever.  The canisters have been identified as marker location marine canisters or smoke candles as they are commonly known.  They are approximately 16 inches in length and three to five inches in diameter.</P>
      <P>The canisters were found at the following locations:</P>
      <P>County Cork: 3 at Inchydoney; 1 at Castletownbere; 2 at Ballycotton; 1 at Clonakilty; 1 at Garryvoe, Middleton; 2 at Youghal.</P>
      <P>County Wexford: 1 at Ballinesker; 1 at Ravenpoint; 3 at Cullenstown/ Black-swell; 3 at Courtown; 2 at Carne; 1 at Cullenstown Strand; 1 at Rosslare; 1 at Kilmore Quay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> County Wicklow: 2 at Arklow, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>County Waterford: 1 at Ardmore.</P>
    <P>The canisters found at Inchydoney, Castletownbere, Clonakilty, Youghal and Cullenstown-Blackswell are, I understand the first of their type ever reported on our shores.  The canisters were marked with the words calcium phosphide.  When calcium phosphide comes in contact with water-damp air it gives off smoke and phosphine for about five minutes.  Because phosphone gas decomposes rapidly in water, these canisters are highly unlikely to pose any danger to fish stocks.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the empty canisters washed up on our shores are regular marine signal candles.  These types of empty canisters are washed up on our shores each year due to storms at sea.</P>
    <P>Empty canisters pose no danger to the public.  However, precautions must be taken in the event of full canisters being found.  A procedure to deal with such incidents is in place: when a canister is found the gardaí will notify Army Operations who will immediately investigate the finding and on the basis of the investigation will decide what course of action should be taken.  The marine emergency service division of the Department of the Marine issues alert notices and navigational warnings advising mariners on how to deal with such situations.</P>
    <P>One full canister was washed up on the shore at Ballycastle, County Mayo. The gardaí immediately notified Army Operations who exploded the canister on the beach.  The investigation into the sources of these canisters is being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's question in relation to munitions dumped off our coast the position is that the UK authorities dumped redundant explosives, non-chemical and chemical munitions at the following locations: (a) Sites located off the coast of Donegal at depths from 3,000 to 8,000 feet (nearest site 65 miles off the coast).  (b) Sites located off the coast of Cork/Kerry at depths from <Col N="875" /> 2,000 feet to 10,500 feet (nearest site 250 miles).  (c) Beaufort Dyke &mdash; 25 miles off the coast of Larne at depths from 600 feet to 1,000 feet.</P>
    <P>Details of munitions dumped are as follows: (a) Between 1945 and 1957 a total of 150,000 tonnes of mustard, phosgene and brombenzyl cyanide charged munitions were dumped off the coasts of Donegal and Cork-Kerry. Method of disposal was in scuttled vessels. (b) Between 1955 and 1956 17,000 tonnes of Tabun charged munitions were dumped off the coast of Donegal. Also dumped were 300 tonnes of arsenical compounds and 3 tonnes of toxic seed dressing comprising commercially available fungicides Granosan and Panogene. Method of disposal was in sealed vessels.  (c) In 1948, 14,000 tonnes of artillery rockets filled with phosgene were dumped in waters off Beaufort Dyke.  Method of disposal involved the jettisoning of munitions packed in crates.  (d) An estimated 1 million tonnes of non-chemical munitions were dumped at Beaufort Dyke up to 1976. Method of disposal involved the jettisoning of munitions packed in crates.</P>

      <Quest>the conclusions, if any, that were reached in the joint Anglo-Irish investigation of underwater munitions dumping outside the Beaufort Dyke area in respect of the 30 canisters recently washed up near Inishowen, County Donegal, and rumours of 15 sealed U-boats on the ocean floor off Donegal; and the discoveries, if any, that were made in the recent search off the Donegal coast.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service reported that 20 phosphorous devices were washed up around Culdaff on the Inishowen Peninsula, County Donegal in November 1995.  The Irish Army disposed of the devices.  These devices probably came from the Beaufort Dyke dumpsite.  This had reinforced my view that the Irish and UK Government must agree a coordinated approach to the issue of munitions dumped at sea.</P>
      <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, met with the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and the Environment, the Scottish Office, the Earl of Lindsay and the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State, Ministry of Defence, the Earl Howe in London last month to discuss the drawing up of a management plan for the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lords Howe and Lindsay confirmed that while there is no conclusive evidence that the British Gas pipeline disturbed munitions in the Beaufort Dyke, <Col N="882" /> they accept that it is likely that this is the case.</P>
    <P>A firm commitment from the UK Government to put in place a system of monitoring and management of the dumpsite was secured.  A number of key points were agreed: (1) The Scottish Office will undertake a new study this spring on the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite in order to remap and re-chart the extent of the dumpsite and the distribution of munitions within the site.</P>
    <P>(2) It was agreed that UK and Irish scientists will co-operate on the methodology and methods of analysis for the study and they will jointly review the data emerging.</P>
    <P>(3) The gas pipe-line between Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be commissioned until its safety has been assured following assessment by the UK Health and Safety Executive.  UK and Irish scientists will liaise in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>(4) The re-mapping of the dump site will be completed before a decision is made on the route of the proposed electricity interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland.  The installation of the interconnector will draw on lessons learned from the laying of the gas-pipe line.</P>
    <P>(5) Based on the studies which are now to be carried out, the UK Ministries intend to issue guidelines on the management of activity around the dump site.</P>
    <P>(6) When the 1996 study of the Beaufort Dyke dump site is completed there will be a further meeting in Dublin between the two UK Ministers and Minister of State Gilmore to assess the results and to discuss what further steps are required at that stage.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the outcome of this meeting and I am satisfied that a high degree of co-operation has been achieved.</P>
    <P>In response to the Deputy's question in relation to the discoveries of U-boats on the ocean floor off the Donegal Coast, the position is that at the end of <Col N="883" /> 1945 and during 1946, the UK authorities scuttled approximately thirty-seven German U-boats in an area extending from 18 miles out to 45 miles off the North-North West coast of Malin Head at depths ranging from 54 to 110 metres of water.  These boats were scuttled following decommissioning during the course of &ldquo;Operation Deadlight&rdquo; which was an operation to dispose of the surrendered German submarine fleet at the end of the last war.  A further 17 U-boats were lost in action during the Second World War and are scattered in areas up to 90 miles off Malin Head at depths of 50 to 100 metres. These U-boats have been charted on British Admiralty Charts.  Because of the depths at which they are located they pose no danger to navigation.</P>

      <P>The Salmon Management Task Force was established in October 1995.  Its brief is to develop practical proposals for the management of wild salmon stocks, in line with stated policy objectives and with full regard for the interests of those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation be they commercial or angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary policy objective is the conservation of wild salmon stocks and to maximise on a sustainable basis the value to the economy of the wild salmon resource.  The decision to initiate a thoroughgoing review of salmon management strategies in full consultation with all relevant interests in order to inform future policy directions was taken in light of the ongoing national and international debate on the conservation and management needs for the <Col N="884" /> wild Atlantic salmon resource, reflected in the very many submissions made to me and subsequently to the Task Force.</P>
