      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I attended the inaugural Asia-Europe Meeting in Bangkok on 1 and 2 March last.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>The participants in the meeting were all the countries of the European Union, the European Commission, the seven ASEAN countries, as well as Japan, China and South Korea.  In almost all cases delegations were led at either Head of State or Head of Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to report that the meeting was an outstanding success. <Col N="1154" /> Particular tribute must be paid to Singapore as the original instigators of the idea and to the Thai chairmanship of the first meeting.  I have arranged to have a copy of the chairman's statement at the conclusion of the meeting placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The summit established a new comprehensive Asia-Europe partnership aimed at strengthening links between Asia and Europe to promote peace, global stability and prosperity.  This partnership will be specifically forged through fostering political dialogue and reinforcing co-operation in economic and other areas.</P>
    <P>The meeting agreed a number of specific follow-up measures, the full details of which are set out in the chairman's statement.  The primary initial focus is on increasing trade and investment flows involving both the Government and the private sectors.  In addition, provision has been made to establish structures to promote community, cultural and student exchanges between Asia and Europe.  There will be a full review of the operation of the partnership at the next ASEM to be held in Britain in 1998.</P>
    <P>In my contributions to the plenary session of the meeting I underlined the importance of adherence to international norms on human rights.  I pointed out that a good human rights position will underpin economic development.  I welcome the commitment by the meeting to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  I emphasised also the need for reform of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>At the summit I had formal bilateral meetings with the Heads of State or Governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and South Korea.  I also had informal discussions with the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, Japan and Vietnam, as well as the President of the Philippines and the German Chancellor. In all my bilateral discussions with Asian leaders I underlined the attractions of Ireland as an investment <Col N="1155" /> location and our desire to improve trading links.  I will ask the relevant Ministers and agencies here to follow up on the contacts I made.  In my bilateral meetings I also raised, where relevant, human rights concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach raise the problems of East Timor during his meetings in Bangkok and what progress, if any, did he make following on the efforts of the Tánaiste in this important matter some weeks ago?  Will the Taoiseach report to the House on the latest position in regard to the Government's efforts to assist the people of East Timor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a substantial meeting with President Saharto of Indonesia at which I raised the East Timor issue; in fact, I raised the matter with him on two separate occasions.  I indicated Ireland's concern about it and our concern for the people of East Timor and their rights.  I also said Ireland is anxious to facilitate a settlement of the differences that exist during its Presidency of the European Union. In response to this, the President of Indonesia outlined the position as he saw it and indicated a willingness to have people visit East Timor to see the situation for themselves.  I welcomed in particular this suggestion of visits and I will take the steps necessary to arrange for this from an Irish point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>All-party negotiations on a settlement will commence on 10 June.  The British Prime Minister and I have made clear, both in the communiqué itself and in statements on it, that we want these negotiations to be fully inclusive.  Full participation by Sinn Féin is contingent, but is contingent only, on a restoration of the IRA cease-fire of August 1994. That restoration is the only requirement for the resumption of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin.  It is also the only requirement for that party's full engagement in the intensive multilateral consultations now under way and in the substantive all-party negotiations.  I call on the republican movement to seize this opportunity now, in the interests of the people they represent and in the interests of the negotiated settlement which we all want.</P>
      <P>Official level contact with Sinn Féin is being maintained.  Such contacts with that party, and with other parties to the Northern Ireland issue, are confidential. In keeping with the position adopted by previous Governments, I do not propose to comment on the substance of any of these ongoing exchanges.  To do so would undermine their usefulness as an aid to Government deliberations and decisions.</P>
      <P>In the lead-up to the recent summit, I had an intensive series of contacts with relevant parties, including a very useful meeting on 14 February with the British Labour Party spokesperson on Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the focus should now be on the commencement of all-party negotiations and on the preparatory work now under way in that regard. <Col N="1158" /> The process of intensive multilateral consultations with the Northern Ireland parties, which began yesterday, is being undertaken by the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The elective process, the arrangements for all-party negotiations and the issue of parallel referendums will be addressed in the course of these consultations. The British Prime Minister and I will review the outcome of these consultations immediately after their conclusion on 13 March.  As we have made clear in the Joint Communiqué, all-party negotiations will be convened on 10 June.</P>
    <P>In view of recent public speculation about the content of a conversation which I had with the SDLP Leader, Mr. John Hume, I wish to say that I had a large number of consultations and contacts with Mr. Hume prior to the summit, covering all aspects of the ongoing situation and the various options to be dealt with.  As Mr. Hume indicated, all my conversations with him were, and will remain, confidential.  It is important, in the interest of the peace process, that I should be able to have entirely confidential and thorough consultations with political leaders.</P>
    <P>In all such contacts with him, and with the many other people to whom I spoke in the days leading up to the summit, I was guided by one overriding goal, that of securing that week, and without delay, the setting of a specific date for all-party negotiations.  This was and is the essential route to renewing the peace process.  All conversations that I had in that period had that object, and that object only in mind.  Speed in setting a specific date was important in view of the unstable situation that had been created by the revocation of their ceasefire by the IRA.  I am glad I was successful in this task.</P>
    <P>I wish to report to the House that, following earlier contacts, Mr. David Trimble MP, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, proposed, in a letter to me on Saturday last, that it might be helpful if an Ulster Unionist delegation were to meet the leaders of this coalition <Col N="1159" /> Government at a mutually convenient time and place.  I will be responding positively to Mr. Trimble later today on behalf of my colleagues and myself with a view to an early meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When last week's communiqué, which contained significant advances that we welcomed on this side, was announced, it would have been reasonable to expect that the Government might have tried to prepare the ground for events arising from it.  Who was responsible for yesterday's fiasco outside Stormont buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The ground rules for the consultations which commenced on Monday were made known well in advance.  They clearly stated that ministerial consultations would be available to parties that were not involved in association with an ongoing campaign of violence.  It was also made clear that because of the regrettable decision of the IRA to recommence operations and suspend its cease-fire that ministerial contacts with Sinn Féin would not take place until the cease-fire was reinstated.</P>
      <P>However, it has equally been made clear that both Administrations are willing to hold official level consultations with Sinn Féin.  What took place in Stormont yesterday was a series of ministerial, as distinct from, official level consultations. I have no doubt that Sinn Féin will be facilitated in holding official level consultations at an early opportunity and that at a very early moment it will be successful in persuading the IRA to cease its military operations and campaign and as a result, it will be possible to resume ministerial contact with Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>The situation I outlined was well known to all those who participated in yesterday's discussions, including all those who presented themselves at Stormont buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach happy that John Hume and Séamus Mallon understood yesterday's arrangements to <Col N="1160" /> be different and that Mr. Trimble did not receive an invitation?  Can the Taoiseach confirm whether we are responsible for yesterday's arrangements, whether the Tánaiste and Sir Patrick Mayhew were jointly responsible or were we going along with arrangements being made by the British Government and then claim we were not responsible for the mess that occurred yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to refer to the matter in the way the Deputy described.  The consultations commenced yesterday with a substantial bilateral meeting between Sir Patrick Mayhew and the Tánaiste, which was followed by a substantial meeting with the SDLP. In the time available, it would not have been possible for there to have been many more meetings yesterday.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for these consultations are being undertaken jointly between the two Governments, as provided for in the communiqué.  A significant but intense period remains for further discussions and I hope Sinn Féin will be able to participate fully in these discussions by virtue of its decision to persuade the IRA to reinstate its cease-fire. It is desirable that Sinn Féin should be involved in every way in the discussions because it has an electoral mandate and people to represent.  It is in its hands and those of the IRA to ensure that it can so participate by virtue of an IRA decision to reinstate its cease-fire and I ask it to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it would be wrong for a Taoiseach to get involved in lobbying anyone in a vote in the House of Commons about an internal British matter?  Will the Taoiseach accept that no matter how laudable the objective, it sets a bad precedent and damages relationships with, for example, other parties in the House of Commons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little to add to what I already said.  All discussions I had in regard to all matters leading up <Col N="1161" /> to the summit were dictated by my overriding objective on behalf of this country, which was in securing the early setting of a date for all-party talks.  That objective was of such cardinal importance that it was essential it should be my overriding and sole objective.</P>
      <P>I again emphasise the importance of speed in that context.  The situation that arose in the immediate aftermath of the resumption of IRA violence and the planting of three of its bombs in London was fundamentally unstable.  The only measure that would have been effective in restoring a measure of stability would not only have been the setting of a date for all-party talks sometime in the future but a specific and speedy meeting to set a fixed date for all-party talks without preconditions.  That has been and remains my objective which, I am glad to say, I obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Taoiseach about his private discussions &mdash; I know he would not answer that question &mdash; but about the involvement of a Taoiseach in domestic political affairs in Britain?  Despite the laudable objective, if he did do it, as seems to be the case, he was wrong just as it would be wrong for Mr. Major to get involved in a matter here and seek to influence the outcome of a vote in this House.  I do not, however, want to capitalise on mistakes as there has been too much of that in Northern Ireland.  If it is the case that officials will continue to meet with Sinn Féin, why were its representatives not met yesterday by officials and why were they allowed a major propaganda coup?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from making any mistakes I believe that my approach in this matter was absolutely responsible in the national interest and that this is vindicated by the results obtained speedily. The Deputy should reflect on this.</P>

      <P>As far as meetings with Sinn Féin are concerned, I have <Col N="1162" /> responded to questions from Deputy Bertie Ahern on that matter.  There is the possibility of official level meetings with Sinn Féin, even though the IRA ceasefire has not been reinstated.  It would be preferable if ministerial level meetings with Sinn Féin would occur, but that can only happen when the IRA reinstates its ceasefire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the telephone call on the knife edge vote in the House of Commons last week the Taoiseach seems to have made it very clear what his involvement was.  In a weekend interview I said that he would at least tell us the truth.  I assume that he is now saying that he did try to interfere in the matter.  Did he discuss it with the Tánaiste when he asked John Hume to keep John Major's Government in office?  In reply to Deputy Harney the Taoiseach gave us his views on the correctness of the decision.  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, it was gross and unprecedented interference to try to influence the way a party would vote on a domestic matter in the House of Commons.  If the Taoiseach believes he was right, on a major internal matter in the United Kingdom of an inquiry into a matter which affected politicians and business people, to try to influence a politician in regard to that vote, what justification does he have for making that decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategic alliance approach had been formulated and adopted by my predecessor.  It was then and still is the right approach. When I took over the process just over a year ago I quickly realised that I had inherited a sorry state of affairs as far as implementation was concerned.  I saw no evidence of concern about this nationally vital transaction.  In short, there was no effective progress on a deal at a time when similar transactions were commonplace elsewhere.  From the time that Cable &amp; Wireless submitted its proposal in February 1994 nothing of any substance had happened until I took office and made this one of my top priorities.</P>
      <P>What matters to this Government is jobs, the competitiveness of Irish industry and the critical influence of telecommunications development in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The Government is pursuing the strategic alliance process rather than a flotation approach because financial considerations or the size of the cheque has never been the overriding consideration. Against this backdrop &ldquo;the flotation for cash&rdquo; philosophy does not address the crucial long-term strategic issues.  The strategic alliance concept seeks to enhance Telecom Éireann's strengths in addition to addressing those areas of relative weakness in the company. Much of the work required to allow the alliance to proceed has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>British Telecom's withdrawal from the process is related to the company's traditional antipathy towards participation in equity-based strategic alliance processes with national operators.  That company has chosen to withdraw or not participate in other processes, most <Col N="1171" /> notably and recently in the case of Belgacom.  I am satisfied, given the players remaining in the process, that a satisfactory agreement from the Government's perspective is necessary and achievable.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann continues to be significantly out of line with most of the EU in terms of both debt burden and poor productivity.</P>
    <P>While derogation can give some breathing space to Telecom Éireann, in reality competition has effectively started already.  The withdrawal of British Telecom from the alliance process foreshadows the emergence of that company as a serious potential competitive threat in the marketplace which reinforces rather than reduces the need for a strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>The House can be reassured that the timetable I have laid down to complete the strategic alliance process will be adhered to.  Preliminary bids will be received from interested parties on 15 March.  I will advise the Government of the line up for phase 2 of the process before Easter.  This second phase is a negotiating process.  It will commence in mid-April and conclude by end July, at which point I will recommend the choice of a partner to Government.</P>

There was no mandate and no legislation.  There were no regulatory principles, no advisers and no structure in place to manage this process. In short, there was no effective process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then a number of steps have been taken to get the process moving and everything is on schedule.  In just over a year I have put in place the key <Col N="1172" /> enablers.  The negotiation mandate was agreed, advisers were appointed and a management structure put in place to bring the process to a conclusion.  Vital decisions have been taken and agreed at Government level on the future regulatory structure, which will mean there will be independent regulation of the telecommunications sector in the summer of this year.</P>

British Telecom, AT&amp;T, Cable and Wireless, US West, Ameritech, GTE and Singapore are gone and only three groups are left.  Will the Minister accept that this process &mdash; because of the Minister's total inactivity in this area as he appears to have gone to ground in recent months &mdash; has, in effect, collapsed? Will the Minister do the decent thing and call the process off?  To spend £4 million on consultants to pick one player from the remaining three is a farce.  The Minister knows that only one of the three is a serious player and it now has the Minister and the Government where it wants them.  Will the Minister call off this farce rather than let it proceed in the silly manner he plans?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I became aware that the holding of an equity stake in Telecom Éireann by a partner would cause the company to lose its public authority status for social welfare purposes and would result in changes in the PRSI status of the company and its employees, I secured the agreement of the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government for a change in legislation to continue the existing arrangements in the event of an equity-based strategic alliance being concluded.  The legislative provision is contained in the Social Welfare Bill published on 1 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1996, gives power to the Minister for Social Welfare to maintain the current modified social insurance status of Telecom Éireann and its employees.  The purpose of this provision is simply to confirm the continuation of existing arrangements in the event of the company entering a strategic alliance.  New employees recruited by the company after 5 April 1995 will be subject to full PRSI rates as is the case with all new public sector employees recruited after that date.  The <Col N="1175" /> question of changing the current PRSI status of other companies operating in the telecommunications sector does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making a major announcement and I trust he is doing it deliberately.  Is he telling the House he has included a provision in the Social Welfare Bill whereby a State company that is privatised will continue to pay the State rate of PRSI and not the private rate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy's galaxy of advisers have not brought the measures in the Bill to the Deputy's attention.  He should have further discussions with them.</P>
      <P>The interests and entitlements of existing employees in Telecom Éireann must be protected and we have made provision for that in the Social Welfare Bill.  Following an equity based strategic alliance the State will retain a majority share in the company.  The company will continue to carry out its obligations under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 to provide national telecommunications services throughout the State and will continue to meet its obligations to employees under section 45 of that Act.  Under this obligation, staff recruited by the company prior to 6 April 1995 and those transferred to it from the Civil Service on vesting day are subject to modified PRSI status.  This legislative proposal is designed to continue the existing arrangements for those staff.  Any change in their terms and conditions of employment, including a change in PRSI status, would be a matter for negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was not done for Irish Steel, Greencore or Irish Life.  Is it true that this will cost about £50 million? Is it constitutional to have a company that is part privatised paying a different rate of PRSI from that of its competitors?  Will a different rate apply to each company, both of which have <Col N="1176" /> private interests?  This is a major change in Government policy and I object to it being slipped into social welfare legislation in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this change is being slipped into legislation.  This decision was taken by the Government following consultation and legal advice. I am surprised the Deputy is advocating on behalf of Fianna Fáil that the Government and I should welsh on an agreement and our statutory obligation to the existing workforce in Telecom Éireann.  We are simply providing that the status quo will remain under any new arrangements for workers who had entitlements prior to 6 April 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This never happened previously in the case of the privatisation or part privatisation of State companies. Is it not the responsibility of the people from Denmark, Switzerland or wherever who buy the one-third of shares now being sold off to compensate the workers in Telecom Éireann rather than the taxpayer, to the tune of £50 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Telecom Éireann is subject to the class D modified employers' rate whereas the standard employers' rate is 12.2 per cent.  However, it is important to recognise that other issues need to be addressed in this context.  While the company benefits from a lower employer contribution rate it has to provide a non-contributory pension based on full pay, full sick pay and continuity of employment for its employees.  These terms are over and above those applicable in the private sector where full PRSI confers benefits on employees which do not apply to those on modified rates.  The company would have to pay compensation to its employees in respect of moving from the modified employees' rate of 0.9 per cent to the standard rate of 5.5 per cent.  This would give rise to changes in the entitlements of employees and, therefore, would <Col N="1177" /> have cost consequences for Telecom Éireann's early retirement, voluntary service and pension schemes.  It would also give rise to consequences for the social insurance fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>The core light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely, via the Harcourt Street line, and Ballymun at an estimated cost of £300 million in 1993 prices.  The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999 provides for a total expenditure of £200 million on light rail during the period.  The DTI final report endorsed this expenditure as about the limit of what could be physically implemented in the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A high level project team comprising CIE personnel and consultants analysed a range of possible two line combinations derived from the core light rail network which could be implemented within the £200 million allocation.  These options were examined against a number of criteria including their contribution to DTI objectives, financial performance, congestion alleviation, <Col N="1178" /> environmental impact and ease of construction. The objective technical recommendation of the project team was that priority should be given to the construction of links to Tallaght and Dundrum.</P>
    <P>I launched CIE's public consultation programme on the planned light rail links to Tallaght and Dundrum on 12 December 1995 following the conclusion of detailed work undertaken by the project team to identify the preferred technical route alignments for both links.  In the meantime planning work on all aspects of the project is continuing and tenders have been invited by CIE for the light rail vehicles.  New legislation to provide a modern statutory basis for light rail is almost drafted and will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>Subject to compliance with national and EU procedures, the target is to have phase 1 of the core light rail network from Tallaght to Dundrum in operation by the year 2000.  Phase 2 is planned to follow on immediately afterwards.  The results of the analysis undertaken to date by the project team indicate that the light rail links to Tallaght and Dundrum will cover their operating costs from fares revenue.</P>
    <P>While the total number of passenger journeys on the DART system fell below 16 million in 1994 for the first time in five years, I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that patronage recovered strongly last year when total passenger journeys amounted to almost 17 million, making it the third best year since DART entered into service in 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to revenue and the estimated operational costs.  The Minister said he is satisfied that the revenue generated will be adequate to meet the operational costs. He will be aware that CIE previously gave advice to the Government on the DART system and when one looks at the figures for 1994 one can see how inaccurate that advice and the assessments were.  In 1994 the revenue from DART was £12 million whereas the <Col N="1179" /> annual cost of operating the system was £26 million, a loss of more than £13 million. The Minister will also be aware that between 1990 and 1994 there was a reduction of one million in the number of passengers using the DART system from 16.8 million to 15.9 million.  I was encouraged to hear that the figure increased to approximately 17 million passengers last year.  Has the Minister any comment to make on the financing of the DART system and its inability to meet operational costs?  What was the reason for the decrease in the number of passengers using the DART system between 1990 and 1994 and for the changes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that DART has been the most successful public transport initiative introduced in Dublin.  That has been the clear message of the travelling public since the service was set up in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A loss of one million passengers does not represent a vote of confidence in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>During the years prior to the introduction of DART annual passenger carryings on the Bray to Howth line amounted to approximately eight million while today the figure is approximately 17 million.  The attractiveness of DART has given rise to demands for its wider deployment. Since its inauguration, it has provided daily proof that high quality public transport can compete with private car transport.  This is clearly borne out by the figures which show that at peak times in the morning 55 per cent of journeys along the DART corridor are made by public transport while 36 per cent are made by car.  In the city as a whole the situation has been reversed and it is estimated that up to 6,000 cars are left at home each day by DART <Col N="1180" /> commuters.  DART has been very successful and I welcome the upward trend in passenger numbers after a year of decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several years of decline.  Between 1990 and 1994 there was a reduction of one million in the number of passengers.  This does not represent a vote of confidence by the travelling public in the DART system.  I am surprised at the Minister's claim that this is the most successful transport system in operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern in some transport quarters about the wisdom of the decision to make this investment in a light rail system? Has he taken these concerns into consideration?  Has he viewed the overall position and is he satisfied he should proceed with the investment in the light of concern as to its viability in the future?  Given that the expectations in relation to DART were not fulfilled, we are right to raise fears that the same thing might happen in this case and that <Col N="1181" /> optimistic forecasts may not be fulfilled once the system is in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that with this level of public expenditure there is need for rigorous assessment, and the basis on which the decision has been taken must stand up to scrutiny.  I am satisfied that assessment has been made.  We are now involved in public consultation. There are concerns about disruption to daily life in the city during the construction phase.

      <Quest>the financial position of Aer Lingus on 31 December, 1995; the consideration, if any, given to this position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4995/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25, 36 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>The annual report and accounts of the Aer Lingus Group plc for the period ended 31 December 1995 are expected to be published in the near future.  Prior to publication, they will be presented to Government and copies will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>While it would be inappropriate for me to discuss specifics at this stage, I understand Aer Lingus has performed well in 1995, following the successful implementation of the group's restructuring programme.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is just emerging from one of the most traumatic periods in its 60-year history.  The early 1990s saw the company in such a perilous financial situation that, in the absence of strong corrective action, its very existence would have been threatened.</P>
      <P>In June 1993, the board and management of Aer Lingus put together a radical restructuring programme entitled &ldquo;Strategy for the Future&rdquo;.  This was intended both to save the company in the short-term and to alter its commercial outlook in the longer term.</P>
      <P>To implement the restructuring programme with any degree of success, Aer Lingus had to embrace radical change. Substantial cost savings were achieved. Changes in work practices and employment were implemented.  The disposal of non-core assets refocused the efforts of Aer Lingus on the core business of air transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the priorities I set when I came into office at the end of 1994 was the need to ensure the future viability of Aer Lingus.  My most immediate task was to ensure that the Aer Lingus Group was positioned correctly to achieve European Commission approval for the payment of the balance <Col N="1185" /> of the £175 million equity pledged by the Government as part of the restructuring programme.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this objective and the targets set out in the restructuring programme have been achieved in full and that the outlook for the coming years is encouraging.  Future success will only be achieved, however, provided the airline's growth is pursued in a prudent and cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental lesson which cannot be repeated too often.  The disciplines imposed and the lessons learned in recent years must not be cast off now that the airline has achieved the objectives set out in the restructuring programme. That was only the beginning of the process.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus of today and tomorrow must operate in a resolutely commercial manner, concentrating on its core business.  The secret of continued profitability in the liberalised airline world of today lies in commitment to quality of service and value for money, allied to an ever present focus on reducing costs.</P>
    <P>This is the world in which Aer Lingus now operates.  State aid and the protection of flag carriers are things of the past.  I am confident that Aer Lingus and its people have the ability to take on the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to TEAM Aer Lingus. In reply to a question on TEAM in May 1995, I advised the House that, following my request, a five year business plan was developed for TEAM Aer Lingus for the first time in the history of the company.  The plan was formulated in a manner which takes account of market realities.  It provided a means of returning TEAM to profitability on a phased basis through a combination of achieving further reductions in the cost base through savings on payroll, overheads and materials; mounting an aggressive carefully co-ordinated marketing and product development programme; and restructuring TEAM's finances.  I am informed by Aer Lingus that the TEAM five-year plan continues to be implemented and the projections <Col N="1186" /> and assumptions underlying the plan remain valid.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations issues are company matters which should be handled through appropriate internal TEAM Aer Lingus channels and procedures involving management, staff and trade union officials.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on specific industrial relations issues.  I would like to emphasise, however, that any difficulties which may be encountered in implementing the TEAM plan should be resolved within the proper industrial relations structures in place for that purpose.</P>
    <P>No one should lose sight of the fact that TEAM Aer Lingus' financial position remains very difficult.  It continues to be dependent on financial support from the Aer Lingus Group.  While I acknowledge that significant progress has been made in introducing improved work practices and flexibility in TEAM, a continued unremitting effort from all concerned is required to assure TEAM's future viability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister's comments on the performance of Aer Lingus and note that the word processor is regurgitating what was issued to us last May.  The Minister is coming out of hibernation and has been taking it easy following the strain of his strenuous activities in previous months.  Anticipated losses for TEAM Aer Lingus last year are of the order of £6.8 million but the dogs in the street know they will be £9 million or £10 million. Obviously that will have a significant effect on the five year plan which was assiduously put together by the new management group in the company. Irrespective of what the Minister said about industrial relations, they are a factor in terms of the cost base and competitiveness. This must be a matter of considerable concern.</P>

      <P>Would 400 people meet on the shop floor without the trade union being represented?  Will the Minister confirm that the figure is likely to be £10 million rather than the forecasted £6.8 million?  How will that impact on the five year plan?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to comment on the exact detail.  However, the company is implementing the five year plan which involves further reduction and rationalisation in the cost base of the company.  That matter is ongoing.  Some elements of the plan are the subject of further discussion between the management and unions.  I am conscious that TEAM Aer Lingus is operating in a difficult market where there is over capacity.  I am satisfied that significant progress has been made which involves changes in work practices and sacrifices by employees.  Management is conscious of the necessity to make changes after consultation with the work force and the procedures in the company for consultation and discussion are adequate and are being adhered to.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister imagine the impact, his statement that there will be further job losses, will have on Forbairt which cites TEAM Aer Lingus, which created 245 jobs, as its star performer last year?  Are the figures accurate?  Do I take it that there were significant job losses last year and that the figures given by Forbairt for the Aer Lingus subsidiary are erroneous?  In view of what is happening in TEAM Aer Lingus, is the Minister satisfied and can he categorically state that the targets set last year will be met and that the targets set for the five year plan are accurate and realistic?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The TEAM plan provides for a cost reduction programme yielding at least a permanent £8 million annually affecting all areas of business, including payroll, overheads and materials.  The plan calls for a reduction in the work force to approximately 1,500.  This amounts to a staffing reduction of 200 <Col N="1189" /> people which will be effective at all levels from management to the shop floor. That is the same number announced in May last year.  The plan also provides for financial stability for TEAM during the early stages when its earnings are not sufficient to meet its costs, conditional on the satisfactory implementation of the plan.  It requires major adjustment and extraordinary effort.  It must be clearly understood that it is an integrated strategy which must be fully implemented to protect the future of TEAM and the Aer Lingus group.</P>
      <P>As I stated in May, the plan provides for achieving profitability on a phased basis within its five year time frame.  I am satisfied that the company is adhering to the plan and that the measures agreed after publication of the five year plan in May will be implemented in a phased way.  Subject to the complete implementation of that plan Aer Lingus will be a viable and profitable company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My party fully supports the Minister in his efforts to achieve his stated objective of making the Aer Lingus group of companies, in their core activities, a lean, fit and successful commercial company capable of meeting competition.  His statement today on the need for prudent and cost efficient management is critical to achieving that objective.  What is the Minister's opinion on the recently stated expenditure of £7 million-£8 million on launching the Aer Lingus corporate image?  He will be aware of the public's concern and alarm at such expenditure shortly after the company received massive capital injection from the EU and the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultants appointed by the EU Commission examined the progress of the Aer Lingus group's restructuring programme, including TEAM's five year business plan, before approving in December 1995 the Government's final equity tranche.  Based on their findings the EU perceived the five year plan as realistic given the present position of TEAM and market conditions. They also noted that it had <Col N="1190" /> already resulted in a significant improvement in the company's overall performance.  It is important to recognise that in the context of moneys being approved by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the five year plan is a matter for the board and the management of TEAM Aer Lingus. How precisely the cost reduction measures in the five year plan are achieved is a matter for the company. Similarly, issues relating to the launch of the new Aer Lingus corporate identity are matters for the Aer Lingus group. Financial provision for TEAM Aer Lingus remains difficult and it continues to be dependent on the Aer Lingus group for financial support.</P>
      <P>The new logo attracted much adverse comment from the media.  In my discussions with the group I asked why it was necessary and was informed that in terms of its marketing strategy this decision was in keeping with the company's objective of being commercially viable and that it would pay dividends, it was necessary and well considered and the board had approved it. Obviously, it is a matter for the board and the management of the company to make such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the new corporate image plan cost £6 million, £7 million or £8 million or are these figures pie in the sky?  The Minister will recall that he launched this plan.  Is there not an implication that it had his full support?  In view of his earlier strictures as regards prudent management and the necessity for cost efficiency, how does he relate that to considerable expenditure on such an item?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Such day to day decisions are a matter for the management of the company to bring before the board.  The board consists of people with expertise in a wide range of areas and it approved this new corporate image.  I understand it will be on a phased basis and that the initial cost will be approximately £8 million.</P>

      <P>On industrial relations, which was the subject of my question, I got the impression from the Minister's reply that there was not really a problem.  I have information that large meetings have taken place in TEAM Aer Lingus and that 400 people attended one such meeting a few days ago.  I am not sure whether the unions attended.  The Minister is misinformed if he was told there is not substantial industrial relations problems in TEAM Aer Lingus.  I have been told about a number of large meetings and about the serious situation developing in TEAM Aer Lingus.  While the Minister might not want to get involved, I suggest that he looks at the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is far from that which I inherited.  The Deputy will recall that when he was in Government the workforce protested and disrupted traffic at the roundabout in Dublin Airport. There has been a dramatic improvement in industrial relations in TEAM Aer Lingus.  There may be problems. In a company that size and with the issues that must be tackled and addressed and the sensitivity of some of the decisions which had to be taken, it is obvious that there is a need for ongoing discussions.  I am concerned that the procedures in place will be adhered to and that management, unions and those involved in TEAM Aer Lingus will comply with them and difficulties can be resolved.</P>
      <P>It is in the interest of the workforce, the TEAM Aer Lingus company and the Aer Lingus group that this five year plan is implemented as envisaged.  Without implementation of this plan, there is no viable future for TEAM Aer Lingus. It is in the interest of those involved to resolve whatever minor difficulties have arisen.  I have confidence in the management and in the trade union leaders to resolve outstanding matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quality standards for oil products are set by the National Standards Authority of Ireland which reports to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science <Col N="1193" /> and technology.  The aspects of the standards which relate to the problem of oils freezing in cold weather are the cloud point temperature above which wax crystals will not form and the cold filter pour point temperature above which the oil should flow despite the presence of wax crystals.</P>
    <P>The national standard issued by the NSAI, IS251, specifies a cloud point of 0ºC and a cold filter pour point of -12ºC for winter grade gas oil.  The Whitegate oil refinery produces gas oil to this specification all year round.</P>
    <P>During two particularly cold spells in mid November and in late December, there were many instances reported of gas oil freezing.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation tested samples of gas oil which it had produced and independent testing verified that the oil was in conformity with the standards laid down in IS251.  Because of the problems encountered, I asked the Minister with responsibility for commerce, science and technology to request the NSAI to undertake a review of the standard with a view to having an updated version, if necessary, in place before next winter.  I understand this review is now in progress.</P>
    <P>That oil meets the national standard does not guarantee operability in the absence of appropriate precautions to be taken by the final consumer.  The NSAI has issued a leaflet detailing some simple precautions which should be taken such as the proper siting of tanks, insulation of exposed pipework and filters, and regular maintenance, etc., to avoid problems occurring at temperatures below -2ºC.  The leaflet should be available from any oil distributor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was approached by many people who use oil during freezing weather.  The Minister assured us that there was nothing wrong as far as the oil companies were concerned.  I contacted <Col N="1194" /> the Whitegate refinery at the time and it admitted that many people had complained, particularly the oil distributors.</P>
      <P>This problem was confined to the southern counties which are supplied by Whitegate oil refinery &mdash; the Dublin area which receives supplies from Milford Haven did not experience similar problems.  There is a belief that Whitegate may be yielding too much of the commodity and that the oil used for home heating is affected.  A similar problem arose about ten years ago in this area.  Will the Minister give an assurance that there will not be a recurrence of the problem with Whitegate oil, particularly with a temperature of minus 12 degrees?  To contrast the position with that in Scotland, the temperature there at that time ranged from minus 18 degrees to minus 28 degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number of reports of oil freezing were received from areas supplied by Whitegate, but they were not confined only to that area.  Similar reports were received from Dublin and Northern Ireland which are supplied by different refineries.  The problem arises as a result of a substance, a form of anti-freeze, that is added to the oil to prevent it from freezing.  That had the strange effect of being in order when tested at minus 12 degrees, which meets the required standard, but not at minus 5 degree to minus 8 degrees when it waxed up or froze.  The scientists involved cannot explain why that occurred.  The only possibility is that the containers may have fallen below that temperature for a short period, perhaps during chill from wind.  I cannot give a guarantee, nor can any Minister, that this problem will not arise again.  Temperatures may fall well below the level of operability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking to change the Irish standard from 0 degrees to <Col N="1195" /> minus 12 degrees to a standard of minus 1 degrees to minus 13 degrees, which would provide for a wider range of operability.  There is no absolute guarantee that diesel and fuel oil will not freeze when temperatures are very low.</P>

      <P>Normally matters such as the level and quality of postal deliveries fall within the day-to-day administration of An Post.  However because of the widespread concern that has existed from time to time about the quality of the delivery service I obtained reports from the company about the matter.

This report contains numerous recommendations on matters concerning quality of service and effective management of its operations.  The board has accepted the report as a framework for future development of the company's services.</P>
    <P>The most recent report on letter delivery services shows a relatively satisfactory performance of well over 90 per cent next day delivery for all services except Dublin to the provinces which was affected by additional Christmas mail volumes.</P>
    <P>The questions of further operational changes and improved quality of service continue to be a day-to-day matter for the company.  I am satisfied that the company now has a clear mandate and understanding of the need to address any problems arising and that it continues to provide a quality service to the public.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the postal delivery service from Dublin to the provinces is most unsatisfactory and that a one day service is the exception rather than the rule?  Will he give the percentage of householders where the traditional morning post is delivered sometimes very late in the afternoon?  Does he consider the present service is satisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the level and quality of service from Dublin to the provinces is unsatisfactory.  There is a satisfaction rating of approximately 90 per cent with the service in other areas whereas the rate of satisfaction with the service from Dublin to the provinces is 76 per cent.  Obviously there is much room for improvement and I have communicated that view to An Post.  The last analysis took place immediately after the Christmas rush and An Post has said that the huge volumes of mail at that time contributed to the problem. I have requested An Post to commit itself to improving performances in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not refer to the 37 recommendations on which action has not been taken.  That was what my question was about.  The committee was set up by his predecessor, Deputy Treacy, to carry out this investigation and prepare a report.  Will the Minister agree that his Department was well aware of the work undertaken on the preparation of the report?  It seems rather dilatory that very little action has been taken on important aspects of the recommendations in the intervening period, particularly when the Minister gave a firm commitment to the House last May that within two or three months he would make a comprehensive statement on the matter.  We do not know the Department's attitude to many of these recommendations and the Minister indicated <Col N="1202" /> that he does not intend to implement some of them, but we do not know those to which he was referring.  The Minister should be more forthcoming in giving information as it would be helpful to the industry and to Deputies.</P>

I am aware they are appreciative of the swift action taken on many of the recommendations in the report.  It should be borne in mind that many of the most important outstanding recommendations impinge on other areas of public policy, notably taxation, land use policy and industrial policy and, therefore, they must be considered in a wider context.  This is being done as quickly as possible.  I assure the Deputy that we will conclude those consultations and bring forward recommendations for the implementation of what is practicable in respect of the outstanding 37 recommendations as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 32 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to put on record my total commitment to this project which is essential for the future of the peat industry.  I want to assure the House <Col N="1203" /> that my Department is developing the necessary arrangements as quickly as possible.  I am confident that the project will be completed by the end of the decade as originally planned.</P>
    <P>This is the first time we have had a competition like this.  It is an extraordinarily complex matter and an enormous volume of documentation must be prepared for the first time.  For example, there must be a power purchase contract, a contract for the sale of peat and a detailed agreement describing the function of the national grid and the responsibilities of any large independent power station connected to it.  In the past the ESB was responsible for all of the electricity system and purchased peat from another State company so it was never necessary to set out these details in contractual legal form.</P>
    <P>This project is the first opportunity to bring competition into the mainstream of electricity generation in Ireland.  It is absolutely essential that the arrangements I put in place have the full confidence of all bidders.</P>
    <P>My Department has been working intensively over recent months to find a fair and transparent arrangement which would allow the ESB to bid and which will also have the confidence of other bidders.  It is essential that the arrangements are not open to challenge under Irish and EU competition law.  A successful challenge would almost certainly delay the project by several years and could result in the State or the ESB paying very heavy damages.</P>
    <P>To avoid that problem I have taken detailed legal advice, as a result of which, I am taking steps this week to employ independent experts to run the competition in a totally impartial manner. This is the only course of action which will enable the competition to be completed early in 1997 in order to meet the objective of having the power station completed by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously in the House, the precise location for the station will be a matter for the developer &mdash; the winner of the competition.  It will be up <Col N="1204" /> to the developer to decide where, within the east midlands region, the new station will be situated.  In deciding where to locate it, the developer will take into consideration general site suitability, proximity of suitable peat supplies, transport and other infrastructures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister will be aware of the many optimistic ministerial statements of this and previous Governments on this Euro peat project, does he agree it is most disappointing, if not extraordinary, for him to elaborate on a list of excuses for the project not yet having come to fruition?  I remind him that in October 1995 he stated that the procurer would be formally announced in the Euro Journal and that he hoped to decide the winner of the competition and award a contract before the end of 1996.  Does the Minister accept that he gave inaccurate, misleading information to the House if the procurer is not now to have a role in assessing the tenders?</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's belated announcement of the appointment of independent experts to evaluate the proposals to ensure there is absolutely no link between his involvement under the ESB umbrella, work on its design and the invitation of tenders.  The ESB connection has been tenuous throughout the whole programme and this is the first occasion we have heard that the Minister and Government are resorting to an independent expert assessor.  Since that appointment had been necessary from the outset, does the Minister accept that the manner in which this project has proceeded thus far has not evoked much public confidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy agrees with the competition procedures in this case.  The project is a matter of priority for the Government, of immense importance to the midlands region and involves detailed work on the part of the ESB with substantial beneficial consequences for Bord na Móna and the peat industry in that area. The project is on target, the time scale <Col N="1205" /> will be met and I look forward to ensuring that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The House will debate the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill today.  On 9 November, the day after the Urlingford drugs consignment find, I asked that the Drug Trafficking Bill be brought forward as I raised the fact that nobody had been apprehended at the location of the drugs find in Urlingford.  Much has been written about that outside this House.  The Taoiseach made light of my remarks on that occasion saying: &ldquo;Obviously, one would not expect to find the drug barons in the lorry.  That they were not apprehended on the spot should not warrant the significance Deputy Ahern attaches to it&rdquo;.  I questioned the Taoiseach about this matter because of something that was made known to the Fianna Fáil office.  The identity of the driver of the lorry is a matter of great significance and the Taoiseach should take the opportunity of clarifying this matter, if not now, tomorrow.  I would remind the Taoiseach also of what was said on the Adjournment on 9 December and what was subsequently said by Deputy John O'Donoghue and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, on 14 December.  I do not wish to say any more but will the Taoiseach indicate that he will look at the matter and correct the record of the House?</P>

    <P>I am concerned that those involved in drugs should be apprehended but that <Col N="1358" /> does not mean that anyone should break the law or that the public should be misled.  This is a serious matter and I want to deal with it as sensitively as possible.  There are sensitivities involved but that does not mean that the House should not be fully informed on the matters concerned.

      <P>I commented at the time on question raised without notice.  The question of apprehending people who are involved in drug trafficking is a matter of day to day responsibility for the Garda Commissioner and it is not possible or appropriate for the Minister for Justice &mdash; or for me on the Order of Business without notice &mdash; to be responsible for answering specific questions about specific Garda operations.  They are properly a matter for the independent decision and supervision of the Garda Commissioner.  It is not in the best interests of law enforcement that both Opposition parties should attempt to introduce political considerations into the day to day operation of the Garda Síochána.</P>

I am very clear on some of the things that happened to this particular consignment and I do not <Col N="1359" /> wish to go into detail because the Taoiseach is right in saying they are confidential. What happened at Urlingford and thereafter is a matter for this House.  Following on from information which I did not know was right or wrong, I asked questions and I believed what the Taoiseach told me but subsequently found out differently.  I am giving the Taoiseach an opportunity to again answer the question.  What happened afterwards with the publicity of the seizure and the photocall opportunity for the Minister for Justice is in the political domain.  I am asking that the Official Report in so far as it relates to me and the Fianna Fáil Justice spokesperson, be set straight.</P>

There was adequate opportunity there for the Opposition parties' concerns to be dealt with in the normal way without the necessity of recourse to vague inferences and dark hints of the kind in which the Deputy is engaged.</P>

I would ask Deputies to bear in mind again that the day to day management of Garda operations is a matter not for me, on the Order of Business without notice, nor for the Minister for Justice but for the Garda Commissioner.  That is something that has been established practice in this House since the Garda Síochána was founded shortly after the foundation of the State.  I see no particular advantage in changing that to a situation where the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice is expected, on a day to day basis, to be accountable without notice for answering questions about day to day Garda operations.  That would be a ludicrous situation and would not have proper accountability in regard to law enforcement.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, is one of the strongest anti-crime pieces of legislation ever introduced in this House.  The Government believes that these measures, with the appropriate safeguards which have been included in the Bill, are a necessary and proportionate response to the grave threat posed to the community by the activities of drug traffickers.  This Government is determined to do all in its power to thwart this deadly trade.</P>
    <P>The Bill is part of the comprehensive anti-drugs package which the Government announced last year.  The measures contained in the Bill will increase the powers of detention in relation to persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to provide for a maximum period of detention of up to 7 days; provide that further periods of detention after the first 48 hours may be authorised by a court before whom the person detained must be brought; allow for the detention of persons arrested for a drug trafficking offence where it is suspected they have concealed drugs in their persons, so-called &ldquo;stuffers and swallowers&rdquo;, in places of detention specified by the Minister; allow members of the Garda Síochana not below the rank of superintendent to issue search warrants in drug trafficking cases where the warrant is urgently required; allow customs officers to be present at, and participate in, the questioning of suspects detained by the Garda in relation to drug trafficking offences.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of drug criminality and the efforts which are made to frustrate measures to defeat it, I am convinced that comprehensively tackling drug trafficking can only be achieved by providing a legislative framework which enables the Garda to take effective action.  Consequently I believe that the provisions in this Bill, which give increased powers to the Garda to detain suspected drug traffickers for up to seven days, as well as the other measures contained in it are <Col N="1364" /> a necessary and proportionate response and provide the Garda with the armoury to deal with this deadly menace. Because of the large profits to be made through this vile trade in drugs, those who engage in it are constantly evolving new ways to evade detection. As well as that, the international nature of the trade is well documented.  Primarily for these reasons I consider it necessary to provide for a power of detention which will give the Garda the means which are necessary to investigate suspected drug trafficking and which reduce the possibility that suspected drug traffickers could frustrate those efforts.</P>
    <P>I have provided, in section 2, for a power of detention of up to seven days in cases of suspected drug trafficking.  I know that seven days detention may sound like a rather draconian response but I believe it is a response which can be justified given the gravity of the problem which we are addressing once we insert specific and substantial safeguards in terms of the procedures under which it will operate.  To that end the Bill provides that the detention permitted under section 2 will effectively be kept under regular review by breaking up the seven days into five separate stages.  At the beginning of each of these stages there is a requirement that the person authorising the detention is satisfied that the detention is justified.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the case that the courts here would be unlikely to hold as constitutionally sound a provision which purports to allow seven day detention unless appropriate safeguards are included.</P>
    <P>As well as having regard to requirements which arise under our Constitution we must have regard too to our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  As a party to that convention we must keep under review the jurisprudence which emerges in that regard.  It is especially as a result of that jurisprudence that we have concluded that an essential safeguard which must be included in the legislation is that a person detained under section 2 <Col N="1365" /> for lengthy periods must be brought before a court during his or her period of detention.  There is a significant corpus of jurisprudence under the convention to the effect that failure to bring a person, the subject of a lengthy period of detention, before a judicial authority is contrary to the convention.</P>
    <P>The basis for this is found in Article 5 of the convention.  Article 5 (1) states: &ldquo;Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.&rdquo;  However, deprivation of liberty is justified, according to Article 5 (1) (c), in cases of &ldquo;the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so&rdquo;.  Article 5 (3) states that everyone so arrested or detained shall be brought promptly before a judge.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the relevant case law concerning Article 5, it would appear that an arrested person would have to be physically brought before the court and must be given an opportunity to be heard.  The advice available to me is that to do so at the expiration of 48 hours after the arrest would not amount to a contravention of Article 5 (3).  At that time the prosecution authority would have to be in a position to establish to the satisfaction of a judge, in relation to a person held on suspicion of having commited an offence, that there was a reasonable suspicion of the person having committed the specified offence, and that reasonable grounds existed for the continuance of that suspicion.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of Article 5 (3), in relation to Article 5 (1) (c), is to afford to individuals deprived of their liberty a special guarantee, namely a procedure of a judicial nature designed to ensure that no one should be arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty and to ensure that any arrest or detention will be kept as short as possible.  Article 5 (3) impliedly stipulates that the detention must not exceed a reasonable time. The reasonableness of the grounds on <Col N="1366" /> which the detention is permitted becomes central to any consideration of whether Article 5 (3) is being observed.</P>
    <P>The European Commission of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights have defined the powers and qualities required of a judicial officer to comply with the provisions of Article 5.  These are that there should be complete independence when performing in the judicial capacity, the detainee should be present at the hearing and have the right to make representations, all the circumstances for and against release should be reviewed and there should be the power to order immediate release where continued detention is no longer justified.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the European Convention and the jurisprudence which has built up in respect of Article 5, the approach being taken in the Bill is that a person arrested under section 2 must be brought before a judge after 48 hours.  Even though the investigation will remain under Garda control, the involvement of the court at various stages of the investigation should satisfy the requirements of Article 5 in the context which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions in section 2 for the involvement of a judge in the extension of the period of detention beyond 48 hours, together with the requirement that the detained person be brought before the court, will be seen as conforming not only with our obligations under the European Convention but also the constitutional imperatives which arise in this area.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 there will be an initial period of detention of up to six hours, which may be extended for a further period of up to 18 hours and subsequently for a further period of up to 24 hours on the direction of a chief superintendent who, on each occasion that the extension is granted, has reasonable grounds for believing that the further period of detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.  Any periods of detention thereafter will involve the intervention of the courts so that a detained person must be <Col N="1367" /> brought before the court on the hearing of each application for his or her further detention beyond the first 48 hours and will be given the opportunity to make submissions or call evidence on his or her behalf.  The court, if satisfied that the detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously, may extend the period of detention for up to a further 72 hours and for a final period of up to a further 48 hours.  The garda who makes the application, who must be of the rank of at least chief superintendent, must, at the time of each application, have reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>If the judge decides to issue a warrant for the further detention of a person he or she may at the same time order that the person be brought before the court again at any time or times during the specified period of detention and if the judge is not satisfied at that time that the detention is justified he or she shall order the immediate release of the person.</P>
    <P>This approach, taken with other safeguards contained in the Bill, should allay any fears that the detention provisions are excessive or open to abuse. In this context I should mention specifically that Garda custody regulations will apply to persons detained under the Bill.  The proposals are a measured response to the unacceptable threat posed by these so-called drug barons.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that those involved in the trade in illegal drugs are constantly evolving new ways to try to avoid detection, including the concealing of drugs within one's body &mdash; the problem, as it has become known, of &ldquo;stuffers and swallowers&rdquo;.  To provide for such cases the Bill makes provision for the making of regulations by the Minister for Justice to prescribe a special detention facility where a person who is suspected of concealing any controlled drug in his or her body may be <Col N="1368" /> detained.  Such a place would be especially equipped to deal with cases of bodily concealment.</P>
    <P>I have spent a considerable amount of time dealing with section 2.  However, it is important for everyone to appreciate and understand the reasons for it. Section 2 will probably be seen as the most significant provision in the Bill and I am sure that when Deputies have had an opportunity to study its provisions in the light of what I had to say, in particular about the European Convention on Human Rights, they will agree that the way I have dealt with the issue is in accord with the convention, constitutional requirements and represents an appropriate response to the evil we want to be rid of.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends sections 2 and 4 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which deal respectively with the taking of bodily samples and the destruction of records and samples.  The effect of the amendment of section 2 of the 1990 Act will be to allow for the taking of bodily samples in the case of a person detained under section 2 of the Bill.  These powers are essential for the full and proper investigation of alleged drug trafficking offences.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned, in relation to the detention powers to be permitted under section 2, that there are significant safeguards built into those provisions.  Safeguards are also in place in section 4 in relation to the rearrest of persons suspected of drug trafficking.  Section 4 generally prohibits the rearrest for the same suspected offence &mdash; or an offence which should have been reasonably suspected at the time &mdash; of a person previously detained under section 2 who has been released without being charged.  Rearrest will only be permitted on the authority of a judge and only in cases where new information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána since the person's release.  Furthermore, the judge when authorising a rearrest may also order that the person be brought before a court on arrest or at any other time for the purposes of being <Col N="1369" /> satisfied that the detention is justified.  If the judge is not satisfied that the detention is justified then the person will be released.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for a significant change in the procedures which follow detention on foot of a rearrest in that the intervention of the court is provided for at an earlier stage than is the case under section 2, which I outlined above.  Thus, under section 4 the rearrested person may be detained initially for up to six hours which can be extended by up to 18 hours on the authority of a chief superintendent.  Thereafter the detention period may be extended for periods up to 24 hours, 72 hours and 48 hours only on the authority of a judge, following procedures identical to those provided under section 2.  Furthermore, if a person is rearrested on the authority of a judge for an offence which is not a drug trafficking offence that person will be dealt with, not under the provisions of this Bill, but under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  In addition, the section makes it clear that where a person has been arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and is released without charge, that person cannot be arrested again under section 2 of the Bill for the same offence or for an offence which he or she was, or ought reasonably to have been suspected of having committed.</P>
    <P>Here again my intention is to ensure that the legislation contains appropriate safeguards.  As I explained, section 4 will enable rearrest only when certain conditions are satisfied, including a condition for further information to have come to the knowledge of the gardaí since the person's release, as to suspected participation in the alleged offence.  This approach should help to remove any concerns that the provisions of the Bill are open to abuse.  The section will not, however, prevent the gardaí from rearresting a person without a warrant for the purposes of <Col N="1370" /> immediately charging that person with an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 applies various provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, to persons detained under section 2 so that, for example, when there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting a detained person of having committed an offence he or she must be released.  It also covers such matters as the requirement that a person be charged when there is evidence to do so, the provision of medical attention, access to a solicitor and the destruction of records where a detained person is not prosecuted or where he or she is acquitted.</P>
    <P>The Government announcement of July last on measures to combat drugs indicated that increased powers would be given to customs officers in relation to questioning of persons detained on suspicion of importing drugs.  To this end section 6 is aimed at enhancing the co-operation between the Garda and the customs service in the fight against the trade in illegal drugs by providing that regulations may be made for the attendance of, and participation by, an officer of customs and excise in the questioning of a person detained under section 2 of the Bill or under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, where the offence is one related to drug trafficking. Section 6 also provides, importantly, that where officers of customs and excise are invited to participate in such questioning they will be subject to the same conditions as apply to gardaí under the regulations made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, for the treatment of detained persons.</P>
    <P>The fight against the drugs menace is not an easy one and it is essential that we as legislators give the Garda all the necessary powers to respond to existing realities.  The nature of the menace often requires quick action by the Garda.  That is why I am providing, in section 7, for the amendment of section 26 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, to confer power on members of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent to issue search warrants in circumstances where a particular urgency <Col N="1371" /> arises and where this is necessary for the investigation of a drug trafficking offence.  Because, as I say, such warrants will issue in circumstances of particular urgency, they will cease to have effect after 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is an important section in that it limits the period of operation of sections 2, 3, 4 5 and 6 to 12 months from the date of commencement, unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that a section or sections shall continue in operation. This will give the House an opportunity to debate the effectiveness of these sections after they have been in operation for 12 months and at the end of any further periods for which the sections by resolution of the Oireachtas are coutinued in force.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies, and the public, will appreciate why we need to give the powers proposed in this Bill to those charged with the investigation and detection of crime.  We must do everything in our power to isolate and remove the malignancy which those who trade in ilegal drugs bring to our society.  I accept that the powers contained in the Bill are, by any standards, harsh but I hope that it will be understood that they are necessary and that any fears that they might be abused in any way will be allayed by the emphasis which has been put on providing safeguards, such as those in extending periods of detention against such abuse.</P>
    <P>I again pay tribute to Deputy O'Donoghue for the work which he put into the Misuse of Drugs Bill and, indeed, all Members who contributed to the debate on that Bill.  On the Order of Business the morning after that debate had concluded, Deputy Bertie Ahern requested that the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Bill should be incorporated in the Government's Bill.  I hope Deputy O'Donoghue can agree that the broad thrust of much of what he proposed in his Bill is addressed in the Bill before the House today in a manner that should prove effective in practice and <Col N="1372" /> withstand legal challenge.  Any differences of opinion which we may have can be discussed fully on Committee Stage. During the Second Stage debate of Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, I indicated a number of infirmities in it which could be open to legal challenge.  I have implemented in this Bill many of the matters which Deputy O'Donoghue set out to do but I ensured the infirmities in his Bill will not weaken this one.</P>
    <P>I intend on Committee Stage to bring forward an amendment to deal with a particular problem in the law as it relates to Garda powers of entry to premises where a public dance hall licence is in force.  At present, section 13 of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, gives any member of the Garda Síochána in uniform power to enter such venues to make such inspection, examination and inquiry as he thinks proper. In the context of investigation of drug related offences, the requirement that the garda must be in uniform is unhelpful to efforts to obtain evidence of drug dealing in dance halls.  To remedy this, I propose to amend the 1935 Act to give power to members of the Garda to enter such places, whether in uniform or not, in connection with investigating suspected drug trafficking offences.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a matter raised on the Order of Business &mdash; I know at least one Member will raise it today because she flagged it in a statement she issued to the newspapers yesterday.  The Deputy will be well aware that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is responsible for the day to day operations of the Garda Síochána.  In keeping with precedent set down by all previous Ministers for Justice, I do not get involved in the day to day operations, nor do I direct operations, of the Garda Síochána.  That is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  On the issue raised during the Order of Business, the investigation is ongoing and spans more than this country.  It would be inappropriate, and has never been appropriate for any Minister for Justice, Taoiseach or Member of this House to in any way jeopardise an ongoing investigation or cause <Col N="1373" /> danger to people involved by seeking to get operational details exposed here or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue raised questions about this operation. There is a precedent set down by previous Ministers where, on rare occasions, a Minister of the day may decide to make available to the Opposition spokespersons, who may be Ministers in waiting, an opportunity to get briefing from the Garda even if an operation and investigation were still continuing. That briefing was given to Deputy O'Donnell last Saturday and Deputy O'Donoghue today; it was offered to him last Saturday.</P>
    <P>Deputies must be realistic about what information they can expect me or any other Minister for Justice to make public about an ongoing investigation without demanding information that would force me or any other Minister to jeopardise it.  I say those words in anticipation of being pressed to break with precedent and somehow expose and outline the full day to day operations and investigations of the Garda on any crime committed.  I do not want to keep information from this House, but it is utterly inappropriate for me or any Deputy to seek to expose such information.</P>

      <P>I also want to refer to the matters dealt with during the Order of Business.  To correct the Taoiseach, I received a private briefing from the Garda which was offered and accepted.  This offer came from the Minister for Justice.  I also appreciate that one must not breach a confidence and I would not do so under any circumstances. Anything which has been said to me on a confidential basis would remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There had been a considerable number of newspaper articles concerning the seizure of illegal drugs at Urlingford, County Kilkenny, on 8 November 1995. Some of these reports, one as late as last Sunday, referred to the possibility of this having being a sting type operation. While what happened in Urlingford is <Col N="1374" /> confidential, in so far as it came out into the public domain such a matter could not be regarded as being confidential.  In this context, the hard political questions which must be asked in the House relate to what happened subsequent to Urlingford.</P>
    <P>On 9 November 1995, my party leader, in congratulating the Naval Service, the Garda and the other arms of State involved in this operation asked the Taoiseach why it appeared that the drug barons seemed to have escaped once again.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in reply:</P>
    <P>Obviously, one would not expect to find the drug barons in the lorry.  That they were not apprehended on the spot should not warrant the significance Deputy Ahern attaches to it.</P>
    <P>This appeared to indicate that the Taoiseach felt Deputy Ahern attached undue significance to the fact that neither the drug barons nor the driver or drivers of the lorry were captured.  If he gave weight to the question asked by Deputy Ahern, the only question he had to answer is whether the information he gave to Deputy Ahern that morning was correct.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter on the Ajournment later the same day the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, said in reply at column 135, volume 458 of the Official Report: &ldquo;I take the opportunity to congratulate the Garda on the success of the operation yesterday which resulted in the largest ever seizure of cannabis in the State.&rdquo;  It is a matter for the Minister and Minister of State in due course to tell the House whether a misleading impression was conveyed.</P>

      <P>On 14 December I put some questions to the Minister, as did Deputy O'Donnell.  In response to a question from Deputy O'Donnell about drugs seizures the Minister said at column 1803, volume 459 of the Official <Col N="1375" /> Report: &ldquo;I have already raised that question following the massive haul of drugs found at Urlingford...&rdquo; I then put it to her:</P>
      <P>I do not believe it would hinder any investigation if the Minister were to say whether the identity of those who purchased the drugs found at Urlingford is known to the Garda.  Further, is the identity of those who transported the drugs into the country and handled them also known to the Garda?</P>
      <P>The Minister said in reply:</P>
      <P>I regret that I cannot make any comment about a case that is under investigation by the Garda.  It would be inappropriate for me to say anything about an ongoing investigation lest I do damage to the integrity of the investigation process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill, which has been long promised by the Minister, brings to an end the legislative drought which has beset the Department of Justice since the formation of the rainbow coalition.  It is the first crime prevention measure to be introduced by the Government in its 15 months in office <Col N="1376" /> and I hope it signals an end to the intellectual famine which has been the hallmark of this administration's criminal justice policy.  In so far as it provides much needed powers for the Garda, it is welcome.</P>
    <P>It is, however, regrettable that a prolonged process of Cabinet guerrilla warfare has taken its toll on the Bill and, as published, it contains many diluted ideologies.  The Minister is not responsible for this dilution, although she has the unfortunate task of standing over aspects of the Bill which, as a result of enforced Cabinet compromise, are legally unsound and, in some instances, intellectually absurd.  Credit for the dilution of the Bill must go to her colleagues who place the rights of the accused above the rights of victims, who believe that the Constitution is a shield to protect the guilty rather than a sword to avenge the victim.</P>
    <P>Chief among those who have waged an insidious campaign against this Bill is the Tánaiste ably abetted, as always, by his multilingual sidekick, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, whose many friends in the recent past survived as long as they did by subverting the wishes of the majority.  This follically enhanced faction has done everything in its power to undermine and subvert the wish of the vast majority in this House to clear the undergrowth in which the drug dealers lurk and return the streets to the people. Whatever the merit of their argument, their methods have been reprehensible. I disagree profoundly with their crime protectionist policies.  The rights of victims ought to be to the fore.</P>
    <P>The clear light of parliamentary debate has been shunned by this Machiavellian couple who have been afraid to make their arguments in public. They have remained in the shadows, furtively whispering and scheming, seeking to achieve by innuendo what they cannot achieve by open debate and smirking in smug satisfaction as another political ambush is executed.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has become the master <Col N="1377" /> of unattributed comment, an off-the-record maestro &mdash; Mr. Anonymous himself. I invite him to shed his cloak of secrecy and step into the clear light of day. I invite him to explain his opposition to the plans as first announced by the Minister and justify his veto on the bail referendum.  He should speak in the daylight what he whispers in the shadows and discard his Svengali mode. He should be manly and speak for himself openly, transparently and publicly. Does the Minister have his full support and, if so, will he release journalists from their ethical duty not to disclose what he has said to them concerning her?</P>
    <P>This House has seen sufficient political vampires &mdash; men who, in the secrecy of the dark and the shadows, try to inflict political wounds on their partners in Government which they have neither the political character nor the courage to attempt openly.  The Tánaiste is such a man.  So, too, is the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  He has shown as little regard for the victims of crime as he once showed for the victims of his political mentors, the Communist Party of the old Soviet Union.  His conduct in this House in recent times amply demonstrated his disregard for fair dealing and accountability.  As he sits in Cabinet, scheming the downfall of the Government on its next budget, he represents a permanent impediment to progressive criminal justice legislation.  His veto is absolute, as we know, from the formation of the Government.  He awaits an excuse to depart and, lamentably, Fine Gael is not prepared to face him down.  No price is too high and no compromise too exacting.  What Democratic Left wants, it gets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the Deputy is deviating considerably from the subject matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about its gestation, as opposed to its publication.  What is the point in having any Fine Gael Minister in the Government? If Fine Gael cannot implement a <Col N="1378" /> law and order policy, what is the point in being in Government?  It is a party which has abandoned the substance of power in order to wear its trappings. Fine Gael Ministers exist to implement cosmetic socialist policies.  On the rare occasions such as this when a Fine Gael Bill survives the attrition process of political treachery in the corridors of power it has been diluted into virtual insignificance. It is regrettable that the Bill carries all the signs of having been through such a mill.</P>
      <P>An example of the manner in which the Bill has been rendered virtually unworkable can be seen in section 2, the provisions of which are intended to permit the detention of certain suspects for up to seven days.  For reasons presumably known to the Minister and certainly to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, a decision has been taken to the effect that a detained person must be brought before a court and afforded the opportunity to give and call evidence and make submissions before a period of detention can be extended.  This will render the detention section of the Bill virtually unworkable.</P>
      <P>On 12 October last when the Minister expanded on the details of this previously announced package she said the increased power of detention was necessary as &ldquo;due to the international dimension which often exists in such cases, it may be necessary for the Garda to make extensive inquiries in other countries when a person has been detained in connection with a suspected offence of illegal importation of drugs&rdquo;.  Without additional powers many persons detained in connection with serious offences may have to be released before investigations are sufficiently advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to advance the interests of the Garda in investigating international drug trafficking by compelling them to go to court and disclose to the detained person and the public at large the extent of their knowledge?  It is possible to envisage anything more damaging to the interests of justice than an open public court <Col N="1379" /> hearing at an early stage of an investigation where the Garda are forced to disclose their hand?  It flies in the face of logic and reason for such a provision to be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is particularly baffling that this provision was inserted without legal justification. Suspects detained under the provisions of section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 do not have to be given the information on which gardaí base their suspicions.  Suspects detained under that Act whose period of detention is being extended by a superintendent do not have to be given the information on which he reached his decision.  They do not have to be given the opportunity to make submissions as to why they should be released.  A similar position pertains to persons detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept that for the detention powers to be effective the application to the court must be <i>ex parte</i> as provided for in Part I of the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996 which Fianna Fáil introduced some weeks ago.  The Minister's Bill gives rise to more questions than it seeks to answer.  What provision has she made for a detained person to be informed of the case to be made for his or her further detention?  What time frame does she envisage suitable for the accused to consider the information, consult a solicitor and instruct counsel before the hearing?  What provisions have been made for the application of the legal aid scheme to such a contested hearing?  Does the Minister envisage that a detained person will not have a right of appeal from a decision of a court at such a hearing?  If power of appeal does not exist, why?  The Minister chose to take detention out of the realm of supervised administrative law and to insert it needlessly in the mainstream of criminal law.  That decision will have consequences the Minister's advisers have not foreseen.  Fair procedures, as set out in a series of decisions by the High and Supreme <Col N="1380" /> Courts, must apply to a hearing as envisaged by the Minister.  I would remind the Minister of the words of Mr. Justice Gannon in the case of the State (Healy) <i>v.</i> Donoghue (1976), page 335 of Irish Reports 325, at page 335 where it is stated:</P>
    <P>Among the natural rights of an individual whose conduct is impugned and whose freedom is put in jeopardy are the rights to be adequately informed of the nature and substance of the accusation, to have the matter tried in his presence by an impartial and independent court or arbitrator, to hear and test by examination the evidence offered by or on behalf of his accuser, to be allowed to give or call evidence in his defence, and to be heard in argument or submission before judgement is given.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the scheme envisaged in this Bill is one whereby a suspect is a person whose conduct is being impugned and whose freedom is put in jeopardy.  In the same case, Chief Justice O'Higgins stated:</P>
    <P>If the right to be represented is now an acknowledged right of an accused person, justice requires something more when, because of a lack of means, a person facing a serious charge cannot provide a lawyer for his own defence.  In my view the concept of justice under the Constitution requires that in such circumstances the person charged must be afforded an opportunity of being represented. This opportunity must be provided by the State.  Only in this way can justice be done, and only by recognising and discharging this duty can the State be said to vindicate the personal rights of the person charged.</P>
    <P>By acceding to the demands of the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, the Minister agreed to create a complex maze through which hapless gardaí will have to stumble blindfolded before the detention provisions can be utilised.</P>
    <P>In seeking to grant customs officers <Col N="1381" /> powers to question and detain suspects, it is regrettable the Minister exacerbated rather than improved the existing position.  Section 6 demonstrates a profound lack of knowledge of the realities of drug importation on the part of its authors.  Customs officers are often to the fore in this area of law enforcement. They are frequently the first to encounter drug smugglers.  At present they do not have adequate statutory power or authority to question suspects in the first vital minutes.  I had hoped the Minister recognised this and would move towards providing such a statutory power.  I was puzzled by her somewhat confused comments on section 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996, which I introduced.  It is clear she failed to grasp its significance.  The publication of this Bill, without granting any such power to customs officers, is a cause of concern. In the debate on the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996 she stated:</P>
    <P>I have to confess that this provision is a mystery to me.  While it is the case that the Government indicated that it was the intention to provide an increase in the powers of customs officers in relation to the questioning of the person detained on suspicion of importing illegal drugs, we did not envisage bringing about a situation where the role of the gardaí in putting together evidence for use in a prosecution might be supplanted.</P>
    <P>Those comments confirmed my earlier suspicion that she was badly briefed on this topic.  For the avoidance of doubt and the assistance of the Minister's advisers, I will spell out in detail why it is necessary to give customs officers the powers contained in my Bill, rather than the somewhat strangled ones contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Customs officials are frequently the first persons to encounter drug traffickers. At present there is no adequate statutory power to enable them to question suspects in the first few vital minutes.  In the People <i>v.</i>  Farrell [1978], <Col N="1382" /> Irish Reports 13, Chief Justice O'Higgins described the Judges Rules as follows:</P>
    <P>The Judges Rules are not rules of law.  They are rules for the guidance of persons taking statements. However, they have stood the test of time and will be departed from at peril.</P>
    <P>Widespread confusion exists as to whether the Judges Rules apply to customs officers.  They are, however, utilised by officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry when investigating breaches of the animal remedies Act.  The existing legal confusion can render comments made by suspects after detention by customs officials inadmissible at trial.  A statutory scheme to enable customs officials to question suspects in the absence of gardaí is necessary.  As the Minister's Bill, if passed, will be a criminal statute, it will have to be construed strictly. Thus, courts will be compelled to take the view that the only power which customs officials have to question is the power contained in the Bill.  This will result in potentially relevant answers being ruled inadmissible.  I hope the Minister will ask her officials to reexamine this oversight as it has potential to create serious mischief in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The most disappointing features of the Bill are not the measures included in a diluted form but those that are omitted.  The legislation, which has had a gestation period approaching that of the average elephant, is profoundly disappointing. It fails to address the horrendous delays occasioned by our present system of preliminary examination. In the recent debate on the Fianna Fáil Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996 the Minister stated that &ldquo;there would have to be strong grounds for doing away with a procedure which ensures that in the early stages of proceedings an opportunity is provided to have a court assess, in effect, whether there is a case which should be brought to trial&rdquo;. With due respect to the Minister, her <Col N="1383" /> comments display a detachment from courtroom reality.  She has been made to throw up excuses for inaction which have neither substance nor reality.  Does she know that in only a tiny percentage of criminal cases a District Court judge refuses to return an accused for trial? This fails to justify the retention of an expensive, time consuming and cumbersome system.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister seriously contend, in the latter part of the 20th century, that it is in the interests of justice that every accused person should have the absolute right to have every word of evidence dictated to a District Court clerk and transcribed in longhand before a trial can commence?  Are the people well served by this procedure?  Do victims applaud it as a manifestation of a fair and reasonable system or is it a nonsense? I believe it is the latter and I have manifested my view by introducing legislation which would remove the nonsense and speed up the preliminary stages of a criminal trial.  The Progressive Democrats followed by introducing broadly similar legislation.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Government to act.  The Minister's protestations in this House recently that this is a matter which she is examining at present in the context of measures which would speed up the trial process and that this, in turn, arises from the formulation of proposals in relation to bail amounts to a statement that nothing can be done until the Minister does something.  It is a frank admission that the Government's criminal justice policy is in a tangle, with no discernible plan for any one area.  We know there will be no progress on bail &mdash; the Tánaiste has vetoed the referendum and the Minister has stated that no progress can be made without a referendum.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in spinning forever in concentric circles.  The Government's policy is that nothing can be done about criminal procedure until something is done about courts; nothing can be done about courts until something is done about bail and nothing can be done <Col N="1384" /> about bail because the Tánaiste will not agree to it.  He sent his anonymous ventriloquist to speak to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week to insist that the Cabinet is preparing the ground to drop the referendum proposal.  His spokesman insists that any response will be legislative. Why is the Tánaiste permitted to publicly contradict the Minister for Justice on her area of responsibility?  Why has he been given the power to publicly rubbish the Minister's proposals?  Why has he a power of veto and who gave it to him?</P>
    <P>Crime will continue unabated as long as the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare hold their veto.  That has the effect of paralysing the Government. It has already succeeded in having a full 15 months pass before the first crime prevention measure was introduced by the Minister.  This is incontrovertible fact.  The claim by the Minister that the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995 is a crime prevention measure is nonsense.  What crime does it prevent? What power does it give to the Garda?</P>
    <P>Equally her claim that the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act is a crime prevention Act is patently incorrect.  It is a regulatory Act and, if the Minister were to examine it in detail, she would accept that its principal sections were lifted from the corresponding Fianna Fáil Bill.  These were the two measures instanced by the Minister as achievements in the area of criminal law reform when she spoke in the House recently. They represent the sum total of the claimed achievements of the Minister in the area of crime prevention legislation after 15 months in office &mdash; one Act which prevents trials being transferred from Cork and one Act which represents 45 minutes of legal transcription.</P>
    <P>As always, the Minister is knee-deep in committees and promises.  Six months after its publication the Minister claims to be still studying the Law Reform Commission report on bail.  Many Members believe that the Minister has had an opportunity to memorise the report.  What is delaying progress is not the Minister but Cabinet warfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> The Minister has said that she proposes to introduce a criminal law Bill dealing with statutory powers of arrest, a Non-fatal Offences against the Person Bill, a Juvenile Justice Bill, a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and a Fraud Bill.  Members will believe it when we see the Bills.  It is indicative of the reign of confusion which exists under this Government that when I asked the Taoiseach at the start of this session what legislation would be introduced he was of the view that the Minister was well advanced in working on a Criminal Insanity Bill.  It is probably too much to hope that the Taoiseach might have a grasp on legislation which his Government proposals to introduce.</P>
    <P>The bottleneck of promises and the instances of talk but no action confirm the existence of a legislative veto.  In 15 months which saw savage criminality we have been given one diluted Bill.  The issue of bail, which is top of every other agenda, is receiving &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;, &ldquo;study&rdquo;, &ldquo;is being assessed&rdquo;, &ldquo;is under review&rdquo;, &ldquo;is nearing completion&rdquo;, &ldquo;is being contemplated&rdquo;, and &ldquo;is under active management&rdquo;.  Proposals will emanate from the Government &ldquo;soon&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;; they are &ldquo;imminent&rdquo;, &ldquo;awaited&rdquo; and &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;.  The Minister has run out of adjectives and excuses.  No progress can be made until the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare lift their veto.</P>
    <P>While they seek a philosophical solution, reality continues unabated.  The bail system is in a shambles.  Last year the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court dealt with 831 new cases.  Warrants for arrest were issued in 189 cases.  Only one application was made to estreat bail &mdash; it appears this Government views bail as a licence to abscond.  Who will accept responsibility for this scandal?  Who is in charge of this Government's criminal justice policy?  The answer to both questions is the same &mdash; nobody.  As the buxom singer, Dolly Parton, said: &ldquo;The way I see it, if you want a rainbow you have got to live with the rain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The investigation of drug trafficking <Col N="1386" /> offences is a serious and onerous task for the authorities.  It is of paramount importance that they be given every protection and the legislation and resources it is feasible to give them to help them destroy the peddlers in death, to destroy their operations and the methods of destruction which they distribute. It is also of fundamental importance that people in public life must never count the success of the authorities' operations as being a personal, political success.  The success of those operations is obviously a cause of great joy and pride to everybody and it behoves politicians and Ministers to ensure that a misleading impression is never created in this House or elsewhere about seizures or fines by the Garda Síochána.  If this happened in the recent past, in light of reports we have seen in newspapers, it certainly behoves those who created that misleading impression to correct it and, where and when necessary, to correct the Official Report.</P>
    <P>My party is totally committed to the work of the Garda Síochána, the customs service and the Navy in this area. In so far as we can, if we are in office at some future date, we will exhibit that materially.  Meanwhile, they will have our full support in their work.</P>

      <P>The Bill's explanatory memorandum makes it clear that this Bill is the legislative element of a package approved in July 1995 by this Government.  The Bill deals with increased Garda powers of detention in drug trafficking cases, the issue of warrants by members of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Superintendent and includes participation by customs officers in the questioning of persons detained by the Garda in connection with drug trafficking offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drug trafficking has presented the State with problems of a type, scale and sophistication which our present laws are not equipped to confront.  The Bill responds to this exceptional problem by conferring exceptional powers on the Garda.  The principal way this is done is <Col N="1387" /> by extending the power to detain a suspect for the purposes of investigating the offence.  Previously the limit was 12 hours in the case of offences carrying a sentence of five years or more or 48 hours in the case of offences to which the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 applied.  Under this legislation, detention without charge for up to two weeks is possible in the context of a drug trafficking offence.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 there have been many instances of large drug consignments coming into Ireland.  Gradually the powers of the Garda and the Customs and Excise branch of the Revenue Commissioners have been built up to deal with crime and smuggling, as this was then known.  These procedures have been criticised by many as they are bound by the general right to silence, the lack of any realistic powers of interrogation and the adversarial system of prosecution.  Given the limitations of the common law and the existing statute law, it has proven extremely difficult to successfully prosecute any substantial drug dealers.</P>
    <P>There has been increasing evidence of sophisticated drug smuggling into Ireland, particularly along the south coast.  A drugs offence becomes a statistic when drugs are found or a person is convicted of one of the drugs offences. The problem appears to have grown quicker than our procedures have developed.  Highly organised armed criminal gangs control the drugs trade and, despite the welcome recent successful seizures by the Garda and Customs and Excise officers, it is clear that a range of procedural and legislative measures is required to ensure prosecutions and convictions.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party supports the measures in the Bill which will strengthen the arm of the investigating authorities in bringing people suspected of drug trafficking and other drug-related offences to justice.  Apart from its tragic effect on young people, including death from heroin and ecstasy, drug addiction has an enormous <Col N="1388" /> impact on crime.  The introduction of a new viciousness into crime as a result of drug abuse makes it imperative that radical measures be introduced and given the sanction of Dáil Éireann.  However, the Minister has said she views the comprehensive reforms proposed in the Prosecution of Offences and Punishment of Crimes Bill, 1996, as unrealistic and is determined to vote them down tomorrow evening.  We have proposed that the absolute right to silence should be curtailed and support the measures for increased detention of suspects as proposed in this Bill.  The time has come to carry out an examination as to whether the legal system should be made more inquisitorial in nature. There is a public perception that the guilty use the adversarial nature of the criminal justice system to escape justice. In other words, sophisticated criminals with sophisticated lawyers are taking advantage of the rules which have been built up over many years to protect an accused to such an extent that the pitch of the law is now balanced too much in their favour and not sufficiently balanced in favour of the public interest, which must be the overriding concern.</P>
    <P>The Bill is carefully crafted to ensure its constitutionality and it embodies the necessary safeguards to allow the provisions to survive a constitutional challenge. As far as I am aware, no public study or assessment has been carried out to ascertain the extent to which drugs are being smuggled into the country for transhipment elsewhere or the quantities being imported for local use. As an island nation we are susceptible to being used as a major transhipment facility for large quantities of drugs to the United Kingdom, continental Europe and America.</P>
    <P>There was an impressive series of drugs seizures in 1995 which culminated in the largest ever seizure of illegal drugs in Ireland and, possibly, the United Kingdom on 8 November when cannabis resin to the value of £150 million was seized by Garda at Urlingford. This seizure was presented to the public in a blaze of media publicity.  Despite all <Col N="1389" /> the euphoria and worthy congratulations on the successful joint operation, the first in which the National Drugs Task Force was involved, many questions about the details remained unanswered.  It appears that much of the information given by Garda sources surrounding the circumstances of the seizure was misleading.  I would like to know to what extent the Minister was aware that misleading information was given to the very experienced political and security correspondents covering the story.  It is very difficult in the field of justice and the related security issue for an Opposition Deputy to tread the narrow path between public responsibility on the one hand and the public's right to know or at least not to be actively deceived on the other.  I am very conscious of the need to be supportive and not to criticise the Garda Síochána or anyone else in the discharge of their duties in this area.  It is important to maximise public confidence in our ability to tackle major crime issues, particularly highly organised and sophisticated crime such as drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Last week I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice on foot of information I had received about the Urlingford drug seizure in November 1995. Extensive briefings concerning the background to the seizure given to newspaper correspondents were widely carried in the newspapers.  It was stated that the surveillance operation was prematurely ended because of an alleged leak to the media, that the shipment was loaded onto a trawler from a &ldquo;mother&rdquo; ship a few hundred miles off the south-west coast &mdash; this was according to intelligence &mdash; and that despite the surveillance at sea and a close watch on all ports the smugglers apparently managed to off-load the shipment from a trawler onto a 40 ft. container which was ultimately seized yards inside the Tipperary border on the main Dublin-Cork road.  It was also stated that the size of the shipment shocked gardaí at the scene &mdash; 15 tonnes were seized in a single swoop &mdash; that the Naval Service <Col N="1390" /> had been keeping suspicious movements of trawlers under radar surveillance and that three men and a woman from Finglas detained in connection with the consignment were carrying £230,000 in cash.</P>
    <P>At the time I joined in congratulating the Garda on their success in the drugs seizure.  However, I found it disturbing that the entire operation could have been sabotaged and prosecutions jeopardised by a leak to the media, which was the spin put on it.  I immediately raised the matter in the Dáil at Question Time on 9 November.  When I asked whether an investigation was ongoing into the alleged media leak the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, tried to portray my legitimate questions as criticism of the Garda, which they were not.  Surely such a leak would warrant a full investigation, given that it has allegedly sabotaged the entire operation and jeopardised prosecutions.  Surely it would constitute a major breach of security and could have jeopardised the lives of the gardaí involved in the operation, not to mention the possibility of prosecutions. We now know that the drugs were subsequently destroyed by the Garda and that no prosecutions were brought against any person.  What has happened to the £230,000 in sterling seized by the Garda and in respect of which no person has been charged?  Will this money be returned to those persons?</P>
    <P>On Monday, 25 February I tabled a question for written reply to the Minister as follows:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if her attention or the attention of any person in her Department has been drawn to any Garda sting type or entrapment operation involving the importation of a large quantity of illegal drugs into the State; if so, if the Garda Commissioner is aware of the operation; if such an operation existed, the person who authorised it; when it was initiated; the outcome of the operation; if she or the Garda Commissioner were informed of such <Col N="1391" /> Garda operation, if any, prior to, during or subsequent to the completion of the operation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this question was to ascertain the extent of the Minister's knowledge of any Garda sting type or entrapment operation and to elicit from her whether she had been aware of such an operation and, more importantly, whether she was aware that misleading information had subsequently been given to the media about the motivation, outcome etc. of the entire operation. The reply was unusually and suspiciously delayed and after several inquiries with the General Office and the Department of Justice the carefully worded reply &mdash; changes were made to it at the last minute &mdash; was faxed to my office after 6 p.m.</P>

      <P>My simple question had been tabled in the usual way with notice and I would like to know why it was so difficult to reply to it.  Was this the first time the Minister had been made aware of the detail of the operation? Had the Garda Commissioner briefed her on the matter and, if so, when?  Did she approve of misleading information being given to the media <Col N="1392" /> and did she willingly participate in the charade of the seizure at Urlingford? Was she aware that the Garda had not, as had been stated, merely watched the unloading of the drugs but had been involved in the handling as part of an elaborate separate operation?  Why was it necessary to so mislead the public and the media?  Why were the drugs not seized at the point of entry or at the point where the Garda took possession of the consignment on the high seas? What was the Customs and Excise involvement in this matter and did it approve of this style of operation?  How was the vessel which delivered the shipment to Ireland via a mother ship permitted to escape without trace while under surveillance by the Naval vessel the LE <i>Deirdre?</i>  Why were no charges brought against any individuals given that the shipment was under surveillance from the moment it entered Irish territorial waters and was landed in Cork?  Was the Customs and Excise service involved in the seizure, given that its job is to stop the importation of drugs at the first perimeter of defence, that is the Irish border.  How much did the entire operation cost and who or what agency defrayed the cost?  Were Garda lives put at risk by this operation?</P>
      <P>On the difficulties experienced by the Minister and her officials in answering my question, I would like to know if this was the first time the Minister's attention had been brought to the truth of the operation.  I note the Minister did not deny that there had been a sting type or entrapment operation.  She failed also to answer the specific question as to who, if anyone, authorised the operation, and whether she or the Garda Commissioner had any knowledge of it at a relevant time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday last the Minister offered me a briefing on this matter before which I made it clear that I was not prepared to be compromised into silence by a confidential briefing.  After that briefing I am still of the opinion there are serious questions to be answered.  The Minister must account for the fact that <Col N="1393" /> the public were misled over a prolonged period of time in the handling of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy will get another similar offer from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I raised it in the House, the matter was speculated upon in <i>The Irish Times</i> in December last and over the weekend in the <i>sunday Business Post.</i></P>
      <P>Was the consignment of drugs in question imported to Irish territory with ministerial authority?  At what level was the importation operation authorised? When were the Minister and the Taoiseach informed of the importation proposal? Were the Revenue Commissioners prepared to go along with the operation?  Was this truly an operation which had the unanimous support of the National Drugs Task Force?</P>
      <P>The Garda Press Office had disputed media claims that the drug shipment in question was a sting which went wrong, but was it a sting which went right?  If so, why all the cloak and dagger carry on?  Suggestions have been made that the operation was compromised by leaks to the media by customs officers in Cork.  However, Revenue sources have denied this and said they had only been involved in the operation at a later stage.  What is the truth?  We know that the cannabis was burned in an ESB power station in December and that nobody has been charged in connection with the Urlingford find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be better if the Minister clarified to the House the extent of her knowledge and involvement and approval of this operation.  I would like her view of the subsequent media handling of the matter.  If it was part of an elaborate international operation, why not just seize the drugs at the point when they came into the possession of the Garda?  What was the need to do so in a blaze of publicity at Urlingford?  If secrecy and confidentiality are essential, warranting misinformation for the media, why have a blaze of publicity <Col N="1394" /> about the seizure?  Surely that might compromise an international operation. Was there ever any hope of bringing prosecutions against anybody in this whole episode?  Would the drugs have been brought into the country without the co-operation of the Garda and Naval authorities?</P>
    <P>There are various reports of 13 tonnes of cannabis and, in other places in the media, 15 tonnes of cannabis.  What is the correct figure?  Was this the figure which was intended to be intercepted, and was it all safely transhipped and landed in Ireland and subsequently seized?  Are there dangers of breaches of security in relation to such dangerous operations?  What does the Director of Public Prosecutions feel about the propriety of such entrapment operations, if they exist?</P>
    <P>The Minister opened her reply with a preamble as to Garda operations being subject to the rule of law, constitutional rights, public interest and the law of evidence. What is the point of this lecture? One would have thought that went without saying.  Has the legality or propriety of this operation been challenged by the Attorney General, the DPP or anybody in her Department?  Is the reference to evidence a suggestion that the <i>modus operandi</i> may have jeopardised the possible prosecutions of persons by the inadmissibility of evidence acquired in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>The reply also states that the Minister &ldquo;is informed by Garda authorities&rdquo;, significantly not the Garda Commissioner. Was the Garda Commissioner made aware of this operation, and did he fully brief the Minister at any material time?</P>
    <P>Is the investigation ongoing?  The Minister today indicated that the reason she could not give any information to the House was because the investigation is ongoing.  That answers that question.</P>

      <P>If the investigation is not ongoing, why not, given that a major amount of drugs was involved?  If it is ongoing, why were the drugs destroyed, since the evidence would be material to any prosecutions pending?  Who originally paid for the drugs?  Was it criminals and, if so, how was it passed to the supplier of the drugs?  How was the balance to be paid?  Why have there been no prosecutions so far?  Why can the evidence of the source not be used? Surely he could identify the persons who were purchasing the drugs.  What is the connection of the persons in possession of large amounts of money who were arrested but not charged?</P>
      <P>There are many questions.  The more one asks questions the more questions proliferate.  My role as Opposition spokesperson on Justice is as clearly defined as that of the Minister.

      <P>Sting operations are very much part and parcel of the strategy adopted internationally against drug trafficking.  What is wrong in admitting that it was a sting operation designed to outfox criminals importing drugs to this country.  I am sure the public would not disapprove of such a measure.  Unusual methods are necessary and, perhaps, essential in trying to bring sophisticated international drug traffickers to justice. Why was it not simply said that this was an elaborate internationally organised sting operation which yielded the successful seizure and interception of a large quantity of illegal drugs?  Why was it necessary to hide the operation?  If it had to be secret, why the blaze of publicity and the attempt to blame a leak to the media for the premature ending of the operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the truth of the Urlingford seizure is that the Garda made a rendezvous with a ship using a disguised trawler, took possession of the drugs, landed them in Ireland and permitted or arranged for them to be brought into Urlingford, then there are very serious questions for the Government.  Was the largest drugs haul here landed by the State?  Was it a seizure in the true sense <Col N="1399" /> of the word or a massive deception which went badly wrong?  Are people still being duped by some members of the Government who are too embarrassed to reveal the truth not only to the people but to their colleagues?</P>
    <P>It is one thing to keep secret the detail of an operation in the interests of security and it is particularly appropriate when the forces of law and order are dealing with subversive or organised activities such as this, but it is another thing, and quite wrong, to deliberately feed lies to the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is quite wrong to deliberately feed misinformation to the media, for the Minister to collude with the misinformation and dine out on it by posing for photographs and other media events which formed the basis of the misleading package to the public.  It could be that the Minister knew nothing of the true facts and that she was given the story line carried in the newspapers. If this is so, is the Minister happy that she should have been kept in the dark? If gardaí had been killed or injured in this operation would it be acceptable that it went ahead without ministerial approval?  I will not make any allegations but pose questions.  The answer to my question last week was a masterpiece of ambivalence and shows yet again the futility of tabling questions in the House, our only method of securing public accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda stated through its press office that this operation was legal.  I am prepared to accept that is its bona fide opinion.  However, I would prefer to hear the Minister explain it.  I have a right to raise the issue in the House with the Minister who has responsibility for <Col N="1400" /> the Garda.  My focus relates to political accountability.  Was there lawful authority to land these drugs in the State? Did those who landed them have ministerial approval for the operation?</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business on 9 November Deputy Bertie Ahern congratulated the Garda on the seizure, in common with other Deputies, and expressed regret that, yet again, the drug barons behind the haul had escaped.  The Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>Obviously one would not expect to find the drug barons in the lorry.  That they were not apprehended on the spot should not warrant the significance Deputy Ahern attaches to it.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>However, we should congratulate the Garda Síochána, Revenue Commissioners and all of the State's security offices on the biggest drugs find in the nation's history rather than trying to make much of the fact that the drug barons were not found in the cab of the lorry when it was found.</P>
    <P>The same kind of put down was repeated when I expressed concern that, as a result of the alleged leak to the media, prosecutions might be jeopardised. The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would have thought today was a day for congratulation and encouragement of the Gardaí,</P>
    <P>to which I responded:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nobody wishes to take away from the well deserved congratulations due to those involved for the success of the cross-agency co-operation in the haul.  If such reports are correct, will the Minister accept the need for an examination of the circumstances surrounding such a leak of information?</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie stated:</P>
    <P>I note the Deputy said &ldquo;if such reports are correct&rdquo;.  I do not wish to enter into conjecture.  This is an operational matter...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> He then invited me to table more questions on the matter.  I have done so but the evasive nature of the reply begets more questions.  I am within my rights as a Deputy in putting these questions. Indeed they should have been put earlier but I wonder if it would have made any difference.  One was made to feel churlish raising questions in face of the flaming media blitz on the success of the seizure.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware no prosecutions have been brought in the interim although the passage of time has allowed for the possibility of prosecutions to be considered and worked on.  Will the Minister inform the House whether prosecutions are in train?  Will she reply to the questions I posed or will this matter continue to fester and be open to speculation?  It is claimed in a Sunday newspaper that the largest drug seizure in this State was an aborted Garda sting operation.  This was disputed by the Garda press office according to the article which stated that a press office spokesman said it was incorrect to suggest that the 13 tons of cannabis resin seized at Urlingford, County Kilkenny, on November 8 last was purchased by the authorities to entrap drug dealers.</P>
    <P>I am sure no such payment was made by the Garda, but with such prolific and colourful speculation, surely it is better for the Minister to set the record straight in the House.  What can be so problematic about that?  Why is the Minister distancing herself from this matter?  No one is suggesting she has a day to day hand in the operations of the Garda, but in a major operation such as this, I would expect her to receive a full briefing from the Garda Commissioner. It is not good for the Garda to be involved in disputing allegations made by newspapers or answering questions put by me when the proper place for questions to be answered is in this House, particularly when the Minister for Justice played such a major role in the media publicity surrounding the seizure and subsequent to it.  I await the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Boylan.  I compliment the Minister on the proposals in the Bill. Illegal drugs affect people across the board.  The trade knows no boundaries. It is taking a grip in rural counties in a way one would not have thought possible a decade ago.  I know the Government, through the Minister for Justice, is tackling the problem head on, but it still remains a headache.  It is as devastating as the ending of the peace process and far more insidious.  It is ensnaring our greatest asset in a trap of self-destruction. If we do not put all our resources into solving this problem our youth will not have a chance to grow up in a normal, civilised way.  Too many of them have been trapped.  Community after community reels against the onslaught of people high on drugs, many committing dastardly offences against people and property.  We cannot allow it to continue.  I commend the Minister and the Government for the measures it is proposed to introduce.</P>
      <P>We cannot be too hard on the lords who import the deadly goods or the foot soldiers who peddle the product not caring to whom they distribute it.  Money is their god and the way to inflict most pain on drug dealers is to hit them in their pockets.  Al Capone was not apprehended because he had a gun in his hand but as a result of the diligent efforts of the tax inspectors.  He went to jail for that as should all here who deal in drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of Deputy Owen's concern to beat this menace and how much the Government is willing to commit in this regard.  I agree with the proposals though it would be my desire to commit the Army to the battle where and when <Col N="1403" /> necessary.  We are talking about security. If we cannot beat this evil our country will stagnate.  We all have a responsibility in this matter and no one should shirk it.  We must be vigilant, observant and willing to help the Garda in its battle against this deadly peril.  The Garda and the authorities will not be found wanting, but they must have the full co-operation and support of the public to be in a position to rid us of such an alien culture.  I compliment the Minister on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join earlier speakers in complimenting the Minister for introducing serious legislation which we, as public representatives, will be called on to approve.  Drug trafficking is an epidemic which affects every section of society.  The Minister must be supported and I am confident she is the right person to deal with this serious problem.</P>
      <P>I am not put out by the attack by the Progressive Democrats which surprised and disappointed me.  It pointed to one incident and tried to throw enough mud so that some would stick, but it will not. I am not worried by the author of the 20 questions put to the Minister &mdash; the same person could probably not get a road tarred in County Cavan.</P>
      <P>The Garda is doing excellent work but it must be given the power to deal with ruthless people who have no regard for the welfare of young people who will use every opportunity available to get drugs and to peddle them.  Unfortunately, they use weak-will people in financial difficulties who believe they can redeem their debts by getting involved in once-off operations.  There are many sad cases like that.  As the previous speaker said, drug barons and the dealers must be dealt with.  The Minister can be assured of public support for the introduction of necessary powers to deal with these people.  If they were locked up for all time without remission I would not lose any sleep because they do not deserve consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda is clearly coming to grips with this major problem.  Some £130 <Col N="1404" /> million worth of drugs were recovered in the haul in Urlingford, County Kilkenny.  It was asked if the Garda went about it in the right way.  Should the Garda have sent a telegram to these people to tell them that they were under investigation?  I have never heard such nonsense and such a suggestion would be repudiated by the people.  There have been other major hauls of cannabis resin and hash, but drugs in tablet form are causing more serious problems and young people are becoming addicted to them.  Although I have no evidence, I understand these drugs are being manufactured in factories here.  People must understand what is happening.  It is not good enough to say that community leaders must be involved and must take responsibility &mdash; parents must know where their children are and with whom they are mixing.  Young people spend £7 to £9 on three or four pints of beer to become good humoured, but for £5 the effect of one of these tablets will last the entire night.  This terrible state of affairs must be addressed and I have confidence that the Minister will do so and that parents will thank her for her efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I said that Part IV of the Bill is a well-meaning attempt at reform of the cumbersome procedure in the Criminal Justice Act, 1967, and that it recognised that the system of depositions envisaged by that Act has no place in the late 20th century. Reform of this area of law has already been proposed by Fianna Fáil which published the Criminal Procedure <Col N="1405" /> Bill, 1995.  That Bill proposed the abolition of preliminary examination and an immediate remand to the court of trial.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is the only party which has published comprehensive proposals to reform the criminal justice system. We published the amendment to the Constitution which we propose, statutory changes to the bail law which we consider necessary and the new procedures we would see operating.  We await proposals from other parties.  We know the Labour Party is against the referendum but it has articulated no other policy.  One might ask if it has a policy.  Is the Labour Party so beset by questions of political strategy that it has not found time to develop a criminal justice policy?  Perhaps Deputy Costello speaks for the party in this area.  Do his concerns and those of some of his colleagues extend to the victims of crime?</P>
      <P>Section 14 proposes serious modifications of the right to silence.  In my address to the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis I called for a public debate on this much misunderstood topic.  The right to silence has two distinct purposes.  It prevents a jury from drawing any adverse inference from an accused person's failure to comment when arrested or questioned by a garda.  It also prevents a jury from drawing any adverse inference from an accused person's failure to give evidence at a trial. It must be remembered that the right to silence developed during an age when it was one of the few effective defences open to an accused person and when an accused person was not entitled to speak in his own defence.  Few people realise that it is in relatively recent times that an accused person is permitted to give or call evidence in his own defence. The right to silence was allowed when accused persons were not entitled to legal aid or any other form of constitutional fairness guaranteed by our Constitution.  Its place in our legal system must now be examined and that is one of the reasons I called for a public debate last November.  I hope this section will encourage that debate but it cannot take place on a simplistic level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> The right to silence has an international dimension.  The two principal international human rights instruments to which Ireland is a party &mdash; the European Convention on Human Rights, by virtue of Article 60 subsection (2), and the United Nations Convention on Civil and Political Rights, by virtue of Article 14 subsection (2) &mdash; contain provisions guaranteeing the rights of persons charged with criminal offences to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.</P>
    <P>The report of the Government advisory committee on fraud published in December 1992 stated that the right to silence, or more generally, the privilege against self incrimination, may in certain circumstances be merely an aspect of the rule that the burden is on the person who alleges the crime to prove it and that if the right to silence is to be modified and if the State is to remain faithful to its international obligations, care must be taken to ensure that the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt is not undermined.  I have grave reservations as to whether section 14, as drafted, meets our international obligations. However, I hope when addressing this section the Minister will indicate Government policy on this topic.</P>
    <P>I would also welcome any information the Minister has on the operation over the past decade of sections 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provide that where a person is arrested without warrant for an offence and on being asked fails or refuses to account for his or her presence at a location or for the presence of suspicious objects, substances or marks. inferences may be drawn from this in any criminal proceedings to the extent of corroborating other material evidence. A person may not, however, be convicted solely on the basis of any such inference.  Alterations to the right to silence should occur only after informed public debate and in the context of our international obligations.  I again call for that debate and I hope on this occasion my call will be heard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> Part VII seeks to achieve the same effect as Part III of my recently introduced Misuse of Drugs Bill.  It seeks to provide information to the public about the operations of temporary release.  I cannot see what objection the Minister could have to accepting this.</P>
    <P>The provision about which I am most concerned is in section 4 which permits the Taoiseach to make regulations effectively expanding the function of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It would require an expansion of the staffing of the DPP's office without necessarily achieving a reduction in State expense elsewhere.  The Office of the DPP has generally functioned well in the manner in which it was intended &mdash; it is there to direct prosecutions. Those prosecutions are best conducted by persons with actual court experience &mdash; solicitors or counsel.  A blurring of that distinction so that the director or his staff conduct prosecutions would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged when the Act was passed that the Office of the DPP would act in much the same way as the Office of the Attorney General.  Policy decisions would be taken by the attorney or director and implemented by appropriate lawyers.  In rural areas the proposed change could result in one firm of solicitors being retained by the State and another by the director. Nobody could be of the view that an increase in the number of lawyers would result in a reduction in costs.  At present solicitors employed in the Chief State Solicitor's office may be assigned to a number of different tasks on behalf of the State or the director as the need arises.  The same solicitor appearing in the same court is in a position to conduct prosecutions on behalf of the DPP and any other State agency.  The proposal in this Bill would result in unnecessary duplication of staff without any obvious advantage.</P>
    <P>The function of directing prosecutions is an onerous one.  The implementation of decisions to prosecute is best left in the hands of persons with <Col N="1408" /> experience in the conduct of cases.  The Chief State Solicitor and State solicitors throughout the country have served us well.  It would be the height of folly to transfer part of their function to an office established to make policy decisions on criminal cases.  Once a policy decision is made it must be implemented by a lawyer, and the fewer lawyers operating, the less is the cost. The present system is an example of versatility and efficiency and no coherent call for change has been established.</P>
    <P>The Government has a lamentable record in introducing criminal justice legislation.  At least part of the blame must lie at the feet of those members of the Cabinet who have chosen to exercise a veto on progress &mdash; the Tánaiste is the leader of that group.  Is it too much to hope that he and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, will tell us their policy for reform of the criminal justice system?  It appears the Minister for Social Welfare is very strong on criticism but very short of ideas.  Can he tell us his party's policies for reform, or is the phone line to Moscow down?  The Minister seems well capable of making announcements and seeking advertisements in certain publications on other matters.  I wonder do his powers of communication stretch to telling us his party's policy on criminal justice.  The difficulty is that many people do not buy <i>Forum</i> magazine. The Minister for Social Welfare should outline in the public arena his precise policies on criminal law reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As a Deputy from a rural area, and having held political meetings in my constituency in recent weeks, I am aware of the perception that the law is not on the side of those with power &mdash; the Garda Síochána &mdash; but of criminals.  In the west there has been a great tradition of protecting our old people.  When people went to bed at night they did not have to worry about crime and the Garda Síochána was there to protect them. <Col N="1409" /> Rural Garda stations were open and law and order was upheld.</P>
      <P>As a new Deputy, I am amused at the number of Bills introduced by the Opposition.  One would think the people on the other side were never in Government and that there was never a Minister for Justice from that side of the House.  When I heard Deputy O'Donnell attacking the Minister for Justice I thought the Minister was judge and jury, who could convict and fine, who is aware of every crime committed and has the answer to every question.  I am not a solicitor but I believe that law and order is about protecting people.  A person who commits a crime should pay the penalty and should not get out on bail.  Members on all sides of the House believe that we must be very careful not to put innocent people behind bars.  I do not want to see innocent people behind bars, but as a rural Deputy I want to prevent people from Dublin travelling to the west in high powered cars to attack elderly people.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago RTÉ reported on a court case in Dublin and I watched with amazement as people convicted of crime put up their two fingers and spat at the interviewer.  They had no respect for law and order.  The people believe that a person who commits crime should pay for it.  I am not saying that we should hold innocent people in prison for six, 12 or 15 months until their trial is heard, but known criminals are getting out on bail.  There is a perception that in some cases solicitors are aware that the person they are defending is guilty.  It is their job to defend people and they are well paid to do so, but at the end of the day it is our job as legislators to protect those who obey the law.  It annoys me that people are arrested for having no tax or for being slightly over the drink-driving limit. That is not what law and order is about. It is about apprehending those who commit serious crime.  I accept that 95 per cent of people obey the law, but the remaining 5 per cent who constantly commit crime are making life miserable for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> I welcome the fact that Opposition parties introduce Bills, but many of those Members particularly the previous speakers, had an opportunity in the past seven or eight years to bring in legislation in this area.  People who pay their taxes are annoyed that the criminal is protected rather than the victim.  The best way to protect people is to make those who commit crime pay.  The Government will be introducing a Bill in this regard, and the sooner the better because the people will no longer tolerate the present position.  Those who commit serious crime should pay for it. For too long criminals have been driving from Dublin in high powered cars to the west to attack elderly people.  A lady who rang me recently said that she goes to bed in daylight and gets up in daylight because of her fear of criminals. Elderly people should be happy in the knowledge that they are protected by the State.</P>
    <P>The policy of previous Government of transferring gardaí from rural areas to densely populated centres has not worked.  Governments should admit when they make a mistake, and that was a mistake.  Gardaí should live in the areas in which they work.  There should be a return to the position when, in the west at least, there was a sergeant and two or three gardaí in every village.  At that time if a strange vehicle or person came into the area the gardaí were aware of it and the local people had confidence in the Garda.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a very serious crime was committed in my constituency but, though there were 22 or 23 gardaí in the local town, the people did not know them.  The Garda will not be given the information they require in confidence when people do not know who they are. Legislation should be introduced to deal with criminals.  It is easy to prosecute publicans or motorists for speeding, but it is not as easy to prosecute those we should target, the people involved in serious crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the sentiments vigorously expressed by my colleague, <Col N="1411" /> Deputy Ring.  I met a person in my constituency of Dublin North East whose 1993 car was stolen the other night and was found three or four miles away, hopelessly vandalised and a write-off. That person's family was distraught as that was the second or third occasion a car had been stolen on their road in recent months.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy about the number of gardaí deployed in my constituency, which has a population of approximately 85,000.  Fewer than 200 gardaí are assigned to the Garda stations in Coolock, Raheny and Howth.  Those gardaí are expected to police a very large territory.  They do so heroically day and night and have been successful in stabilising and reducing the overall level of crime in some Garda districts. The resources available to the Garda are insufficient.  I share the sentiments expressed by many rural Deputies faced with a similar problem following the closure of rural Garda stations which results in a small number of officers policing large territories.  Additional Garda must be deployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputies O'Donnell and Michael McDowell for their lengthy work on this Bill.  It contains useful proposals which I fully endorse. However, overall, it lacks coherence and some of the proposals are somewhat bizarre.  The Bill has been devalued to some extent by the tone and content of the debate last week.  In particular, Deputy O'Donoghue's contribution was outrageous and warrants a strong response.  During recent months Deputy O'Donoghue and the Fianna Fáil Party in general have sought to make political capital out of the crime issue, largely at the expense of the Minister for Justice.  Last week the target of the attack extended to include my party leader, the Tánaiste, and one of his advisers, Mr. Fergus Finlay, who appears to have acquired mythical status within the ranks of Fianna Fáil since the collapse of the previous Government.  At times that party <Col N="1412" /> appears to be more interested in opposing Mr. Finlay than the Government. That is a sad indictment of Fianna Fáil. Crime is a serious issue, but members of Fianna Fáil do not appear to be able to resist the inclination to stick their tongues out at Fergus Finlay.</P>
    <P>At least Fianna Fáil is consistent.  It has sought to address the crime issue with only one thing in mind, political aggrandisement.  It forgets that the Minister has been in power for just under 18 months.  If there are problems &mdash; and in my view there are considerable ones &mdash; in the Department of Justice, Fianna Fáil which held the justice portfolio for almost seven consecutive years is directly culpable for the present crisis and no amount of political posturing by Deputy O'Donoghue will change that.  The Government and local authorities have sought to address problems associated with factors that have given rise to the drugs problem and the level of crime.  Interest was not expressed by Fianna Fáil when in Government for that lengthy period in areas such as estate management or social housing reform.  It was left to recent Ministers to address those issues, given that many large housing estates were built without the necessary social infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue drew attention to the complex issue of bail dealt with in sections 7 and 8.  It demands a fundamental examination of the competing rights of an individual to liberty while not convicted of an offence and the rights of the community at large to be protected from individuals likely to commit an offence.  I am aware the Minister for Justice will shortly announce the Government's proposals in this area and they will be all the better for the extensive deliberations that have taken place.  If the issue were simple, I am sure Deputy Owen's predecessors would have addressed it long ago.  Rather than taking action on the matter the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, referred it to the Law Reform Commission but did not ask it to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> While Deputy O'Donoghue was prepared to grant the previous Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, time to consider the merits of bail reform he has constantly harassed this Minister since she came into office.  In recent years, even during partnership Governments, Deputy O'Donoghue had ample time and opportunity to raise these important matters.</P>
    <P>Ironically, Deputy O'Donoghue cites the Tánaiste as attempting to stifle any political debate on the bail issue, but in the same contribution he produced an article written by the Tánaiste and published in <i>The Kerryman</i>.  If I were in the business of stifling public debate, writing a newspaper article would not be the way I would go about it.  The article is in the Tánaiste's name, not that of Mr. Fergus Finlay.  In it the Tánaiste raised a number of questions about bail reform. Deputy O'Donoghue is aware that there are legitimate questions on that issue and he has raised many of them.  Some of them are addressed in the Bill. However, changes in our bail laws that do not require a referendum are not on Deputy O'Donoghue's agenda.  Having crudely jumped on the bandwagon of demanding major changes to deal with the crime issue in recent months, he now requires a referendum to justify his scaremongering.  It is Deputy O'Donoghue who has attempted to stifle debate on the issue of crime.  He has constantly projected it as a simple one of criminal justice reform.  He refuses to care about many of the underlying causes that have contributed greatly to the problem of crime.  For example, in Dublin up to 80 per cent of crime is drug-related and concentrated in areas of great deprivation.</P>
    <P>During the past 15 to 20 years Fianna Fáil's performance has been one of hypocrisy.  That party which calls for increased resources for the Garda and prison service is simultaneously advocating a general economic policy that requires massive cuts in public expenditure. When addressing the institute of directors before Christmas Deputy Ahern called for significant cuts in the <Col N="1414" /> social welfare budget.  That is something to which I will repeatedly draw attention in the months ahead.  If Fianna Fáil wants to slash public spending in the areas of social welfare, education, health and Garda and prison service resources, it is hypocritical for it to seek major reforms.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the Government's strategy in these areas has been more holistic. Drugs have been correctly identified as a major contributor to our crime problem. Recent presentations by Ministers Owen, Bhreathnach and Noonan dealt coherently with the major community response needed in the drugs area.  They referred to measures to prevent the supply of drugs and announced a liaison policy between the Garda and Revenue to put the drug barons behind bars for long periods.  That is where they deserve to be and should have been in recent years.  This will be achieved by identifying the drug barons and, if necessary, using some of the information collected by Revenue as evidence in court.  A programme of treatment measures, particularly targeted at rehabilitating drug abusers who express a wish to come off drugs, is required.  At long last the Government is investing significant resources in education to encourage young people not to go down the road of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The Government approach, announced last month, seeks to address the matter of educating people on drug abuse generally and the treatment of addicts within the State and voluntary sectors.</P>
    <P>The budgetary proposals to tackle the problems of long-term unemployment along with the commitment of the Department of the Environment to the concept of estate management will be helpful in strengthening community resistance to the abuse of drugs.  While there is room for considerable progress on the part of all Government Departments in countering this horrific problem afflicting Dublin city inhabitants in particular, I am pleased the Government has made a significant start.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Members of the Progressive Democrats have a somewhat blinkered approach to criminal justice reform since they, like many parties of the extreme right, appear to take the view that all public expenditure, with the exception of that on crime detection, is bad; the old adage &ldquo;a stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; does not appear to be part of their thinking.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has said she will not be accepting this Bill, she has indicated she will incorporate some of its provisions in her Bill.  I welcome Deputy O'Donnell's general proposals on a unified prosecution service.  On at least four occasions when the Accounting Officer of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions appeared before members of the Committee of Public Accounts, we were appalled at the dearth of statistical information available on different types of crime, the lack of urgency in bringing forward prosecutions, the appalling lack of speed on the part of the prosecution service, giving the general impression of its being an early 19th century service working for a late 20th century State.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems identified by the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the Office of the Attorney General were further highlighted on the collapse of the last Government.  The proposals of Deputy O'Donnell and others in relation to inter-office business between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and that of the Chief State solicitor are commendable and worthy of serious consideration.  I also welcome the suggestion of an annual report being submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas, in addition to requesting the appearance of the Director of Public Prosecutions before committees of the House, if necessary, the Committee of Public Accounts, to allow Members examine the overall performance of his office and whether crime nationwide is being dealt with effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy O'Donnell on the provisions of sections 5 and 6 of her Bill. <Col N="1416" /> With my Labour Party colleagues I paid a visit to Mountjoy Prison before Christmas and we were horrified to witness many of the problems already reported to us, giving greater credence the the adage &ldquo;seeing is believing&rdquo;, in particular the extent of the drugs problem there, its massive overcrowding, its total inability to rehabilitate and/or prevent prisoners from recidivism and long-term crime.  At the end of our discussions there my colleagues and I were not entirely happy with some of Governor Lonergan's views.  Given that previous Governments &mdash; including those in which my party participated &mdash; gave clear directions to prison governors to establish drug-free units, it is most disappointing that only now, on the instructions of the Minister for Justice, is the creation of a drugs-free unit being contemplated.</P>
    <P>As one of my colleagues on Dublin City Council said recently the tragic position in Mountjoy Prison is that people who may have entered there drug-free emerge drug addicts, an appalling indictment of our prison system which must cease forthwith.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of Deputy O'Donnell's Bill <i>vis-á-vis</i> a coherent prisons service dealt with in sections 22 to 30, inclusive &mdash; the concept of a three-year assessment of prison space, following the recommendations of the Whitaker report on the governance of prisons and the appointment of an inspector of prisons who would report continuously. All of those are valuable suggestions I hope the Minister will take on board when drafting her Bill.  The appointments of a director and inspector of prisons appear to me to warrant further consideration.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill dealing with bail represent a positive contribution to that debate, to which Deputy O'Donoghue, in particular, might well pay heed.  While aware that the Minister questioned the constitutionality of such measures, I disagree with her that it is questionable whether we should seek to divert punishment onto a person who stands bail for another.  However, in <Col N="1417" /> many cases it will be the person who stands bail for another who will be best placed to judge whether that individual is likely to commit an offence resulting in their money being estreated, in which case they might not agree to stand bail in the first place.</P>
    <P>A number of my colleagues with a legal background have urged that we re-examine the matter of consecutive or harsh sentencing in relation to crimes committed while on bail.  Since those sections of this Bill dealing with bail represent a positive contribution the Minister and Deputy O'Donoghue would be well advised to re-examine them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's attitude to the proposals <i>vis-á-vis</i> the right to silence in this Bill.  Since these constitute a fundamental change in the law requiring considerable consideration and discussion it is not possible to incorporate them within the confines of this debate. No doubt Deputy O'Donoghue will endorse these sentiments, having placed his desire for public debate on these issues on the record last week.</P>
    <P>While I am in broad agreement with the provisions of section 31, on a technical point, if a pardon is granted in respect of an offence which is deemed never to have been committed, it ceases to be a pardon in the strict sense of the word.  Having sought to transfer responsibilities to the prison service for all functions in relation to custodial sentences in section 34, I fail to understand the reason for the Minister being brought into the fray or why this function could not have been left to the new director of prisons and his inspectorate.</P>
    <P>While many of the provisions of the Bill are laudable, they attempt to do too much in too many diffuse areas and, given that the Minister has expressed her plans and intention to introduce further legislation, I regret I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>Never has there been a greater demand on our Legislature to take positive action to combat the rash of lawlessness manifested on our streets in recent years.  The electorate is crying our for some visible sign that the Legislature is facing up to the threats stalking our streets, yet the Government has been singularly silent on this matter. Furthermore, the Minister has been frozen in inactivity.  Despite constant urgings of the Opposition parties since assuming office, she has been embarrassingly static in her approach to crime. We have listened to her proposals but they have not been followed by action. Indeed, those measures she has implemented have constituted a miserable response to a crisis of alarming proportions.</P>
      <P>I now realise that that pathetic response is not all of the Minister's making, that her requests for funding at the Cabinet table fall on deaf ears, or are brushed aside as the parties of the left scrabble and scrounge for every spare penny to shore up their personal egos and images as parties of the people.  By denying the Minister and her Department their rightful share of the financial benefits of the present boom, they have deprived women the right to walk our streets at night without being molested, the right of the old and alone to a carefree night's sleep and that of our entire population to proper protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is encapsulated in this Bill a positive step to provide the kind of security our electorate not only demands but has a right to expect, which is why I welcome it.  I see it as an opportunity for the Minister to implement some of the policies we know she favours but which she is prevented from doing by pressure from the junior partners in Cabinet.  I note that Deputy Flanagan, chairman of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, has reservations about the kinds of measures the Minister wishes <Col N="1419" /> to implement.  He says that legislative changes must not trample on the fundamental liberties of the citizen.  However, I remind him that there is no more fundamental right than the right to life, the right not to be attacked, assaulted or murdered; the right to walk the streets of the capital in broad daylight and the right to feel safe and secure in one's home at night.  These are the things that worry our citizens and if Deputy Flanagan does not realise that this is uppermost in their minds, he is out of touch with them.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill, not least those in sections 4, 5 and 6 which reach into the jurisdiction of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is long past time for the interaction of the separate elements of our justice system to be streamlined and duplication or unnecessary bureaucracy eliminated. There is more than enough paper being generated between these offices already and any measure that reduces it is welcomed. As we know, the transfer of papers and exchange of documents makes for a slower system in a part of our public administration which is far too slow already.  We should cut the red tape, eliminate duplication and make the system work swiftly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 6 will allow this House to require the Director of Public Prosecutions to come before its committees as a capable and compellable witness.  Even at the remove of several months, I consider the failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions to come before the Oireachtas as a slight on Parliament.  That he should freely go on a radio programme subsequently to answer the questions which Members were prevented from putting to him in a democratic forum is still fresh in my mind and I can conceive of no adequate explanation for what I consider a discourtesy to this House and its Members.</P>
    <P>I agree that individual cases should not be discussed in the public domain, <Col N="1420" /> but all public servants must be accountable in some public forum to the elected representatives of the people and that goes for the Director of Public Prosecutions as well.  He has a high profile office with an onerous duty and responsibility to the people.  He must be seen also to be open to scrutiny.  A Government which launched itself on a tidal wave of good intentions, not the least of which was a commitment to openness, transparency and accountability, will have no difficulty in understanding that principle or accepting that measure.</P>
    <P>I was less than happy with the reception I received when I raised a case recently with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The attitude with which my queries were greeted left much to be desired and the persons on whose behalf I inquired, less than satisfied. To be unco-operative is one thing, but to be positively unhelpful is unpardonable and I have yet to be satisfied with the quality of the service which the interested party and I received.  The young man to whom I refer was subsequently proven to be totally innocent of any wrongdoing.  He ended up brain damaged.  The perpetrator in this action got a suspended sentence and there was a suggestion that he was told before the case came to court that he would not end up in jail.  This individual and his parents must live with this life sentence for the rest of their lives.  They contacted the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but got no satisfaction. There are many who know the facts of this case and the terrible thing is that justice has not been seen to be done.</P>

      <P>It is a long standing convention of this House that public officials should not be reflected upon.  They are not Members and have no redress against accusations made in this privileged assembly.

I am <Col N="1421" /> sure the Deputy will understand my ruling in this matter.</P>

      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling but I was referring only to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In another case the family did not receive a sympathetic hearing from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and in the light of that perhaps an appeals mechanism should be put in place.  One person may decide what is right or wrong but another may take a different interpretation of it.  Something needs to be done and the Director of Public Prosecutions should be accountable to this House through the Taoiseach, who has responsibility for the office of the Attorney General, or failing that to a committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister need not be reminded that she had hardly warmed her ministerial chair before she declared publicly that she proposed to hold a referendum on the bail laws.  After 30 years or more of worsening crime levels it was hardly before time to do so but, as we know, that good idea was hit on the head, if you will pardon the phrase, and her proposal has not found merit with the Cabinet since then.  In fairness, Deputy O'Donoghue and I have said that the Minister would have introduced a referendum on bail if it had been left to her.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear the two previous speakers from the Government parties.  Deputy Ring, Fine Gael, is in favour of a referendum on bail whereas Deputy Broughan, of the Labour Party is not, which is symptomatic of what is happening in Government.  I would like the question of the bail to be put to the people, but in the absence of that I support the proposals before us, which have been drafted within the confines of the constititional position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are not willing or able to confine a person who has been charged with serious crime to a place where he can be properly monitored then I see nothing wrong with requiring him to find someone who will guarantee his behaviour <Col N="1422" /> until his trial.  Under this Bill that is what he is required to do and this can hardly be considered an unfair restriction of his movements.  The possibility of the forfeiture of bail for a serious breach of the regulations &mdash; the commission of an indictable offence &mdash; will concentrate the bailsman's mind on the possible problems ahead and cause the necessary precautions to be taken. Section 10 provides for a sliding scale of bail and the relevant amounts are realistic.  Because of the amounts specified, there is less likelihood that a person will finance his own bail, which would be a negation of the intent of the system.  Section 12 is a common-sense updating of the situation in regard to taking depositions and is very likely to streamline the system of justice in that regard.</P>
    <P>I realise that the provisions of section 16 are a major departure from the principles within which we work.  The right to silence has been a basic tenet of our justice system since the foundation of the State but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we may have to forfeit this if we are to have an effective criminal system.</P>
    <P>We have seen how known criminals have been able to frustrate the law by keeping silent for the duration of their arrest and, as defendant, declining to enter the witness box in court.  For a system of justice to survive and to command the respect of the public at large, it cannot be brought into disrepute by criminals who can use it to protect them from the consequences of their criminal activities.  I do not lightly advocate the elimination of this right, but the broader society and we as the Legislature must react to the conditions prevailing and protect our people.</P>
    <P>We have not sufficiently availed of the advances in science to assist both the administration of justice and the conviction of criminals.  For instance, we do not yet have provision for the use of tape recorders for taking depositions, a deficiency which will be rectified by section 12 if it is accepted by Government. Everyone saw the benefit of such <Col N="1423" /> basic machines decades ago yet it is only now we are approving their use.  No wonder there is a huge backlog in our courts.  I shudder to think what will happen when computers will get official sanction.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the taking of forensic samples from the person to help in identification and as a means of prosecution. This does not go far enough.  With proper safeguards the technology is now available to have murderers and rapists in custody with good evidence in a relatively short time. I will expand on this at a later stage, but time does not allow it now.  I wholeheartedly agree with the thrust of this section and would hope to see more use of readily available technology in the near future for a variety of purposes.</P>
    <P>I also endorse the provisions for minimum sentences to be applied, consecutive sentences where appropriate, and the right to have this remedy brought to the attention of the court at the time of sentencing.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that section 19 should be put into any legislation.  All it is doing is reminding everybody what is contained in section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  That section requires that consecutive sentences be given to criminals who are convicted of crimes committed while on bail.  That is not happening.  I know from reading the weekly court reports in my local newspaper &mdash; I am sure every Member has the same experience &mdash; that practically every sentence handed down is a concurrent sentence.  I cannot recall the last time I read a report where the judge handed down consecutive sentences. The Law Reform Commission recognised this difficulty and said that shortly after the introduction of the 1984 legislation there was a prevalence of cases where consecutive sentences were handed down but that is not the case now.  I wonder whether judges need a refresher course to remind them that provisions for consecutive sentences are set out in legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> There is some merit in suspended sentencing, particularly for a first time offender, in that a sentence will be hanging over them; in the event of their committing another offence the suspended sentence will be reinstated.  The suspended sentence is overused, particularly in regard to habitual offenders. We read constantly of judges giving suspended sentences in cases of known criminals.  Perhaps there is reason for that which is tied into the early release system.  I would have some reservations about the early release system.  It should only be used for good behaviour.  There must be some incentive for prisoners to be released earlier, otherwise they may as well be disruptive during their entire time in prison, but I believe the system is being abused.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with mandatory life sentencing and recommends that a minimum period be put forward by a judge. That is a sensible section.  Why do we have a life sentence when it does not mean a a life sentence?  Why is a person sent to jail for 20 years when it does not mean 20 years?  If a court was able to give a recommendation for a minimum period, at least they should serve most of their sentence.</P>
    <P>At last the onus for providing a proper and adequate prison system is being imposed on the Minister.  Had that provision existed previously she might have been able to make a better and more effective fight for funds for necessary improvements to the system.  Proper use must be made of our prison spaces and the appropriate categories housed in the appropriate prisons.  There is little point in housing low-risk prisoners in high security prisons and there is scope for the greater use of low security institutions.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, where prisoners have been convicted of assaults of a particularly violent or sexual nature then the full rigors of the law must be brought to bear.  How else can we as legislators look into the battered faces or the broken bodies of the frail and elderly and say we are doing our job?  If <Col N="1425" /> that puts me in the category of a &ldquo;lockem up and throw away the key&rdquo; man, then so be it.  I know to whom I owe a duty of care and I intend to discharge it without flinching.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in according my support to this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister is in the House to hear what is being said about this Bill, which is well thought out, simple and practical with finely targeted recommendations.  I am grateful for the support given to this Bill from all sides of the House.  I listened to the contribution of the last Labour speaker, Deputy Broughan, who was most constructive and positive in his assessment of the provisions of this Bill, as was Deputy Kenneally.  To date, the response from all sides of the House has been positive and constructive and the speakers have been very much in agreement with what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow, despite all that has been said and the approval that has been given, Government Members will vote down this Bill. That should not happen.  I appeal to the Minister this evening not to vote down this Bill on the floor of this House but rather to take the recommendations and the provisions of the Bill and to implement them in conjunction with legislation which she is proposing, much of which centres on the same areas of crime.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill she has proposed to the House this afternoon which my party and I will support without hesitation or reservation.  The business of tackling our outdated criminal justice system is of such paramount importance that party politics must not be played with that issue.  Parties must combine, take from one another the best ideals and recommendations available, incorporate them into law and have that law implemented as quickly as possible. Time is not on our side.  The position is worsening week after week, month after month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our criminal justice system is creaking at the hinges and our response to <Col N="1426" /> date has been too little too late.  When a Bill of this nature is brought before the House it is not done lightly.  This is a well framed set of legislative proposals. It would do a great deal of credit to the Government and the Minister if these proposals were taken on board and if the Bill was not voted down.  I make a final appeal to the Minister not to vote down the Bill tomorrow night. By so doing we are only drawing the anger of the public on us and generating a degree of public cynicism that does not do any of us any good.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to put in place a set of practical measures which, if adopted, would make a difference.  For example, it proposes radical new measures to streamline and speed up State prosecutions. These measures are long overdue. One of the most unsatisfactory features of our system is the amount of time that is allowed to elapse between the apprehension of a suspect and the securing of a conviction.  That delay that our system permits is corrosive of public confidence in the judicial system.  It helps to tilt the balance between the rights of the victim of crime and the rights of the perpetrator of crime in favour of the latter.  Nothing is as subversive of public confidence as the spectacle of a victim waiting for months, and sometimes years, to hear what has happened, knowing that the gardaí have apprehended somebody, have made a charge and are working towards a conviction. Very often nothing is heard. That undermines their confidence in the way justice is dispensed.  Anything that helps to speed up the process, to streamline present practices and procedures and which makes the delivery of that element of our justice system more efficient has to be implemented without delay.  That is the main section of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration and to take it on board. Our recommendations are new and, so far as I am aware, do not exist in recent legislation.  If implemented they would serve to make our system more efficient.  I do not understand the reason the Minister objects to putting these <Col N="1427" /> procedures into practice.  I appeal to her to consider taking on board these well thought out measures because the average citizen is of the view that in the majority of cases our system of justice allows the criminal to go unpunished while the victim is uncompensated. Governments have the nerve to call that a system of justice but it is not the way the average citizen views the system as it currently operates.</P>
    <P>To illustrate my point I will give a simple example from every day life in contemporary Ireland.  I call this a tale of two citizens.  Citizen A is an elderly widowed lady living on her own and citizen B is a young, able-bodied adult living elsewhere.  Citizen B forcibly enters the home of citizen A.  Citizen A is terrorised but, in the manner of her generation, she struggles to protect her property and her purse.  Citizen B punches the elderly lady, knocks her to the ground, kicks her senseless, finally locates her purse and makes off with the money leaving citizen A shell-shocked and writhing with pain on the floor. What happens after such an episode?  If citizen A is lucky, an ambulance arrives to take her to hospital.  That old lady is expected to pay a £40 call out fee.  When she arrives at the hospital she is expected to pay for all the treatment necessitated by the injuries inflicted on her by citizen B.  She has to carry the cost of damage done to her person, her property and her purse.</P>
    <P>What happens to the intruder in such circumstances?  In far too many cases the State hears no more of him but if citizen B is apprehended and brought before the courts, he applies for and is given free legal aid.  The State must incur the cost of any transaction that ensues.  That is the imbalance I seek to illustrate.  The victim endures all the pain, incurs all the costs and, in the majority of cases, does not receive any compensation while the perpetrator has access to free legal aid and becomes a guest of the nation for a period.  That happens on a daily basis in every village, town and city of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> In this year's budget there was an increase in the allocation to the free legal aid scheme.  I welcome the increase in the allocation with regard to civil cases but I am greatly concerned about the extent of free legal aid being made available to the type of gentlemen whose activities I have described.  If our citizens were asked a question by way of referendum as to how they would like to see their money being spent, I know the answer they would give.</P>
    <P>The Minister must seriously examine the compensation scheme currently in operation because if we are to reclaim some degree of public respect for the criminal justice system, we must strike a fairer balance between the rights of the victim and that of the criminal.</P>
    <P>My party was accused recently of calling for more gardaí, and certain people sought to highlight a contradiction between that call and our desire to to keep the public service bill in order.  We are not calling for more gardaí <i>per se</i> but additional gardaí on our streets and on citizen protection and crime prevention duties.  In that regard I wish to draw a particular court practice to the Minister's attention in the hope that she will tackle the problem.  Every day in our courts one can see lines of gardaí waiting to be called to give evidence, many of whom spend the entire day there without their cases being called.  I regard that as criminal waste of Garda time. Other countries with systems similar to our own do not have that type of court procedure.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter with a view to adopting the practice followed in the London metropolitan area whereby a special court officer assembles all the evidence and presents the cases in court on behalf of his colleagues.  If that practice were followed here, more gardaí would be available to protect our citizens and prevent crime.  Once a crime is committed, the cost to the State is enormous.</P>
    <P>The issue of bail, which is a great scandal, is intelligently addressed in the Bill although we fall short of calling for a constitutional referendum.  We are seeking to put in place a system <Col N="1429" /> whereby it would be much more difficult for a criminal to get bail.  If somebody is foolish enough to put up bail on behalf of a habitual criminal, they deserve to forfeit that money.  I appeal to the Minister to accept our recommendations in regard to bail while encouraging her to follow her instincts and frame a referendum to deal with the issue of bail in its totality.</P>
    <P>Before the question of holding a referendum can be considered, the Minister will have to provide a greatly increased number of prison spaces.  This country needs a remand prison and, if we are serious about our criminal justice system, we must find the ways and means of putting such a prison in place. Why can the private sector not be requested to build a remand prison which could then be leased back to the State?  That could be done without excessive capital cost.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to vote down this Bill tomorrow evening.  She will earn the respect of this House and of our citizens if she takes on board the measures proposed in the Bill and incorporates them in her proposed legislation. The Minister still has time to do that.</P>

    <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for her work in preparing this substantial Bill. It is welcome because it has instigated a long overdue debate.  Interest in this issue became slack.  Expectations were raised that the bail issue would be dealt with in last November's referendum but when that did not happen, people wondered what the Government was planning and when its plans might come to fruition.  We still have not heard these <Col N="1430" /> plans but the Minister has talked about devising proposals to reform the bail laws.  I urge her to do a little more than that because there is a great deal of frustration about bail particularly among members of the Garda and the general public.</P>
    <P>I do not have a legal background. However, like every TD, I come up against the injustices of the system and encounter crime, which is pervading every area of life.  I know many members of the Garda Síochána.  Before the foundation of this State, some of my family were members of the RIC and were stationed in Gurteen in County Tyrone and Santry in north Dublin. Some of them had to work with the occupational hazard of having the rank of sergeant and the surname &ldquo;Sargent&rdquo;. It was one of the more humorous sides of the job.</P>
    <P>I have several problems with the Progressive Democrats case.  The crusade to privatise can sometimes be like a runaway train and there is a risk in this case that it may be a short-term solution to what is ultimately a serious social problem. I am not happy to go along with that proposal.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Government's line is more worrying.  It said this Bill pre-empts proposals and is like a curate's egg.  It is the usual response to something with which it does not yet want to deal.  Its bail proposals sound vague, especially in light of statements made in the past.  To that end, I sympathise with the frustration expressed by the Progressive Democrats; it is well founded.</P>
    <P>A report on the examination of the bail laws by the Law Reform Commission was made public in September last year.  It was to be a watershed in helping us to come to terms with the shortcomings of our bail laws.  However, its assessment resulted in as much controversy as did its proposed solutions. The Minister for Justice at the time, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said that, with Government approval, she had requested the then Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, to secure the <Col N="1431" /> advice of the Law Reform Commission on the options that might be open to change the bail laws.  Expectations were raised that we would at least have the framework of legislation or proposals for constitutional change in this area. However, they were seriously dashed when we saw the report.  It examined the current state of play in various parts of the world.  While this may be interesting and gives a good background knowledge, it was not directed to our problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to avoid getting into a quandry by drawing our attention to the referendum.  Hopes were raised that this would be a way of dealing with the problem but they were dashed as well.  We are dealing with a long litany of PR tactics which has left the public and the Garda Síochána reeling with frustration at the lack of commitment from the Government in this area, although it may deny this once it publishes its proposals.</P>
    <P>There is a detected rate of 4,000 crimes committed by persons while on bail &mdash; the Garda would say the figure is even higher than that.  That being the case, one wonders why the Government has been unable to find the resources and the will to publish proposals, which has resulted in the Progressive Democrats having to use its Private Members' time to get some action in this area. There will be no comfort for people listening to this debate until the Minister sets a date and shows her proposals; I would number myself among those people.</P>
    <P>The one consolation is that the Minister said she will examine all the suggestions that come forward in the light of jurisprudence under the European Convention of Human Rights.  While that is great and I would expect no less, I do not see why this should cause a delay.  I hope the Minister will, in the course of this debate, give us a date when these proposals will be published.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to various other measures in her speech, which is generally a good tactic to draw fire away from <Col N="1432" /> the issue primarily being addressed.  The criminal justice plans were referred to and while they are welcome in so far as they go, the Minister does not seem to be able to make any progress on the bail issue.</P>
    <P>The more measures that are announced and the longer it takes before the bail issue is dealt with, the greater the frustration and demoralisation that will be experienced by the Garda Síochána.  This, in turn, leads to infighting between all the various interests with the result that the root causes of the problem are not addressed.  The symptoms can be seen in my own constituency of Dublin North which the Minister knows well.  In this connection I welcome the recent assignment of four extra gardaí to Balbriggan where they were badly needed.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned previously to the Minister, but it is worth repeating &mdash; this issue is wider than that addressed by the Bill, although still relevant &mdash; that the question of adequate resources for crime prevention measures to dissuade young people in particular from entering a life of crime has not been addressed.  Under the new crime package no community gardaí will be assigned to the area mentioned where the one hard-pressed juvenile liaison officer is also forced to act as a community garda.  Despite this, more and more young people are finding themselves in trouble.  The Minister does not have to go very far in her own constituency to see the results in the burgeoning reformatory schools at Oberstown and Trinity House.  This shows how little is being done to prevent crime.</P>
    <P>We have been forced, out of desperation, to address the symptoms, but until we understand the links between cause and effect, which my party has emphasised time and again through the philosophy of ecology, we will continue to miss the boat.  I hope that when the Minister finally presents her proposals in this area she will not take her eye off the ball in addressing the wider question of why crime is perceived as rampant to so many people, particularly those in <Col N="1433" /> business whose premises have been damaged and private property owners who are unable to cope with the onslaught from criminals who are not thwarted by the current legal provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy O'Donnell and her party for the work they put into the preparation of this Bill. While I disagree with many of her proposals there are others which I hope will eventually find their way on to the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>In recent months one could not open a newspaper or turn on a television set without learning of a further terrible atrocity.  Some citizens are under siege. This sense of threat is heightened by irresponsible media coverage.  In recent months there have been acres of newsprint dealing with crime related matters. This has added little or nothing to our factual information base.  Some evening newspapers have carried the same story on the front page on three consecutive nights with a different headline.  This does not help us to understand crime in society.</P>
      <P>There has been a steady increase in crime in recent years.  This soon becomes clear to anyone who cares to glance at the published Garda reports. The current debate, however, is being conducted in a statistical vacuum.  While we are all aware of the types of crime committed, we know relatively little about the people who commit crime, including how many are repeat offenders, the length of sentence they receive, the length of time they serve before being released and the path they take when released from custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may be interested to learn of some of the issues on which I have been unable to obtain information because of &ldquo;the absence of reliable statistics&rdquo;.  One year ago I learned that information on the moneys confiscated from bailsmen was only available for the Dublin District and Circuit Courts.  Last February I learned that recidivism rates among young offenders, except for those at St. Patrick's Institution were, <Col N="1434" /> sadly, &ldquo;not readily available&rdquo;.  Last autumn I was told that statistics on the length of time served by prisoners were not available because &ldquo;current methods of record keeping would not facilitate the ready compilation of statistics on the length of time served by individual prisoners&rdquo;. Last December I was told that &ldquo;records are not maintained in such a manner as to indicate the number of offenders convicted of crimes while on temporary release&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Any Member who has ever asked a question to try to elicit this information is aware that there is a lack of reliable criminological statistics.  This is not the fault of the Minister who has to rely on the resources available to her, but there is a need for more statistical information. This is one of the first areas we have to address to gain a clearer understanding of the crime problem.</P>
    <P>There is also an urgent need to establish a criminological statistics unit under the auspices of either the Garda Research Bureau or the Central Statistics Office.  Until we start to gather reliable data legislative proposals will continue to be little more than shots in the dark.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell has proposed the establishment of a unified prosecution agency under this Bill.  I understand that any developments in this regard would have to await the outcome of the Strategic Management Initiative process in the Office of the Attorney General&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the review of the Department of Finance of the structure of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I hope the outcome of these reviews will lead to greater efficiency and transparency within the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amidst the recent clamour for change, commentators inside and outside the House have forgotten about the rate of existing provisions which either have to be strengthened or, better still, implemented.  I welcome the suggestion <Col N="1435" /> by Deputy O'Donnell that the provisions of section 11 of the 1984 Criminal Justice Act which provides for consecutive sentences should be strengthened.  I also welcome some of Deputy O'Donnell's suggestions regarding the estreatment of bail although, notwithstanding the assurances in the explanatory memorandum, attaching a good behaviour clause to it may prove unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Having praised those elements of the Bill I have reservations about Deputy O'Donnell's proposed changes in criminal procedure.  In particular, her proposal to grant either the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General the right to direct that a person be sent for trial without preliminary examination would require extremely careful consideration.  While I accept this would speed up trials and relieve the logjam of people having to wait 18 months or more to have their cases heard, this proposal is akin to fast food justice, could lead to abuses and prejudice an accused person's right to a fair trial.  I would have reservations about moves to limit the right of the defence to call witnesses during the course of preliminary examinations.  There is no doubt that much of our criminal procedure needs to be streamlined and brought into the 20th century.  In this regard I welcome Deputy O'Donnell's proposal to provide for forensic examination of persons remanded in custody. This matter should be examined in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Fundamental changes to our justice system, such as those proposed in sections 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, should not be considered unless there is strong evidence that they will secure conviction of the guilty while preserving the rights of the innocent.  Nothing I have heard during this debate has convinced me that the proposed changes and the suggested manner of their implementation would satisfy those criteria.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government is united on the need to address the problem of offences committed by persons <Col N="1436" /> on bail and Democratic Left shares the concerns of Deputies on all sides in that regard.  In the absence of reliable statistics we are debating this matter in a factual vacuum.  Approximately 9 per cent of offences are committed by persons on bail, the majority of which fall into the category of larceny, for example, pick-pocketing, mugging, robbery and armed robbery.  According to the most recent figures, approximately 1 per cent of assaults are committed by persons on bail.  We must, therefore, target measures at particular categories of people rather than adopt a scatter-gun approach to this complex problem.  A blanket restriction on the availability of bail, when combined with the lengthy waiting period before cases are brought to trial, would result in large numbers of people spending long periods in custody pending trial and give rise to major logistical problems.  Separate detention facilities may be required if we are to comply with European prison regulations and I do not know how this could be done given the current shortage of prison accommodation for convicted prisoners.</P>
    <P>International statistics indicate that approximately one half of those remanded in custody pending trial are either acquitted or do not receive a custodial sentence.  Many of the remainder receive custodial sentences substantially less than the periods they have already served in detention.  This is particularly noticeable in continental jurisdictions where preventative detention or examination in custody is the norm rather than the exception.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell's proposals to strengthen the provisions on estreatment of bail may be part of the solution but this would have to be examined further to ensure persons or their bailsmen are not disproportionately penalised for what may be relatively minor second offences.  It may be worth examining the possibility of creating a new category of offence &mdash; a criminal offence committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> I support Deputy O'Donnell's proposals on the management of prisons. The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> is an excellent document and should be read by members of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also believe members of the Government should read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Opposition. It proposes the establishment of a parole board to ensure prisoners are released on a structured rather than an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and a prisons board to take over the independent day to day management of our prisons.  The latter suggestion is designed to implement one of the central recommendations of the Whitaker report and would restore public confidence in our prisons system.</P>
      <P>While agreeing with the general thrust of Deputy O'Donnell's proposals on prisons and parole, I have grave reservations about her suggestion in section 33 that a public register should be maintained of persons on temporary release.  In many cases the publication of such information could prejudice, for example, the safety of the individual concerned and his or her family.  Notwithstanding the safeguard in subsection (4), this proposal runs counter to the public good.</P>
      <P>The Minister described the Bill as a curate's egg.  The bad parts, unfortunately, reflect the general climate of panic and intimidation but seek short-term solutions to long-term complex problems.  The good parts, however, should be retained for further examination and possible incorporation in forthcoming legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the last two Deputies for their thoughtful contributions to this debate.  I noted that in dealing with the bail issue Deputy Byrne studiously avoided the question of holding a referendum.  In his proposals to improve the law on bail it is glaringly obvious Democratic Left does <Col N="1438" /> not support the holding of a referendum. It is interesting to reflect on Deputy O'Donoghue's speech on this Bill last week and the remarks attributed to the Tánaiste in <i>The Kerryman</i> on 2 February 1996.  It is obvious that despite the shouting, roaring, rí-rá, ruaile buaile and the histrionics engaged in by the Minister to the effect that the Government parties are not divided on this issue and that newspaper reports written by responsible journalists were fabrications in so far as they quoted Labour Party Ministers as saying a legislative response was preferable to a referendum, the reality is there is not tripartite support for a referendum on bail.  I understand how people could honourably oppose the holding of such a referendum, but either the bail law is perfect as it is or it needs to be changed.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court's decision in the O'Callaghan case was unwise.  In effect, it guarantees that any person arrested and accused of a serious offence will be set at liberty pending his trial unless, as a matter of probability, there is evidence to suggest that he will either not turn up or that he will interfere with the proper conduct of the trial by interfering with the evidence of witnesses and the like.  That guarantee is not available in any other common law country. Ireland is the only country in which the right to trial in due course of law and the constitutional right to liberty of the individual have been interpreted as giving an absolute guarantee to an accused person of his right to liberty unless, as a matter of probability, he fails one of two tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court in 1966 might have felt impelled by some liberal policy to go a little further than the law had ever gone before.  There is a neat logic to the O'Callaghan case but that type of logic is detached from reality.  When one is in a world where people are committing successive crimes as a way of life, where there is a low detection rate and where a general attitude prevails among a certain cohort of people of a particular age group from which crime emanates <Col N="1439" /> that prison is not a deterrent, a liberal bail law is mistaken.</P>
    <P>I have argued before and I still believe that it would be an absurdity to address the issue of bail without addressing the prison service.  One would end up emptying the prisons of those who have been convicted and replacing them with those who might or might not be convicted pending trial.  As Deputy Byrne pointed out, in the present context of lengthy delays in criminal trials if would be equally absurd to imprison many people for a long period of time when, in the last analysis, they might be acquitted. Nobody can restore, in any real way, civil liberties to an individual who has been wrongly deprived of his liberty pending trial.  I hope we will not create a situation in which we will have to start handing over compensation to those who have been wrongly deprived of their liberty.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides, without any assault on the presumption of innocence or a question of there being preventive detention, that a person who goes bail for somebody else &mdash; thereby guaranteeing that he or she will turn up for the trial and will not interfere with witnesses &mdash; and who stands to forfeit the bail money if the accused breaches the two basic O'Callaghan conditions should, in certain circumstances on the application of the prosecutor, also be made to stand surety for the good behaviour of the accused person while awaiting trial.  The sense of that provision is simple.  Heroin addicts who support their habit by daily break-ins and muggings might find it very difficult to avail of the fiction of the presumption of innocence when they cannot persuade anybody close to them to even guarantee for a sum of money that the person will not commit a further offence while awaiting trial.  People in such circumstances suffer no intrusion on their constitutional rights if they cannot convince anybody close to them or on whom they would normally rely in such <Col N="1440" /> circumstances to be bailsman and to act as guarantor for their good behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is relevant that in Scotland the law already has that effect.  It can be made a condition of granting bail in Scotland that one will not commit a further offence while on bail.  That provision is not widely used because there is a discretion to refuse bail on wider grounds, such as existed here before the O'Callaghan case.  Nonetheless, there is a precedent in a neighbouring jurisdiction for the refusal of granting bail in cases where somebody is likely to commit a further offence through the mechanism of making the surety liable to forfeit the bail if the accused abuses his bail to commit further offences.</P>
    <P>Bail is being abused at present and we must face up to that fact.  If this proposal is not the right one, a referendum is the only way to get around the problem. This proposal in any event does not prejudice whether there should or should not be a referendum.  This Bill should be part of the law even if the Constitution is amended by the people to restrict the absolute right to bail.  In cases where one knows in one's heart that people will avail of their liberty to reoffend, it is perfectly sensible to provide for a disincentive to their being granted bail.  The most sensible way within our grasp at present is to create a situation where bailsmen should stand sureties for the good behaviour of the accused during the period of bail.</P>
    <P>The present bail law is a joke.  In the Dublin Circuit Court, as pointed out earlier today, one estreatment has taken place in circumstances where there have been hundreds of bench warrants issued for people who have broken their bail. The reason is that bail is fixed in sums which are so small that to have a court hearing as to whether I or somebody else, who has gone bail for an accused, should forfeit £200 is simply not worth the bother.  That calls into question the amounts of money on which people can secure bail and the amounts of security offered.  If hundreds of people abscond and do not face trial in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and in one year <Col N="1441" /> only one estreatment application is made, it is clear that the criminal has contempt for the disincentive of losing bail money.  The prosecuting authorities, likewise, have no faith in the deterrent of forfeiture of bail as a real element in ensuring that people turn up for their trials.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with some of the points raised by the Minister in reply to Deputy O'Donnell.  She said the provisions in the Bill allowing the Minister for Justice to make regulations for the general governance of the prison service and, in particular, section 30 which allowed the Minister to amend, adapt or repeal the antiquated system of prison legislation were, to use the Minister's phrase, &ldquo;manifestly unconstitutional&rdquo;.  If it is manifestly unconstitutional, I advise the Minister's advisers to search carefully through the Statute Book where they will find many instances of the same thing being done in statutes proposed by the State.  There are many precedents for detailed old-fashioned legislation being supplanted by a modern regulatory regime, which allows the Minister of the day to make amendments to Acts of the Oireachtas in respect of hospitals and other matters, which are perfectly constitutional. Another matter one must bear in mind is that there is a presumption of constitutionality and any provisions such as section 30 of this Bill would be interpreted as permitting a limited power of amendment for the purpose of facilitating the regulatory power conferred by earlier sections on the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by people who say we should be slow to change our law of criminal procedure.  I have experience of criminal procedure; I have prosecuted and defended cases in our criminal courts for about 20 years.  The cases were both simple and serious.  There are some aspects of our system of criminal law which are offensive to reason.  One of them is that prosecuting counsel, when somebody comes into court and says for the first time that he has an explanation for the incriminating facts on which the prosecution relies, is not <Col N="1442" /> entitled to say: &ldquo;Mr. McDowell, if that is your defence, why did you not mention it when you were arrested; why did you not mention it when you went to the District Court; why did not save yourself the bother of being tried on indictment for a very serious offence and risk your liberty if a simple explanation was available to you which you could have given to the police?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the law stands, one cannot ask that question or say to the jury at the end of a case: &ldquo;If the story given by way of explanation by the accused is true, ladies and gentlemen, why was it furnished in the court for the first time?  What do you think of his decision to hold his cards close to his chest until the day of his trial and to go through this procedure without once mentioning that he has a perfectly good defence to all this case?&rdquo;  If one cannot ask simple and obvious questions, which go through everyone's mind in a trial, of a jury when closing a speech for the prosecution or for the accused then there is something unreal about the system.  I strongly believe our law must be changed so that it conforms with common sense.  In a jury trial which is in accordance with the laws of evidence 12 people are asked to apply their common sense to the facts.  However, one then says that they must engage in what must be for some of them fantastic mental gymnastics not to ask obvious questions about the case tendered by the accused and not to permit the counsel employed by the State to pursue obvious lines of inquiry in terms of cross-examination.</P>
    <P>We have already breached that rule in the law relating to alibi.  One cannot call alibi evidence &mdash; that is, evidence to the effect that one was not at the scene of the crime but was somewhere else &mdash; unless the State is given notice of it.  The reason for this is that the State must be given a reasonable chance to challenge this exculpatory evidence and to investigate its veracity.  One cannot simply ambush the State with evidence on the day of a trial.  If this is fair in the context of whether one was geographically at <Col N="1443" /> the scene of a crime or somewhere else as in alibi cases, then other explanations which can be dragged out of a hat as a surprise at a trial or brought up at the fifty-ninth second of the fifty-ninth minute of the eleventh hour in the criminal process must similarly be subject to the common sense rule that at least some adverse inferences can be drawn from that very simple fact.  One of the sections which deals with this issue was not drawn from imagination or thin air but was included in a Bill tendered to the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Department of Justice in 1984, that is the capacity to draw an inference from the failure to mention certain facts.  However, it was withdrawn at the time as a concession to civil liberties.  I am not against the making of concessions to civil liberties but this was an unwarranted concession and the law would be better if it were changed.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is an affront to common sense to say that an accused person need not open his mouth during the three weeks of a trial and at the end of the case to allow his counsel to attack the State's case while at no time is the accused liable to be called to give evidence nor can the jury lawfully draw any inference from his failure to participate in a trial.  Under the 1924 Act no comment can be made about whether the accused did or did not give evidence. It is absurd that a judge, providing he complies with the presumption of innocence, can comment critically on this and point out to a jury that an accused person has not given evidence while the prosecution may not do so, may not ask any questions on the subject and may not say to the jury &ldquo;If there was an innocent explanation to all of this one would think that you would have heard of it, ladies and gentlemen of the jury&rdquo;. Those antiquated laws belong to a bygone age and should not have any part in our modern jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing which tends <Col N="1444" /> to tip the scales against fairness in prosecution. The people who are the prosecutors in most cases tried on indictment are as entitled to justice as an accused person.  The time has come to reform our laws of criminal procedure to make them fair to the prosecution as well.  One is not threatening civil liberties in any way if one introduces a law which accords with common sense and with ordinary people's sense of fair play and justice.  I am not suggesting that Deputy O'Donnell would have been wise to include a section which provided that the previous convictions of an accused person should be capable of being dragged up against them in prosecutions, although many people think it is farcicial that a person with a record as long as his arm can pose as entirely innocent.  However, it is a valuable safeguard as a jury would tend to believe that a person with five convictions must be guilty of the sixth offence.  The proposals put forward by Deputy O'Donnell are reasonable and measured and are based on proposals in neighbouring jurisdictions.  Some of these provisions are in operation in Northern Ireland and England and it is about time we began to address keeping the scales of justice fairly balanced between the prosecution and the defence.  The Bill is not a tabloid approach to criminal law. Rather it seeks to make fairness operate where unfairness is perceived to operate at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said some provisions could be incorporated in Government legislation to modernise the criminal law.  The Minister said she would introduce a criminal law Bill which would abolish the difference between felonies and misdemeanours, create a new form of arrestable offence, abolish the difference between penal servitude and imprisonment and do many other things in regard to the criminal law.  That Bill was introduced in the House 30 years ago.  I do not know how long it had been drafted before it was introduced but <Col N="1445" /> given the way things are done it was probably drafted five years previously. That Bill has sat on somebody's shelf for more than 30 years and there is no excuse for having left the criminal law in the state of intellectual slum into which it has fallen.  I am shocked that it has taken 30 years to introduce legislation which would amend totally antiquated and insupportable legal distinctions and fictions.  Why has the criminal law been left so badly unreformed? From time to time <i>ad hoc</i> measures are proposed but the entire process of modernising the criminal law seems to be unfashionable in the Department whose duty it is to keep it up to date.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to deal with the prisons issue.  The time has come to impose a statutory duty on the Minister for Justice to provide sufficient prison spaces to cater for those who are sentenced by the courts.  The excuse offered by the Minister that the statutory duty to provide adequate space somehow ignores the right to give early release as an incentive to good behaviour is totally threadbare.  The Bill merely provides that if the State is required by the courts to imprison people for a certain time and if, with good policy, there is a certain prison population, then there must be an adequate prison structure to accommodate those people.  That is reasonable.  The proposal to have an inspector of prisons is worthwhile as is the proposal to remove the Prison Service from the control of the Department of Justice.  Although the Minister's response to Deputy O'Donnell's speech seems to suggest no final decision has been made on whether an executive office or agency should run the service rather than the Department of Justice, it is noteworthy that the Department was the preferred option in the five year plan for the management of the Prison Service published two years ago.  I do not see any contradiction between ministerial accountability and making something into an agency of the Department. <Col N="1446" /> It is possible to do both as the policy document of the Progressive Democrats points out.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Home Secretary is politically responsible for prisons and the Director of Prisons Service is responsible for their day to day operation. There may well be unfortunate clashes between the two as to who is responsible for deficiencies in the service but it is far better for the public to know there are deficiencies than to have a Department that pretends there is nothing wrong and refuses to release any relevant statistics about the service it runs.</P>
    <P>I do not like to criticise public servants for the state of our laws or the functions assigned to their Departments. However, there is something strange about a culture in which successive Ministers for Justice, nominally responsible for what happens in that Department, publish prison reports which are years out of date.  That is wrong.  If there is a duty to report on prisons annually, why is the report not published the following March?  Why is it that the latest set of prison reports available is for 1993?  The only reason is sheer laziness and inefficiency and a sense that it does not really matter when one reports as long the provisions of the statute are complied with at some stage.</P>
    <P>If we were told the truth about temporary release and the rate at which the prison door revolves, there would be a public outcry.  When asked about the matter it suited successive Ministers for Justice to say that it would cost too much and take up an inordinate amount of time to give a fair picture of what is happening in the Prison Service.  Anybody involved in the process knows that people are granted temporary release. In practice there is a huge remission of sentences.  On average, the granting of temporary release in respect of most non-politically high profile crimes, such as rape, ensures that offenders spend roughly 30 per cent of their allotted <Col N="1447" /> time in prison.  That is just as much a scandal as the process of remissions granted by the Department of Justice at one stage; it is a parallel system of justice. Sentences are reduced not by reference to whether the needs of society are satisfied by the punishment of the individual offender but solely by reference to the arbitrary issue of whether another person needs the cell.</P>
    <P>The Prison Service is badly managed. We have the highest ratio of prison officers to prisoners.  State expenditure on prisons increased by 50 per cent in the last five years but it received little in return.  There are more employees in the system than prisoners.  In New Zealand there are half as many officers but twice as many prisoners.  Ministers for Justice will be uncomfortable if called upon to answer why we allow our prison system to remain in this state.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced by Deputy O'Donnell with a view to tackling the real issues which confront the Garda and the State in the fight against crime. From changing the law on depositions, bail and the way in which our Prison Service is run to changing criminal procedure, this Bill was designed to put together a series of answers to practical difficulties which face the State in prosecuting the war against the crime.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the Minister has brought in a very worthy Bill against drug abuse and trafficking.  I support the thrust of her Bill but can people spend three or four days in detention staring at a point on the wall without having to account for the fact that they remain silent?  Can those who spend a week in custody come to court and explain, for the first time, why they were caught with this or that substance in their possession without any inference being drawn?  Can they insist on every State witness giving evidence orally in the District Court which must be taken down in handwriting by the District Court clerk and given to them for their signature?  Are <Col N="1448" /> drug addicts and drug barons to be given bail with freedom to reoffend? Will they be granted temporary release without public knowledge?  Will they be held in an inadequate Prison Service without serving the full sentence allotted to them by the court?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to bring in a high profile anti-drug trafficking Bill, the terms of which I support, but what about the right to silence, the fact that drug barons will not give evidence at their trial, that there will not be sufficient prison space for them or that, due to antiquated criminal procedures, it will take a year to get them to trial? When will anyone face up to those issues which are far more practical in the fight against drug trafficking than many of the issues for which the Minister has such high hopes in her Bill?  If we do not face the practical difficulties and the problems in our system of criminal justice, what chance is there that such legislation will have a serious impact on the drugs issue?  A Government which tenders legislation such as the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1966, and says it will not have any of this will find out it is long on rhetoric and short on positive results.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with other Deputies.  Deputy O'Donnell is to be commended for the work she has put into this Bill and neither the Minister nor I have any problem with that.  The Minister for Justice has already told the House that the Government must oppose the Second Stage of the Bill, and the Deputy is aware of our intention in that respect.  It is simply unrealistic to suggest that the major issues which the Bill purports to address can be dealt with in a piecemeal way in the kind of Bill before the House this evening.  It has been amply illustrated in a number of speeches just how piecemeal the Bill is.  The best way forward is to proceed as quickly as possible <Col N="1449" /> with the Government's own major programme of criminal law reform.</P>
      <P>Despite what has been said on a number of occasions, the Government has a major programme of criminal law reform.  The House will be aware that that includes a commitment to introduce a Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill. There has been a commitment from Governments for a very long time to introduce such a Bill.  Members will be aware that such a Bill will be a replacement of a 1908 statute of the Westminister Parliament that was put on the Statute Book.  Even before Lloyd George became Prime Minister, when he was in the lowly position of Chancellor of the Exchequer bringing in an old age pension of five shillings a week, the Children Bill was introduced.  Indeed, when it was introduced in 1908 Sinn Féin, if my memory serves me right, had been in existence for three years, founded by Arthur Griffith on the basis of a dual monarchy similar to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  That is a good indication of how times have changed since the introduction of the Children Bill of 1908 and the Bill I hope to introduce shortly. There have been major changes in relation to political, social and economic conditions.  In many respects the Bill was not bad for its time.  It was quite forward looking in some respects.  It still retained flogging, of course.  There might be some in this House &mdash; Deputy McGahon is not here &mdash; who would think that flogging should remain on the Statute Book but I and the majority of people in this House would not be of that opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many promises to bring forward a Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill and I am pleased to tell the House that substantial progress has been made with its drafting.  The heads of the Bill have been approved by Government and I hope to have it published before the summer recess. Despite many promises in the past that it would soon be in the Statute Book, <Col N="1450" /> this Bill was held up by what I would describe as disagreements on core issues between certain Departments.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that my appointment as a Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordination in the Departments of Health, Education and Justice has been a major factor in overcoming the disagreements in relation to those core issues.  I will not go too far because one cannot, but such issues as who would have responsibility for outof-control children, the age of criminal responsibility, etc., had to be dealt with. There were a number of other issues but Members will have to await the publication of the Bill to find out about them.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a substantial measure representing the most significant reform of our law in this area since the foundation of the State.  It will attempt to keep as many of our young people as possible out of the custodial system.  I have been determined on that because I am aware that, if we can cope with the problems of young people in relation to criminal activity in their early years, it will very much reduce the demands on our system, particularly our prison system, at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In that respect also I have proposals, wearing my other hat in the Department of Education, to introduce a truancy Bill.  Some estimation of the necessity for that can be gained from the fact that our present school attendance Bill dates from 1926 &mdash; not before the creation of the State as in the case of the juvenile justice Bill, but not that long after it came into existence.  Where there is a direct connection between the nonattendance of children at school and their getting into trouble, this Bill will be aimed at keeping them out of the custodial system.</P>
    <P>The desirability of reforms to our bail laws has been discussed here frequently. Given the time available to me this evening, all I propose to do is welcome the Minister's assurance that the <Col N="1451" /> Government will announce its own proposals on this matter in the near future. I have no doubt that those proposals will be comprehensive and effective, which is not something that could be said about the proposals in Part II of the Bill under discussion.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental area of our law which the Bill seeks to address is the right to silence.  I propose to concentrate on this issue in the rest of my contribution. Under our criminal law the general rule is that a person is not required to answer any questions in connection with an offence of which he or she is suspected.  This is in line with the general constitutional protection against self-incrimination.  There have been some statutory exceptions to this rule, the most recent having been included in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Sections 18 and 19 of that Act allow a court or a jury to draw inferences from an accused person's failure or refusal in the course of Garda questioning to account for certain matters, for example, marks on his or her person or clothing or presence in the vicinity of a crime.  These inferences cannot be drawn unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of failing or refusing to provide the relevant information may be. Although such inferences can be treated as amounting to corroboration of other evidence, the Act provides that they cannot be used to convict the accused without further evidence.</P>
    <P>The Bill leading to the 1984 Act originally contained a wider provision to the effect that inferences could be drawn from the failure of an accused person to mention any fact during Garda questioning which he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention and which is relied on in his or her defence at trial.  This proposal was dropped in the light of opposition to it from both within and outside the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are strongly conflicting viewpoints about this issue.  On the one hand <Col N="1452" /> it is argued that the right to silence is an old and very important protection of a suspect's rights and that further erosions in this area could lead to the conviction of innocent people.  On the other hand, it is argued that many of the factors which may have rendered this a fundamental protection in times gone by no longer apply.  For example, there is now ready access to criminal legal aid and it can be argued that, given the nature of the crime problems which society now has to face, the balance needs to be tilted in an effort to protect the public and that such a move in relation to the right to silence would be proportionate to the threat which needs to be addressed.  It is a matter of judgment how useful such a change is likely to prove in practice in relation to the prevention and detection of crime.  It is unlikely that it would prove practical to introduce a proposal that inferences from silence generally could be drawn without including the type of safeguards included in the limited provisions contained in the 1984 Act, that is, that the suspect would be warned in advance of the consequences and that inferences alone would be insufficient to warrant a conviction.  In these circumstances, that is, dealing with professional criminals who choose to stare at a spot on the wall and to say nothing to the Garda during an interview, a new provision allowing inferences to be drawn would not be of any direct assistance in securing a conviction which, if the Garda had no other evidence linking that suspect, would be a crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation at University College Hospital Galway is critical for patients and the nurses and doctors who work there.  It is critical for each <Col N="1453" /> member of the community of 355,800 who live in the area served by this hospital and for the 30,000 tourists who swell the local population throughout the year.</P>
      <P>This hospital was built in the mid-1950s and despite the huge increase in population in the region since, no major improvements or additions have been undertaken.  Some interim measures were undertaken and others are planned, but the major development plan submitted to the Department of Health in July 1982 has never been approved by any Minister for Health since.</P>
      <P>To illustrate the enormity of the problem at University College Hospital Galway, I wish to give some relevant facts to the House.  In 1971 there were 16,900 in-patients, which increased to 27,138 in 1994.  Clinic attendances in 1971 totalled 32,000 which increased to 75,500 in 1994.  Accident and emergency attendances in 1971 totalled 24,500, which increased to 45,000 in 1994.  It must also be acknowledged that the western region served by this hospital has the highest dependency ratio in the country. Some 28 per cent of the population is under 14 years of age, 14 per cent is over 65 years and 45.29 per cent of the population are medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital authorities have listed their problems to the Department under the headings overcrowding and underfunding.  Over the past few months the situation has become even more acute with patients on trolleys for long hours each night.  On one occasion since Christmas a patient was 26 hours in the accident and emergency department awaiting admission and up to 26 trolleys had been occupied overnight filling all the physical space, clogging up the corridors and the surrounding area. Congestion has been so bad that doctors have difficulty making their way through the many trolleys to examine and attend to their patients.  The pain and suffering of patients has been most <Col N="1454" /> distressing with the added embarrasment of being left for hours without normal privacy and restful care.</P>
    <P>The neglect of University College Hospital Galway by successive Ministers is a scandal.  It is so bad that junior hospital doctors have taken industrial action by withdrawing their services, except in cases which are determined to be acute.  They are now refusing to work because of their concern about practices in the accident and emergency section, particularly at night.  Their principal concern is that there is no casualty officer on duty between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m.  This workload falls on the surgical senior house officer who must cover wards, acute emergency admissions, theatre operations and the casualty department between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m. The junior house doctors believe this is an inherently dangerous practice as during these hours, when the surgical senior house officer is scrubbed in theatre operating and, therefore, unavailable, there is effectively no casualty officer available in an emergency.  This dangerous window in cover occurs frequently in this busy hospital.  They believe it is only a matter of time before an untoward and potentially fatal event occurs.</P>
    <P>The Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board recommends a rate of one doctor per 6,000 patients in an accident and emergency department.  The ratio at University College Hospital Galway is one per 12,200.  It is clear that the accident and emergency department is critically understaffed and this is further illustrated when one makes comparisons with other hospitals.  Staffing levels should reflect the requirement of an accident and emergency department providing 24-hour care, as recommended by the Faculty of Accident and Emergency Medicine, the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board, the Royal College of Surgeons and practices in hospitals caring for similar patient throughput.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> The minimum level of cover recommended by the FAEM for non-consultant hospital doctors in an accident and emergency department is one per 5,000 new patients per year.  In Galway 41,000 new patients are seen.  The PGMDB recommends one non-consultant hospital doctor per 6,000 patients seen in an accident and emergency department. The total number of patients seen in the accident and emergency department in Galway was 49,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The necessary level of cover should be two registrars and eight senior house officers, excluding locum cover.  At present in the accident and emergency department in Galway there is only one registrar and three senior house officers. The long waiting time suffered by patients in the accident and emergency department is directly related to the staffing levels which are inadequate at the best of times and which, according to hospital doctors, are very dangerous between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m.</P>
    <P>The hospital doctors state that they have repeatedly pointed out this critically dangerous situation to hospital management through the IMO and the surgical consultants.  The industrial action taken by the junior hospital doctors today reflects their frustration at what they consider to be an inadequate response to their complaints from the hospital management and the Department of Health and to their concerns for the health and welfare of their patients.</P>
    <P>I hope that by raising this matter the Minister will intervene directly.  His Department supplies funds for the hospital in Galway and he has control over what will happen.  I hope he will approve the additional staff required to deal with this critical situation.  I emphasise that the doctor-patient ratio in Galway is too low.  In the Dublin hospitals the ratio is one doctor to 5,000 patients being seen, while in Galway it is one doctor to 12,000.  This is unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for giving me the opportunity to address issues in relation to the services provided at University College Hospital Galway.  Difficulties have been experienced for some time in relation to the provision of services at the hospital. These are centred on the accident and emergency department.  My Department has recently received proposals from the Western Health Board in relation to the development of services at the hospital.  In order to address the difficulties which have been experienced, an examination is being conducted of problems in the accident and emergency department itself, the arrangements which exist for the provision of geriatric services in the area, the lack of stepdown facilities and liaison between the hospital and general practitioner services in the catchment area.  These proposals are currently being examined in the Department.  I understand that further clarification and elaboration of some elements of the proposal are being sought from the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The immediate dispute between the hospital management and the Irish Medical Organisation centres on junior hospital doctor staffing levels during a particular period of the night in the existing accident and emergency department at the hospital.  Hospital management and representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation have been communicating on this matter for some time and further discussions were being held this afternoon.  I am hopeful that this will lead to a resolution of the matter and an ending of the dispute.  I regret the action being taken which impacts on access to hospital care and causes inconvenience to patients and relatives. However, every effort is being made to minimise its effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's revelation that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children born to unmarried mothers were dispatched to the United States in the 1950 and 1960s is yet another insight into the manner in which children have been treated by the State over the years. It is alleged these children were taken to the United States for adoption, that parental names on their birth certificates were frequently falsified and that passports were issued for them in false names.</P>
      <P>Barnardo's Child Care Agency, which has for many years provided assistance to adopted persons seeking to trace their original parents, has reported inquiries from more than 200 adults who were sent to the United States as children and who now want to trace their birth parents.  Many of them have found great difficulties in doing so due to the falsification of birth certificates and to their lack of access to information that may be available to them in the Passport Office for which the Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility.</P>
      <P>For many years I have spoken of the need for a contact register to enable children adopted in Ireland to make contact with birth parents and to enable birth parents to trace their children who were originally placed by them for adoption.  Today's revelations and those relating to Goldenbridge now starkly illustrate that urgent action is necessary to set up a contact register not only for children adopted in Ireland, but also for those sent abroad, for children reared in foster care and for children reared in residential institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to today's revelations, a number of questions should be <Col N="1458" /> answered.  How many Irish born children of the 1950s and 1960s were sent abroad?  What adoption or other agencies or individuals were involved?  What records are preserved by the agencies or individuals so involved of the origins of the children concerned and of their proposed adoptive families?  Were all the children sent to the United States for adoption, so sent with the consent of their mothers, and were the natural fathers ever consulted?  What records at present exist within the Passport Office of applications made for passports for these children to travel to the United States and what records, if any, are held by the United States authorities of visa applications?</P>
    <P>A former Government employee working in the Passport Office in 1958 said on the Gay Byrne radio show this morning that she was very surprised at the large number of passports sought for young children at that time.  Details of all passport applicants from the 1950s and 1960s are, I understand, currently held on micro-film by the Passport Office.  Consideration now needs to be given to the availability of this information.</P>
    <P>Section 40 of the Adoption Act, 1952, prohibited the removal from the State of a child born outside marriage under seven years of age unless such removal was by or with the approval of the child's mother, guardian or a maternal relation.  If any children were removed from the State without such approval, a criminal offence was committed.  Moreover, there was also a provision in place which prohibited the removal of any such child less than a year old from the State unless the child was to reside with its mother or a maternal relative.</P>
    <P>It is not my view that a witch-hunt should be conducted at this stage with a view to prosecution unless new information becomes available which demands that the position be reconsidered. It is essential that answers to the questions raised by me be sought.  I <Col N="1459" /> propose that a formal inquiry be undertaken under the aegis of the Department of Health.  It is essential that the agencies involved in sending children abroad for adoption purposes be ascertained and that they be asked to state how many such children were sent abroad by them and to clarify whether they still retain accurate records of the background of these children.</P>
    <P>Legislation should be enacted without further unnecessary delay to provide for the establishment of a contact register. The necessary counselling should be available for children seeking to trace their origins and natural parents seeking to make contact with their children.  The Adoption Board, in its most recent report, makes such recommendation, as it has done on many occasions.  That recommendation was also made by the Adoption Review Committee in its report of 1985 and by CARE, the campaign for deprived children, when I was chairman of that organisation as long ago as 1978.  We must establish such a contact register and provide the social back-up services required to meet the needs of adopted children, foster children and children placed in orphanages and homes who seek to make contact with their birth parents and trace their origins.  Such a register is long overdue; the recommendations made to establish it should have been acted upon long ago.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will confirm this evening that the Government will establish a contact register and say when the necessary legislation will come before the House.  I hope he will respond to my proposal that an inquiry be set up to seek answers to the serious questions which need to be answered for the sake of many hundreds, if not thousands, of children who were effectively exiled from the State in which they were born.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this matter.  I welcome this <Col N="1460" /> opportunity to make a statement on the allegations that have been made in the media in recent days regarding the removal of children from the State for adoption abroad during the 1950s and 1960s.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, legal adoption was first introduced here by the Adoption Act, 1952.  This enlightened social legislation was brought forward by the Minister for Justice who, until 1983, had ministerial responsibility for adoption matters.  Prior to the passing of that Act, children were informally adopted by couples living here or were sent abroad for adoption.  It is well known that many children of unmarried mothers were legally adopted in the United States and other countries. Indeed, this practice provided some of the impetus for the introduction of our legal adoption system.  What is not known, however, is the exact number of children involved as this practice was not regulated by law.</P>
      <P>Section 40 of the Adoption Act, 1952, imposed for the first time a statutory restriction on the sending of children abroad.  It became an offence for a person to remove outside the State a child born outside marriage under one year of age who is an Irish citizen or to cause or permit such removal, except for the purpose of the child residing with the mother or a relative outside the State. The purpose of this restriction on sending children abroad, as I understand it, was to ensure that children who were available for adoption would be adopted within the State by Irish people.</P>
      <P>However, the provisions of section 40 of the 1952 Act that related specifically to children born outside marriage were subsequently declared unconstitutional by the High Court in the late 1970s.  The effect of this decision was to permit the sending abroad of young children for adoption with the approval of a parent or guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that no <Col N="1461" /> official records exist of Irish children who were sent abroad for adoption in the past, as no such records were required to be kept by public authorities. The records of the Adoption Board relate only to children who were the subject of applications for adoption under Irish law.  No information is kept on Irish children who were adopted under the laws of foreign countries.</P>
    <P>Given the dearth of information regarding arrangements that were made some 30 or 40 years ago, I do not see how it would be practicable at this stage to conduct an investigation into a practice which was widely known at the time and does not appear to have been considered unacceptable.  However, I am asking health boards to check any records that may be available to them to establish the extent of the practice of sending children abroad for adoption.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made about the falsification of birth records for the purpose of facilitating the adoption of Irish children abroad.  It is an offence to make a false statement about the registration of a birth and if anybody has firm evidence in this regard, it should be made available to the General Register Office which will investigate the matter so far as it can, bearing in mind the length of time that has elapsed since the birth was registered.  Similarly, if anybody has evidence that a registered adoption society acted illegally, this should be made known to the Adoption Board which has statutory responsibility for supervising the activities of the societies.  Possession of false passports is, of course, also illegal.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the establishment of an adoption contact register to assist adopted persons and birth parents who wish to re-establish contact with one another.  It was envisaged that the purpose of such a register would be to address the needs of persons who were parties to legal adoption proceedings under Irish law.  However, it would be my intention, in the context <Col N="1462" /> of the preparation of the necessary legislation, to examine whether it would be possible to extend the scope of the proposed register to include Irish children adopted abroad.  However, on the basis of my understanding of the position, this may not be possible.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for facilitating Deputy Ahern and me.  We raise this issue to seek proper treatment and fair play for the students of St. Mary's school, Dundalk, who submitted honours English leaving certificate papers for examination in the 1995 leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>The Minister and her Department have treated these students and their parents in a most shabby and disgraceful manner.  The manner in which the Minister dealt with their case illustrates a breakdown in management systems and procedures within her office and between it and the wider Department. The Minister is not in control of the Department.  She does not adopt a hands on approach.  Her lack of attention to detail and her inability to respond promptly to the most serious of representations raises the most fundamental questions about her capacity to competently administer the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister received correspondence from the parents of these students dated 10 October informing her of their grave concerns with the initial grades awarded to the vast majority of the leaving certificate student body in the honours English examination in 1995.  The parents argued that there was an incredible bunching of grades at C3 and D levels. Three senior English teachers, each of whom has 20 years plus teaching experience, believed that in each of their classes there would be 3 to 4 As, a good number of Bs and an above average number of honours overall.  The <Col N="1463" /> point was also made that students who were classified by their teachers as marginal honours candidates were awarded the same grade as students considered to be very bright and significantly better than their borderline counterparts.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Minister said on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night&mdash; perhaps her comments were inadvertently misleading &mdash; the Department received correspondence not only from the parents but from the school.</P>

The Minister cannot blame officials for this as she tried to do in relation to the arts examination debacle.  She received the correspondence, she acknowledged it personally but she failed to follow through and ensure a proper response.</P>

      <Col N="1464" /> The parents are particularly saddened and aggrieved that the compromise agreement which was arrived at last Thursday when they met with Mr. Glennane, Mr. Martin and the relevant staff member of St. Mary's college, was not adhered to.  It was agreed that there would be pairings of scripts within the St. Mary's cohort to be nominated by teachers.  The pairings would consist of a marginal honours candidate and a more gifted candidate who would have been expected to do much better yet both ended up with the same grade.  The parents believe that such pairings would have highlighted that the market did not or could not discriminate between levels of ability.  The paired scripts in their entirety were not presented and the only discussion centred on sections of St. Mary's scripts against sections of other non-St. Mary's scripts.  The parents are of the opinion this was a travesty of what had been agreed.  Will the Minister clarify why she reneged on this agreement?</P>

      <P>I will not repeat what Deputy Martin said.  I emphasise this is the first time in the history of this school that the teachers have questioned the examination results.  From the outset the school, the teachers and the parents were involved <i>en bloc</i> in making representations to the Department and to the examiners.  Two days after the examination results were issued and before an appeals procedure was put in place or parents appealed the decisions, one of the teachers wrote three letters to people connected with the Department emphasising there was something gravely wrong in the marking of the examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort has been made by the Department and the Minister to compare the 1995 examination results with previous years.  That is unethical and wrong.  It should be emphasised that higher examination results were achieved by students in smaller classes <Col N="1465" /> during the past number of years.  That will be borne out by the facts.  A compromise by the parents, the teachers and the Minister's representatives was agreed recently, but for some reason it was not adhered to.  I have the minutes of the meeting dealing with that.  Why was that compromise not adhered to?  Is it the case that the result of that compromise was not acceptable to the Department?</P>
    <P>Under the examinations procedure when an appeals process is in place the previous marks awarded are available to the second examiner checking the examination papers.  In any appeals procedure that must give rise to an examination <i>de novo</i>.  The second examiner should not be informed of the examination marks awarded previously.  The Minister should address that matter.</P>
    <P>In these cases have the papers been remarked or the results reviewed?  I reject any inference that the teachers, the school and the students are at fault.  It defies logic that 72 of the 80 students were awarded C3 and D grades.  In one case a student who got five A1s got a C3 in English.  That student was awarded a grade A in the junior certificate English examination. There is need for an ombudsman to examine this matter.</P>

      <P>The core issue in relation to the honours English leaving certificate scripts from the students in St. Mary's school in Dundalk is whether they were graded in line with the criteria applied nationally.  The Department maintains, following four successive rounds of scrutiny, that they were. The parents maintain otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two subsidiary issues.  The problem of the delay is one issue with which I will deal this evening.  There is a second issue &mdash; an allegation I received today from the parents' group in St. Mary's that an understanding reached between the Department and the school <Col N="1466" /> and the parents' representatives in relation to the manner in which the final recheck was to be carried out was not adhered to by the Department.  Deputy Martin has tabled questions for answer tomorrow on this latter point.  I will reply to his questions tomorrow but, because of the way all these matters have been linked together, I will also deal with this aspect this evening.  I will deal with the two subsidiary issues first and then finish up with the core issue.  I will do so in the context of a summary of the history of the case to date.</P>
    <P>Following the issue of the leaving certificate results in August 1995 the school authorities appealed the results of 18 candidates in higher level English.  Following the normal procedure, one upgrade was recommended and approved.  The result of this upgrade was communicated to the school on 4 October 1995.</P>
    <P>Following the issue of the results of the appeals for the leaving certificate examinations on 4 October 1995 a number of parents of candidates from St. Mary's College, Dundalk, began a correspondence with me and my Department seeking a further review of the leaving certificate English, higher level, results for the 18 candidates who had already appealed.</P>
    <P>The chief examiner for English was instructed to conduct a further review of the grades awarded for these 18 candidates. In turn he instructed the chief advising examiner to review these 18 scripts and to verify whether they had been marked in accordance with the marking scheme.  In due course the chief advising examiner, a teacher with over 20 years experience of examination work, reported that the results had been in accordance with the marking scheme and did not recommend any further upgrades.  He passed the papers to the inspector who was chief examiner for English, who in turn passed them to a superior officer on 7 November 1995.</P>
    <P>No further communication was made with the parents for three months.  A preliminary and informal report has <Col N="1467" /> been received from the officer who received these papers.  I am concerned that the delay was so prolonged.  I have a responsibility before passing final comment on the delay to take full account of all the circumstances &mdash; including the systems involved &mdash; and giving persons involved the opportunity to explain fully the circumstances as they see them.  I have asked for a further and formal report on the circumstances surrounding the delay.  Pending receipt and consideration of this report, I will not comment further on the matter.</P>
    <P>A further letter was received on 8 February 1996 from the representative of the parents.  Immediately the file was referred to the deputy chief inspector. On Friday, 9 February, the deputy chief inspector spoke by telephone to the principal teacher of St. Mary's School, in Dundalk, and informed him of the decision that no further upgrades were warranted.  He indicated that an inspector would visit the school in the near future.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the chief inspector, the deputy chief inspector spoke by telephone on Monday, 12 February, with a representative of the parents and informed her that the results were unchanged and that a letter would issue.  I issued a letter on Thursday 15 February, informing the parents that no further upgrades were warranted, indicating that I was aware that the deputy chief inspector was in contact with them.</P>
    <P>A further letter was received from the parents on 21 February 1995.  The chief inspector and the inspector who was chief examiner for English visited the school.  Following a meeting between the chief examiner for English and the principal and the teachers of English in the school, the chief inspector joined them for a discussion with three representatives of the parents.  At that meeting the parents made clear their disappointment at the result and <Col N="1468" /> referred to the fact that the majority of pupils had received grades C or D in English whereas some of them had received much higher grades in other subjects.</P>
    <P>The parents suggested that a teacher in the school, who had acted as an assistant examiner at this level, should remark some scripts from which the marks originally assigned had been deleted.  This could not be accepted by the inspectors as it would contravene the regulations whereby teachers are precluded from acting as examiners of their own pupils.</P>
    <P>The inspectors did undertake to have a recheck of a number of the 1995 scripts from the school which were to include some scripts to be nominated for comparison purposes, from the 18 results which had been appealed.  It was proposed at the meeting that the English teachers in the school would nominate a number of scripts which would be subject to a comparison.  The concept behind this approach was that the scripts of a weaker candidate would be paired with a more gifted candidate where each had scored the same grade. The inspectors also undertook that the chief examiner for English would return within one week to inform the school of the results of the recheck.  He would bring with him copies of the marked scripts to show to the school authorities.</P>
    <P>On 23 February 1996 the principal teacher telephoned the Department and asked particularly that the scripts of six nominated candidates within the school be looked at especially.  On 24 February the chief inspector instructed that the chief examiner for English and the chief advising examiner &mdash; for English &mdash; would jointly look first at the six nominated scripts and then at the further 12 scripts that had been appealed originally. On Wednesday the review of the scripts was completed and no upgrade was recommended.  All the nominated scripts were found by these examiners to have been graded correctly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> On Thursday, 29 February 1996, the chief examiner for English, accompanied by the chief advising examiner visited the school again and discussed the findings of the review with the chairman of the board of management, the principal and one of the teachers of English in the school.  The chief examiner for English had with him copies of the six nominated scripts. When he had almost finished discussing the first of these scripts with the representatives of the school, the principal said there was no point in proceeding any further because of the divergence in opinions between the chief examiner and the teacher.  The principal undertook to inform the parents that there would be no further upgrades.</P>
    <P>Parents' representatives alleged to me subsequently that an agreement relating to the scrutiny of paired scripts did not take place.  That is not true.  The paired scripts were scrutinised but a discussion did not take place with all three teachers on the full six scripts.  The relevant factors were the decision by the principal to bring the discussion to a close and the fact that all teachers were not present at the meeting between the chief examiner for English and the chief advising examiner with the chairman of the board of management, the principal and one of the three teachers.</P>

      <P>The 1995 leaving certificate English, higher level, results in the case of 1,639 candidates were appealed at national level and 203, that is, approximately 12.3 per cent, resulted in upgrades.  The results for 18 candidates at St. Mary's College, Dundalk, were appealed, of which one was upgraded.  A total of 104 candidates from St. Mary's College, Dundalk, presented for higher level English, 24 of <Col N="1470" /> whom were repeating the leaving certificate examination and 80 attempting the examination for the first time.  Sixty-two candidates from this school took the ordinary level papers in English, representing 37 per cent of school candidates, compared with a national average of 47 per cent, taking the ordinary level. Forty-four candidates, or 43 per cent, were awarded a grade C or higher in the English examination, of which one was an A grade and five were B grades. These results were broadly comparable with those obtained by the school in 1994 and 1993 &mdash; 40 per cent in both years &mdash; and are much lower than the national rate for grade C for higher level, which was approximately 63 per cent for those three years.</P>
      <P>Spokespersons for the parents have requested sight of the candidates' scripts.  It is important to stress that the conduct and marking of examinations is governed by the <i>Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools</i>, a statutory instrument, and in accordance with detailed instructions issued annually.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Mary's College, Dundalk, I am satisfied that in the leaving certificate higher level English all the relevant procedures and instructions were followed.  Rule 28 of the <i>Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools</i> states:</P>
      <P>...a candidate's worked exercise will not be returned to the candidate or his/her representative under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>I must point out that these papers have now been marked a total of four times.</P>

      <P>Knock <Col N="1208" /> Airport is managed by a private company, Connaught Regional Airport Company Ltd.</P>
      <P>Exchequer grants totalling £9.858 million were granted to the Connaught Regional Airport Development Company in the early 1980s towards the cost of construction and maintenance of the airport.  This grant was shown as a contingent liability on the company's balance sheet.</P>
      <P>The airport company was restructured in 1991 and the then Government agreed, in the interests of safeguarding the future financial viability of the airport, to treat as non-repayable the Exchequer grants paid to the company. In addition, an amount of £155,000 owed to the Minister for the provision of air traffic control services by the Minister's Air Navigation Services Office, was also treated as nonreturnable.</P>
      <P>The debt to the Exchequer was written off on condition that ownership of the airport company would be transferred to a trust the Horan International Airport Trust, the objectives of which were; to hold shares in Connaught Airport Development Company Ltd. and appoint a board of directors to arrange for the conduct of its business in a fully commercial manner; to attract, in conjunction with the board of directors, new private sector investment and new airlines to the airport; to benefit the residents of Connaught, in general, and County Mayo, in particular; to encourage and promote the cultural, commercial and industrial interests of the residents of the said area and to encourage tourism in the said area.</P>
      <P>ERDF aid of £214,000 was allocated to the airport under the 1989-93 round of EU Structural Funds in respect of terminal improvements and a weather station.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 39 together.  At the request of my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs made formal, high-level diplomatic approaches to the Governments of countries which signed, or which were contemplating signing, reprocessing agreements on spent nuclear fuel with the THORP facility, setting out the concerns of the Irish Government in this area.  The Irish position was generally sympathetically received by the authorities concerned and the concerns were then conveyed to the nuclear electricity companies.  However, it was pointed out by the Governments concerned that they could not intervene directly in contractual agreements entered into with British Nuclear Fuels.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to make known its concerns about operations at THORP through diplomatic channels and to promote, at every appropriate opportunity in relevant international fora, the Government's opposition to THORP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 38 and 46 together.  The incident at the Wylfa <Col N="1215" /> Magnox nuclear plant which the Deputy refers to occurred in June, 1993.  In my contribution to the Adjournment Debate of 20 September 1995 I set out the circumstances and extent of the incident. I also expressed my concerns about the safety and reliability of ageing Magnox reactors in general and on the adequacy of safety in the UK's nuclear industry generally, particularly in the light of the upcoming privatisation.</P>
      <P>On 29 September 1995, the UK Minister of Industry and Energy replied to my letter of 19 September on foot of the Wylfa incident.  The Minister pointed out that for the UK Government and for all those involved in the nuclear industry, safety was the highest priority. He also pointed out that all UK nuclear power stations, including Magnox stations, were subject to a stringent licensing regime operated by the independent regulator, the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate-NII.  The Minister said that he was satisfied that, subject to these stations continuing to give satisfactory results for the NII in routine tests and inspections and in periodic safety reviews, the Magnox stations should continue to operate.</P>
      <P>I responded on 14 November 1995 and raised a number of technical issues, advised to me by the Radiological Protection of Ireland (RPII) which, I maintained, rendered Magnox reactors considerably less safe than modern reactors. In his reply of 24 November, the UK Minister contended that my concerns about the safety of Magnox reactors were unfounded and he repeated that the continued operation of the reactors had the approval of the independent Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII).  Notwithstanding these assurances, I remain unconvinced about the safety aspects of Magnox reactors.  My concerns are based on the technical advice which I have obtained from the RPII and I have asked the institute to pursue these concerns directly with the NII and to report back to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> As recently as 5 February this year at a meeting in my office with the British Ambassador, I again emphasised my concerns about the continued existence of Magnox reactors and urged that they be phased out as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 54 together.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is responsible for the detection and measurement of the naturally-occurring radon gas in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the institute initiated a national geographically-based survey into the presence of radon in homes and this is due to be completed towards the end of 1998.  To date the survey has been completed in eleven counties, is ongoing in six more and has now been extended to Counties Wexford and Carlow. The results for the first five counties surveyed will be published in the first half of 1996, with the results for the remaining counties being published as they become available between now and 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress in relation to radon identification has been very good.  Indeed, compared with other countries, Ireland is very advanced in its identification of the extent of the problems and is one of the <Col N="1217" /> few EU countries that have fixed reference levels for radon accumulation.  The only way of identifying homes with high levels of radon is by individual house surveys, which can take up to a year to get accurate results.  The RPII is concentrating resources on this work, and is continuing to build up information as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Where high radon concentrations have been identified, techniques exist which enable levels to be reduced.  In August 1995 the Department of the Environment issued an advisory booklet which is designed to inform householders about radon in buildings and to provide guidance where it has been decided to take action to reduce radon levels.  That Department also provides guidance about what action to take in the design and construction of new buildings.</P>
    <P>The results of the National Radon Survey will assist in the identification of areas of greater risk of high radon levels and will allow the local authorities in those areas to consider what actions are desirable to limit radon accumulation in new buildings.  Under the present building regulations issued by the Department of the Environment, precautions must be taken by builders to avoid danger to health and safety caused by radon.  I am continuously looking at ways and means of improving the public's uptake of the RPII's radon testing services and, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and the RPII, exploring all possible avenues to deal with remedial measures.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute RPII has been informed by British Nuclear Fuels and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority that they are not aware of any fire occurring at the Sellafield site on 6 February last.  I understand that some operations were suspended at the Sellafield site on 6 February 1996 because blizzards caused staff extreme difficulties in travelling to and from work.</P>
      <P>The RPII is aware that a small fire in a fuel handling cave occurred at the Sellafield plant on 30 January last.  It was reported that no person was injured and no part of the plant was damaged by the small fire.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Sellafield onsite fire brigade was called to the scene of the fire at the fuel handling cave but due to the small size of the fire and the speedy actions of staff it was not needed.  Some radioactivity was discharged via the plant ventilation system but I have been informed that this was well within operating limits.  The event was below scale on the International Nuclear Events Scale used by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>

      <P>In view of the fundamental changes suggested by that committee in its report to Government, I decided to continue with the existing annual subsidy arrangements for the passenger ferry service from Rossaveal in 1996.  Following a tender competition, a contract has been awarded to Island Ferries Teo. for the 1996 service.  The Rossaveal study has been made available to the interdepartmental committee for use in its on-going work on island development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago Telecom Éireann submitted proposals to me for a comprehensive rebalancing of leased lines charges. These charges had not been adjusted in many years and a serious shortfall had developed, especially in the provision of the type of circuits referred to by the Deputy, between the costs of providing the service and the revenue earned from it.  This culminated in the package of increases announced by Telecom Éireann in late 1995.</P>
      <P>There should be a reasonable relationship between the tariffs for leased lines and the tariffs charged for other network services including the ordinary telephone services.  This had not been maintained however, with the result that a distorted pricing structure grew up which encouraged customers to remain with leased lines even though this was an inefficient use of the network.</P>
      <P>This was particularly so in the case of short distance analogue circuits, including alarm circuits, which were generally charged at a flat rate of £80 a year, although the user was tying up infrastructure that would be charged at £240 to any ordinary user.  That is why I insisted the increases indicated by the allocation of costs in such cases should be capped at a tariff marginally above the cost of the equivalent two telephone lines initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I instructed Telecom Éireann to take steps to assist customers in identifying the least cost reconfiguration of whatever service they require.  In many cases this would entail customers moving to alternative services or converting to modern terminal equipment operated on the ordinary telephone network.  In the case mentioned by the Deputy, for example, it would be techinically feasible to add an auto-dialling device at the customer premises which would be capable of <Col N="1221" /> transmitting the same communication over the ordinary telephone network on an existing telephone line.</P>
    <P>As the charge for each individual leased circuit is dependent upon a number of variable elements unique to that circuit, It is not possible to generalise about the impact of the increase on any particular customer or type of customer. The cap on increases for analogue circuits was put in place to discourage increases of the magnitude suggested in the Deputy's question.  It may be that there could be exceptional cases where there might be a greater increase.  If the Deputy is aware of such a case I suggest that he transmit relevant details to me and I will have the case examined.</P>

      <P>The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents was finalised in 1991.  It is of considerable importance to me and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that exercises of the national emergency plans are carried out regularly. These are required to ensure that it will function in an emergency situation.</P>
      <P>A major Irish exercise of the plan, called &ldquo;Saferay&rdquo;, was carried out in 1992.  Many lessons were learnt during this exercise and were addressed in a further exercise held in 1993.  This exercise, known as &ldquo;INEX 1&rdquo;, was a major international exercise organised by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD. Sixteen countries performed the exercise. I am pleased to say that Ireland performed quite creditably in this exercise and it was found to be very helpful in assisting us to refine and improve our emergency arrangements.</P>
      <P>It was thought that a second international exercise would be held in 1995, but it will now be held this year.  We have signified our intention to participate in this exercise, which will be known as &ldquo;INEX 2&rdquo;.  It will provide, with some Irish additions, a searching test of our emergency arrangements.</P>
      <P>Important factors of international nuclear emergency arrangements are the communication links between countries and the effective implementation of the international convention and the European Union arrangements for the early notification and the exchange of information about a nuclear accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> The system operated in the European Union is tested every six to eight weeks. At least one of these every year includes the transfer of simulated radiological data between EU member states.  The last test of the communication system established under the IAEA convention on early notification of a nuclear accident took place in September 1995. Ireland participates in all these tests and the experiences gained to date have lead to improvements in the international arrangements.</P>

      <P>My <Col N="1224" /> Department recently agreed a work programme for 1996 with the Irish Energy Centre.  Under the economic infrastructure operational programme 1994-99, the centre has a budget of approximately £21 million.  The allocation for 1996 is £4.925 million and the following are the principal measures which will be implemented by the centre during the year.</P>
      <P>The two grant schemes launched in late 1994 will be continued.  The first of these schemes is the energy audit grant scheme, under which grants of up to 40 per cent are available to energy users in the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors towards the cost of energy audits.  The allocation for this activity in 1996 is £350,000.</P>
      <P>The second grant scheme is the energy efficiency support scheme.  This provides grant assistance of up to 40 per cent of the cost of implementing the recommendations of audits.  Additionally, it targets specific energy efficient technologies.  The allocation for this scheme in 1996 is £1.925 million.</P>
      <P>Under the technical advice measure, the Irish Energy Centre will support the Renewable Energy Information Office in Bandon and the launch of a national energy efficiency training initiative.  It will also produce good practice guides on energy efficient technologies and support them through an integrated package of promotional seminars, conferences, etc.  It will also promote EU programmes such as Joule, Thermie, SAVE and Altener, as well as pursuing a number of sectoral energy awareness initiatives.  A total of £1.4 million is available for these activities in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The energy conservation and efficiency promotional work of the Irish Energy Centre, such as energy awareness week, the development of communications, strategy and the engagement of trade allies in pursuit of its objectives, and the reinforcement of a variety of educational initiatives will also continue in 1996.  The budget available for these activities and general <Col N="1225" /> monitoring, measurement and assessment of its overall work programme amounts to £0.945 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre will continue to support the work of Energy Action, Dublin, and seek to replicate that model in other parts of the country.  A number of other pilot initiatives will also be pursued. The budget available here amounts to £0.305 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered very carefully the proposal for the establishement of a second commercial airport for Dublin.  The conclusion I reached, having consulted with my Cabinet colleagues, was that the project would not be in the interests of the aviation sector and the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made an extensive public statement on this issue recently and I have arranged for a copy of that statement to be placed in the Dáil Library for the convenience of Deputies.  In summary, I pointed out that Dublin airport has the capacity to cater for traffic growth for the foreseeable future; independent studies have shown that Aer Rianta's cost base is not excessive and that its landing charges are competitive; two airports for Dublin would duplicate infrastructure and facilities leading to increased costs as economies of scale would be lost.  Airlines would be reluctant to transfer to a secondary location because of the loss of hubbing opportunities and integrated services that such a move would entail.  The coming on stream of the Baldonnel proposal would coincide with the planned abolition of the intra-EU duty free sales from 1999 which will have adverse implications for all airports and airlines. <Col N="1226" /> In other words, the economics of Baldonnel would be problematic from the outset.</P>
    <P>In addition, a commercial airport at Baldonnel would impact not only on Dublin airport but on the catchment areas of Galway, Shannon, Cork and Waterford airports putting further pressure on some of these airports to survive or grow, and, the Baldonnel project would not come on stream until the end of the century.  In the meantime, the Dublin airport development programme cannot be put on hold.  It would make no sense to enhance capacity at Dublin airport and at the same time provide capacity at another location.</P>
    <P>Baldonnel aerodrome will continue to be used by the Air Corps.  The Department of Defence is currently examining the possible use of the facilities at Baldonnel for private executive air travel. Both the Minister for Defence and I believe that there may be scope for making greater use of Baldonnel in this area of aviation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The core light rail network recommended by DTI provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely, via the Harcourt Street line, and Ballymun.  A fourth light <Col N="1227" /> rail line to Finglas, via the old Broadstone railway line, and an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin airport and Swords have been recommended by DTI for implementation once the core light rail lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely and Ballymun have been constructed.</P>
    <P>Apart from the proposed extension of the Ballymun light rail line to Dublin airport, DTI also recommended that a conventional rail link, but not necessarily a DART type system, from Dublin airport to the Dublin-Belfast railway line should be evaluated as a longer term option.  This recommendation by DTI took a longer term strategic view of the role and importance of Dublin airport and was not seen as impacting on the proposed light rail extension to the airport as both would serve different markets.</P>
    <P>These proposals will be considered in due course as part of the Government's ongoing commitment to the implementation of the DTI strategy.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to pursuing realistic and effective courses of action to convey to the British authorities the concerns of the Irish people about the British nuclear industry.  Developments affecting nuclear safety have been a matter of major concern to me personally and has been one of my priorities for attention since taking office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1995 there were a number of exchanges, both written and verbal, with the British authorities expressing the concerns of the Irish public, not only in <Col N="1228" /> relation to Sellafield, but also on many other aspects of the British nuclear industry.  In particular, on different occasions I have voiced my concerns about specific incidents at nuclear plants and the safety aspects of the Sellafield, THORP and the Magnox plants, the privatisation of the UK nuclear industry and proposals for the establishment of a nuclear waste repository near Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Ireland-UK contact group on nuclear safety matters met on two occasions in 1995, in May and October, to discuss issues of public concern about Britain's nuclear industry.  During the three months, September to November 1995, I wrote strong letters to the UK Minister for Energy, Mr. Tim Eggar, MP, and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP outlining in the strongest terms the very deep concerns of the Irish people about safety aspects of the British nuclear industry, including specific incidents that occurred throughout the year.  In November 1995 I presented my statement of case to a planning inquiry in Cumbria which clearly set out my objections to a proposed underground nuclear waste repository in the Sellafield area.</P>
    <P>Representations and exchanges of correspondence have continued into 1996.  Notably, in January, I attended the public inquiry in Cumbria where I made an oral statement in which I vigorously opposed the granting of planning permission for the construction of a rock laboratory in the general Sellafield area.  In February 1996 I met the British ambassador in my office to convey the Government's concern regarding the safety of the UK's nuclear industry and its potential hazards for the health and safety of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>In March, 1995 the High Court established the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case brought by four Dundalk residents against British Nuclear Fuels in relation to the THORP reprocessing plant in Cumbria.  This decision was welcomed by the Government. In January 1996 British Nuclear Fuels' appeal against the earlier High Court decision was heard by the Supreme Court, which has reserved its judgment.</P>
      <P>Although Ireland and the Attorney General are named as co-defendants in the substantive case being taken by the Dundalk residents, the Government supported the Dundalk group in resisting British Nuclear Fuels' application to have the order allowing service of the summons out of the State set aside.  In addition, my Department and a number of other Government Departments and State agencies are currently making available to the plaintiffs, on a voluntary basis, files and documentation relevant to the issues raised.  This is another illustration of the Government's commitment to do all in its power to eliminate the threat posed by Sellafield and THORP.</P>
      <P>There have been requests that the plaintiffs should be indemnified by the State in respect of their costs of pursuing the proceedings.  The advice I have is that this request raises some substantial issues and, as I indicated in response to a parliamentary question on 12 October 1995, it is considered appropriate in the circumstances to await the outcome of the appeal taken by British Nuclear Fuels before reaching a decision, one way or the other, upon those requests. It is the intention of the Government to positively respond to the request if it is legally possible to do so.</P>

    <P>Note 1: It is not possible at this stage to provide estimates of proposed investments on the Dublin/Sligo railway line; this will depend on the outcome of detailed consultations which are expected to take place with the EU Commission in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>Note 2: The Operational Programme for Economic Infrastructure 1994-99 provides for a total investment programme of £259 million in postal, energy and telecommunications infrastructure.  The Border area will benefit from some of the telecommunications investments under the operational programme, although only a small part of actual expenditure will take place in the area directly.  The programme also provides for investments in specific energy related projects.  The extent of the EU funds to be spent in the Border area will depend on private sector involvement in specific energy related projects which may be eligible for co-financing under the operational programme.</P>
    <P>Note 3: The possibilities of EU funds being available for specific projects in the energy, public transport or telecommunications area are being explored with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Note 4: The projects being undertaken under the ALTENER and EU SAVE (Regional &amp; Urban Energy Management) schemes are funded directly by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>However, under the energy efficiency investment support scheme administered by the Irish Energy Centre, a call for proposals for small scale Combined Heat and Power, CHP, issued in 1995. That call is now closed and grant aid amounting to £435,451 has been sanctioned. The objective here is to set up a number of reference demonstration sites which others could replicate without grant assistance.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the EU Thermie programme has, to date, been one of the most important energy technology support mechanisms in Ireland.  Eight projects involving combined heat and power have been agreed for funding to date, and the total grant aid involved amounts to £1.8 million.</P>

      <P>Exchequer grants paid to CIE in 1995 amounted to £102.5 million.  The allocation of these grants is a matter for the board of CIE.  In 1995 the board allocated the grants as follows: Iarnród Éireann, £89.163 million; Bus Átha Cliath, £3.8 million; Bus Éireann, £1.7 million and Howth/Bray, DART interest charges, £7.837 million.</P>
      <P>A separate payment of £35,000 was made to CIE in respect of compensation paid by the board for redundancies which arose in the period July 1958 to March 1964.  This payment is provided for under the terms of the Transport Act, 1958.</P>

      <P>The operation of decision making procedures in the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, will be among the matters considered at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. In this connection, a variety of suggestions and proposals have been put forward in the reflection group, by some of our EU partners and by the Commission with the objective of refining these procedures.</P>
      <P>Some of these proposals and suggestions are variations on the theme that a relaxation of the consensus rule, whether through qualified majority voting or through voluntary abstention, would enable the EU to respond more effectively to the international challenges which face it.  These proposals and suggestions envisage also that in the event of a qualified majority in favour of a particular course of action, or in the event of abstention by one or two countries, those partners who are unable or unwilling to join a consensus should not prevent the EU's majority from taking or implementing the decision in question. It has also been suggested that partners in the minority should show political and financial solidarity in such cases.  It is of relevance to note in this connection that the proposal has also been made that CFSP should be financed from the Community budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These issues are matters for the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Intergovernmental Conference negotiations can be expected, in the context of the commitment to review the CFSP provisions as set out in the Maastricht Treaty, to consider the decision making and financial arrangements for the <Col N="1242" /> CFSP itself and for any further development of the CFSP towards a common defence policy as envisaged in Article J.4.1.</P>
    <P>The decision making and financing aspects of any proposals for a common defence policy that might emerge in the course of the negotiations are key issues to be considered.  The Government is examining the implications of these and other ideas that have arisen in the context of preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations.  The Government has indicated that it does not favour proposals to move to qualified majority voting for sensitive foreign policy questions.  This would apply in particular to decision making and financing arrangements in the context of proposals to develop a common defence policy for the Union.</P>
    <P>The reflection group's final report noted that the majority of members strongly felt that the principle of national sovereignty should continue to govern relations between European countries in defence matters; that the intergovernmental nature of decision making on these issues should be preserved; and therefore, that any such decision making should be conducted on the basis of consensus.  In any event, any Treaty changes proposed, including in relation to decision making or financial arrangements in the CFSP area, can be adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference only if all partners, including Ireland, agree.</P>

      <P>The current rates of excise duty on dance hall licences are as follows: for a licence not exceeding one month, £20, and in any other case, £125.  In addition, where drink is permitted to be served under an exemption order in discos in hotels etc. after normal hours an additional duty of £90 is payable in respect of each order.  I am satisfied that these charges are reasonable for dance organisers and I have no plans to change them.</P>

International music publishing, recording or entertainment <Col N="1245" /> would not qualify for the corporation tax rate of 10 per cent in the IFSC because none of these activities is a financial service or a service ancillary to a financial service.</P>

      <P>I have received two general representations in relation to availability of tax relief for dental treatment provided abroad and I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have received a representation in relation to optical treatment by laser surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967, provides for tax relief for certain health expenses even if the treatment was received abroad.  I am not aware of any evaluation or study which has been carried out in relation to the impact of section 12 on the provision of complex medical and dental treatment in this State, I would, however, draw to the Deputy's attention that section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967, has been in operation now for many years and has been of benefit to taxpayers in the provision of health care.  The section's primary aim is to alleviate the financial expense <Col N="1246" /> incurred by taxpayers as a result of non-routine and non-reimbursable health expenditure whether or not the treatment is provided within the State.  The measure was not intended as a mechanism for the promotion of domestic providers of services.  Furthermore, there may be EU implications if any restrictions were to be applied in relation to where the service is provided.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any relief similar to section 12 being available in the UK and consequently the issue of reciprocity does not arise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taxation of practitioners abroad, including the UK, this is a matter for the relevant jurisdictions and is an area in which this State has no function.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> Statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy relating to the number of landlords who have paid tax to be provided.  The only relevant information available is an analysis of the tax returns for the income tax year 1992-93, the latest available, which indicates that rental income was declared by some 33,000 individuals for that year.  Additionally, between 1 April 1993 and January 31 1996 the special inquiry branch of the Revenue Commissioners identified 1,149 individuals and companies, including a small number of commercial lettings, who had previously not disclosed or only partially disclosed their income from rental sources for tax purposes. During this period other individuals would have made voluntary disclosures of previously unreturned rental income but statistics on the numbers are not available.</P>

      <P>The 10 per cent corporation tax rate applies to income arising from the manufacture of goods in the State.  The question of whether the processes carried out by a company constitute manufacturing activity, and so entitle the company to the 10 per cent rate, depends on the facts to be determined in each case.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that certain activities carried on in the quarry industry already qualify for manufacturing relief on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> Any amendment of the legislation to specifically extend the 10 per cent rate to all quarrying activities would constitute a State aid which would require prior EU Commission approval.  It is unlikely that such approval would be forthcoming at this time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in my recent budget I anounced a significant improvement in the taxation of all companies which are currently taxable at the 38 per cent corporation tax rate.  From 1 April next, a new reduced rate of corporation tax of 30 per cent will apply to the first £50,000 of a company's taxable income in an accounting year.  This move will be of benefit to all non-manufacturing companies, including those engaged in quarrying.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the reintroduction of 100 per cent accelerated capital allowances in the first year.  I do not intend to reintroduce accelerated capital allowances on a general basis as mentioned in the Deputy's question.  Such a step would go against the thrust of the corporation and income tax reforms which have been achieved in recent years and, as accelerated allowances are very costly to the Exchequer, their reintroduction might well have to be financed by increasing the tax burden in other respects.  This could have implications for our ability to reduce tax rates further and, as such, would be an unwelcome development from the point of view of business generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that children in residential care are no longer maintained in orphanages or similar type institutions that were designed to cater for large numbers of children.  Since the early 1970's there has been a major shift away from the provision of care in such settings to smaller purpose-built group homes and other appropriately-sized residential units.</P>
      <P>A number of important measures have been taken to promote the welfare of children in residential care and to protect them from abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant of these are the Child Care (Placement of Children in Residential Care) Regulations, 1995, which I brought into operation with <Col N="1254" /> effect from 31 October last.  These regulations were made under Part IV of the Child Care Act, 1991, and govern the placement by health boards of children in their care in residential centres.  They apply to residential centres operated by voluntary bodies as well those operated by the boards themselves.</P>
    <P>The new regulations lay down detailed requirements to be complied with by health boards in relation to the placement of children in residential care, the conduct of residential centres for children provided by boards, the supervision, visiting and review of children placed in residential centres and the removal of children from such placements, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>In particular, the new regulations require each health board to satisfy itself that adequate arrangements are in place at each residential centre to guard against the risk of injury and for the reporting and recording of accidents and injuries affecting children residing there; satisfy itself that procedures are in place for the prompt notification to the board of significant events affecting children placed there by the board; monitor standards in each residential centre in which the board has placed a child and ensure that the centre is visited from time to time by an authorised person; arrange for the supervision of children placed in residential centres by the board and for the children to be visited within prescribed intervals; and arrange for the periodical review of each child placed by the board in a residential centre.</P>
    <P>The regulations are designed to ensure that children in residential care are visited, supervised and reviewed on a more systematic basis than before and that the changing needs of the children are not lost sight of.  Full recognition is given to the role of parents, carers and, indeed, the children themselves in this process.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Child Care Act, which relates to the registration of children's residential centres, will be brought into operation later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> I might also mention that, at a national level, it is proposed to establish, on a statutory basis, an inspectorate of social services in the Department of Health.  This inspectorate will be responsible for quality assurance and audit of child care practice, and will undertake inquiries on behalf of the Minister for Health.  I am confident that, together with the important new provisions relating to residential care under the Child Care Act, this will improve the safeguards and procedures for the protection of children in residential care.</P>

The necessity to <Col N="1256" /> involve these groups in the fight against drugs has been emphasised to the boards.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The operational efficiency of radiotherapy equipment can reasonably be measured in terms of machine downtime as a proportion of total operational time.  Radiotherapy equipment, of necessity, requires to be temporarily taken out of service for a variety of reasons, including calibration and validation work, preventive maintenance and, on occasion, for repair work.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the hospital that there have been particular technical difficulties with some of the hospital's treatment equipment in addition to the requirement for ongoing maintenance. Contingency arrangements are automatically put in place by the hospital when equipment is temporarily out of use, so as to ensure that all emergency cases are accommodated and to ensure continuity of treatment.  Alternative treatment machines are used as required and, where necessary, a back up service is available from another health agency for patients requiring treatment planning prior to radiotherapy. I am assured by the hospital that these procedures are operating successfully.</P>
      <P>As part of the major redevelopment of accommodation and facilities at St. Luke's Hospital which is currently under way at a cost in excess of £15 million I have already provided additional funding of approximately £3 million to upgrade the hospital's treatment equipment. The first of two new linear accelerators will be operational in May 1996 and the second machine, which is being installed at present, is expected to be in clinical use by the summer.  In addition, the hospital has had a new simulator installed and discussions are ongoing regarding the approval of funds for the purchase of a third new linear accelerator.</P>

      <P>An application was received by the board in 1995 from the Merchant's Quay project for funding of £217,300 for the provision of a residential detoxification service.  The application was the subject of discussion between representatives of the project and officials of my Department and it was, I understand, also discussed between the project and officials of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Arising from decisions made by the Government on 20 February relating to drug demand reduction measures, the Eastern Health Board will now be proceeding with the development of comprehensive treatment measures in Dublin. The Merchant's Quay proposals will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The dental health action plan provides for the extension of eligibility for dental services to children up to 16 years of age.  I have already extended eligibility for dental services to children after they leave national school up to their fourteenth birthday.</P>
      <P>Treatment will be provided by health boards to these children by extending the targeted approach which is currently used in the national schools.  Children who have left national school will be recalled, as appropriate, screened and provided with appropriate preventive and primary care dental care treatment for any defect noted in the course of screening.  These children will be provided with emergency treatment to relieve pain on demand.  I have requested each health board to implement the extension as soon as possible having regard to the resources available to the boards.</P>
      <P>The question of a further extension in 1977 will be considered in the context of the funds available to me in that year for the development of dental services. In addition, children over 14 years of age who are dependants of medical card holders are entitled to dental treatment services.  Under the recently introduced dental treatment services scheme, medical card holders and their dependants receive emergency dental treatment to relieve pain through private dental practioners. I intend to introduce routine dental treatment to medical card holders and their dependants in the 16-34 year old age group with effect from 1 April 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I presume the Deputy is referring to the recommendations contained in the study commissioned by Women's Aid on domestic violence entitled <i>Making the Links: Towards an <Col N="1269" /> integrated strategy for the elimination of violence against women in intimate relationships with men.</i></P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report on the findings of the study.  The report seeks to bring to public attention the effects of physical and sexual violence on women and children, and makes important recommendations on how this appalling problem can be tackled.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of appropriate services within the health area for victims of domestic violence. Indeed, the discussion document &ldquo;Developing a Policy for Women's Health&rdquo;, identifies services for victims of domestic violence as one of the priorities for the further enhancement of services to protect women's health.  This document forms the basis for consultation with all those interested in improving the health and welfare of Irish women, including those involved in the provision of services to victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>My Department has provided capital funding for a number of women's refuges and revenue funding for counselling and telephone helpline services for victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>I recognise, however, that the provision of emergency refuge accommodation and other family support services, while necessary, deals only with the symptoms of domestic violence and does not confront the issue of violence itself.  This is a much more complex issue and one which no one Government Department or agency can tackle in isolation.  The nature of the problem calls for a wide ranging inter-agency and interdisciplinary approach.</P>
      <P>I agree, therefore, with the report's recommendations on the need for an interdepartmental policy team to develop an integrated strategy on domestic violence.  My Department will participate fully in the deliberations of an interdepartmental working group. However, I am not convinced that the lead role in such an initiative should rest with the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to learn that in Northern Ireland an interdepartmental <Col N="1270" /> group on domestic violence was chaired by the Department of Economic Development.  Arising from the recommendations of this interdepartmental group, a new regional forum on domestic violence has now been set up in Northern Ireland and is chaired by an independent chairperson.  I feel there would be advantages in giving a central Department responsibility for chairing an interdepartmental group on this issue.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure the implementation, in close co-operation with the member states and relevant organisations, of the range of actions provided for under each of the programmes.  To assist the Commission in this role, a committee consisting of two representatives of each member state and chaired by a representative of the Commission, is established under each programme.</P>

      <P>The consulting engineers for the project agreed the working details with an engineer of the Waterways Service.  A standard indemnity form was completed to indemnify the Commissioners of Public Works against any claims and confirmation of the necessary insurances was also provided.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have on four occasions in this House since October 1995 reaffirmed my commitment to the conservation of the corncrake and to the funding of the corncrake grants scheme.  The last such occasion was on 13 February 1996 and I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 107 on that date.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, the new strategy towards conrcrake protection recently announced by me will see the funding allocated directly by my Department to this area virtually doubled.  This new strategy involves long and medium term arrangements with farmers for corncrake-friendly farming.  Most of these arrangements are expected to be under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS).  Discussions are in progress with conservationists, farmers' representatives, the Department of Agriculture. Food and Forestry and farm planners to agree an appropriate prescription for corncrake-friendly farming.  The measures involved will principally relate to dates of closing of meadows, dates of cutting hay and silage and mowing from the centre out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers who for various reasons do not wish to participate in REPS may be offered a new scheme whereby the portion of the land which contains corncrakes will be purchased by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and <Col N="1280" /> leased back to the farmer to be managed in a corncrake-friendly fashion.  I have allocated £60,000 for this purpose in 1996, to be funded on a 50/50 basis from the Exchequer and the EU Life Fund.</P>
    <P>NPWS staff will be holding public meetings in the areas concerned &mdash; Shannon Callows, North Donegal and the Moy Valley &mdash; to explain these proposals and will also visit farmers who have been involved in the corncrake grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Funding for the corncrake grants scheme, operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and jointly funded to date by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and NPWS, will be continued in 1996 and I have allocated £64,000 for this purpose.  This will bring total funding by the State for this particular scheme to £205,000 since 1992.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of those promoting, or benefiting from the corncrake grants scheme to the substantial benefits, both ecologically to the corncrake and financially to the landowner, of participation in REPS, where grants up to £6,000 per annum are available to landowners.</P>

      <P>A study of the possible impacts of climate change in Ireland has been published by my Department and is available in the Oireachtas Library. National policies and measures to contribute to the mitigation of climate change have been set out in the National CO 2 Abatement Strategy of 1993 and the National Communication under the Framework Convention Climate Change of 1994.  These address <Col N="1287" /> a number of areas including energy, transport, forestry, and waste management.</P>
      <P>Specific measures which have been developed involve promotion of energy conservation and efficiency under the co-ordination of the newly established Irish Energy Centre: promotion of renewable energy sources; demand wide management measures by ESB; improved urban transportation arrangements; increased waste recycling; and an ambitious programme of afforestation to improve such capacity.  It is intended to publish an updated national climate change strategy later this year.</P>
      <P>As regards the EU and international dimension, I intend that the Irish Presidency will provide active co-ordination of the EU position on climate change at the Second Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention in Geneva in July 1996, and subsequently, with a view to strengthening the provisions of the convention in relation to the post-2000 period.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a small number of courses appear in the CAO/CAS Handbook which colleges intend to offer but which have not received full validation or approval prior to publication.  The reason for this is that the colleges are not always in a position to obtain final validation and approval of the planned courses in advance of the publishers deadline which is fifteen months before the commencement date of the courses.  My Department is in regular consultation with the colleges and the NCEA with a view to the ongoing improvement of this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.  There are 40 cars in the ministerial fleet at present; 17 are permanently assigned to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Government Ministers including the Chief Whip and the Minister of State to the Government.  Others are assigned to the President, former Presidents, former Taoisigh, former Ministers for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, and the Ceann Comhairle.  Some 11 vehicles are not specifically allocated to individuals and are used when vehicles are undergoing repairs, maintenance, etc.</P>
      <P>Twelve new vehicles were purchased for the ministerial fleet in 1995 at a cost of £453,600.  It is estimated that the runing cost of the fleet in 1995, including petrol, service, maintenance and repairs was approximately £200,000.  This figure does not include the cost of Garda drivers who work on a week-on week-off basis.  It is anticipated that similar sums to those expended in 1995 will be spent on ministerial transport in 1996.</P>

      <P>In general, I am informed that, when marital breakdown is resolved by way of a separation agreement, the agreement, signed by both parties, is submitted to the Circuit Court which makes the agreement a rule of court.  It is then open to either of the parties to apply to have the agreed maintenance paid through the District Court.  Where such an order is made the District Court will process the payment and enforce the order.  If the order is not made payable through the District Court it is open to either of the parties to apply to the Circuit Court if they consider that the terms of the agreement are not being met.</P>
      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of and decision reached in any court case are matters entirely for the presiding judge.

      <P>The question of rearresting any offender granted early release, whether under the provision of the Offences Against The State Act, 1939, or the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, would depend on the conduct of the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>The question of rearrest would arise if, for example, the individual concerned had already breached his or her conditions of release or there were real grounds for believing that the offender was engaged in activity which was such as to suggest that his or her continued release posed a threat to the community. Rearrest for breach of a condition imposed at the time of release could not of course arise where the original sentence period had expired.  In that event, the question of arrest would fall to be determined by reference to the gravity or otherwise of the new offence, rather than the fact that an (expired) condition had been breached.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 200, 202 and 203 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week, £8 in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks of each year.  The number of recipients of the fuel allowance for the <Col N="1316" /> years 1989 to 1994 are not available on a county by county basis.  In respect of both the fuel allowance and the smokeless fuel allowance, the estimated number of recipients and the expenditure on a national basis is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
    <P>The growth in expenditure over the period may be attributed to a number of factors which has resulted in an increase in the number of recipients. These factors include the introduction, in October 1990, of the smokeless fuel allowance scheme to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.  This allowance, which is paid at the rate of £3 per week to eligible persons, was extended to cover Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995.  Recipients of the £5 fuel allowance may also qualify for this payment; the extension of the fuel allowance scheme to participants on the community employment scheme and to recipients of disabled person's rehabilitation allowance in October 1994; an increase, which took effect from October 1995, in the income limits for the fuel scheme from £5 to £10 per week.  In this year's budget I announced a further £5 increase in the income limit which will take effect from October 1996.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I dealt with this matter in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 23 on 22 February 1996.  In addition I should <Col N="1318" /> point out that in order to qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career. This condition applies to self employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self employed people, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course covered for survivor's and orphan's pensions.</P>
      <P>The 53 per cent of contributions referred to by the Deputy can be refunded in the circumstances outlined in my reply of 22 February 1996.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made for the payment of interest on refunds of contributions due after 1 November 1990.  The rate of interest is equal to the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for each full calendar year after the date the contributions have been made.</P>
      <P>The 47 per cent of the contributions referred to by the Deputy are for the survivor's and orphan's pensions and are not gifts to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The whole question of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions falls to be considered in both the context of the recommendations contained in the final report of the National Pensions Board &mdash;&ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; taking account of the overall future financing of pensions.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 205 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>Exchange rates can fluctuate frequently. In view of this and the fact that a considerable number of Irish non-contributory pensioners are in receipt of British pensions, it would not be practicable to re-assess entitlement to old age non-contributory pension each time currency exchange rates move.  A realistic approach for resolving this problem has therefore been adopted by my Department. When calculating means based upon EU pensions, the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism which is used within the EU in relation to certain social security transactions between member states.</P>
      <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in value of sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR£66 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension and whose means have reduced as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment by the DSS UK at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions, who, for instance, may be waiting for the non-contributory old age pension application to be processed, or who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size <Col N="1320" /> should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre. If the Deputies have a particular case in mind they may wish to give me the details so that it can be investigated to ensure that the claimant is in receipt of his or her full entitlements.</P>

      <P>One of the statutory contribution conditions for entitlement to treatment (dental and optical) benefits from my Department requires an applicant aged between 21 and 66 years to have at least 39 reckonable PRSI contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Of that 39 contributions, at least 13 must be paid contributions.  Alternatively, this condition may be satisfied where the applicant has at least 13 contributions paid in either of the two contribution years preceding the governing contribution year, or a subsequent contribution year, including the year in which PRSI contributions cease to be paid, for example, due to early retirement.</P>
      <P>In practice, therefore, a person who leaves the workforce can retain entitlement to treatment benefit for up to five years after employment ceases.  Where entitlement runs out after that period, it can be restored on receipt of retirement pension at age 65 years.  Furthermore, once qualified at 66 years of age, a person remains qualified for the rest of his or her life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, disability benefit for <Col N="1321" /> more than 12 months, invalidity pension, or retirement pension are exempt from the condition requiring at least 13 paid contributions on the basis that such persons are unable to acquire paid PRSI contributions by virtue of the nature of their payment.  There are certain similarities between those persons and persons who are effectively retired from employment and who are getting credited contributions under the pre-retirement credits scheme.  I will have the matter examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together</P>
      <P>In last January's budget, I announced a number of improvements in the free schemes of telephone rental allowance, electricity allowance and colour television licence.  From next July these schemes will be extended to low income pensioners who do not qualify at present because they do not get a social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>The weekly income limit that is being fixed for this purpose will be the new maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, £75 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30. In determining the income limit for individual pensioners, account will also be taken of any increases, including the over-80 allowance and the living alone allowance, which would have been payable had the pensioner concerned been in receipt of old age (contributory) pension. In this regard, the adult dependant allowance will be determined by reference to age i.e. under or over age 66.</P>
      <P>Pensioners whose net weekly means are under the income limit and who only have access to free travel at present, will now, for the first time, have access to the other free schemes referred to above.</P>
      <P>The free fuel allowance, which is paid to eligible applicants from mid-October to mid-April each year, is not included in these measures.  This allowance is designed specifically to assist qualified householders who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  It is payable only to those dependent on a long-term social welfare or health board payment or similar payment who must satisfy certain &lsquo;living alone&rsquo; conditions and also satisfy a means test.</P>

      <P>The number of people in receipt of carer's allowance at the end of each year from 1992 to 1995 and the associated expenditure in each year is set out in the following table along with the projections for 1996.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  The number of recipients continues to increase, following the improvements in the scheme which I introduced in the 1995 and 1996 budgets. The means testing arrangements were eased considerably with effect from 15 June 1995 and recipients of carer's allowance became entitled to a free travel companion pass.  The rate of payment will be increased by 8 per cent to £67.50 per week from 13 June 1996.  This increase will bring the rate of payment to within 1 per cent of the personal rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 is the primary vehicle for grant-aiding tourism projects.  The programme focuses primarily on the development of top quality tourist attractions and amenities, training and overseas marketing to assist Irish tourism to generate increased visitor numbers and revenue.  The strategy is based on the ability of the market to provide tourist accommodation, catering and other commercially driven facilities in response to increased tourist demand. Accordingly, provisions in the programme to further encourage investment in accommodation are quite limited and operate on a strictly selective basis.  I believe that this is the appropriate approach as the significant increase in tourism revenue in recent years should continue to ensure that market demand will generate a sufficient supply of tourist accommodation without grant assistance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> I am aware that difficulties are being experienced at present in the pig industry, particularly by slaughtering plants in the Border regions in obtaining supplies of pigs.  These difficulties have unfortunately caused the temporary closure of McCarron's in Cavan last week.  My Department has been in touch with Forbairt, and has been informed that detailed discussions are ongoing with this company to see how the problems can be addressed.</P>
    <P>The current difficulties are due to a number of factors.  The pig industry is by its nature cyclical but pig numbers are now on the increase as is shown by the December 1995 CSO Livestock Survey. This shows that pig numbers rose from 1.498 million head in December 1994 to 1.542 million head at the end of December 1995.  However, it will take some months before the increased number of pigs comes through to slaughter stage and supplies should improve in the latter part of this year.</P>
    <P>Another factor in the pig supply situation has been the recent arrival in Northern Ireland of a major pigmeat processing firm which is sourcing some of its supplies south of the Border. Slaughterings in Northern Ireland for the first seven weeks of 1996 are some 4.0 per cent up on slaughterings for the same period in 1995 while the corresponding figure for slaughterings in the South is down by 4.4 per cent.  Processors in Northern Ireland are paying higher prices for the raw material than processors in the South, and naturally producers of pigs will sell at the highest price.</P>
    <P>Under the Single Market rules of the EU it is not possible for me to stop the movement of pigs northwards across the Border.  Member states are also precluded under the common organisation of the market in pigmeat from giving direct national aids.  Therefore, I cannot intervene directly in this matter.  In the past week or so pig prices have started to ease slightly.  The outlook for the industry is good and, as indicated, supplies are expected to become more plentiful in the latter part of the year.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid £1,028.10 under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme on 15 cows.</P>
      <P>He applied for grants under the 1993 and 1994 suckler cow premium schemes under his own herd number.  This herd number was amalgamated with that of his brother in February 1993 because the Department was not satisfied that his holding was being operated as a separate unit.  He was not, therefore, entitled to the suckler cow premium scheme in 1993 or 1994 as milk was being supplied from the holding with a milk quota in excess of 25,638 gallons. An advance amounting to £644.77 under the 1994 suckler cow premium scheme was paid, in error, but has since been recovered.</P>
      <P>The Department is now satisfied that the holding of the person named is being operated separately from his brother's holding and the 1995 suckler cow premium will be paid to him shortly.</P>

      <P>The following table shows the area per county which failed second instalment inspections in the years 1993 to 1995.  Payment of premiums is generally withheld in such cases until the plantations are brought back up to standard.  The table covers second instalment failures under the western package and operational programme schemes 1989 to 1993 under which second instalments of the grant became due from 1993, four years after planting.  The table includes both cases where premiums are payable and cases which do not attract premiums (non-farmers). It should be noted that to pass the second instalment inspection the entire plantation must be up to standard.</P>
      <P>Many of the cases which failed second instalment inspections in the years 1993 to 1995 required filling-in or replacement of plant stock and these would generally not be inspected again until two years after filling-in since this is the time necessary to establish whether the remedial work undertaken has been successful.  In cases where remedial action involves the cleaning of sites or the application of fertilizer the sites can be inspected again on completion of the remedial work.</P>

      <P>In relation to environmental controls on forestry, my Department is currently engaged in discussions with the Department of the Environment in relation to both a reduction of the current thresholds for planning permission and environmental impact assessment for afforestation projects and the introduction of a provision for add-on or incremental forestry development.</P>

      <P>Acid rain is caused by industrial pollution and has not affected forests in Ireland to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Under an annual international Cooperative Programme on the Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects in Forests, monitoring of some 40 plots is carried out by Coillte Teoranta on behalf of my Department in relation to forest health, crown conditions and nutrients.  The results of these forest condition surveys are published annually by the UN-ECE in co-operation with the European Commission and are available for reference.</P>
    <P>Complementary monitoring of forest plots for the EU is also carried out by UCD and includes water deposition, soil waters, throughfall (amount of rainfall through forest) and chemical content. Reports prepared for the EU are available from UCD.</P>
    <P>There has been some recent media comment on a report recently finalised by a study team drawn from UCD, TCD, UCC and Coillte Teoranta.  This study of &ldquo;The Effects of Stream Hydrology and Water Quality in Forested Catchments on Fish and Invertebrates&rdquo; is expected to be published by mid-summer and will have a relevance to the question of water acidification in afforested areas.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the comments made by the chairman of An Taisce who described as unwise his promise to look at an underground option as part of the Dublin light rail system.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a press report of remarks made by the chairman of An Taisce.  Policy in relation to light rail is quite clear.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative recommended that an on-street light rail system should form part of its overall transport strategy for the Greater Dublin Area.  It recommended against an underground system on economic, financial and accessibility grounds.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative strategy has been accepted by the Government as the policy framework for transportation planning in Dublin.  The Operational Programme for Transport, agreed by the Government and the European Commission, makes provisions for an expenditure of £200 million on the implementation of the first phase of the on-street light rail network as recommended by Dublin Transportation Initiative.  The CIE project team is proceeding with its detailed design and consultation work on the basis of these decisions.</P>
      <P>When I launched the public consultation programme on the planned light rail links, I stated that its purpose was to explain the light rail proposals, to listen carefully to any concerns expressed in relation to those proposals and to respond to those concerns where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New legislation will be introduced shortly which, among other things, will provide for a mandatory public inquiry into all aspects of the proposed light rail project.  It will enable people who are <Col N="1341" /> not fully convinced that light rail is the best option to argue their case and have their views considered.</P>
    <P>As I indicated during a recent Seanad debate, any people who have concerns about the light rail proposals should use the opportunities afforded by the public consultation programme and the statutory public inquiry to explain their concerns and have them considered.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the stated policy position on light rail, I (as the responsible Minister) will be obliged by the legislation to fully and objectively consider the inspector's report on the public inquiry and the submissions made by interested parties before making a final decision on CIE's application for the statutory powers to construct light rail. This requirement holds true for all infrastructure projects which are subject to statutory procedures.</P>

      <P>A deepwater exploration licence over six blocks in the Slyne Trough issued in 1993 requires the licencees to drill an exploration well during the first phase of the licence i.e. by 31 December, 1996. The licensees have made firm preparations to drill the well and expect to commence operations by early May.  In addition they plan to drill a further non-obligation well this year under a frontier exploration licence issued in 1994.</P>
      <P>Under a lease undertaking over the Connemara field in the Porcupine Basin the licensees have a commitment to drill an appraisal well in 1996.  However, the licensees have decided to carry out a 3D seismic survey over the area this year with the objective of identifying the optimum location for the well.  The time involved in acquiring, processing and interpreting the data from this survey may not allow sufficient time to drill the well in 1996.  Any postponement would, of course, have to be with the agreement of my Department.</P>

      <P>Almost £21 million (£10.5 million European Regional Development Fund aid) was spent under the Operational Programme on Peripherality 1989-1993 on upgrading the infrastructure of the six regional airports.  As a result these airports now have the capacity to handle anticipated traffic levels to the end of the century and beyond.  The emphasis must now be on attracting additional services and passengers into those airports. Accordingly, no financial provision has been made for regional airports in the Operational Programme on Transport (1994-1999).</P>
      <P>The regional airports are owned and operated by private undertakings. Therefore, the future prospects and development plans for these airports are matters for the individual airport companies. Under an essential air services programme operated by my Department in accordance with EU regulations, a number of the regional airports may benefit from Exchequer-subsidised air services for a period, as a measure to assist such airports and their regions.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to indicate the level of expenditure by other Government bodies, State agencies or local authorities over the period.

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999 some £5.1 million is being made available to help address the serious erosion problem around our coast.  In order to identify projects for possible funding under the Operational Programme, all coastal local authorities were invited to submit details of their top four priority proposals. A number of projects identified by the local authorities have been aided by the Department during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, no works in County Louth have been grant-aided, which is also the position in many other counties.  I am sure the Deputy will fully understand that the funding available in any one year is very limited and as a result it is <Col N="1353" /> only possible to undertake a small number of works in any particular year. Louth County Council's proposals will be considered along with all other priority proposals received, over the remaining years of the Operational Programme.</P>

      <Quest>what plans, if any, he has to obtain a loan from the European Investment Bank similar to that obtained by the authorities in Northern Ireland to upgrade harbour facilities at Killybegs and Burtonport, County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Exchequer and EU investment of some £3 million is planned under this year's Fishery Harbour Capital Programme including completion of the current project at Burtonport.  Works at Killybegs are among the projects being examined for inclusion in the programme, and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on this matter shortly.</P>
      <P>As regards the financing of fishery harbour capital investment, this is handled as an integral part of the Government's total funding programme, drawing on the best available sources and terms, including the European Investment Bank as appropriate.</P>
