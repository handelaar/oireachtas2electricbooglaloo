      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited Brussels on Tuesday, 11 June <Col N="3" /> to have meetings with the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, Prime Minister Prodi of Italy who is the current President of the European Council, Prime Minister Aznar of Spain and the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Klaus Haensch.  In addition, I attended a meeting of the European People's Party where the Heads of Government of Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Malta and Italy were also present.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with President Santer the main topics discussed were the BSE crisis and the Pact for Confidence and Employment proposed by President Santer.  On the BSE crisis, we both agreed the only workable solution would be one that would restore consumer confidence in the beef industry. We also agreed that every effort should be made to resolve the issue in a way that ensures the Florence European Council can fully address the other key items on the Union's agenda.  I assured President Santer of Ireland's broad support for the Confidence and Employment Pact proposed by him.  Consistent with the Conclusions of the Florence Council, we will seek to progress the pact proposals during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The European People's Party meeting included the current EPP Heads of Government.  There was general concern at the meeting that the BSE crisis should be brought to a workable and rapid conclusion based on the restoration of consumer confidence and an early end to the policy of non-co-operation by the United Kingdom.  A public declaration to that effect was issued by the five Heads of Government whose parties are members of the European People's Party.</P>
    <P>The European People's Party meeting also considered the question of how the European public could be engaged more fully with European institutions.  I did not make any public comments on the matter on this occasion.  Various options for bringing the citizen into <Col N="4" /> closer involvement with European business were considered at the meeting. However, as this meeting was a private party meeting, it would not be appropriate for me to report to the Dáil on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach confident we can achieve a resolution of the dispute about BSE and the British blockage of progress before the Florence summit which will be held this weekend or do we face the prospect in the early months of the Irish Presidency of the negotiations on various issues being seriously hampered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware from my replies last week, I am very concerned that the issue should be resolved in advance of the Florence summit, if that is possible, and this is one of the reasons I had the meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, and the subsequent meeting with the President of the Commission and the President of the European Council, Prime Minister Prodi of Italy.  In the course of our discussions we looked at the possibility of having a framework agreed which would be acceptable to all concerned.  As I speak, we have not reached a point where I can be in any way confident that the matter will be resolved, but work is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been various reports in Irish and British newspapers about the framework and I would like the Taoiseach to spell out his understanding of the basis of the framework and the content of it and whether it will be concluded before the Florence summit or at the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was considered at the Foreign Ministers' conclave yesterday.  I do not have a copy of the documentation considered at that conclave and I have not had the opportunity during the short time since the Tánaiste returned to have a detailed discussion with him on the outcome of the conclave.  I would prefer, therefore, not to attempt to answer a question without <Col N="5" /> having full information.  However, I am aware that the Italian Presidency is doing all it can to resolve an extremely difficult problem.  The perceptions of this issue in various countries differ very widely and the view held in Britain about this matter is not held in many other continental countries.  There is a wide gulf of misunderstanding between the various parties here but I am not in a position, for the simple reason of the recency of the meeting in question, to give detailed answers in regard to the possible outline of a framework at this juncture.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach use the opportunity to brief his colleagues on the peace process and the opening of the all-party talks in Northern Ireland last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in general terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why the Taoiseach cannot tell me what took place at the Foreign Ministers' conclave yesterday but I thought he said he had agreed a framework with the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Deputy wishes I will clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking loaded questions, I am simply trying to find out what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is very serious and it is important to be accurate. If I was not accurate then I am glad of the opportunity to correct what I said.  We discussed the concept of a framework and the British put forward the idea of such.  The content of the framework would have to be proposed by the Commission and perhaps be the subject of a compromise devised by the Presidency.  No framework existed last week in documentary form.  There was a meeting of the veterinary group on Friday last which did not reach unanimity on the matter.  The question of a <Col N="6" /> possible framework was discussed yesterday at the Rome conclave of Foreign Ministers.  All I was discussing with my colleagues was the concept and procedure for resolving the difficulty.  The detail and-or content of the framework, or of the steps that might be taken as part of the framework, are matters on which I cannot report in detail to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Taoiseach to use whatever persuasion he and his Government can on the European Council at its meeting on Friday and Saturday next to resolve this issue, which is crippling Irish agriculture, and, if not resolved now, will lead to huge losses for Irish agriculture in the autumn. I am concerned that an issue of such importance as agriculture ends up on the Foreign Affairs agenda.  Indeed I am not too sure of the relationship of BSE or CJD and the cattle crisis in the autumn to foreign affairs issues when, presumably, talks will focus on Bosnia and the Russian elections but I am sure they know more about the matter than I do.  I ask the Taoiseach to use whatever influence he can to resolve this issue before the Florence Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, representing a rural constituency, is very familiar with the position of the beef industry and understands the problem fully.  I take the point the Deputy made on the need to ensure that any solution is technically and scientifically solid and commands consumers' confidence.  There are two issues involved here, first the agreement of a procedure for dealing with the British issue.  Second, there is a wider question, in some respects independent of that, of restoring consumer confidence in beef products generally because, unfortunately, the controversy which has emanated from Britain has done great damage to beef consumption in other countries.  For example, a 40 per cent fall in the consumption of beef in Germany represents a much greater fall <Col N="7" /> of consumption in German beef in Germany than the fall in consumption of British beef in Britain.  The effect of the loss of confidence arising from the difficulties concerning BSE in Britain has been felt disproportionately in other countries.  The difficulty lies in restoring continental European consumers' confidence in beef in general, not just in British beef.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach briefed his colleagues about the peace process, will he brief this House on the outcome of the Government review of contacts between Sinn Féin and the Government and say whether the Government has changed its policy in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not brief my colleagues on the content of today's Government meeting because my meetings with European Leaders took place last week prior to that Government meeting and the Manchester bomb. What I did brief them on was the general approach we were taking in regard to the talks.  I indicated we were happy that the talks had started, that we had reached substantial agreement on procedures and on the Chairman of those talks.  With regard to the Government's consideration of the outcome of the bomb in Manchester and the admission by the IRA of the involvement of some of its units in the events in Adare, a Government statement on that matter will be issued later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to question No. 2, the French Minister for European Affairs who visited here recently said that the Intergovernmental Conference would appear to be heading for a bad start since it had not yet begun.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that statement? Will he say what proposals his Government has for injecting some momentum into the Intergovernmental Conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="8" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined to our colleagues our ambition to ensure that substantial amounts of Treaty language are ready for consideration by the Dublin European Summit toward the end of our Presidency.  We want to see progress on a number of issues on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda. During our Presidency we propose to focus the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on reaching contingent or tentative agreement on Treaty language over a wide range of issues.  Of course, we would like to complete the Treaty-making process during our Presidency but that is unlikely.  Nonetheless we intend to ensure that we go as far as we can in that direction and will have drafted a considerable amount of Treaty language for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Ahern on the matter of BSE, will he agree that the primary objective must be to restore the confidence of consumers throughout Europe on this issue?  Furthermore, does he agree that the revelations on last night's &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; and &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programmes are hardly likely to restore confidence, if their contents become generally known to the people of Europe, since they indicated a great deal of misplaced complacency on the part of the British authorities as to what is happening there in relation to the BSE scare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I already indicated I strongly agree with the first sentiment expressed by Deputy Michael McDowell, that the crucial question is the restoration of consumer confidence.  I also said publicly that will not be restored by political statements or threats.  Consumer confidence in beef will be restored by patience, scientificallybased reassurance and improved systems of quality control &mdash; something very important in itself &mdash; in fact more important than the present type of political consideration being allowed enter into this debate as between Britain and some of our other European partners.  I <Col N="9" /> did not see the programmes on BSE to which the Deputy referred.  I would prefer not to comment on programmes I did not see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the heavy schedule of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, is the Taoiseach aware of the disappointment on the part of the Iranian authorities that a meeting of the Joint Commission, of which the Tánaiste and Mr. Velyati are co-Chairmen, has not been possible?  Is he aware that one method by which matters could be advanced is the convening of a meeting between the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and Mr. Velyati's Deputy, ensuring that that market is reopened more expeditiously given its importance to the beef processing industry?  Will the Taoiseach give the House an undertaking that he will take up the matter with the Tánaiste and, bearing in mind his forthcoming busy schedule during our Presidency, arrange for the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to have a meeting with his counterpart in Iran to advance the many issues, including beef, the Iranians would like to discuss with us in the advent of our Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While that is an interesting, constructive suggestion, it does not arise directly in the context of the questions tabled to me today.  My meetings were with Leaders of continental European countries, I was not involved in any meetings with Iran, but I have taken note of what the Deputy has said, will consider it carefully and discuss it with the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 3, since the Taoiseach had a number of high level meetings with European Heads of State, did his proposal for the direct election of a Commissioner or President with a higher status than the European Council &mdash; which I note is not repeated in the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy &mdash; receive any significant support among other Heads <Col N="10" /> of Government?  Indeed the arguments contained in that document were against the delicate institutional balance of the Union.  Is this the Taoiseach's proposal, that of his party or of Government and what does he intend to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As leader of my party and a member of the Christian Democratic family of parties in Europe, a group that has among its membership five or six prominent European leaders, I expressed views on this matter at party meetings.  Any proposals I put forward on introducing more citizens' involvement in the selection of prominent persons involved in European affairs were made in a party, not a governmental context.  Comments I made in that regard were clearly made in a party not in a governmental capacity.</P>
      <P>I accept the introduction of a new elective element in any area for any institution will affect the balance of influence and power between institutions. In discussions with my colleagues I have been careful to draw that to their attention because it is a potential difficulty concerning any proposal in this area.  It might also be acknowledged that unlike the United States, where citizens, irrespective of where they live, are directly involved in the selection of one federal officer once every four years and have a sense of direct personal involvement, that does not exist in Europe and that is a deficiency.  I am not certain as to the best way to remedy that deficiency, but in the context of a broadranging debate that is possible in a European political party, it is not unreasonable to discuss these matters in a general way.  In recent discussions with my colleagues I suggested several options, not only the one to which the Deputy referred, which might be considered by my party colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach does not speak as the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, does not speak as the Minister of State, and Ministers and Ministers of State speak as <Col N="11" /> individuals.  This is a fairly new concept that appears to have been introduced under the principles of openness, transparency and accountability.  There is not a democratic deficit given that national governments are elected more often than every four years and they, in turn, appoint Commissioners.  Is the Taoiseach unaware of the benefits gained by this country from the present institutional balance between the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Parliament and that we should be loath to make suggestions which would play into the hands of those who would want to damage the Commission's strong initiation power which has been of great benefit to a small member state of the Union, like Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the balance of power and influence between the institutions is not only good for this country but for the European Union.  It has the effect of ensuring there is specific responsibility for initiative in one place and for disposal of decisions in another.  That balance is quite good in many respects, but most people who reflect on the position of Europe at present would recognise, as was shown in referenda in various countries and might well have been evident here were it not for the fact that the financial benefits this country derives from the European Union are so great, that there is a sense that the ordinary citizen does not have much direct say or input into European decisionmaking. Citizens elect members of the European Parliament, but I am sure the Deputy will recollect that frequently European elections are fought on national rather than European political issues and a direct sense of voting on a European platform is not available to the average citizen.  That creates something of a democratic deficit and is a problem that it is appropriate for parties to discuss.  The Deputy can discuss it with his European allies who may have a different view from my European <Col N="12" /> allies, but that is all to the good in terms of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10 April 1996, I wrote to the Deputy and to the Leader of Fianna Fáil enclosing a document setting out the Government's proposals on the establishment of the all-party committee. In the document it was suggested the committee might bring forward an interim report on specific sections of the Constitution in early 1997 and a full and final report as soon as possible thereafter.  In my further letters of 30 May to the Deputies, I stated that when the committee met, it could consider its programme of work, including the possibility of interim reports.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it will be a matter for the committee to determine its programme of work.  While I am confident it will be expeditious in its deliberations, I do not wish to set a time for the completion of its work other than what I have already stated.</P>

      <P>In his report the Attorney General outlined the progress which has been made in a number of areas including the ongoing development of computer-based systems for use within his office.</P>
      <P>One of the main needs identified by the review group was the need for a case and correspondence tracking system. This means the development of a system which allows senior management to review new cases as they arrive, to allocate the work as appropriate and to monitor its subsequent progress.  It is intended that the Attorney General's office will develop the system in phases, with expert assistance from the centre for management and organization development of the Department of Finance. This approach facilitates the introduction of information technology in an incremental manner and delivers clear benefits at each stage to the office. Phase I, implemented in September 1995, provided the office with a case tracking system and has had an immediate impact on the office.  The system is in the process of ongoing refinement and development in light of experience with its operation.</P>
      <P>Phase 2, implemented earlier this month, and subsequent phases will further enhance the tracking capabilities within the office and its ability to respond to external queries.</P>
      <P>I expect that a fully operational system will be in place in the first quarter of 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of items of correspondence received in 1996 by the office of the Attorney General up to and including 14 June was 7,098.  This figure includes all correspondence from Government Departments and offices as well as correspondence received from the general public.  However, correspondence received in relation to the work <Col N="15" /> of the parliamentary draftsman, that is, the drafting of Bills is not included in this figure.</P>
    <P>The average time taken to acknowledge receipt of correspondence is one day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 5 of the report of the review group report on implementation makes the point that there is serious concern about the level of administrative and secretarial facilities in the office of the Attorney General.  Has this matter been rectified?  The report goes on to say that it is causing major problems in dealing with the workload in that office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this problem and it is receiving attention.  It is a matter which must receive attention in the context of available resources, but priority as far as possible is being given to the office of the Attorney General and to the law offices of the State generally with regard to the provision of adequate secretarial backup, which has been neglected over a number of years. However, the House will agree that the introduction of the latest information technology to the office will enable the staff to work to better effect than was possible in the absence of such technology.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the same report points out that one of the problems the office of the Attorney General now faces is 2,500 deafness claims in respect of Army personnel which are apparently being processed through the courts on an individual basis?  Would he not agree that if a huge volume of claims of that order is going to be dealt with by the office on a case by case basis there is much sense in the argument for setting up a compensation system which does not involve individual cases and High Court proceedings along the lines of the hepatitis C and other claims?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Price Waterhouse have been asked to conduct a review of the appeals procedures currently in operation for the leaving certificate examination.  This is the first such external review of these procedures that have ever taken place. I should await its recommendations before deciding on any significant change to the present system of appeals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reply.  The purpose of the Price Waterhouse report was to investigate the errors discovered in the art examination last year where the practical work of 51 students went missing and this was not discovered, even at recheck stage.  The purpose of my question was to ask if we should have an independent State examinations appeals board.  The Minister should be in a position to give her views on this.  With regard to the most recent development on the honours mathematics second paper, the Department issued a statement acknowledging the error in the <Col N="18" /> paper, saying it will arrange to deal with the matter in the context of the marking of that paper.</P>
      <P>There is no transparency in terms of how the Department will deal with an error of this type.  How will the Department assess the impact on the students who sat the examination?  What criteria will be used?</P>

      <P>The purpose of the report was to investigate major errors that occurred last year.  We are now well into the operation of this year's State examinations. The students sitting these examinations will not have the benefit of an independent examination appeals system given the length of time it has taken Price Waterhouse to carry out the Minister's request.  It has taken far too long and it is wrong for the Minister to hide behind the report.  Will she indicate when Price Waterhouse will have concluded its work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with the rechecking of papers.  Last year people got marks even after the recheck stage, despite the fact that 25 per cent of their <Col N="19" /> papers went missing and were never found.  This critical situation has led to the lack of public confidence in our system. Will any system be in place for the marking and rechecking of papers of students who are sitting this year's examinations?</P>

      <P>In answering Questions Nos. 35, 43 and 56 today I will be informing the House that I received the Price Waterhouse report on the leaving certificate art examination last Friday.  I am studying the report.  There are constraints regarding the publication of the report in full but I intend to make the full report available to each Member of the Dáil and Seanad next week when the leaving certificate examination concludes.</P>
      <P>It is important that we keep in mind that there is an appeals procedure in place with which the schools are familiar. It is one under which the scripts are fully rechecked where requests for appeals have been accepted.</P>

      <P>That appeals procedure is in place.  I asked Price Waterhouse to examine the difficulties that arose out of the art examination last year and the mistakes that were made and to look not only at the appeals procedure for art or crafts but for all subjects of the leaving certificate.  I look forward to receiving the report and to considering its recommendations.  I commissioned the report.  I gave Price Waterhouse the terms of reference with a view to retaining confidence in the examination system and to express our willingness to respond where human error has occurred.

      <P>On the afternoon of 14 May 1996 I received a report from my officials on the outcome of an investigation into this matter conducted jointly by my Department and Iarnród Éireann.  I reported the outcome to the House later that day. In my statement to the House I explained that an assorted delivery of 27 packages addressed to the Department was checked by Iarnród Éireann at Athlone railway station and then placed on a truck for delivery to my Department's Athlone office.  On arrival at the Athlone office the itemised consignment was signed for as a unit.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the House that arising from this incident the Department and Iarnród Éireann would be consulting further.  The consultations included a review of the check-in procedures for deliveries by Iarnród Éireann which have now been revised and strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> This year, for the first time, the leaving certificate results will be accompanied by a statement for any candidate whose result in a multiple component subject does not contain credit for all mandatory parts of the subject. This is a timely innovation in the leaving certificate results issue system. This new supplementary statement will effectively provide the candidate with a guarantee that the grade awarded reflects all components submitted by the candidate.  The information provided will empower the candidate to confirm for himself or herself that any essential component missing in a result can be attributed to genuine absence.  This is a final fail-safe mechanism designed to secure the system and make it safer than ever before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's fail-safe mechanism is farcical.  Most students would like a complete result, not a statement to the effect that there is not a complete result because somebody did not correct a portion of the examination paper.  We are trying to get away from a situation where portions of examination papers are not corrected.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the procedures that were in place?  Can she outline why a parcel containing the practical work of eight students from a school in Kilmuckridge, County Wexford, was not signed for as a parcel in its own right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the practice to do that.  It is now the practice that itemised parcels are signed for.  In dealing with subjects where there are multiple components it happens, not too infrequently, that some students do not sit the practical elements of the examination. The art and craft examination last year only had one part in the answer which was the total mark.  On the engineering examination, missing components would have been missed because the technology that has been in placing for logging in the information on the engineering examination would have highlighted the absence of those <Col N="22" /> components.  That system will also be in place for the 1996 art and craft examination students.</P>
      <P>We should keep a sense of balance regarding this.  An enormous logistical operation is going on at this time.  The scale of it means mistakes occur.  The responsibility of the Minister is to ensure that where mistakes occur they are fully and openly addressed and that the risk of recurrence is minimised.  I acknowledge the work of the teachers and of Department officials as they work through what has to be done at this time.  I said last month when some of this emerged, and I will repeat it again in the last few days of the public examination system, that our duty is to maintain confidence in the system and ensure that the students take their examination in as calm an atmosphere as possible.  If we put into perspective the small number of errors that have occurred this year, greater ones last year that have now been fully investigated and absences that happened in the past, we are looking at a system where the Department of Education and the teaching profession are working together to ensure that as more technology becomes available to us, as greater numbers of students take the examination, they are doing it under a system that is getting all the supports that are necessary.  We cannot legislate for human error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister has admitted today that proper procedures were not in place for the checking in of this material.  Given what happened last year in the art examination where 51 parcels went missing and have still not been discovered &mdash; we await the Price Waterhouse report to tell us whether the work is still missing &mdash; surely the Minister <Col N="23" /> should have tightened up procedures this year to ensure, at the minimum, proper checking in and checking out and that the trucks carrying these very important packages should not have gaping holes on their sides such as allowed a package to fall off on the way to Roscommon, to be discovered later in a bog by a worker.  We are talking about leaving certificate papers which are very important to the future of the students sitting that examination, but the Minister lectures me and others about the integrity of the public examination system.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister has failed to guarantee the integrity of the system of handling and delivering packages of this nature.</P>

I am confident that with the improvement in technology and the investment that has been made by my Department in the examinations branch, we will be able to put in further fail-safe systems to ensure that where human error occurs that error will be detected and no student will suffer. Iarnród Éireann has now agreed that no canvas-sided trucks will be used to deliver examination papers from the railway station to the examinations branch.  That is a new response to the problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 232 together. Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector, bringing the total number of teachers in primary schools to 1,188.  Eighty seven per cent of all pupils in primary schools now have access to a remedial teacher.  I have also approved the allocation of an additional 98 ex-quota remedial posts to second-level schools since I took office, bringing to 350 the total number of ex-quota posts at second-level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have achieved in <Col N="27" /> this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.  However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the school to which she refers is among those which were invited to apply for inclusion in this initiative.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the question I tabled?  I asked whether she would be appointing remedial teachers this year.  I did not want to know the number of remedial teachers appointed in recent years or how successful she has been in fiddling around with the demographic dividend. I asked whether remedial teachers would be appointed this year but since she has not replied to that I assume she will not be appointing remedial teachers this year.  Will she explain how she can justify this, given that educational disadvantage encompasses the need for remedial education?</P>

      <P>Intervention in education includes remedial reading but it also includes much more.  I refer the Deputy to my initiative Breaking the Cycle.  I asked the Combat Poverty Agency together with the Educational <Col N="28" /> Research Centre to review the targeting, including the remedial reading service, to ensure that as increasing resources were being put into areas of disadvantage those resources would be used wisely.  The Combat Poverty Agency and Education Research Centre published a report which was put into the public arena.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was concerned at the level of disadvantage in very small rural schools.  These are very difficult to target, given their size and the distances between schools.  I know the Deputy is referring to the Laghey national school, which has an enrolment of 81 pupils and there are other schools in the area with even smaller numbers.  When we came to deal with smaller schools, which might have only a handful of pupils, I had a vision of remedial teachers driving around the byroads and high roads, spending more time on the road than in the classroom&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it was a nightmare.  Due to the concern about the level of disadvantage in rural areas, I have accepted the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency to further target our resources, which is a completely new initiative in rural areas. Such schools will qualify on the basis of their size alone.  Disadvantage is easier to locate in urban areas than in rural ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a cluster of small schools which will be selected for special report.  Each cluster will have 300 to 350 pupils in groups of schools with fewer than five teachers.  We will be looking at co-ordinating teachers, special funding and special training.  The criteria will be extended with new headings because there have been difficulties about the criteria for disadvantage in rural communities.  The Education Research Centre devised the application form.  The scheme has been <Col N="29" /> advertised and schools have been asked to apply.</P>
    <P>The schools will be given services to meet the needs of those who prior to this were getting reading lessons but required more rounded resources, which is sometimes quite difficult to provide with very small numbers.  I am satisfied that, given the number of remedial teachers we have put into the service and the coming on stream of a new service, we will meet the needs of the children concerned.  I take it the Deputy tabled the question on behalf of the pupils whose needs were not being met in very small, dispersed rural communities.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not reply to my question.  I did not want to know about the disadvantaged status. She spoke about targeting.  I want to know how many remedial teachers will be appointed in September 1996.  The Minister took this question with Question No. 232 which refers to a school in my constituency which has needed a remedial teacher for ten years for children with special needs.  Will the Minister appoint remedial teachers in September?</P>

I reassure schools in the disadvantaged scheme that help will continue to be provided and that there will be a more targeted approach.  We expect to break the cycle of disadvantage, rather than just providing a few &ldquo;smarties&rdquo; every year.  We are asking schools to draw up a plan where, with the Department and the extra resources which have been made available, they will be able to expect that children will not be disadvantaged when they leave school but will have benefited from this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a radical scheme which has been warmly welcomed by those concerned about disadvantage in education.  I ask Deputies to allow this scheme to go into operation next September without any disruption.  I have committed myself and <Col N="32" /> the education research unit in Drumcondra to monitoring the effects of this scheme so that I, and the Ministers who follow me, will be able to tell this House about the improvements for children who up to this, particularly in rural areas, were lucky to get a couple of hours a week with a remedial reading teacher.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to recommend to Government the withdrawal of the Supreme Court appeal in the case in question.  I understand the appeal will not be heard by the Supreme Court before the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judgment raises issues of constitutional relevance, primarily to do with the separation of the powers and duties of the Executive and judicial arms of Government and the appropriate <Col N="33" /> relationship between the two.  These are constitutional matters of the utmost importance, having a relevance across the entire spectrum of State activities. The Government has been advised by counsel and the Attorney General that the Supreme Court, which has the ultimate role in interpreting the Constitution, should, in the public interest, be asked to consider these aspects of the judgment.  It is on this basis that an appeal has been lodged.</P>
    <P>The appeal, however, when it is resolved, will not in any way diminish the services made available, after this judgment, to the child involved or to other children with special education needs.  The appeal is being pursued entirely without prejudice to the present level of education services in the special needs area.  It is also entirely without prejudice to the proposals set out in the White Paper on the future development of such services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The perception on the ground is very different from that presented by the Minister.  The perception is that the appeal to the Supreme Court is to frustrate the positive implications of the High Court judgment for children with special needs.  Why has the Minister not taken steps to implement the positive aspects of its decision, the central element of which is that a profoundly handicapped child is incapable of being educated to the fullest degree possible?  Why have we not seen consequential improvements in terms of resources and the allocation of teachers to special schools and so forth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Deputy has no idea of the major improvements which have been made since I became Minister.  Prior to the High Court judgment in the O'Donoghue case children with profound and severe mental handicap enjoyed a pupil-teacher ratio of 12:1.  Child care support was provided at a similar ratio.  Significant improvements have been made since then.  The pupil-teacher and child <Col N="34" /> care assistant ratio is now 6:1.  The number of classes has increased from 19 to 55.  The special capitation rate in respect of these children has increased from £92.70 in 1993 to £341 in the current year and will be increased to £383 in the 1996-97 school year.  For Paul O'Donoghue and the other children attending the COPE Foundation in Cork an extended education service is provided throughout the month of July.</P>
      <P>I have sought to have the report of the special education review committee published.  I can list the improvements which benefit not only children with profound and severe mental handicap but other children suffering disadvantage. The question is timely because it allows me an opportunity of informing the Deputy of these improvements.  If he were to visit the many schools which provide services to children in this category, he would be left in no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a pity the Minister was not there in one respect because she would have witnessed the incredible anger and frustration of the parents of children with special needs.  Their anger was most palpable. They were extremely angry at the lack of progress and the fact that the decision was being appealed to the Supreme Court.  They were not positive in any way about what the Minister and the Department have been doing in terms of providing increased resources <Col N="35" /> for special schools and children with special needs generally.</P>
      <P>There was a large attendance at the meeting.  It was a very angry meeting and public representatives from all parties witnessed that anger.  They could not have come away from it with any sense that major progress had been made.  Would the Minister be prepared to meet the Cork groups concerned?  It is my understanding that Government Deputies were to arrange such a meeting but to my knowledge none has taken place.

The capitation grant is to be increased to £383 from next September. It was £92 when I became Minister.  The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced from 12:1 to 6:1.

I am sorry to hear that the parents of children with specific needs are concerned that the improved investment in schools which is very evident is under threat.  Not only will there be improvements now but more improvements will come on stream.  It would help everyone if a full itinerary of the improvements was made available.  This will not prejudice the outcome of the Supreme Court ruling.  It is being pursued because there are concerns about the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Executive and the right of the Government to decide how resources are allocated. I have been advised to say no more about the court case except to assure Deputies and parents that they should not be concerned.  My record in the Department of Education is good in regard to the provision of services for children with special needs.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 18, 20, 24, 26, 31, 38, 45, 51, 59 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I am very aware of the problems being reported by school authorities and teachers.  However, there is a shortage of objective information in this area and, as Deputies will appreciate, this is an area where perceptions can be very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have commissioned a research project on discipline in primary and second-level schools.  This study will identify the extent of discipline problems in the education system.  It will also identify models of good practice in the maintenance <Col N="41" /> of discipline in schools.  I expect to receive the report on the study by the end of the year.  This report will be discussed with the partners in education and will provide a valuable input in the review of the existing guidelines.</P>
    <P>As far as the present position is concerned the managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in their schools.  The Department, through the in-career development unit, provides support towards courses for teachers in the areas of classroom management and discipline.  These courses are organised mainly by the teacher unions &mdash; the INTO and the ASTI.</P>
    <P>Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up a code of discipline appropriate for that school.  To assist schools in this process, guidelines on school behaviour and discipline were issued to all schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On my travels throughout the country meeting parents and teachers generally, I noted concern about the increasing levels of indiscipline in schools and the degree to which it is impacting on the delivery and provision of a sound educational programme. Many teachers are at a loss in dealing with the problem.  When I tabled a similar question more than a year ago the research project on discipline was announced.  We are awaiting its publication for a long time.  Following publication it is important that its recommendations be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a specific point, is the Minister concerned about the increasing number of suspensions and expulsions, particularly at second level, with the result that many children aged 12, 13 and 14 unfortunately end up on the streets? There is no safety net to pick them up, and there is very little referral to psychological services.  Has the Minister any data available to her Department <Col N="42" /> about the number of expulsions and the indefinite suspensions in our schools?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny there is a problem.  In primary schools a pupil cannot be struck off the roll and in secondary schools a pupil under 15 years of age cannot be expelled.  Sometimes, department officials and inspectorate have to bring that matter to the attention of boards of management.  The research project is nearing completion. Guidelines on school behaviour and discipline have been in place since 1991.  It is important those guidelines are reviewed in light of the research which will be available to the partners in education. The Deputy must remember that the level of misbehaviour and trouble is higher in some schools than others. Research and good codes of practice are necessary and the Government is prepared to make necessary resources available to teachers to help them draw up a relevant code of discipline. However, this should be done when the research is complete and following consultation with the partners in education, including the managerial bodies.</P>
      <P>It is worth reminding the House that primary school pupils and second level students under 15 years of age may not be expelled.  There are programmes such as Youthreach for students over the age of 15 years although they are not always available countrywide.  I look forward to accepting the research carried out by St. Patrick's College, Maynooth on discipline in primary and second level schools.  This will be completed this year and I expect it will then be discussed with managerial bodies, teachers and parents.  A review of the existing guidelines, based on the research, is timely.  If changes are based on the research, it will be possible to meet a problem which appears to be growing in some areas.</P>

      <P>Does the Government have any plans to amend and update the truancy legislation?  This dates back to <Col N="43" /> 1926 and is, by common consent, grossly outdated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept it is not necessary to wait for the results of research to acknowledge there is a severe problem regarding the breakdown of discipline in schools?  Teachers are bringing forward this information and they can suggest a solution without the depth of analysis the Minister claims to require.  Teachers say they are not receiving necessary support; for example, there is no school psychological service at primary level.  If there is a behavioural or indiscipline problem in a school, it can take up to three years for a child to receive psychological assessment. Will the Minister admit this greatly contributes to the problems of indiscipline in primary schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Children with behavioural problems contribute to difficulties in schools.  However, this issue is guided by perception at present.  The ASTI asked that the research project, which I announced, should be completed. This research has a positive role to play because there is already a code of behaviour.  When an indiscipline difficulty in a school is brought to my attention, it is interesting to ask about the management of the discipline code in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code of discipline was put in place in 1991 and I have reason to believe it works reasonably well in a large number of schools.  The research project was established to respond to a need to update the guidelines and to examine and produce statistics on the level of the existing problem.  Another aspect of the project is to make available information on good codes of practice to schools through boards of management and managerial bodies to <Col N="44" /> enable a code of behaviour to be drawn up in partnership.</P>
    <P>This approach worked well in terms of a dress code for the school examinations this year.  There were no headlines this year about this matter; no cases arose in County Donegal.  Everything went well because, in response to a difficulty which arose last year regarding dress during examinations, it was possible with the managerial bodies, teacher unions and parents to devise a code which was acceptable and flexible enough to be put into practice in schools.  It should be noted that nobody was under threat of expulsion from an examination on the basis of dress this year.  This was a major news item last year.</P>
    <P>A good practice exists in the Department and there is a good relationship between union officers, parents' associations representatives and managerial bodies.  All those involved come together in a number of committees and bring forward codes of behaviour.  The Deputy suggested some teachers feel isolated if problems arise in the classroom, but the guidelines are not imposed by the managers at the top and then ignored.  It would be wise to allow the research project to be completed.  At that stage it should not be considered in terms of ministerial advice and issuing a dictum, rather that we can move forward in the same manner as last year regarding a less disruptive problem.  The partners involved in resolving that issue will be the same partners involved in drawing up a revised code of practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be aware that suspensions and expulsions of children aged up to 15 years in second level schools are taking place. Many boards of management may make the point that, while the State has a duty to provide children up to the age of 15 years with an education, the manner in which it is provided is a different matter. Schools are expelling students under the age of 15 years.  They may refer them to youth services or a youth project, but, unfortunately, those children invariably <Col N="45" /> do not end up on the schemes and they fall through the net.</P>

      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not be complacent in relation to children aged up to 15 years, particularly in the post primary sector.  No safety net exists in the system to cater for children who must be removed from classrooms because they are disrupting the education of the class.  However, these children also have individual rights and must receive care.  No safety mechanism is in place to care for such children and to help them reintegrate in the mainstream system in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I am aware of the situation.  However, at times, I question whether all schools and parents are aware that legal consequences can arise if a pupil under 15 years is expelled and an alternative placement in another school has not been secured.  The Department of Education's inspectorate spends time with parents and schools dealing with this issue.  The Department is aware of the problem because it is brought sharply to its attention when people feel all else has failed.  It is timely to remind people of rule 130 in the primary school rules and the legal obligation on second level schools but this does not take from the fact, as the Deputy mentioned, that some pupils need specific care and attention.  The intention is that the Department will be in a position to respond to their needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister shielded herself with the Supreme Court on the last occasion.  On this occasion she is shielding herself with a study, as she has done in relation to many questions in the past.  The Minister said she is aware of the difficulties, but this matter has been ongoing for a number of years and the difficulties in schools are escalating.  Is the Minister satisfied with the current <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement <Col N="46" /> between schools regarding indiscipline? While such an arrangement was fine for a small number of pupils, the problem is increasing and the arrangement itself poses a difficulty.  I concur with Deputy Martin that in many cases boards of management act outside the law.</P>
      <P>In reply to a recent question I put to the Minister on the extent of bullying in schools she indicated there was not a system in place for reporting such incidents to the Department.  If she could deal effectively with truancy, which has a direct link with lawlessness, and implement a reporting system on bullying, effective short-term action could be taken on matters that are fundamental to the proper organisation and running of our schools.</P>

      <P>I commissioned research on this matter so that we would not have to make guesstimations on whether the problem is accelerating or whether some schools have more problems than others.  I support the need for proper Irish research in this area and it will be completed.  The people who run the schools will have access to this information and we will then be able to draw up guidelines on a code of practice for schools.  Research on bullying has been carried out and we have compiled reports.  The Minister has responsibility for some areas, but boards of management are responsible for the running of their schools.  The guidelines on bullying issued by the Department were actively implemented by boards of management in co-operation with teachers and parents and as a result time spent at school has improved for some children.</P>

      <P>The Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education was asked to examine &ldquo;within the overall national context... the needs for higher education on a regional basis...&rdquo;  One of the specific areas examined was north, north west and the north east Dublin region where the steering committee recommended Blanchardstown as the appropriate location for the establishment of a new regional technical college for the area.</P>
      <P>In response to the recommendations in the report I have already announced the provision of 6,200 additional places in the university sector over the next five years.  These places will involve a capital investment of £60 million to be provided by equal contributions of public and private sector funding.  This initiative represents the first stage in the implementation of the steering committee's report.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have begun consultations with the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges regarding the change of title for these colleges as recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>I am giving further consideration to the steering committee's recommendations, including those relating to the Dublin region, with my colleagues in Government over the next few months.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister acknowledged the recommendation, but there is little else about which to be encouraged in the response to date. While Dublin north west benefits from the expansion of DCU, the recent review of participation rates at third level indicates that rates in that area are particularly low.  This affects large numbers of young people in Finglas and Ballymun. Vast areas in Dublin west are badly in need of such a facility.  Will the Minister indicate when the planning stages of such a project will commence? I hope it is not necessary to appoint a Minister in the area to get a third level <Col N="49" /> institution there.  If that is the case, I will volunteer.  Will a sod be turned for this development before the next election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>I received recommendations from the Higher Education Authority which I asked to report on the future development of third level education.  The steering committee was chaired by Noel Lindsay, the chairperson of the Higher Education Authority, and represented all the social partners. It was served by a technical working group chaired by Dr. Gerry Sexton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which recommended Finglas as an appropriate site. However, when the technical working group presented its work to the steering committee it considered that Blanchardstown, while less well placed than Finglas in terms of adequacy to deprived city areas, had the advantage of location within the major areas of population growth and favoured a site in that area.  A site will be reserved in Blanchardstown until 1997 when a decision must be taken on whether it will be used for the development of an educational facility or revert to the contractor of the main town centre in Blanchardstown. While it may be timely to take the steering committee's recommendations to Government, they involve large investment and the current capital programme which requires an annual investment of £55 million to the year 2000 does not include the bricks and mortar for a third level college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the level of activity on third level institutions at Trinity College, DCU, Tallaght, Cathal Brugha Street and the Aungier Street site.  Investment proposed for third level institutions in the national plan is now being spent.  The Higher Education Authority is considering another phase for the development of third level institutions, under which Blanchardstown <Col N="50" /> will be included.  I will bring to Government the recommendations of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my colleague, Deputy Ahern, is anxious to intervene to support the case for the area.  While I appreciate there has been substantial investment in the university sector and the DCU is benefiting, a significant number of students would move more easily from second to third level education via the regional technical colleges. I am sure the Minister is aware that, despite the excellent work done by post-leaving certificate colleges in my area, the participation rate study indicates that students from that area have to travel to Dundalk, Athlone and further afield to attend regional technical colleges.  Participation rates in the area are well below the national average. Given the Minister's commitment to social disadvantage, she should direct her efforts to finding the resources to bring forward this project so that the college will be built before the turn of the century.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's support.  There has been great investment in the Dublin Institute of Technology sector, as is evident from the skyline of Dublin at present.  There is ongoing investment in the Tallaght regional technical college and work is beginning on the Dún Laoghaire regional technical college. While there is projected growth in student numbers, there are hefty resource implications for accepting the recommendations, which I will discuss with my Government colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary <Col N="51" /> that the Minister is not giving this project the degree of priority recommended by the Higher Education Authority. From the steering committee's report on the provision of third level education in the Dublin region it is clear that the north-west is the area of greatest need and has the greatest degree of disadvantage in terms of participation in third level education.  I am surprised the Minister has made no decision in principle to go ahead with this project.  She has put Dún Laoghaire, Tralee and other areas ahead of this.  I suggest that political considerations are more important in terms of disadvantage in third level education in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Martin's views.  Will the Minister list the first six locations as recommended by the steering committee?  Has area number one, the north-west area, received funding, or have other areas which are of a lesser priority, including the Minister's constituency, been given the go ahead?</P>

      <P>Decisions on Dún Laoghaire and Thurles were taken prior to the request by me to the Higher Education Authority to bring forward a steering committee report.  I do not have a copy of the report but I will make it available to the Deputies.  Recommendations were made in that report on third level places and we have been able to respond with partnership investment in securing 200 places.  Other recommendations made relate to change of title; plans for projected growth &mdash; student numbers are given and capital resources &mdash; recurrent funds are sought; a balance between degrees and sub-degrees; provision for the Dublin region through the establishment of a college in Blanchardstown; negotiation and special links with the Dublin Institute of Technology, DCU and TCU; strengthening links with PLC programmes; expanding Tallaght college to accommodate 3,000 students; expanding Waterford college and improving equality measures.  There is a long list of recommendations, but I <Col N="52" /> would prefer not to be associated with taking decisions in principle when I do not have the necessary resources to deliver on promises made in the past. There are resource implications to accepting the recommendations, which I will bring to Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to consider a proposal from this side of the House.  When a Bill comes before the House the Opposition, and outside groups, are normally given 14 days to consider the legislation.  In this case the Bill has been before the House and was defeated.  That is only the second occasion since the foundation of the State a Bill has been defeated, and the first defeat of a Government Bill; on the other occasion, in 1976, there was a free vote.  This Bill was defeated not just because people were missing for the vote but because of a lack of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On two occasions last week on the Order of Business I requested that the proposal put forward by our Whip be considered.  The Taoiseach stated on Thursday morning he was in the process of considering the proposal and he would come back to us on it.  I found out subsequently that on Wednesday the Minister's first reaction was to bring forward the Bill again this week without any amendment.  He changed his mind in that regard following advice &mdash; I will <Col N="240" /> not speculate from where &mdash; that he should make some cosmetic changes. He did that and the Bill was presented on Friday.  I did not see the Bill until the latter part of the weekend but my colleague examined it on Friday evening.  We have not had any opportunity to consult the outside groups that had lobbied and put forward their views &mdash; whether or not one agrees with them &mdash; over the past months.</P>
    <P>I do not have any objection to the commencement of this legislation today but I ask the Taoiseach to leave the remainder of the Second Stage debate until next week.  If that were done, those of us on this side of the House would have an opportunity to consult on the Bill in the coming days and we would make sure the Minister had the Bill in its entirety before the House adjourns in early July.  I ask the Taoiseach to agree to my request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the way in which the Deputy has approached the matter.  I have carefully considered the timetable put forward by his party which would involve postponing the completion of Second Stage until next week.  The difficulty with the proposal is that we need to get the Bill into Committee in sufficient time to allow Report Stage to be subsequently taken and for the Bill to go to the Seanad.  If any amendments arise in the Seanad, the Dáil would still be in session and in a position to deal with them.  We do not want to be in a position where Seanad amendments cannot be made because the Dáil is not in session to affirm them. The Deputy's proposal would, by virtue of the lapse of time, exclude the possibility of Seanad consideration being meaningful on the matter.  As this is a bicameral system we must be able to ensure that the Seanad amendments can be taken into account also.  That is the reason, and the only reason, for the timetable we have put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the points the Deputy has made but I would say to him in response that the proposal the Government is making involves taking Second <Col N="241" /> Stage today, starting, but not concluding, Committee Stage next Thursday &mdash; Committee Stage would be taken in Committee the following Tuesday also &mdash; and having Report Stage on Thursday, 27 June.  There will be quite an amount of time, therefore, for the Dáil to make changes and to consider the matter carefully.  Furthermore, it is envisaged that the Seanad will sit to consider the matter on 2 and 4 July.  All of those procedures for discussion will allow all relevant interests to have their viewpoints considered.</P>
    <P>The Government has made significant changes to the Bill from that which was considered in the House earlier and I understand extensive consultations were provided to Opposition spokes-persons in which the nature of those changes was explained, as well as the good and sufficient reasons some other changes, which might have appeared to be attractive, could not be made. Whether the Opposition accepts those explanations is a matter for themselves which they can discuss in the debate I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for outlining the reason behind the Government's decision.  The Taoiseach stated that the only reason he could not agree with our proposal was that the House might have gone into recess but my colleagues and I would be willing to make ourselves available in July &mdash; we will probably be here anyway for committees &mdash; to debate the Bill in the House.  This Bill deals with the biggest infrastructural change to the capital city since the report of the Wide Streets Commission published approximately 100 years ago.  If the Taoiseach insists that Second Stage must be finished tonight, I will have no option but to call three votes.  We will then go into a debate on whether the Government has the right to suspend Standing Orders, which may result in Opposition spokespersons not having an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak on the Bill because in the past four months I have <Col N="242" /> been involved in various consultations on it, along with many of my colleagues. We had to fight to get a debate on the suspension of Standing Orders.  For the first time in the history of the State we are being asked to reintroduce a Bill which was defeated and which will be railroaded through in approximately 40 minutes.  What the Minister is asking his colleagues to do &mdash; by supporting him they are, in turn, asking the House to do the same &mdash; is unreasonable and unfair. We have not had an opportunity to consult residents' groups as they were not available on Friday night, Saturday or Sunday.  They saw the Bill for the first time yesterday.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable to try to complete the Second Stage debate on this major legislation in one day.  Will the Taoiseach allow the debate to begin this evening and to continue next week?  If he does this he will have our support in ensuring the Bill is passed by the House. If this is not achieved by 5-6 July, the proposed adjournment date, we can reconvene for one day later in July, as we did last year.  I presume the Dáil will reconvene for a day as the Taoiseach has given me a firm commitment that I can put down questions on a certain date in July.  It should be possible to deal with any remaining sections of the Bill on that day.  Will the Taoiseach agree to my reasonable proposal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the Government will have many responsibilities during July in relation to the Presidency.  Obviously we are anxious to fulfil these responsibilities to the best of our ability.  I understand the Deputy's concerns about the Second Stage debate of the Bill and his anxiety for more time for consultation. All we are asking is for the Second Stage debate to be taken today.  If it is of any assistance to the Deputy, we could, of course, agree to conclude the debate tomorrow.  Obviously we have looked very carefully at the Deputy's suggestion but, as I explained to him, if we do not begin the Committee Stage debate next Thursday and allow it to be <Col N="243" /> pursued the following week we will not get committee time and will have difficulties dealing with any Seanad amendments. I am now offering, if it is of any advantage to the Deputy &mdash; which it does not appear to be &mdash; to extend the Second Stage debate to tomorrow. Although changes have been made to it, the Bill is largely similar to the earlier Bill in its content.</P>

      <P>Last week the Dáil in its wisdom passed judgment on the previous Bill and voted against it by a majority.  We represent the public and <Col N="244" /> while democracy is not always convenient it is the best system.  However, because the Dáil went against the wishes of the Executive on this occasion the Government, which has committed itself to accountability, proposes motion No. 10 which will set aside our Standing Orders to literally streamroll through the legislation.</P>
      <P>Our problem with the legislation does not merely relate to the timescale; it is that the Government has made no effort to deal with substantive defects in it. These defects were ably pointed out by Deputy Costello last week when he said the Government was taking a blinkered approach.  Will the Taoiseach think again about this proposal?  Not once in 20 years has a Government sought within a week to undermine the wishes of the people as expressed in the Dáil and to ignore the vote passed here last week.  Last Tuesday evening a majority of the Deputies in the House passed judgment on the Bill, and it shows scant regard for the wishes of the House, the public and democracy for the Government to ignore that fact simply to make it convenient for itself.</P>

      <P>We are asking the Government to allow the Bill to be debated properly.  Last February and March I asked the Taoiseach if the Minister would consult Deputies and others but none of the issues was resolved.  I understand that last Saturday night people were running from pub to pub in an effort to consult the public. The Government had months in which to engage in such consultation but refused.  I am asking the Taoiseach for the last time to take the Second Stage of this Bill next week; otherwise there will be no debate on it.  The Government is making a joke of this issue and should not pretend it cares about transport in this city because it has no intention of getting this project started within the timescale the Minister proposed. The working group on the Luas project maintains this Bill is urgently required, so that the project can begin in October next, while privately telling residents' associations that it will not commence until some time late next year.  The Minister issued a letter dated 14 June contradicating what he told the House a week ago on conclusion of Second Stage of the original Bill.  He is making a joke <Col N="248" /> of the House, the Opposition and everyone else.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the background to the defeat of the Second Reading of the Bill last week was a series of well organised, very responsible and democratic local meetings held over the preceding three or four months, when Members consulted and listened in a democratic way to the views of communities north and south of the Liffey?  Those communities received a copy of the new Bill yesterday and, over the past two days, the promoters of the Luas project engaged in <Col N="249" /> more consultation with them than they did in the preceding four months, having proposed practically a dozen alternative routes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is unreasonable to expect a vote to be taken on a Second Reading of this Bill without Members being given an opportunity to consult those same communities again, listen to their views and return here in the normal democratic way?  If that procedure is not followed today's Government proposal is clearly undemocratic.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider what I said and allow Members consult with their respective communities which, while small, have very strong voices to be carried into this House. Will the Taoiseach respond?</P>

      <P>I might explain to Deputy Gregory that all that is being sought is that the Bill on Second Reading, in other words, in principle, be approved today.  All the detailed points to which the Deputy referred, heard at various meetings held around the city, are more appropriate for discussion on Committee and Report Stages.  The Committee Stage will commence on Thursday and conclude the following Tuesday; in other words, Committee Stage will not be completed until approximately ten days after the Bill's publication.  That will afford Deputy Gregory and other Deputies who are consulting people in Dublin an opportunity to collect all the necessary data <Col N="250" /> and information they want brought to the attention of the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I send heartfelt sympathy to the people of Manchester for the injury and suffering caused by the callous bomb attack on last Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>The elected Members, without exception, condemn and repudiate the totally unwarranted attack against the entire civilian population of Manchester.  The effect of this action together with the murder of Detective Garda McCabe in Adare, County Limerick is to undermine continued peace in Ireland as well as to prejudice prospects for the viability of the inclusive peace process for which all in this House have worked so hard.  The Fianna Fáil Party regards the restoration of the ceasefire as an absolute necessity, as I am sure everybody else in the House does.  I urge the Government to steer a steady course and not allow anyone to close off the window of opportunity for a renewed ceasefire and participation in all-party talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of Fianna Fáil in extending my sympathy and that of my party to the people of Manchester and to the victims of the bombing last Saturday.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday last we extended our deepest sympathy to the family of the late Detective Garda McCabe and roundly condemned those responsible for his murder and the attempted murder of Detective Garda O'Sullivan.  We wish Detective Garda O'Sullivan a speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how many more acts of violence it will take before the IRA and Sinn Féin decide that democratic politics is the way forward, not the bomb and the bullet.  I had hoped the Government would cut off all official contact <Col N="260" /> with Sinn Féin because I believe the time has come to get tough.  We were tough last week and because of that and the public pressure that was put on Sinn Féin we at least got a half-hearted comment from it on Detective Garda McCabe's murder.  The leader of Sinn Féin, whilst he could not bring himself to condemn that murder, was prepared to repudiate it.  If we are tough we will get more from Sinn Féin than from pandering to them and appeasing them.</P>
    <P>If Government officials meet Sinn Féin officials once more, the only question they need ask is when the IRA ceasefire will be restored.  If there is not a positive answer to that question, I believe that must be the end and we must cut off contact and ensure that we take a tough stand with terrorists.  Sinn Féin and the IRA are the same organisation and there is no point in somebody asking Sinn Féin to go to the IRA.  They are synonymous.  Sinn Féin is the political wing of the IRA and we must never ever forget that.  It has carried out dreadful atrocities in the name of Ireland.  I hope what happened in Manchester is the end of it.  I hope and pray that next week we will not have to rise on the Order of Business and condemn another atrocity.  They are doing a great disservice to the people and to constitutional politicians in Ireland, Britain, the United States and elsewhere who have gone out of their way to bring Sinn Féin into the democratic political process.  Many people now feel we have had enough.  I hope that lessons have been learned and people use the leadership they have, which is considerable, to have the ceasefire fully restored.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government well in the talks process, but all politicians who participate in them carry an enormous responsibility.  I hope they have the courage to show real leadership and to compromise.  If they do not reach a political agreement they will simply give the initiative back to the men of violence. I hope and pray the politicians on all sides will not allow the opportunity which exists in Northern Ireland to be squandered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to those who suffered at the hands of IRA violence recently, both in Adare and Manchester.  On behalf of the Green Party, I urge that the main energy be put into the behind the scenes talks and that efforts be redoubled.  Once the politics of the North become identified with megaphone diplomacy, attitudes become polarised and progress stagnates. I urge people to take that on board so that we will see more progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Members who have expressed their revulsion at the action of the IRA in igniting a bomb in a shopping centre on one of the busiest days of the year in Manchester.  Not only was Manchester that day filled with the normal, happy, summer shopping crowd who come into the centre of the city on Saturdays, there were also people there from all over Europe, including German and Dutch people who had come to Britain for the European Championship.</P>
      <P>What image of Ireland is presented by the bombers to the people of Manchester? What image of Ireland is presented by the IRA to the people of Germany and the Netherlands who will report back on what was perhaps their first contact with an Irish phenomenon?  If the IRA cared about Ireland, it would care about how we as a people are seen by the world at large.  Unfortunately, the image of bleeding people with glass embedded in their faces is the image the IRA is seeking to implant in the minds of people all over the world.  Nothing could be more unpatriotic, anti-national or contrary to a true sense of Irishness than the activities of the Irish Republican Army.  The IRA does not represent Ireland.  It is anti-Irish.  It is an organisation which is antipathetic to the interests of Irish people and to the interests of peace and reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The republican movement spent many months agitating for peace talks. It wanted an opportunity to talk.  It has had that opportunity for a full week now, on terms which were carefully <Col N="262" /> worked out to make it as easy as possible for Sinn Féin to participate, by making it as easy as possible for it to go to the IRA and ask it to stop.  What was the reaction of the IRA to the fact that talks are available to it?  It killed a member of the Garda Síochána in Adare and shattered the peace of the city of Manchester.  Its action created maximum difficulty for Irish people living in Britain, making their daily lives more difficult than at any time in the past 18 months.  The reaction of the IRA to the fact that peace talks have been available to it for a full week was to deliberately plant a bomb a number of days after 10 June when it knew the talks would start.  It was a very deliberate action.  That bomb had to have been planned well in advance of 10 June to concide with the end of the first weeks of the talks.</P>
    <P>Last night the Government put a simple question to Sinn Féin &mdash;&ldquo;Do you, as a political party, continue to support the armed struggle of the IRA?&rdquo;  That is a very simple question.  We in this House, as representatives of political parties, would have no difficulty in answering it.  It is a question of supporting violence or not supporting violence. No question could be simpler or more fundamental and there has to be a simple answer to it.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin campaigned in the recent elections in Northern Ireland and got many votes on the basis that it was working on a peace strategy.  I put it to Sinn Féin that continued support for the IRA and its campaign which involves the use of kalashnikovs in armed bank robberies and igniting heavy explosives in shopping districts of heavily populated cities is not consistent with a peace strategy.  I do not believe Sinn Féin would have received the number of votes it did in Northern Ireland if it had indicated it would continue to support an armed strategy by the IRA which involved bombs in Manchester and armed robberies with kalashnikovs in this jurisdiction.  An answer is required from it now.</P>
    <P>The talks will go on.  They are the best <Col N="263" /> hope for the Irish people.  We have fought long and hard politically to have those talks start on the best possible basis.  The Tánaiste and other Ministers have deployed the very best diplomatic skills on behalf of the people to have those unprecedented talks start on the most inclusive basis possible, and in a way which I know has already created considerable confidence among all the politicians participating in them.  The bomb in Manchester and the shooting in Adare are simply a hangover from a past which I hope will soon disappear.  The talks in Stormont buildings, and the conciliation and compromise being deployed there, represent the future.  Therefore, I have confidence in the future.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions during the year I asked the Government to proceed with the Adoption Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and have no wish to labour the point but there is a motion on the Order Paper in my name. The Minister announced today that she has received the Price Waterhouse <Col N="264" /> report and will make it available to Members next week.  I am making a reasonable request that the debate and question and answer session we were promised should be held the following week to ensure there is a thorough examination of the report, which is essential to the integrity of the public examinations system, before the recess. Given the errors that have been made and continue to be made the Taoiseach should give such a commitment.</P>

      <P>In the week in which the newspaper commission has completed its deliberations, is legislation promised which would have the effect of preventing the Taoiseach's persona being used in an advertising campaign on RTE to support the sale here of an English newspaper, <i>The Times</i>, at 30p? Will such a campaign affect employment levels in the surviving titles of the Irish newspaper industry?  Such a campaign is being conducted with the Taoiseach's persona and others underpining and supporting that campaign.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure he does not give tacit support to such a campaign.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a very serious matter regarding a woman who has been detained against her will in an institution.  A mental health Bill which has been promised for a long time by the Department of Health will allow for a more liberal approach to those detained against their will in institutions. When is this Bill likely to be published?  In dealing with this matter in my constituency I find this woman has no redress.  She was put into the institution against her will without any formalisation on her part or redress to any course of action or justice.  This is a grave injustice and it has happened to many women.</P>

It represented the product of almost four years of detailed work costing in the region of £2.5 million and contained proposals for an integrated strategy involving a programme for investment in roads, public transport and traffic management.

      <P>A primary aim of the Dublin Transportation Initiative is to maintain and reinforce the vitality of the city centre of Dublin and to promote a transfer of commuters from private cars to public transport.  The DTI also places a particular emphasis on improved traffic management and enforcement, arguing that we can only justify increased investment in making improvements to the system when we have made better use of our existing transport infrastructure and facilities. Central to that is the provision of a light rail system and this can only be done if the necessary enabling legislation is enacted.  Unfortunately, the opportunity to provide this infrastructural investment is not open ended.</P>
      <P>Progress is already being made on other aspects of the strategy but they are in large part dependent on the light rail proposal.  The DTI represents an ongoing planning process with permanent institutional structures.  This ensures the continuity of the process designed to continue into the future and provide a momentum for real change. To support this process, the Government established the Dublin transportation office to oversee the implementation of the DTI transport strategy as a whole and ensure an ongoing transportation planning process in the greater Dublin area.  My aim as Minister is to develop public transport as part of the strategy to reduce traffic congestion in Dublin and I want to do so while ensuring the continued development of Dublin city as a vibrant social, economic and cultural capital.  Against this background, light rail has much to offer.</P>

      <P>The question of underground systems was raised by Deputy Molloy and others in the Progressive Democrats Party.  DTI rejected the underground option for a number of reasons, not just on cost grounds.  On the basis of its examination DTI concluded that on-street light rail would provide a better overall response to the <Col N="281" /> wider DTI objectives of shifting commuters from cars to public transport and increasing priority on the road network for public transport.  Underground stations are very expensive and less accessible to mobility impaired people. The flexibility to vary the location of stops in line with demand inherent in a surface system would be impossible once an underground system had been configured and built.  The underground option is a higher cost solution compared to the on-street rail system option favoured by DTI.</P>
      <P>In the development of the DTI strategy a number of options were evaluated. Costings of a DART option with an underground connections to the city centre amounted to a staggering £595 million in 1992 prices.  This gives a clear indication of the massive cost implications of going underground with the project.  Furthermore, such a network was deemed not be be viable in economic terms and to have a very large negative rate of return.  An underground system is not being considered.</P>
      <P>If on-street light rail is not acceptable it will involve a fundamental reappraisal of the entire DTI strategy.  The question of bringing light rail underground for short sections is a separate matter which can be considered, but that would not be without its problems.</P>

      <P>CIE and its consultants have been studying the issues involved and a report on this work will be published when it is completed.  That raises the question of the consultative process and the way it is operating.  I have always stated that there is need to address the very real concerns expressed about the development of the light rail project.  The legitimate views highlighted by those contributing to the debate will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>In launching the light rail public consultation programme last December, I invited the people of Dublin to become involved in a process designed to explain what light rail is about and the benefits it would bring.  I remain determined that the consultation programme on this project will be a robust two-way process.  I have insisted that the CIE project team listen carefully to concerns and opinions from all interested parties about the light rail proposals and respond to those concerns where possible.</P>
      <P>The CIE project team has already held eight major public exhibitions around Dublin, attended by approximately 11,000 visitors.  In excess of 400,000 newsletters have been distributed with information.  More than 50 local community meetings have taken place to date and the number continues to increase.  It is not possible to legislate in detail for such a process of consultation. To attempt to do so would mean that the consultative process would, by definition, be legalistic and bureaucratic, to use Deputy Séamus Brennan's phrase, I am conscious that the consultation process can be improved.  That view is supported by representations made to me and by the many Deputies who contributed to the debate on Second Stage of the Light Rail (No. 1) Bill.  I have discussed the issue further with CIE and agreed a strategy which, I expect, will overcome residual difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a more general level, a permanent LRT office will be opened this week at the premises of Dublin Bus at 59 O'Connell Street.  That office will be <Col N="283" /> open each day during business hours.  It is a central location where inquiries can be answered and information made available.  Information on route options is a key concern to those living in areas likely to be served by light rail.  Route alternatives have been developed as part of the consultation process and will continue to be developed.  In some cases there is delay while the feasibility of suggestions is evaluated and maps prepared. That is unavoidable, but I have instructed CIE to publish route options as soon as possible to allow debate on the alternatives to be undertaken on an informed basis.  The process has already started, with a number of options having been published in yesterday's evening newspapers.  Where difficulties are encountered with particular suggestions, they will be made known.</P>
    <P>The concerns raised during the consultation process are being taken seriously by the CIE project team. Selection of routes will not be made until the consultation process has been completed.  A final decision on the routes will not be made until the formal inquiry has been held, an environmental impact evaluation completed and consideration given to submissions made to the Minister as part of the formal procedures. As part of this strategy on consultation, the report on underground options and other reports will be published and made available in the consultation process.</P>

      <P>This audacious move flies in the face of the normal democratic procedures and suggests this rainbow Coalition Government has little regard for the rules and regulations which have governed the business of this House since the foundation of the State.  The Bill, defeated on Second Stage last week through a combination of Government arrogance and incompetence, should not be reintroduced for six months at least if Standing Orders are to be adhered to.  There is no end to this Government's disregard for normal practice.  Rather than reflect on the reasons the Bill was defeated, and the underlying causes of concern about the nature of the light rail proposal, the Government decided to disregard the views of those who do not agree with it, flex its muscles and railroad it through the House.</P>

      <P>Such an approach is unprecedented.  How many times have the parties in Opposition sought the discussion of issues of major importance in this House only to be told that such an avenue is closed off under Standing Orders?  How many times has this Government invoked rules and regulations to prevent the Opposition pursuing specific lines of inquiry?  This Government has set new records when it comes to being economic with information in this House.  It has bent the rules of the House to suit itself and has failed to practice what it preaches in those lofty sentiments contained in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> That would not be so bad were it not for the fact that the Taoiseach has consistently promoted himself as the champion of Dáil reform.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to level the playing pitch for major Irish charities by removing restrictions placed on lotteries for charitable purposes.  While the removal of the cap on prize funds for charitable lotteries in the &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo; sector has been repeatedly sought over the years, especially in recent times, it has become a matter of great urgency and a question of survival for Irish charities.</P>
      <P>The recent arrival in Ireland of the UK national lottery with a turnover in excess of £20 million, and its rapid spread to 1,500 outlets throughout the country has greatly added to the problems faced by Irish charities.  If the Irish charitable lotteries are to survive and continue to do their excellent work they must be allowed to compete on equal terms with both the British and Irish national lotteries.</P>
      <P>The voluntary sector has a major part to play in the provision of a wide range of health, education, research, environmental, sports and social services.  It has been and continues to be an important contributor to our society.  In 1994 charitable donations were estimated to range up to £251 million.</P>
      <P>However, the turnover of the charitable lotteries has been severely reduced by the national lottery.  It dropped from more than £15 million in 1988 to £10 million in 1994.  In real terms this is a much bigger drop because the sum of £15 million in 1988 would probably be equivalent to £23 million or £24 million in 1994.  At the same time the national lottery has increased its turnover from £107 million in 1987 to £303 million in 1995.  This is approximately 97 per cent of the lottery market, which reduces the share by the charitable lotteries to a mere 3 per cent.  The charitable lotteries have been severely reduced by the operation of the national lottery.  This was not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dominant position of the national lottery has been achieved through separate and more flexible legislation under which there is not a cap on prizes. By contrast, the charitable lotteries are restricted to a legal limit of £10,000 on the total weekly prize fund which may <Col N="299" /> be offered.  It is clear, therefore, that the Irish charities, such as those catering for cancer &mdash; the conquer and care lotteries of the Irish Cancer Society; for polio &mdash; The Polio Fellowship of Ireland; for asthma &mdash; the Asthma Society of Ireland; the Central Remedial Clinic, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Liffey Trust Limited and Gael-Linn are at a disadvantage.  By comparison with the Irish and British national lotteries they are being unfairly discriminated against given the prize limits.</P>
    <P>The Government must act now on this issue.  The rapid spread of the UK lottery here, without let or hindrance and with multi million pound prizes, spells the end of the road for Irish charitable lotteries.  Last January the Government decided not to continue with the test case it took against a retailer who sold the UK lottery tickets. It was a clear signal for the floodgates to open and for the UK lottery to spread throughout the country, as it has done.</P>
    <P>This created an emergency for the charitable lotteries.  They faced the immediate prospect of being wiped out of the market.  Their dilemma demanded immediate action but they got none.  It was clear that once the UK lottery got the free run of the market, it would spread rapidly and be taken up by the shopping centres and retail outlets. The existing monopoly offered the UK lottery an opportunity to install itself, which is what happened.</P>
    <P>Instead of taking immediate action, as was required, the Government established an advisory group on 4 March 1996 to examine the area of fundraising and charities along the lines of the Costello report.  This was admirable, but immediate action was also needed to ensure the survival of the Irish charitable lotteries.  When none was forthcoming we introduced this Bill to meet their needs.  These include the removal of the cap on prizes and the removal of obsolete and costly administrative procedures.</P>
    <P>It is essential that action be taken immediately to enable them retain a <Col N="300" /> share in the market, which is why we propose the removal of the cap on prizes without any further delay.  If prize funds are to be limited the limit should apply to all lotteries to create an even playing field.  The Bill does this by amending section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 which applies only to periodic lotteries for charitable or philanthropic purposes and from which the licence shall derive no personal profit. It does not apply to gaming, but only to charitable, non profit making lotteries.</P>
    <P>What was the effect of the delayed action on the UK lottery?  Last week the Government announced it had clarified the legal position and was now of the view that the UK lottery in Ireland is illegal.  It appears to have concluded that new legislation is not needed to curb the operation of the UK lottery here and that the existing law is sufficient for that purpose.  It appears extraordinary to us on this side of the House that vacillation such as this could occur, given that the advice of the Attorney General was available to the Government at all times, including last January.</P>
    <P>If the Government is correct in its new found view, it is a great pity this conclusion was not reached before it decided to abandon the case last January and open the floodgates to the UK lottery with the consequent damage this had done to our indigenous charitable lotteries.  Perhaps in due course the Minister will make a statement to the House explaining how this bizarre state of affairs arose.</P>
    <P>If a prosecution is taken against a retailer at this late stage, the difficult legal issues involved will have to be confronted in a test case.  Given the appeals that will have to be addressed by the courts this will take a considerable time to reach finality.  In view of this it is imperative that there be no further delay in the removal of the cap on charitable lotteries.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for an easing of the requirement to make weekly returns to the Garda in the case <Col N="301" /> of prizes valued at £1,000 or less.  Of all the details which must be reported, the statutory requirement to keep records and make returns to the Garda of all prize winners is unrealistic when dealing with scratch cards where the prizes are small.  This requirement imposes an inappropriate but heavy administrative burden on both the charities and the Garda Síochána.  Section 4 will result in considerable savings in Garda time, which must be the most valuable time in the country at present, and in the administration costs of the charitable lotteries where the funding and the moneys concerned will be especially important to them.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that while removing the obligation to keep records and make returns to the Garda Síochána of the names and addresses of prize winners and the amount and serial number of all prizes up to £1,000, all other accounting and returning obligations are being kept in place.  Lotteries remain obliged under the law to keep records of all moneys received.  The total value of prizes, commissions paid, expenses incurred in running the lottery and the obligation to make returns of all this information to the Garda remains. In addition, this Bill makes no change in respect of prizes in excess of £1,000.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector is a major contributor to society.  It plays a crucial part in the provision of our health, education, research, environmental, sports and social services.  In 1994 it is estimated that public expenditure in the not-for-profit area amounted to £5.286 billion or some 16 per cent of gross domestic product.  Total charitable donations were estimated to range up to £251 million.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the voluntary sector is very important.  Most voluntary organisations are locally based and in touch with the needs of people in the areas they serve.  They are in a position to see clearly what needs to be done, and being less encumbered than statutory bodies, they can react quickly and effectively to meet pressing social needs.  The <Col N="302" /> importance of the voluntary sector cannot be over-stated.  They provide a means by which people can be encouraged to help themselves and so actively partake in shaping their own future. They harness the good will for which we as a nation are internationally recognised, and promote an active and caring society in which the people are encouraged to participate.  The voluntary sector also provides a voice for disadvantaged people, for people with disabilities and for minority groups within society.  They are effective in bringing forward new needs and concerns as they arise.  They also provide important feedback on the effectiveness of State services.  Most of the really imaginative and new ideas have come from the voluntary sector participating with the statutory sector.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil sees the role of Government as one of encouraging self help and of introducing legislation that will assist voluntary organisations and not inhibit them.  Recognising the importance of the voluntary sector, we would like to see the statutory bodies continue to provide support to voluntary organisations. Because of their high level of flexibility and effective responses to the needs of society, charitable organisations can, in many instances, provide a more cost-effective and efficient response to these needs than can the statutory sector.</P>
    <P>Supporting the work of voluntary organisations has many advantages for society.  In general the aims and the activities of voluntary organisations complement the work of the statutory agencies.  Many Government Departments recognise this and provide direct support to voluntary organisations through a range of grant schemes which cover, for example, staff and administration costs.  They also provide project funding and capital grants, the use of premises and facilities or the provision of workers to voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>It is clear there is a need for transparency in relation to the use of public money.  Indeed, the statutory agencies <Col N="303" /> have defined functions and responsibilities, many of them under legislation which makes them accountable for how they carry out their functions.  They must ensure that they act effectively and efficiently while staying within their budgetary constraints.  They must also work within Government policy guidelines, and so there is accountability for statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>The national lottery was established by the Oireachtas in 1986.  Ten years on, it is time to review its operation and the disbursement of funds generated which amounted to a net £101 million in 1995. The national lottery was given a key role in fund-raising and a virtual monopoly in the market place.  A study of its operation shows that of every £100 raised £6 goes as commission to collectors, £10 to costs, £51 to prizes and £33 for disbursement by Government Departments.  None of this money goes directly to the voluntary and charitable organisations, the money they receive comes through the various Departments. The Government's £85 million allocation in the Estimates of 1995 &mdash; this figure was subsequently increased to £101 million &mdash; breaks down in the following way: Education, namely youth and sports &mdash; 41 per cent; Health &mdash; 30 per cent; Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; 12 per cent, Environment &mdash; 7 per cent; Social Welfare, which is community and voluntary services &mdash; 5 per cent; and other &mdash; 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>What are the main issues?  First, the voluntary and charitable organisations do not receive any moneys directly from the national lottery.  Second, the dominant position of the national lottery has severely reduced the income of the charitable lotteries.  Third, the charitable and voluntary organisations claim there is a lack of openness and transparency in the distribution of national lottery funds.  Too much of the money goes to meet costs which Government Departments should meet themselves in the normal course, and their own charitable lotteries are unfairly handicapped <Col N="304" /> by the capping at £10,000 per week of their prize funds.</P>
    <P>These are the main issues raised in this debate.  It is time to review the operation of the national lottery and the disbursement of its funds.  This could be done by an all-party Oireachtas committee during the summer recess.  In the meantime, it is imperative that the cap on prize funds for charitable lotteries is removed without further delay.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of accountability for the voluntary and charitable organisations.  This is another side to the equation.  Many excellent voluntary organisations do invaluable work and it is important that this high standard of work is protected through good legislation. There is a need for clear guidelines to be put in place regarding the operation of voluntary groups to protect the integrity of those excellent voluntary organisations and to ensure the proper use of public money.  It is recognised that maintaining the confidence of the public in terms of the overall integrity of the charity and the collection and disbursement of funds is critical to protect the charity industry and the public interest.</P>
    <P>The main areas of concern relate to licensing and the collection of funds, and accountability for their subsequent disbursement.  At the same time any new control should be customised to recognise the differing requirements of the charities.  For example, there is an enormous difference between a local initiative seeking to raise £5,000 and the national organisation.  Likewise, lotteries can be funded through the sale of scratch cards and other methods.  Control and accountability must, therefore, focus on two main areas &mdash; licensing the collection of funds and accounting for the disbursement of funds collected.  In the first instance, Fianna Fáil proposes that a national registration authority be set up.  The authority would be headed by a charity commissioner with a board consisting of members of the voluntary and statutory sectors with at least one member being a qualified accountant. The registration authority would report <Col N="305" /> to the Minister for Justice.  As part of its remit the authority would be responsible for creating a register of charities within Ireland.  The register would be open to public view and charities that were no longer active would be removed from it.  In the interests of transparency in the spending of publicly donated money and to keep a check on it, there is a need for voluntary organisations to keep annual accounts.  These accounts should be available to the public and to the registration authority on request.  Many organisations already keep these accounts.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the removal of the cap on prize funds of charitable lotteries and to strengthen accountability we propose that the collection scheme could be improved through regulations in which the main control would continue to rest with the Garda chief superintendent; the form of any accounting records and returns can be specified by the Minister &mdash; the annual return should be scaled according to the turnover of the charity, with the larger turnover funds being required to give more detailed accounts; consideration should be given to availing of the skills and expertise of the Revenue Commissioners to monitor the accounts submitted. They are in a position throughout the country to monitor the accounts very simply and easily and they are very good at it.</P>
    <P>Annual accounts are prepared by charities to meet the requirements of various statutory agencies.  Different agencies can and do look for accounts over different financial years, for example, the calendar year or from April to March.  In order to assist the ease of operation for charities, the Fianna Fáil Party proposes that all statutory agencies would accept accounts prepared for the calendar year unless there is EU funding and EU requirements or regulations apply. There are three main categories of funding for voluntary organisations, first, the once off grants; second, the large capital or equipment grants; third, the ongoing funding for years where the activities of <Col N="306" /> the voluntary organisation match the policy objectives of the funding body, an example would be voluntary social service providers.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise with ongoing funding. There are two ways in which this type of funding is done.  There is deficit funding whereby the statutory aid is decreased by the amount of fundraising the voluntary organisation does.  While this is a way of distributing scarce resources, it has the disadvantage that it prohibits voluntary organisations from fundraising to expand their service without the loss of existing statutory support. The Fianna Fáil Party proposes that ongoing funding switch to the second type of funding, namely, budgetbased funding.  Under this system the statutory agencies would provide a level of funding based on the cost of an agreed level of service to be provided through consultation with the voluntary agency.  The statutory agency would provide this funding based on the required number of staff to provide that service, but other than the voluntary groups' independence of operation would be maintained.  The aim is to assist voluntary groups in their operation, not to inhibit them.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make long-term plans when year to year funding is not assured.  If the voluntary organisations are to be expected to continue providing essential social services within the local community, certainty of continued funding is vital.  With this in mind we propose that a better approach be taken to State funding and that the State agencies should make a commitment to multi-annual funding, for example, a commitment to a level of funding for three years to voluntary organisations who are recognised as providing an essential local service.  Obviously it would be important that the statutory agencies providing such funding would assess the suitability of voluntary organisations, that is the continued appropriateness of the service that they provide and the performance of the organisation. It would be important to ensure that funding is not closed to new groups <Col N="307" /> and that the given statutory agencies have the flexibility to adjust to new needs as they arise.  There are some examples of multi-annual funding in progress.</P>
    <P>If we look beyond the issue of fund-raising for voluntary organisations, there is a major contribution that can be made at this level.  There is scope for a partnership approach between the relevant statutory agencies and voluntary organisations.  Fianna Fáil proposes that formal consultative processes be put in place whereby voluntary organisations can partake in the planning and delivery of services and discuss funding and those policy issues that will affect their work.  These fora could provide the facility for voluntary organisations themselves to come together and coordinate their services, approaches to statutory agencies for fundraising and their own fundraising activities.</P>
    <P>The voluntary and charitable organisations play a major part in the provision of vital services to the community.  They are recognised worldwide for their outstanding contribution, especially to people with disabilities.  They have two immediate problems.  First, they need a level playing pitch to pursue their fund-raising through periodic charitable lotteries. This can be achieved by removing the cap on prize funds and allowing them to survive and prosper in their fundraising activities.  They need a greater share of the national lottery funds.  It is time to have a full review of the national lottery and of the distribution of its funds.  This could be done by an all-party Oireachtas committee during the recess, looking towards the next ten years of the lottery.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill will remove the cap on prize funds for charitable lotteries and will result in substantial administrative savings for the charitable lotteries and for the Garda Síochána.  It will provide a level playing pitch for the charities.  In conjunction with the removal of the cap we have put forward suggestions to strengthen accountability, establish a national <Col N="308" /> registration authority headed by a charity commissioner and avail of the expertise of the Revenue Commissioners to monitor accounts.  We call on the Government to act now to accept the Second Stage of this Bill and discuss any amendment on Committee Stage. The support for and recognition of those who work in the voluntary and charitable organisations is shared by all parties.  Deputies on all sides of the House support this Bill and they should show their support where and when it matters by supporting Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great need for this simple and effective legislation and I hope the Government will be able to respond to it.  The Bill is not much more than 300 words but its enactment will mean an improvement in the quality of life of a small but important section of the community and for some it may mean the difference between life and death.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest examples of discrimination is the cap on prize money imposed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  It is not that there should not be controls but that the same allowances should be applied across the board.  In this case an injustice has been allowed to continue for almost ten years.  I am pleased that my colleague, Deputy Woods, has introduced this Bill which, in his words, attempts to level the playing pitch for every organisation looking to realise a large amount of money from a game of chance.  As long as there are charitable organisations dependent on the generosity of the public and as long as hospitals are denied vital medical equipment and machinery and schools are given only a fraction of what they need to heat the building, there will be a need for fundraising groups and the activities in which they engage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as the cap on lottery prize money is in place we, as a Legislature, are guilty of a grave wrong &mdash; one which we hope will be righted by this timely, necessary and equalising legislation.  It is a glaring injustice and those who have to work within its confining provisions <Col N="309" /> know that section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, enshrines the principle of one law for the State and another for the people.  That could not be just and I ask the Minister of State not to condone it.  By accepting Deputy Woods's Bill, the Minister of State would go a great distance towards alleviating the hurt, anger and dismay of those good and committed people who try to make up the deficiencies of State funding for a variety of societies, groups and agencies which are at present spancelled in their operations.</P>
    <P>I have always held that it is good that people should have to make a modest contribution for some services because it gives them a feeling of being a part of, or having achieved, something.  Services or items which are provided free are often not respected.  Contributing money confers the right to a stake in an end product such as a school, clinic or other service.  However, not alone have we demanded exorbitant contributions for services, or failed to provide any services in some cases, but we have also denied people a productive means of achieving their goal.  In short, we have asked people to generate huge local contributions or fund services from local resources and have denied them a level playing pitch on which to do it.  While I realise there have been &mdash; and, most likely, always will be &mdash; fly by night operators who take advantage of fund-raising opportunities, the vast majority of voluntary bodies should not only be verbally supported and encouraged, but the Government should also be seen to actively enable the large sums necessary to be raised.</P>
    <P>Who can say the Polio Fellowship of Ireland has not achieved major successes or has not improved the quality of life of a great number of people struck down by a dreadful disease since little Willie made his first appearance in the mid-1950s?  Who can deny the Rehab organisation is making a major contribution to the lifestyle of a section <Col N="310" /> of the population which has been sidelined for too long?  Who would query the commitment or track record of the Irish Cancer Society in the field of research into a disease whose name is not mentioned above a whisper?  Who can quantify the contribution of the Irish Hospice Foundation's home care service, run by that agency for people whom the State has often almost abandoned? The Central Remedial Clinic, the Irish Wheelchair Association and one or two dozen other hard working bodies can also be added to that list of groups which daily pick up the slack left by the health service.</P>
    <P>We have failed them miserably and this is our opportunity to begin to make amends.  In contrast, we have given the national lottery, which has no immediate dependants, what amounts to a monopoly on fundraising.  It is no wonder it has captured 97 per cent of the lottery market.  In the name of decency, how long can we justify such a situation?</P>
    <P>The paltry limit of £10,000 on the maximum weekly prize fund must be divided between several different lotteries in a particular charity.  Thus, they can only offer £1,000 or £2,000 as a top prize.  This is ridiculous when one considers that on Saturday nights throughout the winter Mike Murphy was able to dispose of about £70,000 or £80,000 in prizes under the guise of the national lottery.  On nights when the £250,000 jackpot was won the prize fund could rise fivefold.  This far outweighed the big money game shows in Britain which, before the emergence of Camelot, must have been grinding their corporate teeth at being denied such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>What chance have small local charities against such an onslaught?  What chance have the more organised national charities against such extravagance, when throwaway prizes on that show equal the first prizes on British television shows?  Where is the level playing pitch there?  Where is the basic <Col N="311" /> equality guaranteed by our Constitution? Where is the equality envisioned by our founding fathers, whose wish it was that we cherish all the children of the nation equally &mdash; except, of course, if they suffer from polio, cancer or other physical disabilities?  As the Lotto advertisement says, &ldquo;It could be you&rdquo;. Their interests have to take second place to the multi-million pound State machine, whose prize fund can make several people millionaires overnight.  Is that just, equal or morally right?</P>
    <P>I have yet to see a national lottery advertisement which says that when one sends away one's winning scratch card it has to join 50,000 others in the enormous out of sight bin before it can be flashed to the nation as one of 100 lucky cards in the drum which eventually produces the six lucky contestants on the show.  The odds are not as good as they appear.</P>
    <P>Worse still, we have sat on our hands and watched Camelot cream off anything which was left for export to British coffers.  It was rather late in the day when the Minister pointed out that the sale of British lottery tickets contravened the law, and not before irreparable damage had been done to the beneficiaries of small local lotteries.</P>
    <P>While the national lottery can trot out a team of high powered accountants for each lotto outing and have the costs borne by the lotto millions, lesser lotteries which are hog tied and spancelled by the provisions of the 1956 Act have to spend an unacceptably high percentage of their turnover on making weekly returns of dubious value to the Garda. The resources this outdated requirement consumes is a genuine concern of lottery administrators and means that resources are squandered needlessly. One such lottery claims to spend £120,000 per year on this provision, with a subsequent loss of service to a potential 100 patients.  That is ludicrous.  I am glad Deputy Woods has addressed this <Col N="312" /> problem head on and has proposed a measure which will considerably ease the requirement to make returns.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last Monday that he would be looking at how the law enshrined in the 1956 Act could be reformed.  I suggest that while the Minister undertakes a study of this matter, he should accept this Bill as a first step which would remove some of the hardship these charities have to bear.  It would be a humane step and the decent thing to do.  I invite the Minister of State to tell the House that she accepts completely the logic, necessity and compassion of this small piece of legislation. She must have heard the impassioned pleas of the workers of the various charitable organisations for action on this matter.  She must be aware of their concerns and have been impressed by their presentation of the figures which indicate the nature and scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>An anomaly and an inequality exist where two organisations with the same aims have different sets of ground rules which are enshrined in two pieces of legislation.  I repeat that there is one law for the State and another for the disadvantaged. Can the Minister of State stand over that injustice?  I hope not, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that all Members of the House recognise the enormous contribution made by various charitable organisations to the quality of life in our society.  The success of their work reflects the long and proud tradition of generosity of the people of this country when it comes to donating money to charities.  We all accept that whatever reasonable steps might be taken to support that work should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has as its main purpose the abolition of the limit on prizes which can be offered in what are known as <Col N="313" /> periodical lotteries run by bodies other than the national lottery.  It also contains a section designed to ease the reporting requirements by fundraising organisations to the Garda Síochána in relation to prizes valued at less than £1,000.  The House will be aware that for some years now a number of fundraising organisations have been campaigning to be allowed play on a level playing field, in other words, that the scratch card lotteries they run should not be subject to prize limits.  The Bill provides a useful opportunity for the House to debate the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Government accepts that changes need to be made to the cap and proposes to make such changes.  It believes, however, that this should be done in the context of a comprehensive reform of the legislative framework within which fund raising organisations operate.  In particular, it believes that while the issues which have given rise to the Bill must be addressed it would not be desirable or appropriate to do so without ensuring at the same time that a modern and effective regulatory framework is in place within which lotteries, with changes which will be made to the cap, would operate.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal for new charities legislation are well advanced and the hope is to introduce a charities Bill later this year.  Members of various charitable organisations, large and small, are actively assisting in the process of formulating legislative proposals through an advisory group which I established earlier this year.  Charities come in many shapes and sizes &mdash; Deputy Woods alluded to this &mdash; and what suits one may not suit another.  It is important that we do not devise legislation for the Rehabs of this world but for all charities, including very small charities such as school based charities which are of importance in towns and villages.  The advisory group has just completed its work.  It has drawn on the different types and groups of charities <Col N="314" /> throughout the country to gain the benefit of their advice, assistance and involvement in drawing up the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government intends also that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security will be consulted in advance of the finalisation of the Government's legislative proposals so that Members will have an opportunity at an early stage to influence the shape of the proposed legislation and put forward specific ideas on how the various issues involved, including those raised by this Bill, can best be tackled.  In this sensitive area it is important that there is the widest possible consultation with all the charitable interests involved, small, medium and large.  They all deserve to be heard and have their case taken into account.</P>
    <P>If Second Stage is pressed to a vote, the Government will have no choice but to oppose it.  In all the circumstances and given in particular the general agreement that the issues raised in the Bill need to be addressed and the Government's commitment in that regard I ask Deputy Woods to consider withdrawing his Bill.</P>
    <P>There is merit in seeing the issues raised by this Bill as part of the wider question of the need for reform of the law in the area of fund raising generally. There is widespread acceptance that the statutory framework within which fund raising organisations operate is outdated and in need of substantial reform. That legislative framework needs to be placed on a modern footing which takes a comprehensive and coherent approach which would enable it to cope with modern realities in this area.  This is particularly relevant where existing limits on prize funds were to be raised or removed.  In making this point I am not calling into question the bona fides of charitable organisations which operate scratch card lotteries but it is in everyone's interests that activities in this area are properly regulated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> In relation to the detail of the Bill increasing the existing limits on prize funds in what are referred to as periodical lotteries does not require primary legislation.  Section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, provides for the granting of a licence for periodical lotteries.  It goes on to specify that the lotteries must comply with specified conditions, including, at subsection (2) (c), that &ldquo;the total value of the prizes on any occasion shall be not more than five hundred pounds, and, if more than one lottery is held in any week, the total value of the prizes for the week shall not be more than five hundred pounds&rdquo;. However, section 33 of the National Lottery Act, 1986, allows the Minister for Justice to amend section 28 of the 1956 Act by altering the amount specified at subsection (2) (c).  Such a regulation was made by the Minister for Justice in the Lottery Prizes Regulations, 1987, which increased the amount in question from £500 to £10,000.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in this Bill is to repeal section 28 (2) (c) of the 1956 Act in its entirety thus not imposing any limit on prizes in periodicals lotteries and, presumably for the sake of legislative completeness, to repeal also the related section in the 1986 Act as well as the relevant portion of the 1987 regulations.</P>
    <P>While the making of regulations under section 33 (2) of the National Lottery Act would not allow the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; to be abolished this is largely a technicality in the sense that the limit in the regulations could be set so high as to amount in practice to the abolition of limits, but it is in the overall context of reform of the law on fund raising generally that the Government believes that the question of raising or removing the cap should be addressed.</P>
    <P>In this connection it might be useful to outline the types of issue being considered as part of the proposals for <Col N="316" /> changes in the law which the Government will be bringing forward and the background to those proposals as well as the reasons there should be the widest possible consultation with Members of the House and members of charitable groups and organisations.</P>
    <P>The need for the law on fund raising to be updated has been recognised for some time and it was in that context that the report of the Committee on Fund-raising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes was presented to the then Minister for Justice in October 1989.  The remit of the committee, chaired by Mr. Justice Costello, was to examine the adequacy of the existing statutory controls over fund raising activities for and by charitable and other groups and to make recommendations for reform.  The membership of the committee was broadly drawn and contained considerable expertise.  It comprised representatives from the charities sector, senior officials from relevant Departments, a senior counsel and a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>To enable it to complete its task the committee advertised for, and received, submissions from the public.  All the major charitable bodies responded and most of them appeared before the committee to give oral evidence.  The Garda Síochána also made a submission and the committee received expert advice on the accounting and auditing aspects of fund raising by charities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the committee undertook a postal questionnaire survey aimed at identifying the fund raising techniques and practices employed by charities.  I understand that members of the committee also visited London for talks with the Charity Commission, Home Office and people active in the British charities sector with a view to establishing at first hand how fund raising for charitable and other purposes was regulated in Britain.</P>
    <P>All this helped the committee to form a complete picture of the contribution <Col N="317" /> being made by charities to Irish society, the part played by fund raising in their activities and the limitations existing in the current regulatory and legislative framework controlling fund raising.  As a consequence the report of the committee is wide ranging.  It contains a survey of the various types of fund raising techniques used, ranging from the traditional flag day to the modern mass appeal technique of the Telethon.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended over 80 changes to existing arrangements.  The recommendations include a system of registration of organisations fund raising for charitable and philanthropic purposes; a system of accounting requirements; a registration authority to have supervisory and investigatory powers; greater controls on private lotteries, occasional lotteries and periodical lotteries; and registration and control of professional fund raisers.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that there is a commitment in the Government policy agreement to reform the law relating to the administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the Costello report.  I am pleased to inform the House that substantial progress has been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of considering what legislative changes are required in this area, last year I hosted a seminar which was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations big and small involved in fund raising.  The holding of the seminar was a very worthwhile exercise and the main point which emerged was that the groups working in the sector were very anxious that further and detailed consultation should take place with them before the legislation was finalised.</P>
    <P>For that reason, earlier this year I established an advisory group on the legislation.  Membership of the group is drawn from a variety of different types of charitable organisations of different sizes and includes, for example, representatives of the national charities in <Col N="318" /> Ireland and Rehab.  The purpose of establishing the group was not to revisit the work done by the Costello committee but to ensure I had the advice of groups operating in the field available to me in the context of finalising legislative proposals in this area.  The work of the group is almost complete and I expect to receive its report shortly.  I would propose then to refer this report to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security for its consideration.</P>
    <P>It would be neither practical nor appropriate for me in the course of this debate to attempt to deal comprehensively with the recommendations in the Costello report, but it might be helpful to outline the broad philosophy which underlies the preparation of the legislation. There is a proud tradition of generosity in this country when it comes to giving money to charities.  To help maintain that tradition it is desirable to take measures to reassure the public that the legislative framework in which charities operate is modern, comprehensive and effective.  The fact that new legislation is necessary is no reflection on the propriety of those many dedicated individuals and organisations who perform such good work.  Reliance on personal integrity alone is not enough.  There needs to be a system of checks and balances in place which are thorough but not unwieldy and which represent an appropriate level of accountability in relation to funds which are raised.</P>
    <P>One of the concerns which bona fide fund raisers have is that some incident of misbehaviour on the part of others purporting to raise funds for charitable purposes could severely undermine the willingness of the public to donate to any charitable organisation.  It is clearly in everybody's interest that this should not happen and new legislation has a useful role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>It is hardly a matter of dispute to say that while the vast majority of organisations are more than willing to account publicly for their activities that process <Col N="319" /> is &mdash; at the very least &mdash; not facilitated by the current legislative framework.</P>
    <P>When the proposed legislation has been completed I hope it will have achieved two aims: that it facilitates a proper level of accountability on the part of charitable organisations to those who donate to them and that we achieve this without placing undue burdens on those organisations.  In other words, people donating to charities will have knowledge of &mdash; and confidence in &mdash; the ultimate destination of the money they give.  Charitable organisations will be able to offer that reassurance to the public without any disproportionate strain on their resources.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Costello report, I should mention specifically that a number of the recommendations which it contains are related to matters covered in section 4 of the Bill before the House this evening.  That section is proposed in the context that it would remove the requirement for fund raising bodies to make weekly returns to the Garda Síochána in the case of prizes valued at £1,000 or less.  It is argued that the current requirements &mdash; which arise primarily under the Periodical Lotteries Regulations, 1961 &mdash; place a heavy administrative burden on both the charities and the Garda Síochána and that they are unsuited to dealing with the sale of scratch cards.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that changes are desirable in this area.  The fund raising report concluded that those regulations in so far as scratch cards were involved were now entirely inappropriate.  The committee indicated that they appreciated that it would be some time before any final decisions on the implementation of the proposals in its report could be taken and that more time must elapse before amending legislation could be enacted.  It recommended in the circumstances that, in the meantime, scratch card lotteries should be dealt with by means of new regulations.  When the <Col N="320" /> report was published that approach was not taken but in any event the intention now is that these matters will be dealt with in the context of the new legislation which is being proposed in relation to fund raising generally.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the approach recommended by the committee did not envisage &mdash; as the present Bill does &mdash; that the existing reporting requirements should be simply abolished. According to the committee changes in that regard should take place in the context of changes in existing regulations which would establish a detailed regime of control in relation to the obligations which would be placed on those who run scratch card lotteries.</P>
    <P>The new regulations recommended by the committee would set out specific requirements in relation to the keeping of accounts and records, for example, an account of the total amount of commission received by agents and sellers and of the total expenses of the game as a percentage of the total income received from the game.  A return containing the specified information would have to be furnished to a Garda superintendent and records would have to be kept by the organisation for three years. Members opposite will agree that that is practical, in other words, records have to be kept and returns have to be made available for inspection.  It reduces considerably the burden which arises from outdated accounting records whereas modern accounting technology enables all this information to be held in an easy and accessible form.  Even since the Costello report was published the improvements in computer technology have rendered some of the difficulties encountered in that report almost redundant.</P>
    <P>It would not be desirable to make changes of the kind comprehended by section 4 of the Bill in a vacuum.  Any such changes should form part of a general updating of the law in this area.  I cannot stress strongly enough that the <Col N="321" /> vast majority of charities here operate honestly and fairly but from time to time abuses can happen.  When those abuses happen they are extraordinarily destructive of public confidence in the whole sector.  Whatever new regime we adopt the public must be confident that it knows the total amount of money being collected, the total amount for prizes, the total amount paid by way of commission and agency fees and particularly the total amount that has gone to its favourite charitable objective.  That is the minimum accounting requirement needed to assure the public.  I assure the House that in finalising proposals I will be mindful of the type of difficulties which can arise in practice and which section 4 was intended to address.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that proponents of the Bill argue it is a matter of particular urgency in the context of competition from the UK national lottery.  That has implications and not just for fund raising organisations generally but also for the national lottery.  Members will be aware, as the Minister for Finance made clear publicly last week, that there is a determination to deal effectively with the problems posed by the sale in this jurisdiction of UK national lottery tickets.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to the sale of lottery tickets &mdash; other than tickets for the national lottery which is governed by separate legislation &mdash; is contained in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956. Section 21 of that Act, which sets out the law in relation to the prohibition of lotteries, states that:</P>
    <P>(1)  No person shall assist in promoting a lottery.</P>
    <P>(2)  No person shall import, print, publish or distribute or sell, offer or expose for sale, invite an offer to buy or have in his possession for sale or distribution any ticket, counterfoil or coupon for use in a lottery or any document containing any information relating to a lottery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> (3)  If any ticket, counterfoil or coupon for use in a lottery is found at any place or premises searched in pursuance of a search warrant under this Act, it shall be evidence until the contrary is proved, in a prosecution for a contravention of this section, that the person having control over the place or premises had it in his possession for sale or distribution.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section does not apply to a lottery declared by any provision of this Part not to be unlawful.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a matter for the Garda Síochána to enforce the law as it stands. I understand the Garda is seeking the necessary evidence to submit a number of cases relating to the sale of UK lottery tickets to the Director of Public Prosecutions for decision as to prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Government will, of course, pay attention to the views expressed in the House in the course of this debate and will take these into account in the formulation of its proposals for changes in our charities legislation.  Members will have a further opportunity in that regard when the matter is referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Because of the complexities and the needs of the different charities, more than 200 people, representing large and small charities throughout the country, attended a seminar on fund raising which I organised in Dublin Castle.  They presented a complex and interwoven set of demands and accountability was at the heart of them.</P>
    <P>It is important Deputies have an opportunity at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to examine this complex legislation.  On the one hand, the Bill seeks to assure the public that a regulatory framework is in place and, on the other, that excessive burdens in terms of regulations are not placed on charities.  We are trying to assist charities and create a positive environment. The Bill also seeks to eliminate any <Col N="323" /> possibility of the misappropriation or abuse of charitable funds.  The Government has set itself a complex set of objectives.  I expect the Select Committee on Legislation and Security will give Members a further opportunity to tease out all the ramifications of this topic.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Woods for introducing this measure.  I hope he agrees the practical and effective course to take is along the lines I outlined and that he will not press forward with his Bill. Deputy O'Keeffe wishes to share my time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to inform the House that the Government accepts changes are required in relation to the cap.  Deputy Woods mentioned the various areas in which charitable organisations operate. Visitors to Ireland are astonished that the voluntry fund raising sector operates over such a wide and comprehensive segment of Irish life, not just in the caring areas in relation to people with specific needs or disabilities but also in <Col N="324" /> terms of education, culture and sport and, increasingly, in recent times it has extended to the community area.</P>
    <P>Given the huge range of organisations, the mechanisms of fund raising used by charitable organisations are widespread.  The previous speaker criticised the national lottery but in its defence &mdash; Deputy Woods is aware of this point &mdash; many voluntary organisations, such as community based groups, do not have a large fund raising capacity.  The funding they receive from the national lottery has allowed a new area of social community and cultural activity to take place.  For example, the funding for locally based women's organisations, which was made available through the national lottery to the Department of Social Welfare, was the first of this type ever made available to such organisations.  These groups had a limited fund raising capacity.  The availability of sources of funding through the national lottery has allowed a new and important area of activity to grow and prosper.  I am inclined to temper some of the criticisms of the national lottery with consideration of the point that it has allowed certain areas to expand and provide a valuable service.</P>
    <P>Accountability was mentioned as the cornerstone of the regulation of lotteries. Another aspect mentioned was the style of fund raising, but the calibre of fund raisers is equally important.  Concerns have been raised about particular charitable objectives, but more often than not they related to fund raising. The process of consultation which took place in the lead up to the preparation of the new legislation was most helpful to some of the smaller charitable organisations. For example, charitable fund raisers may offer a particular charity a <i>bloc</i> of money, but they may collect much more money and not remit any of the surplus proceeds to the charitable objective.  This must be an enormous cause for concern.  Another issue is charities lacking identification.  A recent <Col N="325" /> example was the significant fund raising which took place in the south-west in particular, but it was unclear what, if any, ultimate benefit was derived from the charitable objective which was set out.  From time to time charities spring up in Dublin and other cities &mdash; particularly around Christmas when people are feeling very charitable &mdash; which lack identity that can be authenticated and checked.  If a comprehensive framework is to be provided in the legislation, we must provide for the registration and naming of charities.  We must ensure the people who collect money for charities are identifiable.  A member of the public must be able to satisfy himself or herself as to the identity of the collector and for whom they are collecting.</P>
    <P>We must also be satisfied in terms of how a charity spends its money.  Is it fully accounted for and how much of it goes towards expenses?  How much is spent on promotion, fees and commissions? In particular, how much goes to the charitable objective?  If this type of information can be made available, particularly in respect of larger charities, the public will know how effectively the money they give to charities is spent on the charitable objective.</P>
    <P>I was pleased earlier this year to preside at the formal inauguration of the Irish Institute of Fundraisers.  The aim of the body is to set a professional structure for fund raisers in Ireland and to offer a code of ethics in relation to fund raising for charitable purposes.  Everybody recognises that fund raising has become a highly skilled operation. However, it must be accountable to the public.  The basis on which fund raisers take their fees must be set out clearly, particularly in terms of how much of the money is given over to the charitable objective.  In common with many other Members, I have heard of charities which undertook fund raising ventures and, although there was a great deal of publicity, they were ultimately disappointed that they received relatively <Col N="326" /> little money.  This area will be addressed in the forthcoming legislation.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment to seek an explanation from the Minister as to how an error of this magnitude could occur on paper II of this year's honours mathematics paper.  I am disappointed the Minister has not come into the House to give an explanation on behalf of her Department on this very serious issue which has caused widespread concern.  How does the Department intend to make allowances to deal with the error and to compensate students for its impact on their performance?  We have had some vague statements about the matter but we want a transparent account of how the Department intends to make allowances for the error.  In question 4 (c) of the paper, a trigonometry question, students were given an isosceles triangle, the angles of which added up to more than 184 degrees, a mathematical impossibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received complaints from parents about the matter.  Many students spent an undue length of time on the question while others avoided it.  I heard a student outline in detail on radio today how it affected his performance.  He was unable to finish the question and kept returning to it throughout the examination to see if he could work it out.  At the weekend parents called to my clinic in Cork to complain about the effect the <Col N="327" /> error had on their children.  It caused considerable distress and upset and affected their preparation and composure for subsequent examinations.  I have personal knowledge of cases where students' performances in other papers were affected as a result of the difficulties they encountered with this question.</P>
    <P>Mr. Richard Walsh, a mathematics teacher in Abbey CBS in Tipperary, summed up the matter when he said many students were put off by the question, some thought their calculations were wrong and others spent an inordinate amount of time on it.  He concluded by saying that he had never seen such a mistake on a mathematics paper in his 25 years of teaching.</P>
    <P>Surely such distress and trauma could have been avoided.  The Minister failed in her responsibility to ensure the integrity of the public examinations system and has not maintained a hands-on approach to the operation of that system. Given the errors discovered in the operation of last year's examinations, it is extraordinary that an error of this magnitude should occur.  It is obvious that a proper system is not in place to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our public examinations system. The Department's response has not been adequate and lacks clarity in terms of how the paper will be corrected.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept responsibility for this state of affairs.  She has not put in place procedures to prevent such errors taking place.  She has not given the State examinations system the attention and resources it needs.  Given what happened in the past, most people find it extraordinary that such an error should happen.  Furthermore, the time has come for the establishment of an independent examination appeals board to deal with complaints, queries and to recheck applications from students, parents and schools in regard to our State examinations system.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for sharing his time.  This has been an appalling blunder in the leaving certificate examination paper.  It is difficult to over-estimate the feelings of students who sat the examination.  Because of the mistake in this question many students were put off.  It is incumbent on the Minister to give a clear explanation how this happened.  She must reassure students about the integrity of the examinations system.  It is unbelievable that this mistake should follow other blunders in the Department of Education. This type of stress and worry adds to the difficulties of students going through this stressful period.</P>
      <P>What reparation will be made to these students?  How did the mistake happen?  What checks and balances were in place?  Will the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report cover the type of difficulties that occurred in this year's leaving certificate examination papers?  It is crucial that the Minister gives a clear explanation in this regard and reassures students, particularly the victims of this error.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister who is attending a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>There was an error in question 4 (c) of the leaving certificate higher level mathematics paper II examination held on 7 June.  The error is regretted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A code of procedure identifies the various stages in the preparation of an examination paper up to the scrutiny of the final printed paper.  This includes procedures intended to minimise error at the following stages; preparation of the paper from the drafts supplied; proof reading of the paper on one or more occasions as necessary and comparison of English and Irish versions of the paper.  When each paper is printed a scrutiny copy is re-examined.  If any <Col N="329" /> errors are detected an errata list is perpared. Such an errata list is read out by the examination superintendent before the commencement of each examination as appropriate.</P>
    <P>In this particular case the error originated when question four was simplified and redrafted.  The diagram shows a triangle in which one of the values given to an angle is incorrect.  However, the original value of the angle in the draft question was retained and this was not discovered in the subsequent stages during the profing.  The error was not detected at the stage when the scrutiny copy was examined on 28 May 1996. After that point no further scrutiny was possible.</P>
    <P>Part (c) of question four represented 15 marks out of a total 600 marks for the two examination papers i.e., 2.5 per cent of the total marks.  About 10,000 candidates sat leaving certificate higher level mathematics.</P>
    <P>The examination was held on 7 June 1996.  The error was discussed in detail at the pre-marking conference with the chief advising examiner and advising examiners on 13 and 14 June.  The examination marking conference is being held today and tomorrow.  From an analysis of scripts at the pre-marking conference and following a further analysis of some scripts over the weekend, there is no evidence that candidates had been confused or frustrated. As is normal comments on the mathematics examination papers were received from the ASTI, the TUI and the Irish Mathematics Teachers Association. The views of these bodies were that the error did not have a major effect and did not seem to upset students who completed the question using the given data without analysis.</P>
    <P>The marking scheme will be adapted to ensure that all reasonable attempts at the section of the question containing the error will receive due credit.  If candidates state there is a problem with the <Col N="330" /> question and make a reasonable attempt, due credit will also be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The widespread welcome accorded the Supreme Court judgment in the Hanafin case &mdash; which gives the green light to the introduction of divorce legislation &mdash; is premature.  The introduction of divorce legislation would generate an enormous amount of extra family law business which will be simply loaded onto a system which has already effectively broken down.  The Law Reform Commission, an organisation not given to hyperbole, recently described Ireland's family courts system as being &ldquo;in crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;a sad parody&rdquo; of that which might be expected in a state whose Constitution places such emphasis on the protection of family life.</P>
      <P>Family law in Ireland has changed more in the last decade than it did in the previous century.  New business triggered by the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, was simply grafted onto the existing system without any commensurate increase in funding.  In 1988 there were 68 applications before the courts for the remedy now known as judicial separation. In 1994 the figure was 2,806, a 40fold increase.  In the case of a family law client, whether a battered wife or deserted husband, who applies to the Dublin District Court for a judicial separation decree today, that case will not be heard until, at the earliest, January 1998.  The position outside Dublin is invariably worse and in some venues, much worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present people who can no longer live together and whose conflict is often damaging to their children will have to endure several years more under the one roof until the court hears their case. This is the bleak reality of the present system.  One can hardly begin to imagine what the position will be when divorce legislation comes into effect. <Col N="331" /> The present intolerable delays discourage parties from reaching amicable solutions by agreement.  Because they will be aware of the long delay for a court hearing, couples will frequently intiate proceedings without exhausting all other possibilities.  Once proceedings are initiated, negotiations become progressively more difficult.  Parties often find themselves under doctor's care during the extended waiting period for a court hearing.  The children of a couple going through this process may suffer long-term trauma and incalculable damage. They are the silent victims.  Their lives are put on hold, often for several years, and they are frequently used as pawns by one parent against the other in disagreements which occur during the waiting period.</P>
    <P>Women in particular suffer cruelly during their extended wait for justice. Those not living in physical fear often suffer great mental cruelty and distress. Some flee to the relative sanctuary of women's refuges.  Many have inadequate resources and they and their children are obliged to live from hand to mouth, often for several years.  When the case eventually goes to court, because of pressure of business the judge is often forced to make his or her decision after a hearing that is all too brief and huried.  Such judges often hand down decisions which further exacerbate family conflict.</P>
    <P>The physical condition of many courthouses outside Dublin is neither adequate nor appropriate for family law hearings.  Couples in conflict are often forced to consult their lawyers in the open air in all types of weather, or, alternatively in crowded hallways a few feet from where the other party is consulting his or her lawyer about the very same business.  The State has failed to provide the resources, structures and personnel to make the present legislation work.  It is obvious that, before we introduce more law, giving rise to yet <Col N="332" /> more business, we must provide the wherewithal to make the present system work properly and increase resources accordingly.  The appointment of extra judges, as promised by the Government, will be grossly inadequate.  Radical surgery is necessary.  The Law Reform Commission, in its recent report on family courts, indicated clearly what needs to be done.  The Government has accepted that report.  If, however, it continues to refuse to implement its recommendations it will be condemning even more of our citizens to continue to endure a position which is not only patently unconstitutional but fundamentally unchristian.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  The hearing of family law cases in our courts is a matter of great concern to the Minister who is committed to ensuring that these cases are dealt with in the most effective and efficient way possible.  Social changes in recent years and developments in the family law area have led to a major increase in the number of persons coming before the courts on family law business and this has placed a severe strain on the resources of the courts.  There are prolems in some courts with regard to delays in the sharing of family law business and with the accommodation available for persons having recourse to the courts on such business.  Delay in the hearing of family law cases is a serious matter having regard to both the personal and complex nature of such cases and to the fact that the decisions in them have lifelong repercussions on all members of the families concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The<i>Programme for a Partnership Government &mdash; A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; gives a commitment to complete the steps necessary to ensure that family courts are strengthened.  The Law Reform Commission in its report on family courts examined the best type of judicial courts structure for dealing with <Col N="333" /> family law and have recommended &ldquo;a combination of structural and legal reforms together with a major injection of resources&rdquo;.  The Department of Justice is studying the implications of these recommendations at present.  The report will, it is expected, also be examined by the Working Group on a Courts Commission which is examining the courts system in general.</P>
    <P>The report recommends the establishment of a system of regional family courts within the Circuit Court.  In this context the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, provides for an increase in the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the courts.  The Minister obtained Government approval for the appointment of seven additional judges of the Circuit Court. These additional appointments will be made as soon as possible.  The Minister is confident that the appointment of these additional judges will provide the courts with the resources necessary to deal effectively with existing delays and arrears, including family law cases, and assist in the prompt disposal of cases in the future.  It is not possible at this time to say if further additional judges would be required following the introduction of legislation permitting divorce.  The situation will, however, be kept under review.</P>
    <P>A major courts refurbishment programme is under way by the Department of Justice and an integral part of that programme is the provision of family law court facilities.  These include separate courtrooms, consultation rooms and private waiting areas to meet the needs of those attending the courts in family law related matters.</P>
    <P>Separate family law facilities are now available in Athlone, Arklow, Bray, Cork District Court complex, Donegal, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Galway, Kilkenny, Loughrea, Waterford and in the District, Circuit and High Court of Dublin.  These facilities will also be available in the refurbished courthouses <Col N="334" /> in Ballina, Ballinasloe and Clonmel, which will be completed shortly.  The Minister is committed under this refurbishment programme to providing the best possible facilities for the transaction of family law business as quickly as possible with the resources available to her.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue. Woodfab's sawmilling operations are located at Aughrim and Fermoy.  The company has a total workforce of 213, of which 155 operate at Aughrim and 58 at Fermoy.  Of the 155 workers at Aughrim, 65 have been laid off in recent weeks, 57 yard workers and eight office or supervisory staff.  I understand the eight office staff are allied in the dispute to the yard workers who have been laid off.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that at a time when the economy is booming and the construction industry is flourishing, timber workers in Wicklow are being laid off.  It is even more extraordinary when one considers that Wicklow is the premier forestry county.  The grave concern about these layoffs in the Aughrim and general south Wicklow area is understandable, particularly in relation to business people and their workers who will feel the brunt of this extraordinary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aughrim forms part of the south Wicklow hinterland of the town of Arklow, and Arklow and its surrounding areas have been blighted by unemployment for the past two decades.  The rundown in traditional industries has resulted in the loss of 3,000 jobs and this <Col N="335" /> latest tragedy simply cannot be allowed to happen.  Urgent and potent action is required forthwith in the form of ministerial intervention.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with the workers and senior management in Woodfab as well as Coillte Teoranta representatives at director level.  All those I met were very forthcoming with information but it is obvious that a powerful catalyst is required immediately to address this problem, to bring about a solution and to save these jobs.</P>
    <P>There is a long standing dispute between Woodfab and Coillte Teoranta and between the Irish Timber Council and Coillte in regard to timber prices. That appears to be an underlying factor in this crisis.  In the time available it is not possible to go into detail but I ask the Minister to take up this matter immediately.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in liaison with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry, to seriously examine the relationship between Coillte and the sawmill companies.  I understand a new timber sales regime is to be put in place. That should be expedited.</P>
    <P>There is little sense or joy in reading the accounts of Coillte Teoranta while layoffs of this level obtain in the premier forestry county.  The situation at Woodfab is ludicrous.  Many long serving skilled office and yard workers may lose their jobs.  It is obvious that heads must be knocked together and logic applied if this dispute is to be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Jacob, and echo his concerns about the valuable jobs that are in jeopardy as a result of a number of factors. I hope the Minister of State can give Deputy Jacob and myself some reassurance that the Government intends to take action because the news from Woodfab is worrying.  People who have been working with this company for the past 30 years are being laid off.  They <Col N="336" /> have made an enormous commitment to this company.</P>
      <P>Some of the causes underlying this problem relate to the fact that the Woodfab logs are too expensive and the production value has thus declined. Coillte's pricing policy is an issue in this debate in addition to the fact that Woodfab must compete with the timber producing industry in central and eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The Government should establish an independent regulatory authority to decide on a proper pricing policy for timber because Government intervention is clearly required.  The Minister and the Government should be concerned when they hear a SIPTU official criticising Ministers for their lack of interest and lack of action on the loss of these jobs.  As the SIPTU official said, this dispute has lasted since last June yet the Government has not shown any interest in it.</P>
      <P>We have all been impressed with Coillte's work over many years and we have seen the impressive planting throughout the country.  We have waited for the obvious investment to materialise into real jobs.  Most lay people would expect new jobs to be provided as a result of the tremendous work done by Coillte rather than the job losses that are now taking place.  They cannot understand what is happening and clearly expect the Government to intervene. The pricing policy for logs must be dealt with and the Government must intervene directly to save these valuable jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who is abroad on official business and unfortunately cannot be here this evening, to reply to the Adjournment Debate on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, the Minister wishes to assure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="337" /> Deputy Jacob, and Deputy Kitt that the proposed redundancies at Woodfab Limited are a matter of great concern to him.  He fully shares their anxieties at the effects this will have on the workforce and consequences for the local economy.</P>
    <P>Woodfab is a 100 per cent subsidiary of the Smurfit Group and was acquired in the late 1980s.  The company has two manufacturing locations, namely, Aughrim in Wicklow employing 157 people and Fermoy employing 58 people.  From inquiries made with Forbairt the Minister understands that due to difficulties in both the Irish and UK markets, the company is planning to rationalise the Aughrim plant.  This will involve closing down its large log line with a loss of 29 jobs; a closure of its night shift operations, part-time workers, with a loss of 28 jobs and a reduction of eight staff employees.  Woodfab claims that high log prices are the main factor for these job losses but accepts that the failure of the company to invest in new technology over the past eight years is also a factor.  The sawmilling sector is critical to the long-term success of the Irish forest products industry.  The sector processes all of the sawlog produced by Coillte and it supplies the board mills with sawmill residues.  This residue represents 50 per cent of the logs.</P>
    <P>Significantly capacity increasing investment took place in the late eighties and early nineties which has resulted in serious sawmilling over-capacity. While a number of these top mills &mdash; 80 per cent of timber is processed by eight mills &mdash; are competitive by international standards, the sector has not generated sufficient profits for reinvestment in new technology and the development of new innovative added value products.  A number of factors have contributed to this low level of profitability, namely over-capacity in primary processing which has created a strong demand for logs resulting in high log prices, even by international standards; residue prices <Col N="338" /> are low compared to international prices.  This issue should be resolved when LPC Louisiana Pacific Coillte Ireland Limited &mdash; in Waterford and the Masonite plants in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, are in full production; strong competition on the home market forcing down prices at very competitive levels; exports have reduced due to the high value of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling and the main export market, i.e., the UK, is being supplied to a greater extent by new exporting countries with cheap timber and labour costs, i.e. Lativa and Estonia.  Overall the sector is experiencing severe difficulties because of high log prices.</P>
    <P>Under the Forestry Act, 1988, Coillte Teoranta has a commercial mandate to sell its timber on an equitable basis. Coillte sells its timber mainly through the tender system and it is open to all sawmills to tender for that timber. Coillte's commercial mandate requires it to maximise the price it obtains from its timber sales.</P>
    <P>Discussions are on-going with the representative body of all the major sawmillers in Ireland, the Irish Timber Council, of which Woodfab is a member, for the purpose of putting in place a new timber sales system.  The new regime will be based on an electronic bidding process and will include more regular timber sales.  It is envisaged that the new system will better meet the current and future needs of sawmillers in marketing fluctuations and raw material demands.  As with the current system it will be open to all sawmills to bid for timber on offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being present to respond to this matter which is of serious concern in rural areas.  The temporary milk leasing scheme which has been in existence for a number of years was available to milk suppliers with up to 30,000 gallons. Many small farmers with herds of 15-20 cows availed of the scheme to top-up their small quotas.  Last April the Minister issued a notice informing farmers that the guidelines would be changed and he increased the quota to 35,000 gallons for 70 per cent of the milk pool, to 35,000-55,000 gallons for 20 per cent of the milk pool and in excess of 55,000 gallons for the remaining 10 per cent of the pool.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the quota should be increased for farmers with more than 55,000 gallons.  I know farmers with quotas of 75,000 gallons, which is the equivalent of 70-75 cows, and an increase of 1,000 gallons is of little use to them.  However, small farmers with quotas of between 6,000-9,000 gallons have had their quotas reduced to 1,0001,500 gallons and they are being put out of business.  Some farmers have advertised the sale of their dairy herds in <i>The Examiner</i> and the <i>Southern Star.</i> This is a serious matter and I appeal to the Minister to change these disastrous guidelines and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Walsh's plea to the Minister.  I am surprised that the Minister of State who represents a constituency with a large number of small milk suppliers would have allowed this change to go through. He must be aware of the pressure on these suppliers to earn a living from their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency some farmers have quotas as low as 7,000-8,000 gallons. Previously these farmers were able to buy an extra one or two cows, thereby securing an additional quota of a couple of thousand gallons.  However, they now find it very difficult to get <Col N="340" /> additional quota as it is being given to the larger suppliers.  It is obvious that the Government and Minister are no longer interested in small milk suppliers who have had to work hard to earn a living but are in favour of giving quotas to the large suppliers, thereby turning the key on rural areas in the long-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for sharing his time with me and support his plea to the Minister.  Many young small farmers in my constituency who had quotas of 10,000-12,000 gallons when they started in business could secure an additional quota of up to 10,000 gallons through the temporary leasing scheme.  In recent weeks these farmers have been told they will get a quota of 2,500 gallons, which means a reduction of £8,000 in their income at a time when they are trying to build up their businesses.  This is a retrograde, insensitive, treacherous and barbaric decision and is further evidence, if this was needed, that the Minister is not in control and does not know what is happening in his Department or that the Government has taken a decision to do away with small farmers.  It is outrageous that such a decision could be taken by a Government which includes so-called socialists.  The Minister should come back to reality and look after young farmers who are trying to build up their herds.  If this decision is not changed he will drive many young farmers to penury in the coming months.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing his time and for giving me an opportunity to voice my concerns about small milk producers, many of whom live in South Tipperary, who are facing hardship.  These farmers who made major investments in their dairy unit, whether in buildings or stock, now <Col N="341" /> find they are already over quota as a result of this decision.  As Deputy Walsh knows, this recommendation was made by the milk quota review group which consists of representatives of the farming organisations.  I am alarmed that the group could have made this recommendation to the Minister.  Successive Ministers have accepted the recommendations put forward by the review group.  However, this bad decision has been taken at a difficult time when less milk is available.  I ask the Minister to reverse the decision in the second and third stages so that small milk producers can continue in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have spoken on this matter.</P>
      <P>The operation of the milk quota system has always been biased in favour of smaller producers.  Apart from various special reserve allocations which have been distributed over the years, the rules governing the ongoing schemes such as temporary leasing, restructuring and the allocation of unused reference quantities, flexi-milk, have also ensured that smaller scale producers have first priority access to all quota which becomes available for distribution.  For the last two restructuring schemes, and again in respect of the 1996 restructuring scheme, a subsidy has been made available to smaller scale producers towards the cost of purchasing additional quota.</P>
      <P>All these measures are implemented with a view to improving the situation of the smaller scale producers but, at the same time, it is vitally important to emphasise that the extent to which any individual producer can benefit from any of these schemes is totally dependent on the amount of quota which becomes available for distribution at a given time and the demand for it.  Milk producers are, of course, responsible for their quota management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quota system has not been in operation for over a decade and for this <Col N="342" /> reason the Minister specifically asked the milk quota review group to look critically at all aspects of its operation. The group, which includes representatives of the farming bodies and the dairy industry in general, made a number of recommendations for changes in the operation of the various schemes, including the temporary leasing scheme. One such recommendation was that quota available for temporary leasing should be distributed across the various categories of producers in the same way as flexi-milk is allocated &mdash; 70 per cent to category I, producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons; 20 per cent to category II, quotas between 35,000 to 55,000 gallons and 10 per cent to category III, quotas over 55,000 gallons.  The Minister accepted the group's recommendation and indicated, when announcing the first stage of the temporary leasing scheme in April last that he would review the situation for the second and third stages based on the outcome of the first stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be out of business at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In analysing the outcome of the first stage of the temporary leasing scheme, this change in categories is at most a minor factor.  Under the changed system the policy of giving priority to smaller scale producers was continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other factors are even more relevant.  The main factor has been the increased level of demand and the extent of the super levy liability which was incurred in 1995-96.  Some producers are applying for the first time on the basis that the flexi-milk which had been available in previous years to meet their over-quota production is no longer available.  As many producers held over milk which was produced in the latter days of March in order to minimise their super levy liability for 1995-96, the estimated milk deliveries to <Col N="343" /> date in the current year are in the region of 6 per cent over quota.  The favourable weather conditions last year and this year have led to increased production, and there is the further unexpected difficulty of disposing of surplus dairy animals.</P>
    <P>All these factors have meant that, while all indications are that the level of demand has perhaps doubled, the amount of quota available under the first stage of the temporary leasing scheme fell far short of requirements.  It is clear that this doubling of demand is the principal factor which determined the level of the allocations to the individual producers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> There are, however, two further stages of the temporary leasing scheme this year, the second stage in September and the third stage before the end of December.  The Minister has already called a meeting of the milk quota review group on 8 July for the specific purpose of analysing the outcome of the first stage and to consider how best to operate the further stages to ensure that those producers in greatest need will benefit most.  The Minister is fully aware of the situation on the ground for smaller scale producers this year and he will consider the group's recommendations in the light of this knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 June 1996.</P>

      <P>Foilsíodh an Páipéar Bán i mí Aibreán, 1995, mar thoradh ar phróiseas comhairleach a bhí an-fhada agus an-leathan ar fad.  Le trí bliana roimhe sin, bhí díospóireacht dhian ar siúl féachaint cén saghas múnla a bheadh oiriúnach i bhforbairt an oideachais in Éirinn sna blianta romhainn.  Rinneadh comhphlé níos leithne agus níos doimhne ná mar a rinneadh riamh roimhe sin.  Bhí go leor gnéithe suntasacha agus nuálacha ag baint leis an díospóireacht. Mar shampla, bhí Comhdháil Náisiúnta an Oideachais i nDeireadh Fómhair 1993 agus, ina dhiaidh sin, i 1994, comhchainteanna i dtaobh struchtúr idirmheánach oideachais agus rialú scoileanna.  Don chéad uair riamh bhí comhphlé struchtúrtha iltaobhach i measc na bpríomh-chomhpháirtithe san <Col N="59" /> oideachas ar shaincheisteanna ríthábhachtacha a théann i bhfeidhm ar fhorbairt an oideachais.

Níl mé ag rá, áfach, go bhféadfaí glacadh sa Pháipéar Bán le gach uile tuairim ó gach uile pháirtí.  Léiríonn an Páipéar Bán go ndearnadh iarracht teacht ar chomhaontú oiread agus ab fhéidir.</P>

      <P>In the past schools were selected for disadvantaged status on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators, agreed between my Department, managerial authorities and the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  Account was also taken of the views of my Deparment's inspectorate on the relative levels of need among applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to a report which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas. In line with the recommendations in the report, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 <Col N="60" /> schools which will be selected in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports.  Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
    <P>Eligible schools have been identified on the basis of revised criteria for the identification of disadvantage as recommended in the Combat Poverty Agency/Education Research Centre report.  The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with the schools in question inviting their applications. The centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five-year development plans. Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage.  Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>
    <P>Of the 74 primary schools in the areas mentioned, 33 already have disadvantaged status.  Applications for disadvantaged status are currently on hands from a further nine schools in these areas.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to alter the quota for the 1996-97 academic year.

It will take account of any recent changes in the demand for second-level teachers. The quota arrangements for the 1997-98 academic year will be determined in the light of the findings of the working group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>Under the rules for national schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second-level the managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of <Col N="64" /> behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  In 1990 and 1991, my Department issued Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline together with A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline to all schools.  The guidelines do not include a system of reporting suspensions to the Department.</P>
    <P>Within these guidelines individual boards are given the discretion to work out specific details of their policy on school discipline.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspension only as a last resort.  Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school.</P>
    <P>I propose to have these guidelines reviewed during the next school year. This review will be carried out in consultation with the partners in education and will be influenced by the conclusions of a research project currently being undertaken with support from my Department.</P>
    <P>In cases where parents feel aggrieved with a decision to expel a student they may bring the matter to the attention of my Department which arranges for appropriate investigation.  My Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through its inspectorate to assist in the re-instatement of the pupil in the school or alternatively, his or her placement in another school.</P>
    <P>In more difficult situations, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.  Programmes such as Youth Encounter Projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance-Truancy report, published in April 1994, addressed the question of suspensions <Col N="65" /> and expulsions from schools.  Subsequent to the publication of this report a task force was established within the Department to examine submissions on the report and to consider and make recommendations as to future action required to address the problems of truancy at primary and second level.  The work of the Truancy Task Force is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>The issue relates to correspondence submitted by a number of parents who complained about the actions of a member of the teaching staff in a second level school in Bray. The procedure for dealing with such cases is that the employer of the teacher is made aware of the allegations.  In this case, the Town of Bray vocational education committee is the employer. Where specific allegations are made regarding an employee of a vocational education committee, the vocational education committee, as the employer has a duty of care to the children in its care and must have these allegations investigated.  It is incumbent on me as Minister to make the allegations known to the vocational education committee to enable it to discharge its responsibility. Where the complainants indicate that they do not want their identity known outside the Department, this wish is normally acceded to.  Nothing in any of the letters received by my Department in this case indicated that the authors wished to retain their anonymity.</P>

      <P>Information extracted from records within my Department indicates that the total number of qualified primary permanent and temporary teachers in service on 10 June 1996 was 20,897.</P>
      <P>I accept that, in the current year, there is a shortage of trained teachers at primary level.  However, I am satisfied that the present difficulties are of a temporary nature only.</P>
      <P>Since I took office I have increased substantially the number of entrants into the colleges of education each year. In January 1995 I introduced a special 18 month post-graduate course for 180 students in the colleges of education. All this will mean that a total of over 600 newly-qualified teachers will be available for employment in schools this September, 335 more than last year.</P>
      <P>The initiative, combined with the projected reduction in overall pupil enrolments at primary level &mdash; from over 478,000 at present to approximately 444,000 in 1998-99 &mdash; will alleviate the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>The total teacher allocation at second level in the current year is 23,263 wholetime teacher equivalents.  I can assure the Deputy that the vast majority of these teachers are fully qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to convene a working group under the Higher Education Authority shortly to undertake an in-depth review of needs for second level <Col N="67" /> teachers, in total and to the extent feasible by subject grouping.  It will take account of any recent changes in the demand for second level.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, I am committed to developing initiatives to facilitate participation by mature students and part-time students in third level education within available resources.  A number of measures in recent years have benefited mature students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improvements have been made in the <Col N="69" /> student support arrangements to extend them to mature students and to enable such students to be assessed on their own means.  Mature students also benefit from the free fees initiatives and from the provision allowing tax relief on fees for certain third level courses. There are also special arrangements to enable mature students to train as primary teachers.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority, in co-operation with third level institutions, is promoting the co-ordinated development of a system of modular course structures and related credit transfer arrangements.  Such flexibility in course structures has the potential to facilitate access and enable mature and part-time students to study for qualifications while remaining in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education was asked to examine the participation levels of mature students in higher education.  The committee identified the principal difficulties for these students as lack of adequate financial resources, clear admissions criteria and student support in the first year of study and made a number of recommendations which they felt would alleviate these difficulties.  The Higher Education Authority is currently considering proposals from the universities for funding in regard to mature students in the context of the report of the steering committee.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that mature students as a proportion of full-time entrants to third level education should be progressively increased from a level of about 1,000 full-time students in 1993-94 to 2,200 by year 2000.  Over 6,200 additional university places will be created by the year 2000 by the private sector-Exchequer £60 million initiative and, over the same period, a further 1,000 in the regional technical collegeDIT sector with the establishment of the first phases of regional technical college Dún Laoghaire and TRBDI with funding from the 1994-99 European <Col N="70" /> Regional Development Fund programme. The creation of over 7,200 additional third level places by the end of the century will enable mature student intake to third level to increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 1994, the management of Trinity House School, <Col N="71" /> in conjunction with my Department, undertook a major review of programme content and delivery in the school.  The object of this exercise was to maximise the effectiveness of the programmes in contributing to the rehabilitation of the children.</P>
      <P>Arising from this review, programmes were updated and steamlined and new management systems were introduced. The impact of the revised procedures was assessed again in October 1995.  It was found that there had been a marked improvement in the boys' behaviour, both while in the school and while on home leave and mobility trips.</P>
      <P>Key indicators of behaviour, such as assaults on staff, assaults on other boys and levels of attempted abscondings were noted to be significantly reduced.</P>
      <P>It is too early to gauge the likely impact of the revised policies on the rate of re-offending.  This will only emerge over time and will be monitored by the school.  However, I hope the positive changes observed in the boys' behaviour while in the school will continue when the boys return to the community.  The Deputy will appreciate that the environment to which a boy returns after leaving the school can have a major impact on his subsequent behaviour.</P>
      <P>While the level of re-offending by children who leave our centres continues to be a matter of concern, I would point out that experience in this country compares favourably with that in other countries.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the yearly cost per place in Trinity House School was £79,921. While every effort is made to control costs in this area, it must be noted that Trinity House School is a secure facility catering for the most difficult juvenile offenders and, as such, has staffing levels and other cost factors related to security and control which are not required in other centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Government has recently approved the general scheme of a new children Bill. This Bill sets down the framework for <Col N="72" /> the future delivery of services to children in need of special care and those coming into conflict with the law.  One of the fundamental principles set down in the Bill is the proposal that custodial sentences should be applied only as a matter of last resort.  In support of this principle, the Bill proposes a wide range of non-custodial alternatives.  The Bill also envisages a significant rationalisation of the operation of the custodial centres to ensure that they are in a position to meet today's demands.</P>

      <P>Youth encounter projects were first established in 1977 to deliver a specially tailored education service to children who have become alienated from the conventional school system.  The children in question would generally be involved in persistent truancy and would be at risk of becoming involved in petty crime and delinquency.</P>
      <P>There are four such facilities in operation at present.  Two of these are in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick. Each facility caters for about 25 pupils aged between ten to 15 years.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the projects is to rehabilitate the pupils and return them to mainstream schools as soon as possible.  As part of this process, the projects are required to liaise closely with both first and second level schools in their catchment areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at present have any plans to further develop the youth encounter projects.  However, I have introduced a range of initiatives aimed at reducing early school leaving and pupil alienation. The measures in question include the special support schemes for pupils in <Col N="73" /> disadvantaged areas, the home-schoolcommunity liaison schemes, and the pilot scheme of teacher counsellors.  In addition, I recently launched a further special initiative aimed at breaking the cycle of educational disadvantage in targeted urban and rural areas.</P>

      <P>The most recent data on participation in higher education by socio-economic group are those based on a national survey of the 1992 entrants to higher education.  The data are contained in tabular format in the report Access to College: Patterns of Community and Change by Professor Patrick Clancy.  This report was published by the Higher Education Authority in November 1995.  The information requested by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>There is no international comparative data readily available on participation rates in higher education by socio-economic groups.  However, the results of research projects and national reviews undertaken by a number of EU member states indicate the pervasiveness of social class inequality in educational attainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper Charting Our Education Future, it is a major policy objective of the Government to promote equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age or disability, for all who have the capacity to benefit from it.  There is no single or simple solution to this problem. Rather it requires persistent, targeted and regularly evaluated policies <Col N="74" /> which seek over time to redress present imbalances.  Educational underachievement is, in many cases, rooted in wider and fundamental social inequalities and differences and has its roots, in many cases, in early childhood.  Accordingly, initiatives in relation to participation in third level education are the culmination of strategies to tackle educational disadvantage throughout a child's schooling.</P>

My Department has consulted with the main interest groups, including the youth organisations, the local voluntary youth councils and the relevant Vocational Education Committee.  I expect that the Government will be in <Col N="75" /> a position to consider the Heads of the youth service Bill in the very near future.  Following clearance by the Government of the Heads, the matter will be referred to the Parliamentary Draftsman to draft the Bill.  I hope to have the Bill published before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a few areas in Dublin where parents are having difficulty in enrolling children for next September.  My Department is addressing these problems at present.  I would be very concerned that any parent would be obliged to send a child to a private school because of a shortage of places in a national school.</P>
      <P>The enrolment policy of national schools is generally a matter for the board of management of each school. However, my Department expects that schools will cater for their immediate catchment area in the first instance.  If, after that, places remain available, schools may enrol pupils from outside their area, should there be a demand. Where more than one school caters for an area or parish, it is expected that these schools will liaise to ensure that all children in the area can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>Individual schools should alert my Department, in good time, where the need for additional accommodation is anticipated or where alternative arrangements need to be made to provide extra pupil places.  If the Deputy provides me with the details of particular cases he may have in mind, I will have these fully investigated.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to restore the part-time remedial teacher service to the school referred to by the Deputy.  Remedial teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need and are subject to ongoing review by my Department's inspectorate.  Following such a review, it was decided to reorganise the service in question to meet the remedial needs of pupils attending another school in the area.  However, I would remind the Deputy that the school to which he refers continues to have the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools.  I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.

All applications for support under this scheme were carefully considered by my Department.  It was decided that funding under the pilot phase of the scheme should be concentrated to facilitate the appointment of escorts on services to special schools and special classes for children with a physical handicap, and provide assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing-impaired and visually-impaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.

      <P>As promised in my reply to Questions Nos. 159 and 160 of 13 February 1996 I arranged for inspectors from my Department to investigate this case.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is due to complete primary education in 1997.  The pupil's needs at second level continue to be investigated and considered by my Department's inspectors and psychologists.  They are also considering the appropriate provision which may be made for the pupil, including the provision of a visiting teacher or resource teacher.  When the matter has been fully considered and reviewed, the pupil's parents will be contacted and the Deputy will be advised of the position.</P>

      <P>The psychological service of my Department is available on a limited basis to second level schools and has also been extended in 1995 to primary schools serving a certain number of disadvantaged areas.  While the psychologists employed by my Department provide a psychological assessment service for pupils having a broad range of learning and other disabilities, they <Col N="82" /> have not been recruited for the provision of specialist services in respect of particular disabilities.  For the most part psychologists doing such work, in relation to sensory disabilities especially, have been provided by the National Rehabilitation Board, which comes under the auspices of the Department of Health.  There are no plans to extend the Department of Education's psychological service in 1996.  Any such extension must be within the limits of my Department's administrative budget.</P>
      <P>When further expansion of the Department of Education's psychological service becomes possible the needs of pupils having various disabilities will be considered.  Senior officials of my Department met with representatives of FEACH in January 1996.  In the light of budgetary restrictions I do not feel that a meeting at this stage would advance the organisation's cause.</P>

      <P>The staffing allocation made to each disadvantaged school is set at a level which enables the school authorities to ensure that no class will have more than 29 pupils.  In response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of education disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question inviting them to apply for consideration under the initiative.  The centre will prioritise all applications in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit fiveyear development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on <Col N="84" /> the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>The White Paper, <i>Charting Our Education Future</i>, indicates that each school will be expected to provide students with experience across a number of curricular areas at junior certificate level.  The White Paper also indicates that some of these curricular areas e.g. guidance, social, personal and health education including relationships and sexuality education, civic, social and political education may best be provided in the form of short courses or modules.</P>
      <P>Already civic, social and political education is being introduced as a short or modular course of 70 hours duration over three years.  Social, personal and health education will be introduced in a similar manner.</P>
      <P>I do not have any plans to introduce a modular system for all subjects in the junior certificate.  The White Paper indicates that modular and short courses on a variety of subject areas will be developed and introduced gradually to junior certificate students.</P>

      <P>The White Paper indicates that, while external examinations will continue to be the main instrument of assessing achievement in the leaving certificate, a wider range of assessment techniques will be necessary.  These techniques will be used to evaluate the range of skills, now demanded in a modern society, including thinking and innovation skills, practical skills, research and problem-solving skills as well as the ability to apply knowledge.</P>
      <P>The modes and techniques of assessment for the leaving certificate at higher, ordinary and foundation levels are and will be consistent with the objectives of the syllabi in so far as is feasible.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is revising the leaving certificate syllabi on a phased basis.  The assessment objectives are laid out on a subject by subject basis.

    <P>The report, Delivering Better Government, which was launched on 2 <Col N="90" /> May 1996 sets out the Government's programme of change for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>A key element in the successful implementation of the programme is effective communications on the nature and scope of the change proposed.  For this reason, the launch on 2 May had two important dimensions &mdash; internally within the Civil Service and externally. Professional advice on the design and implementation of the appropriate communications strategy was retained in order to ensure that the most effective methods of communication were put in place.  The costs incurred relate to the development of the overall communications strategy in respect of the programme and to its continued implementation over the longer term.</P>
    <P>In addition to the external launch in Dublin Castle on 2 May, Delivering Better Government was also launched to the 30,000 civil servants in all Departments and offices.  All Departments and offices within the Civil Service organised briefing sessions for their staff at all locations and the costs incurred covered the production of the report, a summary report which was made available to all staff, leaflets setting out the main issues arising in respect of individual Departments and offices and briefing material. The majority of these briefings took place on 2 May.  Briefings were also organised for the trade unions and the Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>Ireland participates in the Bretton Woods institutions as a full member state.  Almost all of the powers of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund lie, initially, with the board of governors.  Each member state is represented by one governor, usually a Minister.  In Ireland's case, the Minister for Finance is the Governor on the <Col N="97" /> boards of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>Ireland's voice is exercised at the jointly held annual meetings of both bodies where the board of governors agree on the policies, budgets etc. of the relevant bodies.  In addition, such occasions offer opportunities for informal exchanges which occur on the fringes of the formal meetings.</P>
      <P>The board of governors in practice delegates its authority to a much smaller group of representatives &mdash; the board of executive directors.  There are 24 executive directors in the Bank and in the Fund.  The boards are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organisation. The executive directors also present to the board of governors an audit of accounts, an administrative budget, the annual report and any other matters that, in their judgment require submission to the board of governors. Matters may be submitted to the board of governors at its annual meetings or at any time during the year.</P>
      <P>At board of directors level, Ireland shares a constituency with Canada and certain Caribbean countries.  In each case Canada holds the executive directorship. In both institutions Ireland has resident representation at the board.  In the case of the IMF, Ireland is represented by an alternate director; in the case of the World Bank by an adviser to the executive director.  The Irish authorities maintain ongoing contact with the directors concerned through our resident representatives.  The directors also visit the Irish authorities for direct consultations.</P>
      <P>In the context of the World Bank Group, it is relevant that Ireland participates in the International Development Association (IDA).  This association is an affiliate of the World Bank which makes finance available to the poorest countries at concessional terms.  The overall policies of the IDA are negotiated at regular intervals on an inter-governmental basis.  Approval of projects under the IDA mandate is at the level of the Board of Directors, which is the same as that of the World Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The IBEC document to which the Deputy refers addresses the role of Government in the economy in two respects i.e. the provision of services by the State and the level of Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>In relation to the former, the operation of the public service and its delivery mechanisms are under continuous active review, not least as part of the strategic management initiative. Further, many commercial State bodies are now operating successfully to a commercial mandate.  This is an important dimension of the drive to improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy. Very significant progress has been made and continues to be made along these lines.  I am convinced that this has contributed in no small measure to the current strength of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>In regard to the latter, IBEC has specified a target of 37.5 per cent for public expenditure as a share of national output by the year 2000.  At present, public spending accounts for approximately 45 per cent of GNP.  To meet IBEC's target would require a reduction in spending of the order of £2,700 million or £700 million per annum in current terms.  Most of these spending cuts would have to fall on current supply services i.e. the day-to-day cost of running Government programmes and services. Adjusting current spending programmes on this scale would present a major challenge and would involve significant reductions in the existing level of public services.  Unfortunately, the IBEC document does not specify how it considers such an adjustment in spending might be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> In principle, I accept that setting targets for public spending, whether by reference to the annual rate of increase, as this Government has done, or by its share of GNP as IBEC has suggested, can be an effective and straight forward means of controlling public spending. The specification of a target should, of course, be accompanied by a coherent strategy to achieve the target while, at the same time, avoiding too severe a dislocation of essential public services. With the latter objective in mind, the aim of the Government is, nevertheless, to maintain firm control over growth in public expenditure in the medium term.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation of commercial property is net annual value i.e. the rental value of the property.  Under the Valuation Acts any improvements, alterations of change of use that affects the rental value of a property must be taken into account in assessing the rateable valuation.  The provision of a new or improved shop front might or might not lead to a change in the rateable valuation. The urban renewal scheme has been instrumental in transforming many formerly derelict areas of our larger towns and cities.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Customs service has primary responsibility for preventing the illegal importation of controlled drugs.  In the Single Market era, the Customs service is required to play an increased role in protecting not only our own frontier, but also the Irish section of the external EU frontier against the illegal importation of drugs.  As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the <Col N="104" /> Revenue Commissioners responded to that situation by allocating substantial resources to this area, in particular by setting up the Customs National Drugs Team in 1992 with specific responsibility for detecting and preventing drug-smuggling. This dedicated team operates on a countrywide basis, including at air and sea ports, and it also supplements the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for combating drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in 1991, the number of staff assigned exclusively to dealing with drug-smuggling was 12.  This special resource consisted of one drug unit at headquarters, four sniffer-dog units and one maritime unit.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the Customs National Drugs Team is 69 and comprises head office staff, three operational units, 13 intelligence units, five maritime units and six sniffer-dog units. I would stress again that this dedicated team is in addition to the general body of Customs officers distributed around the country whose duties include work to combat drug-smuggling.</P>
      <P>The Customs service and the Garda co-operate closely in fighting drug-trafficking under their new memorandum of understanding.  Customs have also enlisted the assistance of companies and organisations engaged in the importexport trade in fighting drug-smuggling through the memorandum of understanding programme as well as the general public through the drug watch programme, which encourages coastal communities and maritime personnel to report unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs by freefone or freepost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Customs service already plays a most important role in combating drug-smuggling and there are no plans to extend this role.  I am satisfied that the present resources available to Customs in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies are adequate.  The deployment of resources is, of course, kept under constant review.  The main <Col N="105" /> focus will continue to be on intelligence driven operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are committed to applying the tax laws against persons who may have derived profits or gains from illegal activities including drug trafficking.  I am satisfied, on the basis of my discussions with, and assurances from, the Commissioners that they are using their powers as best they can in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are considerable difficulties for Revenue in dealing with this type of case. As the individuals concerned carry on their activities in a clandestine fashion, they are not amenable to the normal controls and checks which Revenue brings to bear in the detection of tax evasion.  Properties or bank accounts with which they may be associated will not necessarily appear in their names. Consequently, the Revenue task is focused on establishing the level of wealth and asset ownership of such persons and in addition to its own researches, Revenue is dependent on receiving hard information from other agencies &mdash; in particular the Garda &mdash; to progress inquiries which may have to proceed over a long period.  Anecdotal information is of little value in itself as it does not conclusively identify asset <Col N="106" /> ownership, and indeed in some instances can be misleading.</P>
    <P>Where Revenue can establish the necessary information they will make an assessment to tax under section 19 of the Finance Act 1983 which provides that profits from an illegal or unknown source may be assessed to tax under the description &ldquo;Miscellaneous Income&rdquo;. This mechanism represents a recognition by the Oireachtas of the difficulties involved, in that Revenue does not have to prove that the profits are derived from drugs trafficking &mdash; in most cases, Revenue will not be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that over the past few years they have been inquiring into the tax affairs of certain individuals in relation to whom information received suggested that their wealth and lifestyle could not be supported by known sources of income.  These include the persons referred to in the comments attributed to the State Solicitor in Cork. There are currently approximately 40 such cases under various stages of inquiry.  I understand that two of the 40 cases have recently been assessed under the miscellaneous income description and it is expected that further assessments will be entered in the coming months in other cases.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a separate record has not been kept that would enable Revenue to indicate total tax collected in &ldquo;section 19&rdquo; cases and, indeed, not all such tax would necessarily relate to drugs cases.  However, Revenue has indicated that in a number of cases that could readily be identified in recent years, a sum in the region of £1 million was collected in respect of miscellaneous income assessments, of which a relatively small amount refers to the two years mentioned by the Deputy.  As I have indicated, the work of making further assessments is ongoing.</P>

      <P>Ballymun was designated in 1993 under the 1986 urban renewal scheme which terminated at end-July 1994.  In order to <Col N="108" /> assist developers experiencing difficulties in getting tenants for their premises, a two year extension for lease signing for double rent purposes was provided for in the 1994 Finance Act which brought the termination date to 31 July 1996 in the case of the general designated areas.  With regard to the question of cost, I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information sought is not available at present and that a detailed examination of the individual tax files, which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost, would be required to obtain it.</P>
      <P>A review is now taking place of the last ten year's experience of urban renewal so as to better inform future policy in this area.  As part of this review, a team of independent consultants have been engaged and are expected to make their findings known during the summer.  Until this review is completed and evaluated, it has been decided that there will be no further designations at this stage.</P>
      <P>In any event, as the Deputy rightly points out, even with designated status the redevelopment of Ballymun Town Centre does not appear to be a huge success.  I feel in the circumstances that there may be other more appropriate options which might be better suited to meeting the particular needs of the Ballymun area.  One such option would be the granting of aid under the EU URBAN Initiative operated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>This programme focuses on finding solutions to serious social problems in depressed urban areas through supporting schemes for economic and social revitalisation, the renovation of facilities and infrastructures and environmental improvement.  A sum of about £16 million is to be made available to Ireland under the initiative with co-financing of about £4 million to be provided by the Exchequer.  The URBAN programme will apply in areas of Cork and Dublin. Ballymun is among the areas selected in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Operational Programme for the Initiative has been <Col N="109" /> sent to the EU Commission and that provisional funding levels have been agreed.  URBAN would appear to be a more suitable source of aid for the Ballymun Centre than double rent allowance which has not been successful to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 119, 120, 121, 122 and 123 together.  As I see it, four main issues are raised: classification as an &ldquo;emergency service&rdquo;, rate of pay, &ldquo;eating-on-site&rdquo; allowance and manning of ambulance vehicles.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service was published in November 1993.  The group stated in their report that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the Garda and fire service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is accepted that the ambulance service acts as an emergency service in respect of its accident and emergency work, it must also be accepted <Col N="117" /> that approximately half of all ambulance calls are not of an emergency nature but are related to the routine transport of patients.  In addition, classification as an emergency service does not suggest that ambulance personnel are being asked to carry out the same duties as either the fire service personnel or indeed the Garda.</P>
    <P>A claim was lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993. The claim sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994, during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a range of productivity-efficiency measures, with referral for binding third party decision in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place since then to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity-flexibility measures.  This has been a complex set of discussions in the context of the publication, in December 1993, of the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service which heralded a new strategy for dealing with the major policy issues which had arisen in the ambulance service and which had not been addressed in a comprehensive way by the health service.</P>
    <P>A number of outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Relations Commission in January 1995.  Arising from these conferences a set of proposals were agreed and put to a ballot of the membership.  In July 1995 SIPTU advised that the proposals had been rejected.  A number of meetings have been held since then to try to progress these talks to a satisfactory conclusion. Two meetings have already been held in the last fortnight at the LRC and a further meeting is scheduled for next week.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that this issue can be <Col N="118" /> resolved at a very early date.  With the monetary aspects of this deal already agreed, the Department is anxious, at this stage, to finalise the details of the productivity and flexibility measures as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The monetary sum quoted in the questions would seem to refer to the &ldquo;travel&rdquo; allowance as opposed to the &ldquo;eating-on-site&rdquo; allowance.  Both of these allowances emerged originally from their introduction in the local authority Dublin metropolitan and were subsequently extended to the Eastern Health Board &mdash; Dublin area. It should be noted that ambulance personnel in the Dublin area are not in receipt of the &ldquo;eating-on-site&rdquo; allowance.</P>
    <P>These allowances have been the subject of a number of Labour Court cases for the non-nursing group of employees as a whole.  Consistently, the court has recommended that allowances such as these, should not be extended to employees working outside the Dublin area.  Particular emphasis has been laid on the origins of the allowances and the fact it would be &ldquo;neither practical or desirable that these payments should be extended.&rdquo;  [LRC 10319].</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that this issue represents a cost-increasing claim.  This group are entitled to only one such claim in the lifetime of the current agreement on pay as incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The claim for pay parity represents their claim under this agreement.</P>
    <P>Ambulance vehicles are manned by a two person crew.  This crew may incorporate a driver and an attendant, two interchangeable qualified drivers; or a driver and an ambulance nurse.  The report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service recommends that each emergency ambulance should be staffed by two trained personnel, with at least one having successfully completed the advanced training programme. Where a nurse is employed as part of the ambulance service she/he will act as an ambulance person and perform the <Col N="119" /> duties as set out in the report of the review group.  The recommendations regarding the training of ambulance personnel are currently being addressed by all health boards.</P>

Following agreement, it is expected that the review group will finalise its report.  I hope to publish the report as soon as it is presented to me.</P>

However, the physiotherapist providing the service at Carndonagh Community Hospital also provides a service in the Buncrana district, which results in a waiting list for non-urgent cases.  The board is currently running a competition for physiotherapists, with a view to filing vacant posts.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): In the first instance, capital developments in County Donegal are a matter for the North-Western Health Board.  There is a proposed new health centre at Moville, County Donegal and I allocated £100,000 in capital funding towards this project in 1995.</P>
      <P>The health board is looking at the feasibility of incorporating a day centre for the elderly as part of the new health centre proposal.  However, the board's final decision will depend on the resources available and the competing capital priorities within their region.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department, in conjunction with the health boards, is currently preparing a five year development plan <Col N="123" /> for services to persons with a mental handicap to meet the needs identified by the new national mental handicap database.</P>
      <P>The national plan will be based on regional plans which the health boards, with the assistance of the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees, are currently compiling.  The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, <i>Needs and Abilities,</i> endorsed the direction in which services to persons with a mental handicap had been developing and provided a blueprint for service delivery into the next century. However, it is generally accepted that the estimates in relation to the numbers of persons with a mental handicap requiring services contained in the report were not based on any firm data. The national mental handicap database will provide my Department with a more accurate estimate of both current and future needs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 136 together.  Speech and language therapy services in County Meath are provided under the community care programme within the North-Eastern Health Board.  Services are provided in a number of settings, that is health centres, schools-units and hospitals.  Therapists work with varied caseloads including preschool mental handicap, speech and language disorder, physical handicap and adults.</P>
      <P>Clients-patients attend for an initial assessment appointment.  At this appointment a decision is made on the necessity for therapy.  Depending on the presenting problem, severity and other factors a client is offered regular weekly or fortnightly therapy.  In some cases a review schedule may be appropriate, for example monthly or every three to six months.  It is not possible, to provide figures for the average number of sessions received by each person.  However, in 1995 there were 2,794 child attendances and 371 adult attendances.  Details of the location services are set out in the tables under:</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The subvention scheme which accompanied the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, came into operation on 1 September 1996 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home and without the means to pay for it receive assistance towards that cost. Since the introduction of the scheme on the 31 December 1995 a total of £31.2 million has been expended on subventions and this year, approximately £16 million has been allocated to the scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a working group comprised of officials of my Department and the health boards was established to review the operation of the Nursing Homes Act.  The group reported to me earlier this year.  While the group concluded that the dependent elderly were the people who had benefited most from the Act, it also identified a number of issues which were causing some problems in the effective operation of the Act.  One of these issues was the assessment of adult childrens' circumstances.  Accordingly, the group recommended that the allowances listed in the Third Schedule to the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 (Paragraph 6) which sets out the general rules for the assessment of circumstances of a person who has qualified for a nursing home subvention, be increased.  A draft amendment to the regulations has been prepared by officials of my Department and I expect to bring it into operation in the very near future.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The entitlement of Irish citizens who reside in North America to health services in Ireland is governed by the provisions of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, which introduced the criteria of &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; for determining eligibility for health services in Ireland.  Any person, regardless of nationality who is regarded as ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either category 1 eligibility (i.e. medical card holders) or category 2 eligibility (limited eligibility) for health services.  In this regard, health boards normally regard persons as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he/she satisfies the health board that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Where a person is deemed not be be &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland the health board/hospital may apply the full economic charge for any services provided. However, a health board/hospital has the discretion to provide urgent medical treatment at a reduced charge or without charge where application of the full economic charge would cause undue hardship.  In addition where an Irish national has been resident abroad for a period of up to three years but the health board is satisfied that the person did not establish an entitlement to health services in any other country, the health board would regard the person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he/she requires treatment on returning to Ireland.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to put an exact figure on overall funding for drug treatment prevention programmes, as prevention programmes are just one of a number of initiatives which health boards finance from their overall allocations.  For example, a major part of the work of addiction counsellors and outreach workers is on drug prevention initiatives such as education, one to one counselling, group counselling, advice and drug workshops.  Coupled with this, information campaigns and various voluntary projects make up other drug prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>The total amount of money allocated annually to health boards for drug treatment and prevention has increased steadily since 1992.  For example, the allocation to health boards for these programmes in 1995 was approximately <Col N="136" /> £13 million.  This figure will increase by £4 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy on drug demand reduction measures aims at reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse through information, education and prevention programmes. The recent Government decisions on drug demand reduction measures emphasised that there should be further development of education and prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>Each health board has been asked by my Department to produce proposals for such programmes and these will be supported by funding from my Department.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): There is no statutory basis for compelling a drug misuser to undergo treatment, unless it is ordered by the Courts on foot of a conviction under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.  It is generally recognised that successful treatment outcomes for those addicted to drugs are achieved where drug misusers themselves are committed to undergoing treatment for their addiction.</P>
      <P>It has also been recognised internationally that the provision of methadone maintenance programmes to intravenous drug misusers can be a first step in the process of getting somebody addicted to drugs to deal with his/her addiction.</P>

The Government has made an additional £7 million available in 1996 to allow work in reducing excessive waiting times to continue and orthopaedic surgery will continue to be a priority area in the allocation of waiting list funding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is currently no limit on the number of drug misusers who can attend any one pharmacy in order to have methadone dispensed.  Up to the present, because only a relatively small number of pharmacies have been involved, the tendency has been for such pharmacies to attract large numbers of drug misusers.  However, a pilot scheme for the prescribing of methadone by general practitioners commenced in March, 1996, and in accordance with the scheme, the maximum number of patients attending any general practitioner will be ten.  It is intended also that numbers attending any pharmacy participating in the scheme will be kept low.  For example, a total of 22 pharmacists have become <Col N="140" /> involved to date, with a total of 45 patients.  I am hopeful that the success of the scheme will encourage more pharmacists to become involved, which will, in turn, mean that numbers attending each pharmacy will be small.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is that sheep farmers who wish to enter the rural environment protection scheme (REPS), which is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, receive payments for farming in an environmentally friendly manner. Farmers with land in the proposed natural heritage areas (NHAs) receive an additional payment (approximately 20 per cent on top of the basic premium) for farming in such a manner as to assist the conservation of the proposed NHAs.</P>
      <P>As the payments are made for environmentally friendly farming, farmers with land in proposed NHAs that are overgrazed will be required to reduce their flock size.  This is necessary in order to ensure compliance with the REPS conditions and to satisfy the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>An <i>ad-hoc</i> committee, consisting of representatives of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Teagasc, the IFA, the ICMSA and conservation organisations has been established to examine the question of overgrazing and to recommend stocking densities.</P>

    <P>This committee has yet to reach agreement.  However, as a similar committee was successful in prescribing farm management plans in respect of the Burren, I am confident that an agreement on stocking levels will be <Col N="143" /> arrived at that will ensure the conservation of the sites and the continuance of sheep farming throughout the country.</P>

The areas proposed for designation as NHAs have been identified solely on scientific grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that adequate prior consultation will take place with land owners and occupiers and with other interested parties.  All <Col N="144" /> such parties will have an opportunity to make their views known regarding any proposed designations and indeed to object to such designations.  All views expressed will be taken into account prior to final decisions being taken in regard to designation.</P>
    <P>Formal designation of sites as NHAs will only take place after this consultation procedure has been completed and after the Wildlife Act, 1976, is amended and a formal system for hearing objections is established.</P>

      <P>The area referred to in my reply of 15 May 1996 included the section between the new local authority houses and Spenser Dock Bridge.  The property in this area, apart from a strip approximately 1m wide along the edge of the canal, was retained by CIE when the canals were transferred to the Waterways Service and remains in the ownership of CIE.</P>
      <P>While my policy, as previously outlined, is to try to open up the waterways, including the Royal Canal, for recreational use by the public to the maximum extent possible, I accept that the general condition of this particular area and the very limited space that is owned by my Department make the area unsuitable for general recreational use at present.  I have, therefore, asked the waterways service to bring the Deputy's concern about access to the area to the attention of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy has other difficulties relating to access in this area, I will be <Col N="145" /> glad to arrange for the waterways service to contact him directly to try to resolve them.</P>

It has never been the practice for the Minister to issue such directions and I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to do so in this case.

While the overall 3 per cent quota has not yet been met by all authorities, my Department has, for a number of years, been actively encouraging them to achieve the quota, and substantial progress has been made since the end of 1991 when only 0.63 per cent of local authority staff were people with disabilities. My Department wrote to all city and county managers again on 8 May 1996 reminding them of the objective that the 3 per cent quota be reached as soon as possible in all local authorities and recommending specific measures, taking account of the advice of a working group which had considered the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 184 together.  My Department has raised a number of queries on this proposed scheme with Donegal County Council and a response is awaited.  However, having regard to the existing level of commitments under the water and sewerage programme, I cannot say when it may be possible to advance the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities do not need sanction from my Department for the advance acquisition of land that will be needed for public water or sewerage schemes.  If and when a scheme is approved for funding, land acquisition <Col N="152" /> costs may be charged to the Department's capital grant.</P>

    <P>There is a provision of £2 million in my Department's Estimates for 1996 for the swimming pool programme.  This provision is fully committed to projects under construction or fully approved and on which work is likely to commence later this year.  Depending on progress these commitments will extend to some degree into 1997.  The 1997 provision will be determined at the appropriate time.  I cannot at this stage, say when it may be possible to give a firm commitment to the funding of the Offaly proposals.</P>

      <P>Three applications were received from Galway Corporation for funding in 1996 under the EU cofinanced scheme of grants, at a cost of £2.2 million.  The Western Distributor Road was included in these proposals. However, as the applications considerably exceeded the appropriate expenditure guideline limit set out by my Department, the proposals were returned to the corporation for revision and resubmission.</P>
      <P>The corporation resubmitted two proposals in December 1995 for funding in 1996 at a cost of £335,000.  The Western Distributor Road was not one of these. Local authorities are advised by my Department that it is accepted that circumstances can arise where a single large high priority project can exceed the expenditure guideline; in such circumstances, only the single project concerned should be submitted for consideration.</P>

      <P>Wexford County Council wrote to my Department on 6 June 1996 outlining the position in relation to this bridge and indicating that, while structural repairs were currently being carried out, the bridge is sub-standard with a restricted carriageway width and poor horizontal alignment.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of the people on the Castlebridge side of Wexford Bridge regarding proposals to close the bridge for ten weeks for repair works with the consequent loss of jobs and trade for many businesses; if he will consider widening the current bridge or providing a new crossing prior to repair works taking place to ensure the protection of jobs and trade in view of the growing demand for a greater crossing capacity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, aware of Wexford County Council's proposals to carry out necessary improvement works on this bridge.  I understand the council consulted fully with all local interests. With officials of my Department I met with local councillors and residentsbusiness people from the Castlebridge side of the bridge to hear their concerns.</P>
      <P>All the options were considered in depth by the county council.  The recommendation by the council that the construction be carried out in the manner proposed, largely as a prefabricated construction on the existing piers with a ten week closure period, is based <i>inter alia,</i> on: least cost and shortest construction period, least disruption to the Ferrybank residents-commercial interests, least likely to have long-term adverse effects and public safety considerations. The council will provide a commuter bus service and a &ldquo;pedestrian&rdquo; ferry between Ferrybank and Wexford town for the closure period to help alleviate disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to widen the existing bridge prior to the repair works taking place is unacceptable on cost-engineering-appearance grounds.  The provision of a new bridge would have to be considered as an entirely separate medium <Col N="163" /> to long-term proposal and not as an alternative to the carrying out of urgently needed improvements to the existing bridge.  The timescale for determining the location of a new bridge would be considerable, in that traffic studies and site investigations would be necessary, and statutory procedures-environmental impact study and possibly a bridge order &mdash; would need to be followed.  The cost of constructing a new bridge, estimated at £10-£12 million, would also be very substantial.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I would be most anxious that all special needs children, including those with muscular dystrophy, would enjoy a thorough, informed and sympathetic educational environment.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached a high priority to improving the quality and level of support services available to children with special educational needs, including those with muscular dystrophy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the response required by such children can vary depending on the particular needs of the individual child concerned.  In some cases, placement in an ordinary primary school can <Col N="169" /> be the most suitable option supported, if necessary, by a remedial or resource teacher.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have appointed an additional 241 remedial teachers and 29 resource teachers to the primary sector.</P>
    <P>In more serious cases, the child may require placement in one of the special schools dedicated to children with a physical handicap.  At the commencement of the current school year I introduced a one unit reduction in the pupil teacher ratio in all such schools.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to review needs in this area to ensure the best possible quality and level of service for all such children within available resources.</P>
    <P>The measures set out in the White Paper in relation to special needs pupils are intended to refine and develop the current range of responses.  A key objective will be to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including those with muscular dystrophy, will have the opportunity of having those needs addressed in their own area and on a basis which is sufficiently flexible to meet the evolving needs of the children concerned.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce a separate education board for Gaeltacht or all-Irish schools.</P>
      <P>The proposals to set up a structure of education boards are clearly set out in the White Paper &ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The education boards will be responsible for servicing all community interests within the education system. They will have a number of advantages over the existing centralised structure in supporting Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools.  In particular, education boards will be situated in close proximity to the schools and communities which they will serve and will have powers to establish specialist groups and/or committees to advise and assist as appropriate in the implementation of policies.</P>
      <P>I realise that Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools are dissimilar to other schools and that therefore special arrangements need to be formulated for them.  For example, arrangements will need to be made for the provision of textbooks and Irish medium teaching materials, as well as incareer development programmes, for these schools at a national level.</P>

      <P>An application for sanction to establish a Gaelscoil in the Knocklyon area is under examination in my Department at present.  Given that the proposed school has not yet been sanctioned, it would be premature at present to consider a longer-term location for the school.</P>
      <P>I do not propose at this stage to take any action on the disposal of the Department's site at Scholarstown Road.  I appreciate that there is strong local feeling in relation to the future of this site.  However, in the circumstances, I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by my meeting a deputation in regard to the issue.</P>

      <P>My Department's responsibility in the pre-school area is limited to its involvement in the delivery of the early start pre-school programme. I have no plans at present to expand this programme.  The general legislative provisions relating to pre-school services are contained in the Child Care Act, 1991, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  The current pilot phase of the early start pre-school programme is focused on schools serving areas which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  The programme has already been expanded in the current school year with the extension of the service to an additional 33 schools.  This brings the total number of pre-school classes now in place to 56 with a capacity to cater for up to 1,680 children.  I have established an expert monitoring committee to advise me on the operation and future development of the early start pre-school programme. This committee is representative of a wide range of interests involved in the provision of pre-school services.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of children with specific learning disability &mdash; Dyslexia &mdash; are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area. Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
      <P>At present, 53 primary schools in the south Tipperary area have a remedial teacher service.  This represents 58 per cent of all primary schools and 77 per cent of pupils in the area.  The White Paper on Education sets out a range of measures aimed at ensuring early detection and intervention where children with special educational needs are concerned. The fundamental objective is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area.  To this end, the White Paper provides for a continuum of provision ranging from specialised back-up services for children attending ordinary schools, to the provision of special facilities dedicated to children with more serious needs.  The needs of children with specific learning disability will be addressed within the comprehensive range of measures set out in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of education disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas. The initiative is in response to reports which I received from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers, and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports.  Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Drumkeen national school is among those recently invited by the education research centre to submit an application for consideration under the scheme.  The centre will prioritise all applications in terms of level of need and will advise my Department of the outcome.  Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit a five year development plan.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>Post-primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than three miles to travel to a pick-up point.  An extension or rerouting of a school transport service to enable a pupil to be picked up or set down at home may only be considered where the pupil is medically handicapped, and the condition is such as to prevent them from making their own way to the pick-up point.  On the basis of the medical evidence submitted, my Department's medical adviser has determined that these conditions do not apply in this case.  As this pupil is already availing of a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme, I regret that I am not in a position to alter the existing arrangements.</P>

Under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a phased programme of assistance by way of a supplementary capitation grant for the provision of caretaking and clerical services in schools was introduced from 1 September 1992.  At present all secondary schools with 200 or more pupils and primary schools with 250 or more pupils are receiving financial assistance from my Department towards the cost of clerical services.  In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis.  It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff as it sees fit.  In the case of the community and comprehensive school sector, all schools have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>

Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools for reading disabilities. Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.

I understand that the gardaí are at present seeking the necessary evidence to submit a number of cases relating to the sale of UK lottery tickets to the Director of Public Prosecutions for decision as to prosecution.</P>
    <P>In relation to the position of charitable lotteries generally, there is a commitment in the Government policy agreement to reform the law relating to administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the Committee on Fund raising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Burton, held a successful conference with a number of charities and other parties in this regard last June.  Work on the preparation of the necessary legislation is proceeding in my Department and it is intended that proposals will be brought before Government as quickly as possible.  To this end an advisory group comprising representatives of a number of organisations working in this area has been established in the context of the finalisation of legislative proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 123 on 6 June 1996, one of the recommendations of the special task force on security for the elderly was that my Department introduce a £2 million grant scheme to provide grant aid to voluntary groups in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.  Subsequently, <Col N="205" /> the Department established an advisory committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association for Victim Support, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána are represented, to devise a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved.</P>
      <P>The scheme, entitled, a Scheme of Community Support for Older People, was advertised on Wednesday, 29 May in the national newspapers.  The scheme is open to any voluntary or communitybased organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people.  It was decided that to make the funds available through voluntary organisations in this way is the most appropriate way of ensuring that the most vulnerable older people are targeted by the scheme.  Voluntary groups operate close to the ground and are aware of the greatest need in their communities. Working with the voluntary sector to deliver these funds to the most needy has the advantage that individual older people need not make an application and can have their needs met with the minimum of administration and without the need for a formal assessment of their circumstances by departmental staff.  I am satisfied this is the most appropriate way in which to structure my Department's response to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deadline for receipt of applications is 28 June 1996.  This is to allow time for my Department to assess all applications and to ensure that those most at risk benefit from the available funds before the onset of winter. However, as indicated above, my Department has been in contact with a number of relevant national organisations prior to the formal advertisement of the scheme with a view to disseminating information on the grants and enabling voluntary organisations to compile applications in advance of the public advertisement.  I am satisfied that this scheme will make a real difference <Col N="206" /> to those vulnerable elderly people most at risk.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has in respect of a solution for persons who commenced paying PRSI contributions at the age of 56 years or older and who currently do not qualify for a contributory old age pension.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961. The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course, covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions.</P>
      <P>However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes. Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time <Col N="207" /> as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on any basis including a lump sum payment would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> puts forward, <i>inter alia</i>, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.  However, they also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156 &mdash; three years &mdash; to 520 &mdash; ten years &mdash; contributions.  The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present.  While in principle I favour a <i>pro rata</i> pension approach, I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996 contains provision to enable the transfer of the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the health boards to this Department.  The Act also provides for some significant improvements in the conditions of the scheme and the assessment of means, as well as a change of title to disability allowance.  It is intended that the transfer will be effective from 2 October 1996.  The necessary arrangements are being made at present and involve my Department, the Department of Health and the eight health boards working together to effect the transfer.  I am confident all of the issues arising in this fairly complex process will be resolved in time to enable the transfer to take place smoothly as planned and with the minimum inconvenience to recipients of the allowance. The Act also contains provision to replace the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit schemes with a single means tested payment called one parent family payment. It is intended that this scheme will come into effect from 2 January 1997.  The necessary arrangements to this end are well in hand.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is currently available to employees on low earnings with children.  A significant number of improvements to FIS were provided for in the 1996 budget, including an increase of £10 in the weekly <Col N="209" /> income limits used to determine entitlement, thereby ensuring that most recipients will receive an increase of £6 per week.  Other improvements in FIS, which came into effect earlier this month, include a reduction, from six to three months, in the minimum period which the employment is expected to last; a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in order to qualify for FIS, from 20 hours per week to 38 hours per fortnight; the extension of FIS to job-sharers and increasing the rate of FIS payable on the birth of a child, rather than awaiting the annual review of entitlement.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed under the programme of renewal to further enhancing the system of child income support.  Various options are being examined by the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare. The group's final report will be published within the next few weeks. The report's recommendations will be studied by my Department in the context of the programme for Government. As the Deputy will know, self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim unemployment assistance. The rate of unemployment assistance payable depends on their means. In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was overpaid in excess of £2,000 by failing to disclose earnings from employment in the 18 months to September 1992. Weekly deductions of £6 were being made from her lone parent's allowance in order to effect recovery.  About half of the amount overpaid has been recovered. In the light of the disimprovement in her circumstances, it has been decided to reduce the deductions from her allowance to £4.00 per week.  Her allowance rate will increase to £75.70 a week as a result of this change.  At this rate, it will take some five years to recover the balance which is just over £1,100 and in the circumstances it is not realistic to reduce the recovery rate further.</P>

      <P>Section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as substituted by paragraph 3 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement, including rent and mortgage interest supplements, to a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  It is a condition of any claimant's entitlement to a supplement under article 9 (2) (d) that a person must not have vacated accommodation provided by a housing authority, or if he has done so, the health board must be satisfied that he had good reason for doing so.  In this case the family in question vacated their local authority house following intimidation.  At present, they are living in bed and breakfast accommodation secured by the Eastern Health Board on their behalf.  They are currently seeking private rented accommodation.  If they secure suitable private rented accommodation, they may apply to the Eastern Health Board for a rent supplement. The board will assess their claim and will advise them of their entitlements.</P>

      <P>These improvements to the disregards in the assessment of means in the case of various social assistance payments include: earnings up to a prescribed amount &mdash; which I have set at £34.10 per week &mdash; from employment of a rehabilitative nature; allowances paid by a health board in respect of accommodation provided for a child under the supported lodgings scheme; income up to a prescribed amount &mdash; which I have set at £2,000 per annum &mdash; received under the rural environment protection scheme and moneys received under the farm retirement scheme.</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions, a wide variety of earnings and other disregards are applied in the assessment of means for the various social assistance payments.  The existing disregards include, in the case of unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance, up to £45 together with travel expenses in assessing earnings of a working spouse or partner; in the case of a recipient of unemployment assistance, £15 plus the daily rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to the persons circumstances in respect of each day worked; in the case of carer's allowance, the first £200 per week of the income of their spouses or partner and in the case of lone parents, the first £24 of earnings per week plus child minding expenses, together with half the earnings in excess of this amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provides for a number of improvements in the provisions for the assessment of means.  In the case of unemployment assistance, for example, the 1996 Act provides for a major reform of the provisions for the assessment of earnings from employment.  Under these provisions, an unemployed person who works up to three days a week may, subject to the level of his or her earnings, qualify for the full rate of unemployment assistance for that week, including payment in respect of the days in the week on which the person worked.  Under the improved arrangements, which are to come into force in October, earnings will be assessed at 60 per cent.  Entitlement to the various social assistance payments is based on the needs of the individual and any of <Col N="215" /> his or her dependants and as such are payable subject to a means test.  I have no proposals to provide for paying the full rate of mean-tested payments to couples with income in excess of £9,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The primary support mechanism for low paid workers with children is family income supplement (FIS) under which families can have income ranging from £195 per week &mdash; £10,140 per annum &mdash; for families with one child, to £334 per week &mdash; £17,368 per annum &mdash; for families with 8 or more children and still qualify for payment.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements in FIS were provided for in this years budget. These improvements, which came into force earlier this month, include: a reduction, from six to three months, in the minimum period which the employment is expected to last; a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in order to qualify for FIS, from 20 hours per week to 38 hours per fortnight; the extension of FIS to job-sharers and increasing the rate of FIS payable on the birth of a child, rather than awaiting the annual review of entitlement.</P>

      <P>The Department's priority is to ensure that claimants receive their payments on the due date.  The payment arrangements for the bulk of social welfare recipients are not affected by bank holidays.  Given the wide range of social welfare schemes and payment schedules, payment may be due on any day of <Col N="216" /> the working week.  A significant number of unemployed people now receive payment on Monday and when this coincides with a bank holiday the standard procedure is to bring payment forward to the preceding Friday.  In the case of extended public holiday periods such as Easter and Christmas, the practice is for two weeks' entitlement to be paid simultaneously.</P>
      <P>In general, this arrangement meets with the approval of the majority of unemployed persons.  The alternative would be for payments to be paid a day later than normal for these customers due to the intervening bank holiday.  I recognise, however, that the special arrangements at bank holidays may present difficulties for some people and the position is being examined to determine whether an acceptable alternative can be found which would accommodate their difficulties.</P>

      <P>Section 37 of the Social Welfare Act, 1996, provides for a number of amendments to the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, relating to the assessment of means for social assistance payments. For example, in the case of a person who has attained pensionable age &mdash; age 66 &mdash; income received under the EU early retirement scheme from farming and administered by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is now disregarded in the calculation of social welfare non-contributory pensions and allowances.  However, the question of a disregard of occupational pensions in general in order to establish entitlement to a social welfare non-contributory pension and thereby the free schemes would have major cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of the resources available.</P>
      <P>In last January's budget, I announced a number of improvements in the free schemes of telephone rental allowance, electricity allowance and colour television licence.  From next month these schemes will be extended to low income pensioners who do not qualify at present because they do not get a social welfare pension.  The weekly income limit that is being fixed for this purpose will be the new maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension &mdash; £75 per week &mdash; plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.  In determining the income limit for individual pensioners, account will also be taken of any increases, including the over 80 allowance and the living alone allowance, which would have been payable had the pensioner concerned been in receipt of old age contributory pension. In this regard, the adult dependant allowance will be determined by reference to age &mdash; under or over age 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensioners whose net weekly means are under the income limit and who have access only to free travel at present will now, for the first time, have access to the other free schemes referred to <Col N="218" /> above.  Applicants for the carer's allowance from my Department who are in receipt of income under the EU early retirement scheme will not have that income assessed against them in determining the rate of carer's allowance provided that the applicants are aged 66, or over.</P>

      <P>Policy related to the recruitment of staff in companies grant-aided to establish in this country is for the relevant State agencies to <Col N="219" /> determine and I have no function in that regard.  However, I am informed by IDA Ireland that, while it is very sympathetic to the need to provide employment opportunities for people with disabilities, it would not be possible to compel grant assisted companies to do so.  The attraction of foreign investment is an extremely competitive business and, because our competitors do not have such a requirement, we would lose mobile projects to them.  The net result would be a reduction in employment possibilities for everybody.</P>
      <P>IDA has, however, been examining the introduction of a voluntary code among its clients relating to the employment of people with disabilities.

Forbairt, in providing support to Irish companies, encourages the provision of facilities to allow for the employment of disabled persons.  While recruitment is a matter for each individual company, the experience of Forbairt is that there is an openness on the part of Irish companies to develop in a co-operative and constructive way within the communities in which they are located.  This involves facilitating, where possible, the employment of people from local communities, including people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is currently involved in completing a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law <Col N="220" /> and that the issue of published material being made available in a form readable to people with significant visual impairments forms part of that review.  The outcome of the review will be seen in new copyright legislation which will attempt to balance the rights of owners and users taking into account our international obligations under the Berne Convention on literacy and artistic works.</P>
      <P>Article 9.1 of the convention provides for authors the exclusive right to authorise the reproduction of their works in any manner or form and only allows members of the convention to permit reproduction of works in certain special cases provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.  My Department is currently examining this issue with a view to seeing if we can draft some legislative provisions which will enable copyright owners and users live within the terms of this provision of the convention. In the digital age it is not easy to see what solution can be reached but I am confident that a settlement fair to all interested parties will be arrived at. The Deputy will also be aware of contacts between publishers and groups representing the visually impaired which have taken place in an effort to ensure that the latter group are in no way deprived of access to literary material.  It is my understanding that these contacts go back some time and that the publishers are keen to facilitate access to works by all sectors of the community whilst maintaining control over their exclusive private property right to permit or prohibit reproductions of works and their ability to control the use of digital copies of their work.  I would urge both parties to these discussions to negotiate in a full and frank manner and endeavour to come to an equitable solution to this difficult problem as agreed solutions will always be preferable to legislative dictate.</P>

      <P>As a general rule, employment protection legislation applies to persons employed in accordance with a contract of employment. <Col N="222" /> Certain Acts require employees to have a minimum period of service with their employer in order to qualify for coverage e.g. the redundancy payments legislation sets a threshold of 104 weeks' continuous service for eligibility purposes.</P>
      <P>In referring to &ldquo;contract workers&rdquo; in his question it is understood that the Deputy means workers employed on fixed term contracts of employment. Such workers are generally covered by the individual pieces of employment protection legislation where they meet with the relevant qualification criteria.</P>
      <P>An important exception is the unfair dismissals legislation.  The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993, do not cover employees on fixed term or fixed purpose contracts who are let go when the contract expires or the purpose ceases provided the contract is signed by both parties and specifies that the Unfair Dismissals Acts do not apply to such dismissals. However, since the 1993 amending legislation, a Rights Commissioner-the Employment Appeals Tribunal may consider whether the employment of a person on a series of two or more fixed contracts, between which there was no more than three months of a break, was for the purpose of avoidance by the employer of liability under the Acts.  Where it is so found, the Acts will be deemed to apply and the length of the various contracts may be added together for the purpose of eligibility.</P>

      <P>Under the 1995 suckler cow premium scheme non-beef breed cows such as friesians were not eligible for premium.  This followed a transition period of two years (1993 and 1994) during which friesians were acceptable for premium in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The position in 1995 was that where an applicant for the premium openly declared friesian cows on his/her application form the animals in question were simply deleted from the application and payment was made only in respect of meat breed animals.</P>
      <P>However, in a small number of cases applicants declared cows in 1995 as belonging to a meat breed while the same cows were declared as non-meat breeds in 1994.  In all such cases the animals were inspected.  Under the terms and conditions of the 1995 scheme the penalty for declaring a non-meat breed as a meat breed was non-payment under the 1995 scheme and exclusion from the 1996 scheme.  Anyone penalised in this manner had an opportunity to appeal the decision following which the animals in question were again inspected by a different inspecting officer.  I had my officials discuss the level of penalty in these cases with officials of the Commission but the change in declaration of breed was considered serious enough to warrant such a penalty.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission has made proposals in relation to a compensation package for beef producers who have suffered income losses due to the BSE crisis.  The proposals allow for a general top-up of the special beef premium and suckler cow premium and for an additional amount of money to be allocated to member states for targeting certain producers.  Winter finisheres are clearly a category of producer that have been hardest hit by the crisis and I will be seeking to have compensatory payments targeted at those producers through the deseasonalisation premium.</P>
      <P>Heifers have not been included in the beef support measures for many years on the basis that support for male cattle and suckler cows provides adequate support for beef producers generally. However, I am very much aware of the difficulties which specialist heifer producers have undergone since the beginning of the crisis and I am, therefore, prepared to consider the merits of those heifer producers who do not derive any specific income from EU funded schemes.</P>

      <P>There are as yet no European Union directives or guidelines in force within my area of responsibility regarding the provision of accessible public transport.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on the Citizens' Network which was published by the European Commission earlier this year addresses a wide range of issues relating to public transport systems, including the question of improved access to these systems for people with disabilities.  The Green Paper has been circulated to organisations representing the interests of the people with disabilities as part of a general consultative process initiated by the Commission.  During its Presidency, Ireland intends to provide a full opportunity to the EU Transport Council for a constructive discussion of the proposals in the Green Paper.  This discussion will help provide guidance to the Commission on possible future legislative or policy initiatives on the issues covered by the document.</P>

      <P>Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, the Irish Aviation Authority is empowered to make Orders relating to its functions. The Act requires the Authority to inform the Minister of its intention to make any such Orders and of the purpose of the Orders.

      <P>The 1995 Order which the Deputy refers to, with the Air Navigation (Fees) (Amendment) Order, 1996 (S.I. No. 49 of 1996) which amended the 1995 Order, was made by the Authority under Section 60 of the 1993 Act.  This section specifically empowers the Authority to make Orders prescribing fees payable to it in respect of the statutory regulatory services which it provides.</P>
      <P>All Orders made by the Authority under the 1993 Act are required, under section 6 of the Act, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  Section 6 provides that any such Order can be annulled if a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either such House within the subsequent 21 sitting days on which the House has sat after the Order is laid before it.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan covering the period 1994 to 1999, total investment in the mainline rail network will amount to approximately £275 million. This investment will be focused on track renewal, modern signalling systems and rolling stock in accordance with the overall policy framework set out in the <Col N="232" /> Operational Programme for Transport. All major lines on the inter-urban mainline railway network, including the Dublin-Sligo line, are included in the proposed investment programme.  The EU authorities have requested that an independent cost benefit analysis be undertaken before the proposed investment on some routes, including the DublinSligo line, can be approved.  It is not possible, therefore, to give the precise details of individual investments on particular lines pending the outcome of the analysis and associated consultations which are ongoing with the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The allocation of rolling stock to the Dublin-Sligo route falls entirely within the day to day responsibilities of the boards and management of Coras Iompair Éireann and Iarnród Éirean and I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320, 321, 322 and 323 together.  Senior Counsel and the solicitors for the Loran C planning appeal were engaged by the Commissioners of Irish Lights who are acting on an agency basis on behalf of the Department of the Marine in respect of the Loran C project.  Senior Counsels' fees in respect of the planning appeal amounted to £69,990.03 (including VAT), which comprised a brief fee of £36,300, refresher fees of £30,492 and £3,198.03 in respect of consultations and preparatory work.  Solicitors' fees for the planning appeal totalled £41,722.63 (including VAT).  I understand, however, that these legal fees were submitted to the Taxing Master who allowed senior counsel and the solicitors their full fees.  While the Chief State Solicitor's Office has accepted the Taxing Master's decision in respect of the solicitors' fees, senior counsels' fees are the subject of a Supreme Court appeal.</P>
      <P>Ove Arup Ireland are the consulting engineers for the Loran C project and to date have received payment of £201,428, of which £53,629 related to the planning application and appeal.  The remainder of these costs arose in respect of land purchase, site work, contract fees and the procurement of a fire certificate.</P>
      <P>During the planning appeal the Commissioners of Irish Lights called nine expert witnesses at a cost of £39,513, of which £5,198 was in respect of one non-national.</P>
