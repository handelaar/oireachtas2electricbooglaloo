      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and Harney.  I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask for the suspension of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following urgent and important matter: the admission of liability by the Blood Transfusion Service Board for the first time in the hepatitis C controversy and the steps the Minister for Health now proposes to take to amend the scheme of compensation for the hepatitis C tribunal which specifically omits claims for liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to move a motion under Standing Order 30 to seek the suspension of the normal business of this House to discuss an urgent and specific matter, namely, that the Blood Transfusion Board has, for the first time, admitted liability to a hepatitis C victim who died last Tuesday evening. This House needs to debate the circumstances surrounding the concealment of <Col N="1240" /> vital information both to this House and the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien inquiry. We need to stand down the tribunal of inquiry and ensure that the cases which have already been settled there can be reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matters fully I do not consider them to be contemplated by the Standing Order and, therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest.  If there was ever a time when this House should suspend its normal business to discuss a matter which has affected the lives of 1,000 women and their families it is today.  These women got a pittance while the people responsible received golden handshakes.  If there was ever a time when a scandal should be discussed in this House it is today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7-14, inclusive, motions re reports of Committee of Public Accounts; No. 15, Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, Second Stage (Resumed); and No. 1, Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, 1996 [Seanad], Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 7-14, inclusive, shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 26, motion re residential property tax (resumed).  By agreement between the Whips, we will discuss the matter raised by our colleagues after Question Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 7-14, inclusive, satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  I am sure the matter to which the Tánaiste referred has been noted by the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's announcement that we will have a debate but I am sure he will accept that it is unforgivable for the State to bring many of its citizens to the brink of death and despair before admitting liability.  Will the Tánaiste <Col N="1242" /> give a commitment that the Government will consider introducing legislation immediately to deal equitably with all those who have been affected? That is the least it should do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste clarify the nature of the discussion or debate we will have this afternoon?  When I raised this matter on the Order of Business on 28 March following the discovery of documents the Minister for Health rubbished me, said that I did not know what I was talking about and that I should read the report.  I am anxious that we should have an opportunity to put questions to the Minister for Health, statements will not be sufficient.  There was concealment in relation to this matter on behalf of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <P>Matters have been raised by the Opposition parties and we have said that we will provide time.  The Minister for Health will have no difficulty in answering questions.  There has been no concealment in this matter.  We will provide as much time as the parties require this afternoon after Question Time up to the end of which the Minister has commitments.  If the Whips meet immediately after the Order of Business, they can agree the time and the format.  There are no difficulties <Col N="1243" /> about answering questions at the end of that debate.</P>

The Tánaiste will be aware of the case made by the Comptroller and Auditor General about the severe maladministration of the Local Development Fund and other issues in the Taoiseach's Department.  I am not asking the Tánaiste to answer the attacks on the Taoiseach in the report but perhaps he might force the Taoiseach to come into the House and answer those allegations.</P>

    <Title>Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution last week I outlined what I saw as the faults in the Bill.  When the debate adjourned I was dealing with the office of the director of telecommunications regulation.  It is proposed that the director will be a full-time civil servant within the Civil Service appointed by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  It will be an independent office and the officer will be independent in the performance of his or her functions.  Those functions relate to the licensing of apparatus for wireless telegraphy, broadcasting stations, telecommunications services and television retransmission services.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on the retransmission of television services, particularly the so-called deflector system currently operating in many parts of the country. For the following reasons I hope the Minister will deal with this aspect of the business before appointing any director of telecommunications regulation.  The programme for Government specifically states that &ldquo;the Government will seek to allow competition between community television deflector systems and existing MMDS franchise holders&rdquo;.  The decision given in the Cork case clearly stated that there was an obligation on the Government to have the possibility of licensing deflector systems fairly and impartially considered and that it was incorrect to give the monopoly to any one system, as was done in relation to MMDS at the time, without giving fair and open consideration to the other systems.  There was a specific commitment given in Cork by the Taoiseach on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, a policy decision is needed here, and policy making is not the function of a civil servant.  The Government should, therefore, act swiftly and fairly and deal with the many applications for <Col N="1248" /> licensing from deflector groups.  It is most unfair to have community groups who operate those systems on a nonprofit making basis, with no financial resources, threatened with court action by large commercial companies who have a vested interest in this subject in the face of Government failure to comply with the High Court decision directing the Minister to examine their case for licensing and the Government's clear commitment in this regard.  Perhaps it is the intention of the Government to direct the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to license deflector systems.  If so, I would be glad to hear it, and the Government should make the appropriate announcement immediately and take all those community groups facing court action out of their pain.  If it is the Government's intention to throw the responsibility entirely on the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, such a course of action squares neither with its own stated commitment on this matter nor with the community's expectations so assiduously fostered by members of the Government when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot but comment on Deputy Morley's remark about community TV.  I recall the monopoly licences granted by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Communications at the time, Deputy Ray Burke, in 1989 over my protests and my efforts since then to ensure that fairness and justice would apply in regard to community TV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>That proposal was originally adopted by Deputy Jim Mitchell and subsequently adopted by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences were granted by Deputy Ray Burke, then Minister for Communications, in 1989, despite my protests and mine was a lone voice at the time on the issue.  The complex legal and technical difficulties now arising are being tackled but we had to take into account the residue of that <Col N="1249" /> monopoly created by a Fianna Fáil Government.  I continue to hope that a resolution can be found to these complex issues.</P>
      <P>Before coming to the general issues of the Bill I would like to speak on the major technological revolution arising out of which telecommunications will have an increasingly important role to play in all aspects of modern society, particularly rural society.  I am convinced that the problems of peripherality can be minimised, if not entirely resolved, as a result of these developments in technology.  However, these problems of peripherality will not be dealt with unless the cost discrimination which exists at present is removed.  This discrimination arises from the fact that rural Ireland is, in effect, subsidising the phone system through the payment of substantially higher charges for trunk calls.  As a consequence, business costs are substantially higher in country areas.  That makes a mockery of the &ldquo;save the west&rdquo; and other such campaigns &mdash; I notice my namesake and colleague on the Fianna Fáil benches nodding in agreement.  A very necessary instrument of regional policy should be the standardisation, where possible, of the costs of essential goods and services across the country.  A unit of electricity or a bottle of beer costs the same in Ballydehob as in Ballyfermot.  Why, then, does it cost ten times as much for the resident of Ballydehob to phone a Government Department as it costs the resident of Ballyfermot?  The same applies to the cost of a call to a hospital in Dublin, a business supplier or anyone else in Dublin.  This is a legitimate question in the context of this Bill.  Let me bring it further.  Why does it cost the same citizen from Ballydehob three times as much to phone County Hall in Cork as it costs somebody from Cork city.  The same applies to all other business and social calls.  People in rural areas are charged a penal levy by having to pay trunk call rather than local call charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> I will come to what I believe is the solution to that problem.  It is clear that the cost of telecommunications services will be more and more influential in the future in determining the economic vitality of a region.  We are in the early stages of a revolution in the way people use telecommunications channels. Looking ahead, there will be four main areas of use &mdash; the phone, the fax, electronic mail and electronic access to information sources.  Growth in the last two will be enormous.  Voice telephony could be a relatively small part of the total telecommunications usage within ten to 20 years.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the cost of essential services and goods in peripheral areas there are both direct and indirect effects.  Higher costs associated with telecommunications will deter businesses of all kinds from setting up and expanding.  They also affect the quality of life in a region which, in turn, affects the economic and social vitality of a place.  Accordingly, if we are to have a true regional policy, and if we are to make a solid impact on the problems associated with peripherality, telecommunications is the key.  Cost structures must be levelled throughout the country and the ridiculous cost penalty which now exists, whereby those who live, work or holiday in rural Ireland are charged a premium, must be ended.</P>
    <P>As a first stage, arrangements must be put in place to ensure that all county areas can make contact with their county town or city at local call rate.  In west Cork we have the ridiculous situation whereby callers from Skibbereen, Bantry and Castletownbere are charged trunk call rates to contact Cork city.</P>
    <P>The next immediate step should be to ensure that all persons contacting Government Departments can do so at local call rates.  It very much adds to the sense of discrimination that arrangements have been put in place over recent years whereby callers from Dublin to a decentralised office in Cork city, Sligo, or elsewhere can call for the price of a local call.  However, the caller from Ballydehob ringing a Government <Col N="1251" /> Department is charged trunk call rate. That is unfair and unjust.  An arrangement must be put in place whereby callers from anywhere in the country to any local government office are charged local call rates.  The problem will not be finally resolved until there is one flat rate for the country.</P>
    <P>We already have it for Eircell.  It is cheaper to ring County Donegal from west Cork on an Eircell telephone.  By having one local call area, this discrimination against rural areas will be eliminated.  The time has come to end the ridiculous subsidy rural dwellers are expected to pay for use of the telephone service.  Only when this discrimination has ceased will there be the reasonable prospect of encouraging the development of service based industries and business in rural Ireland.  In many ways, the development of that sector may be the solution to the problem of rural depopulation provided that cost penalty is removed.  It has been done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Let us look at examples in other countries, such as the US where there are many remote areas, and compare what has happened over the years.  The factors that affect remote areas are telecommunications, transport and energy. Regulatory authorities for transport were set up in the US as far back as the 1880s, for energy around 1915 and for telecommunications in the 1920s.  Rules were laid down on standardised costs and they have been taken for granted ever since.  The US approach has always been to facilitate areas which have not had economic development.  There was a keenness to encourage development in those areas and the consequence has been that the least likely states, and the least likely parts of other states, have been the beneficiaries of exceptional development.  Why can we not do that here?</P>
    <P>We are great believers in European regional policy.  I spent five or six years pleading the cause in Brussels and I continue to be all in favour of it.  It has contributed to Ireland's financial well being.  However, you cannot be an angel <Col N="1252" /> outside and a devil at home.  We must be genuinely convinced of the need for a true regional policy in Ireland and no government in my time in this House has reflected on the need to put in place a regional policy which will ensure that the benefits of economic development are spread throughout the country.  Due to the developments in telecommunications, this is becoming more important. If we follow what we say in Europe and implement it at home, we will have the beginnings, at long last, of a solution to the problems of remoteness and peripherality of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the Bill.  I am all in favour of competition.  Again, from the point of view of the future development of the nation, there must be competition.  It will happen anyhow so let us be ready for it.  The Department and Telecom Éireann have brought enormous benefits to the country.  There was a time when we did not have the technology or resources and had to rely on the State or a semi-State body to provide public utilities.  They did so although they were limited by a number of factors.  The Ceann Comhairle was complimented earlier on the time he spent in the Dáil.  When I was first elected to the House one of the main requests I received from constituents was that I use my influence to get them a telephone.  People were waiting 12 months, two, ten, or 15 years for the privilege of being connected to the telephone service.  While that is no longer the case, the EU average is one out of two houses are connected but only one out of three Irish houses are connected. I am sure many of those without telephones are in rural Ireland where there is perhaps a greater need.  There is still great scope for further development.  I hope the changes taking place will facilitate further investment and development and that the technology which is now available will help to ensure Ireland is brought up to at least the EU average in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>There is competition at all levels and in every part of the world.  Ireland is no exception.  As a result, competition will <Col N="1253" /> be the key and the customer will be king.  It is important that Telecom Éireann, which has rendered such great service to this country, be in shape to cope with that competition and that is why the strategic alliance makes much sense.  In so far as it will be in a very dominant position, I am glad there will continue to be State control.  I am anti-monopoly generally but a private monopoly is worse than a State one.  Therefore, I am glad the State will retain a majority holding and I want that to continue for as long as Telecom Éireann enjoys a dominant position in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of worker directors which was raised by the CWU.  An explanation has been given in this regard that the strategic partner, the KPN Telia consortium, which is buying 35 per cent must be represented on the board and that makes sense.  Obviously, one does not want an overloaded board and consequently the number of worker directors will be reduced from four to two.  The State, which has a majority shareholding, will have seven board members, the strategic partner will have three and there will be two worker directors.</P>
    <P>I understand the points raised by the workers and the CWU in particular.  I am a great believer in profit-sharing and worker ownership.  I believe there is scope for investment by workers in the company whether by way of direct investment or redirection of salary over a number of years so the workers will acquire a share in the company.  In that situation, one could have the view that such a shareholding of itself should lead to another directorship.  In the same way as the strategic partners get three directors for their shareholding, is there any reason the workers, as shareholders, should not have some entitlement to an additional director?  That might resolve the problem and should be considered.</P>
    <P>I mentioned changes in technology and it is clearly only beginning.  I see that Bill Gates, who is probably the richest man in the world at present, is <Col N="1254" /> hardly 40 years of age.  The enormous success he has had with Microsoft is mind-boggling but I notice he has a 24 year old competitor, Mark Andriessen, who together with some friends has founded Netscape.  He is introducing innovation virtually on a daily basis in his firm.  In an interview he was asked about the future and what he hoped to do for the rest of his life.  He said he could not even think about that; it was taking him all his time to get through his twenties.  That is the pace of technological change and it will continue.  It is important that we keep up, as far as we can, with those changes and it is particularly important that Telecom Éireann, because of its unique and dominant position in the Irish market, is put in a position where it can do so.  That is why this Bill is timely and why I am enthusiastic about it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of the derogation and full competition.  Normally we would have full competition on 1 January 1998.  After some negotiation the normal reaction, whether it has to do with life assurance or anything else, has been to derogate as far as we can.  We could have had a five-year derogation but I am delighted we are not going to avail of that five-year term. I would be equally happy if we were not going to derogate.  As of now the decision to have full open competition by 1 January 2000 is the right decision unless there is any reason to shorten it. I am delighted we did not go for the full five years.  My inclination would be to have no derogation but if there has to be one it should be as short as possible. Perhaps that deadline is the best in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Overall I am very much in favour of this Bill.  We can endorse its provisions enthusiastically.  In recent years Telecom has shown it can rise to the challenge and I have no doubt it can rise to the further challenges that will emerge in the future.  I commend this Bill to the House.  I commend also the point I made in relation to the level playing pitch for rural Ireland.  I hope in the <Col N="1255" /> years to come we adopt a regional policy which will allow a level playing pitch for everybody no matter where they live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear what the Deputy had to say regarding charges.  He said much that I have been saying for many years on this issue. However, I am disappointed the Deputy did not propose amendments in relation to the powers of the director under section 7 of the proposed Bill.  Unless we put an obligation on the director in fixing tariffs to ensure equity for all citizens we are handing away power.  We can shout forever but we will have no power to change anything.  That section of the Bill is deficient.  It will not address the problem of the inequitable way in which telecommunications are charged for.</P>
      <P>The original argument in favour of trunk call charges was based on the argument that it was more expensive for the provider &mdash; being the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and subsequently Telecom &mdash; to provide the service because it was using a manual system.  With modern infrastructure it is as cheap for Telecom Éireann to provide a service from Cork to Dublin as it is to provide a local service, yet we persist in charging by distance rather than time duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small number of examples highlight what the previous Deputy has said.  We still have some exchange areas or group charge areas which have as few as 10,000 local subscribers, while the 01 area has 600,000 subscribers available at a local call charge.  In many areas a phone call to one's county town or county council business is still a trunk call.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned places in Cork.  I could mention places in Galway.  A call from Ballinasloe to Galway city is still a trunk call.  In terms of cost this means if you telephone during the day on what is termed an A rate trunk call you will pay three times more for your three minute call then you would pay in the local call area.  If you telephone a friend at night and spend 15 <Col N="1256" /> minutes on the phone you will pay nine times the cost you would pay if you were in the local charge area.  However, if you need to telephone a Government Department during the day in Sligo, Longford, Letterkenny or Dublin from Cork, Limerick, Galway or Waterford the call is five times dearer.  If you have reason to make a 15 minute call at night outside that area you are paying 18 times for 15 minutes what you would pay in a local call area.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about competition but it only works if there is not cartelism.  In other words, the danger with the competition we will have because of the weakness of this Bill is that with which we are familiar when we go to change a few bob in a bank.  Each bank will charge £2.50 even if you are changing only £10 through an ATM machine in the airport.  We can have the same kind of competition here.  The competition will be on the basis that those who are creaming it off will continue to cream it off.  Let us enter into a friendly competition in the areas of maximum distribution of population.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the cost of telephoning Britain with making an internal trunk call.  In the evening time you can telephone Britain for 24p a minute while a trunk call during the day to Limerick or Cork costs 22p per minute, a difference of only 2p.  When we compare the day time charges to Britain at 29p per minute with internal charges at 22p per minute it is obvious that international competition has reduced the international charges but there has not been a consequent reduction in internal charges.</P>
    <P>Since I took up this complaint about ten years ago there have been changes. For example some of the trunk call areas were changed and my own area benefited substantially in that we got a local call to Galway city.  Other areas were not so fortunate.  While there has been a reduction in the C rate to a B rate, for some reason in latter times Telecom Éireann has decided not to proceed further.  What we need to write into this Bill is the ultimate goal to <Col N="1257" /> which the Deputy referred that is that all internal calls would be charged at the same rate for the same time, as on the Eircell system.  Telephone calls from Dublin to Galway and Cork to Derry would cost the same.  That is the logical way to go because the cost to Telecom Éireann of making the call when all the infrastructure is in place is the same.  A number of phases have to be taken to get there.  The first and most urgent is that the A rate trunk call should be made a local call, in other words all A rate trunk calls would become local calls immediately.  That would be a great advantage for many people.  At the same time the B rate trunk call should be made an A rate trunk call.  That would be the first step in the right direction.  A second step which could be taken relates to weekend calls.</P>
    <P>While the weekend rate for trunk calls has been of great benefit to people in rural areas the time should be extended from ten to 15 minutes during off-peak periods.  The reduced rate for trunk calls should not be confined only to Saturday and Sunday but should apply also from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. on weekdays.  These changes, which could be introduced immediately, would be a step in the right direction.  It would then be possible to begin introducing a local call rate throughout the Thirty-two Counties, as already applies for weekend calls.  I do not understand why we, as legislators, should not insist on this being done when we are being given the power to do so under the Bill.  All telecommunications suppliers should be given a certain period within which to provide services on a Thirty-two County basis at a uniform cost.  If we are serious about rural development and equity &mdash; and I certainly am &mdash; we should include a provision to this effect in the Bill and not leave this decision to the goodwill of people outside the House who might not hold the same view as us.</P>
    <P>As someone who has been involved in rural development for many years, I have always said I would swap many of the Mickey Mouse grants offered by the <Col N="1258" /> numerous agencies for fair play on the issue of costs.  I am a rural Deputy and the telephone bill for my office, home and Eircell amounts to approximately £6,000 per annum.  I doubt any of my urban colleagues pay anything like that amount.  All rural Deputies with constituency offices pay similar telephone charges to me.  This indicates the scale of the problem, and unless we avail of the opportunity to include in the Bill a provision dealing with it, we will have lost the best opportunity we will ever have had to nail it down once and for all.  Will the Minister consider putting down an amendment which will ensure uniformity in terms of cost?  Given the size of the problem, the provisions dealing with capping are irrelevant. Increases in charges cannot be higher than the CPI but the company can persist with a system which is more relevant to the 19th century than to the latter part of the 20th century.  For example, people can communicate with America on the internet for the price of a local call but they still have to pay trunk call rates for telephone calls between Cork and Dublin, Galway and Dublin etc.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the director shall be independent in the exercise of his or her functions.  Of whom will he or she be independent?  This seems to be the route we are taking in all legislation. The director will be independent and can do what he or she wants within the minimalist controls proposed in section 7.  The director should be answerable to this House or the Minister and we should retain the power to direct him or her in certain fundamental directions. None of us is interested in fixing tariffs on a day-to-day basis but we have an interest in ensuring that the general policy pursued by the director as telecommunications evolve is in accordance with the wishes of the Members of the House.  I would find it very difficult to agree a provision which states that the director shall be independent and not answerable to anybody, including the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> Many Deputies referred to worker directors who have provided a very good service within publicly owned companies.  Proposals have been put forward on how section 10, as proposed, could be amended.  These proposals should be looked at seriously and we should not do anything to undermine the position of worker directors in these companies.  During a time of rapid change it is very important that worker directors at all levels are represented at the board table.  Given the multiplicity of unions, there are difficulties with the proposal in the Bill.  Change can only be brought about with the goodwill of the workers.  More and more people are beginning to realise that workers are a fundamental part of a company and that they become an asset only when they have a positive involvement in changes which need to be made.  There will be huge changes in the telecommunications sector and the flexibility and goodwill of the workers will be necessary to keep up with competition.  The Bill does not address this issue and I hope amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to the deflector system.  The technology in communications, telecommunications, television communications etc. is changing rapidly and it is time this issue was dealt with.  MMDS has not proved a successful solution to multi-channel television and has not been able to provide a service in areas serviced by the deflector system.  Those of us who live in hilly areas know that MMDS is a non-starter &mdash; it is expensive, inefficient and not suitable.  Given the developments in technology, the old arguments about using up bands etc. are no longer used. We are told the introduction of digital technology will make it possible to provide an unlimited number of channels in every country.  This issue should be looked at again and the deflector system should be legalised.  I understand that problems have arisen in relation to commitments given to MMDS companies and it is a pity these commitments were given.  While a particular Government <Col N="1260" /> was not responsible for this, we must grasp the nettle and deal with the issue in a proactive and positive way.  The problem will not go away as those people who do not enjoy access to multi-channel television would like to have access to it.  I welcome the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge but I also believe people in rural areas should have access to the channels available in other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation which will serve to protect and enhance one of the most vital parts of the semi-State sector.  The purpose of the Bill is twofold: to provide for the establishment of an independent regulator for the telecommunications industry and to allow the sale of equity in Telecom Éireann which will, in turn, <Col N="1261" /> permit the formation of the equity based strategic alliance with KPN-Telia.</P>
      <P>In the course of the last decade we have witnessed the most revolutionary and innovative change in telecommunications this century.  For many people, including Members of this House, the mobile telephone has become a vital tool without which it is almost impossible to function.  In addition, the advent of the internet has redrawn the boundaries of communications worldwide.  This revolution shows no sign of slowing down and the tremendous change has resulted in many companies entering the marketplace to provide new and important communications service.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this legislation is to establish an office of director of telecommunications regulations.  It provides for the transfer to the director of the functions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications relating to the regulation of telecommunications.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the contribution Telecom Éireann has made to the communications revolution in Ireland.  Telecom Éireann and its workforce have shown their commitment to the ongoing development of the communications sector by investing almost £2 billion over the last decade in Ireland's telecommunications sector.  This investment has ensured that our telecommunications and telephone system are on a par with any communications system in Europe or the rest of the world.  Telecom Éireann is to be congratulated for introducing such a first-class system. The company has shown that it is capable of coping with and responding to change in a proactive and imaginative fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the role that companies such as Telecom Éireann have played in contributing to the development of our economy.  This Bill will facilitate the orderly transition to full competition and help Telecom Éireann to adapt to the new competitive environment.  The decision by the Government to allow Telecom Éireann to involve itself in a <Col N="1262" /> strategic alliance with a European telecommunications conglomerate makes perfect sense.  In this instance the Government has made the right decision to opt for liberalisation through restructuring the ownership of the company.  It will open new markets and opportunities to the company.  Telecom Éireann will become a much richer company and advance its stock of skill and knowledge by working closely with its new partner.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the concerns expressed by the trade unions in Telecom Éireann about the ability of the workforce to continue to influence the strategic direction of their company. They point out that the restructuring of the board runs contrary to commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the programme for Government to extend social partnership in industry.  Serious concern has been expressed regarding a change in circumstances whereby the representation of workers on the board is altered from being one-third of the total board to one-third of the Minister's nominees. Section 10 of the Bill does not make provision for the representation of employee shareholders in the event of an employee benefit trust being established under section 8.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to be flexible in negotiations with Telecom Éireann unions on this issue.  The unions intend to put forward proposals to the Minister and I look forward to hearing the Minister announce that the question of worker participation on the board of Telecom Éireann has been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Our party spokesperson has informed the House that Fianna Fáil will vote against this Bill.  In general, I oppose the privatisation of State companies unless there are specific reasons.  Semi-State companies play a major role in the economy.  They have a total turnover of approximately £4.5 billion and make a considerable contribution to the country's welfare.  Up to <Col N="1263" /> £1 billion is returned to the Exchequer through income tax, PRSI and so forth.</P>
      <P>The sale of 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann for £183 million is a giveaway. It represents a severe undervaluing of the assets of one of our major semi-State bodies.  When we reflect on this sale in four or five year's time, it will be seen to have been an absolute giveaway. Only hindsight will prove my contention but that has been the case in regard to other privatisations of semi-State bodies in both the UK and Ireland.  Shares of Irish Life and the Sugar Company, which at the time did not appear to be the snip this sale is, were seen in hindsight to have been sold too cheaply.  The sale of Telecom Éireann will be the most glaring example of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no logic in what the Government is doing.  It made the decision to seek a strategic partner and to sell part of the company.  It advertised for partners and, one by one, the partners pulled out of the negotiations.  The Government has ended up doing business with the only company that remained interested.  The Minister has championed this deal but I believe that has more to do with his pig-headedness or determination than anything else. Having decided on a policy, he stuck to it and tried to put the best face forward. However, in being obliged to deal with just one bidder the Minister, in his heart of hearts, must be disappointed with how this matter has turned out, although he will not admit as much.  He had to do business with just one partner because he had to stick with the course to which he had committed himself.  If part of a State company is being sold, why must it be sold to foreigners?  This must be a manifestation of a type of inferiority complex in the minds of some Irish people.  Why can a company not be sold to the Irish public or to the pension funds of Irish workers?  Why must we always behave as if we cannot do business at home or as if nobody here has money and we must bring in foreigners? The current position is that people living abroad can buy shares in a company which owns a portion of Telecom <Col N="1264" /> Éireann.  In effect, people in Sweden or Holland can buy shares in the development of Telecom Éireann but Irish people cannot.</P>
    <P>We are selling 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann.  However, whether the portion is 20 per cent or 35 per cent, the deal is wrong and is bad for the Irish taxpayer. The Bill allows the Minister to sell up to 49 per cent of Telecom Éireann without referring back to the Dáil for further approval.  Those who console themselves with the thought that we are only privatising 20 per cent of the company are living in a dream world.  This is privatisation and we have seen with other companies that the only big and important step is the first step.  Once it is decided to privatise or sell a portion of the company the principle has been established, after which there is no real argument.</P>
    <P>It was amazing to listen to the last speaker, Deputy Kenny.  If he were in Opposition he would have been thumping the table about a Government selling or privatising the jewel in the crown of the semi-State sector.  Instead he talked about technology and ignored the fundamental issue, or at least it was a fundamental issue for people who label themselves members of the Labour Party or the left.  I worked for 25 years in a semi-State company and, in many ways, that is where I arrived at my philosophy on these matters so I share the concerns of those people.</P>
    <P>The notion that one can induce a foreign company to pay £183 million for 20 per cent of a company and that it will not try to seriously influence that company is a joke.  Once a private company has invested its first £1 it is looking for reward and the rewards in this case will be delivered on the backs of the efforts of Irish employees in the future.</P>
    <P>The notion that we are entering a strategic alliance with one of the giants in the telecommunications industry is a fallacy.  While KPN/Telia are a fine company, they are not much larger than Telecom Éireann.  The notion that KPN/Telia is vastly superior than Telecom Éireann in terms of technology is <Col N="1265" /> wrong.  In recent years taxpayers have invested a fortune in the company and it can compete with the best telecommunications companies in the world. Perhaps the alliance will be beneficial in the future, but Telecom Éireann is linking up with a company that is only at a similar stage of development.  Future technological development will have to be worked out between the two companies, we will not get it for nothing. The public has been short-changed and this is not a good deal.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand how members of the Labour Party and Democratic Left can support this deal.  The comments of many of their members in the past, particularly when Irish Life and the sugar company were being privatised, now ring hollow.  This sale is being made on the cheap and will provide a quick killing for foreign companies, not for the taxpayers.  Deputy O'Malley stated that taxpayers will not even benefit from the proceeds of the sale.  It appears the £183 million will be kept within Telecom Éireann and the person who buys a 20 per cent share will at least get back 20 per cent of his or her money.</P>
    <P>Very few speakers from the left contributed to the debate.  I am familiar with the views of Deputies Sean Ryan and Kenny on the question of privatisation.  Deputy Ryan and I worked for the same employer some time ago.  I am shocked at the manner in which their philosophies have changed.  Do the members of the Labour Party have any honesty?  Deputy Ryan took credit for the £175 million which the Labour Party secured for Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus.   Has he forgotten it was a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Cowen, who did the spadework and delivered the deal at the Cabinet table?  I accept we were in partnership with the Labour Party at that time, but the achievements were made with the co-operation of the staff of Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus and as a result of the efforts of the then Minister, Deputy Cowen.  A number of Labour Party members prolonged the process because they were afraid to <Col N="1266" /> stand up to the shop stewards, some of whom did not understand that we are living in a changing world.  If the Labour Party had given them the facts, matters could have been resolved much sooner. The northside six failed to understand the limits of what was possible.  At one stage they were minus one because Deputy Shortall did a runner on a crucial vote on a TEAM Aer Lingus motion for fear people would know how she voted.</P>
    <P>I am amazed and annoyed at members of Democratic Left and, in particular, the Labour Party for the manner in which they brazenly support this legislation.  It conflicts with many of their hollow promises.  The scene is changing in many semi-State companies and this has been talked about at union meetings for the past ten or 12 years. The Labour Party and Democratic Left created the image that they are the honest brokers, the protectors of semi-State employees.  They conned the people prior to the 1992 election.  I am sure Members will recall the sermon from the ramp at the airport when people fell hook, line and sinker for a number of false promises.  Many of those people are now out of work or are working approximately 30 hours in March, 35 in April, 50 or 60 in July and are back on the dole for three or four months towards the end of the year.  Many workers in Telecom Éireann, the ESB and CIÉ are bitter about the false promises of Democratic Left and the Labour Party.  A total of 2,000 jobs are being shed in the ESB and a further 2,000 in Telecom Éireann.  It is reported in this morning's newspapers that 800 jobs are to be shed in Iarnród Éireann and more in some of the other CIÉ companies.  At least Fianna Fáil were honest with the workers, but for those who made the false promises, it is a case of watch what we do rather than what we say.</P>
    <P>Many workers have been betrayed and some leading trade unionists have been brow beaten.  Some workers voted for restructuring because they were bribed into selling their jobs.  A person of 50 or 55 years of age who is offered a cheque <Col N="1267" /> for a large sum of money will usually consider only the short-term, accept the cheque and leave the workforce.  Trade unionists, however, must protect the long-term interests of those who continue to work.  Deputy Ryan stated that he had no difficulty with selling 35 per cent of the company, although it is incidental to the main function of the strategic alliance.  It is amazing how the views of the Labour Party and Democratic Left have changed.  A previous principle is now simply incidental to the strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív spoke about worker-directors, something which is close to my heart.  The recognition of the role of the worker-stakeholder in State industry, through representation on boards of State enterprises, has made a unique contribution to necessary changes in recent years.  A comparison with State organisations elsewhere demonstrates the value of the concept, and as it matures the benefits increase.  In the light of such positive achievement, it is disturbing that the Bill will effectively deny the worker-stakeholder in Telecom Éireann 50 per cent of their representation on the board of the company.  In his anxiety to sell off part of the public asset, the Minister is trying to quietly halve the worker-stakeholder interest in the Telecom Éireann board-room.  It appears the three director vacancies to be filled by the new partners will be made possible by kicking out the worker-directors.  Where is the equity in that proposal?  What have workers done to deserve this?  A sum of £183 million or 30 pieces of silver has turned matters on their head.  Other speakers stated that the main union in Telecom Éireann has been negotiating with the Minister in this regard, but a compromise has not yet been reached.  There is a danger that the agreement of workers about the deal could change unless this difficulty is resolved.  Is the Minister bluffing?  I fail to understand how the number could be reduced from four to two.</P>
    <P>It is probably a case of softening them up by threatening to reduce the number <Col N="1268" /> to two, but that he will make compromise on Committee Stage by increasing it to three so everyone will be happy. On the basis of arithmetic, it is ridiculous how he has reduced the number to two.  It would be ridiculous if they are that easily fobbed off by increasing the number of three to make everyone happy.</P>
    <P>The situation in Telecom Éireann, and other semi-State bodies, is that the big unions take most of the positions on the board and the last place goes to an amalgam of the smaller unions.  That is what happens in most companies.  If we reduce the number, it could mean that the big unions will take everything while the smaller ones will be disenfranchised. Another rumour floating around semi-State companies is that worker-directors will serve a four or five year term, like the commercial directors, and will leave in turn so that only one or two will be elected at an election.  That would be a disgrace, anti-democratic and would silence and push out members of the small unions.  I accept that such a provision is not contained in the Bill, but it is a rumour which has been floating around. It would represent a very bad deal.</P>
    <P>I understand KPN Telia is to get three places on the board for 20 per cent.  When it requires 35 or 49 per cent, how many places will it get on the board?  Will another worker-director have to move over each time the stake increases?  The main union has made some recommendations.  It has asked that the number go back up and suggested a Pat Rabbitte &ldquo;baby chair&rdquo; type solution where people could be on the board but could not necessarily vote. The minimum number should be three with that solution or another director for the worker-director shareholder. Reducing the number to two is not a genuine move but a tactic to soften people up.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion from the unions &mdash; I do not like the sound of it and it makes me nervous &mdash; is that in future it would not have to be a worker-director on the board, that it could be an outsider or the general secretary of the <Col N="1269" /> union.  That sounds very fishy and I am inclined to think I smell a rat.  I wonder what deal has been done.  Do some union officials see themselves appointed to the board as the price for their support for this deal?  I feel very strongly about that.  This issue is about the worker-director not the unions getting a general secretary, a leading light, a sympathiser or an outsider on the board.  It is vital that it should be a worker-director who will muscle in.  I hold a strong view on that and I hope there is no compromise.  As of right the figure of two should return to three.  Some means should be found to increase it to four &mdash; perhaps another place based on the shareholding &mdash; otherwise we will find that the big unions will take everything. It will be a case of might is right and the small unions will be pushed aside.</P>
    <P>On the appointment of the director of telecommunications regulation, why is it that in most legislation we are taking away power from politicians and the Minister and setting up independent bodies?  It is as if suddenly the politician, no matter what side of the House he or she is on, is crooked, that one cannot trust him with power and that one must have an independent body.  It is about time all sides of the House pulled together and started a campaign to bring power back to the politician otherwise we will be reduced to the status of messenger boys.  I do not know why this is happening, whether it is because of <i>The Irish Times</i> or senior civil servants, but most Bills propose the establishment of an independent body and take power away from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In some cases the Minister may be afraid to exercise power and looks for a skirt to hide behind.  We are doing away with our positions by giving power to everybody.  Because we set up a body and take power away from the House, it does not mean that somebody will not do a favour for their mother or brother; it does not mean that suddenly life is straight and people are more honest. We need to cop on and stop setting up independent bodies in legislation.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I will briefly summarise the main provisions.  The Bill provides for the establishment of the office of director of telecommunications regulation and for the transfer to the director of the functions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications relating to the regulation of the telecommunications, radio communications and cable television sectors.  It provides for the funding of the expenses of the director in carrying out his or her functions by means of a levy imposed on providers of telecommunications services and by the retention of fees collected by the director pursuant to the transfer functions.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the regulation of tariffs, initially by the Minister and, ultimately, by the director of telecommunications regulation, for certain telecommunications services.  It enables the issue and transfer of shares in Telecom Éireann and entry into agreements in connection with the sale and issue of equity in that company.  It makes provision for the restructuring of the board of Telecom Éireann on the closing of the strategic alliance agreement.  It amends the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, in relation to pension matters and the regulation of tariffs.  It provides for the repeal of certain provisions of existing legislation relating to Telecom Éireann arising from the strategic alliance agreement with KPN Telia.</P>
      <P>I would like to reply to a number of points raised in the debate which has been disappointing in that few speakers choose to subject the legislation to any scrutiny but rather engaged in a great deal of rhetoric about every conceivable issue under the sun except the Bill before the House.

The MMDS issue was a good example of that having regard to the position taken by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade, Deputy O'Sullivan, at the time when Deputy Ray Burke introduced that Bill in the House in 1989.</P>
      <P>I was also bemused by the bewilderment Deputy Seamus Brennan pretended to affect in terms of my position and that of my colleagues in the Labour Party on the issue of strategic alliance. Deputy Seamus Brennan should be aware that my colleagues in the trade union movement promoted the idea of a strategic alliance and for good reason if we are to stay abreast of developments in the communications industry, stay ahead of competition and compete in what is a global industry and maintain the optimum employment for those at work.  It is interesting to note that Deputy Seamus Brennan claims to support the position of the CWU, the communications workers' union, on the issue of worker-directors but on little else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party tabled this motion for the consideration of the House because of public anger about the property tax and water charges which arises from the fact that the general body of taxpayers believe they are already paying through the nose in income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to develop the argument about double taxation, a phrase often bandied about in this argument, which requires analysis.  Approximately 80 per cent of Irish homes are owner occupied, representing the highest number in any member state of the European Union. The imposition of property tax and service charges involves taxing the same body of people who are already paying income tax.  That is one of the great weaknesses in the argument put forward by various economic commentators down through the years who have made the case that we should have more extensive property tax arrangements here.  The reality is that if property taxes are extended it will involve taxing the same base of people who are already paying income tax.  The comparison <Col N="1273" /> between here and continental countries made by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, last night when considering the property tax issue is fallacious.  Because we have a far higher incidence of owner occupation of the family home than any other member state of the European Union, the introduction of a property tax on the family home is, in effect, a form of double taxation.  As a matter of history, most Irish people have had a strong itch to buy and own their home &mdash; to invest in its bricks and mortar.  It is a form of confiscation to introduce a tax on the family home when dealing with taxpayers who are already paying a substantial amount of income tax.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by my party spokesperson on finance last night, the double taxation arguments is reinforced in the case of Dublin by the fact that in the year ending 5 April 1994 75 per cent of the receipts of the residential property tax were paid by persons living in Dublin city and county and in the year ending 5 April 1995 77 per cent of those paying that tax resided there.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the debate an announcement was made outside the House by Deputy Broughan yesterday evening that it is now Labour Party policy to eliminate this tax.  I am very glad to hear that and in a sense it would appear that our motion has had a response from the benches opposite. Although Deputy Broughan does not hold a Government position, apparently it is stated Labour Party policy that this tax should be eliminated.  In that sense to press the case much further might be otiose because it is accepted on the benches opposite that the property tax should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat concerned to hear the argument made by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, last night that there was nothing wrong with the fact that the population of Dublin and Galway had to bear this tax more than people in other parts of the country because it was their good fortune to live in houses that have high capital values. The people who must pay this tax are <Col N="1274" /> already paying income tax and substantial amounts of it if we are to believe the receipts published by the Commissioners &mdash; that highlights the double taxation argument.</P>
    <P>An attempt has been made by the Government parties to relate this subject to the question of local government funding.  The residential property tax has always been an item of central Government receipts.  The receipts from the residential property tax have never been allocated to local authorities, but the relationship between it and local government funding has arisen because I assume the Democratic Left and the Labour Party are concerned to eliminate service charges as well as the property tax, but that would involve separate considerations.  I am opposed to service charges in the Dublin area and would like to see them eliminated, but the considerations that would have to be taken into account in that regard are somewhat different because an adequate funding base must be established for local government.  It was made clear by my party leader yesterday evening that Fianna Fáil is prepared to provide that base, but it must come from within the existing tax system.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to accept our motion on the basis it is apparent from the Labour backbenchers that in any event it is official Labour policy to dispense with this tax and, therefore, I do not see why there is opposition to the motion from the Government side.  It appears to be agreed in this House that the residential property tax is an inequitable form of taxation and should be eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The residential property tax contravenes the most basic tenets of taxation.  As any student of taxation is aware, those tenets are that a tax should be equitable, transparent and efficient.  When the residential property tax is measured against those standard tenets of taxation it is not transparent, efficient or equitable.  Attempts have been made to make it more acceptable through exemptions and changes in the <Col N="1275" /> thresholds.  Those contrivances simply highlight deeply embedded contradictions in the concept and in the tax.</P>
      <P>The tax is a direct imposition on the most important and basic investment made by any of us here and by those whom we represent.  Buying a house is the most important investment people will make in their lifetimes for themselves and their families.  In many ways that investment in bricks and mortar will shape the way we live our lives and the manner in which we provide for and rear our families.</P>
      <P>For many small businesses investment in bricks and mortar represents the only equity the owners of those businesses possess.  Today the banks are less willing to take a charge on property as the basis for lending to small businesses.  I welcome this greatly.  When I established the task force on small businesses some years back it was of particular importance to me to ensure that the banks would not overuse the domestic home for the basis of lending for business purposes.  The same logic applies to the residential property tax.  Amid all the uncertainties and pressure of business the small business person's home remains the bedrock of their financial and emotional security.  It has been said by Members opposite the residential property tax is a tax on speculation, but that is a nonsense.  The tax impacts on many thousands of families who could not possibly be called speculators.  More importantly, the Government must be aware that the way to deal with speculation is through sound macroeconomic and monetary policies, not through direct tax on the homes of families and citizens of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all those reasons our homes must be tax free zones of security and stability.  It was never more important to us or to our people that they save and invest in their homes without having to worry whether such prudence and such a sensible approach will leave them less well off because of the additional burden of residential property tax.  It is obvious from the operation of the tax that it is inequitable and, from what we <Col N="1276" /> have seen of its operation during the past few years, that it is a burden on those who save, take out mortgages and invest in their homes &mdash; it is a disincentive to do that.  Whatever about the theory, the tax has not worked in practice.  It has been inefficient, ineffective and has not brought in revenue.  It does not meet the basic tenets of what a good tax should be &mdash; equitable, transparent and efficient.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that RPT is an additional burden on families seeking to establish homes.  It comes on top of the reduction in interest relief on mortgage payments and insurance. Those expenses combine to give rise to a situation where most householders are put to the pin of their collar to meet them.  In that context, a tax on the family home does not make any sense.</P>
    <P>There is also a constitutional aspect to this matter.  If we believe that citizens have a right to establish homes for themselves and their families for their emotional and financial security &mdash; which is how we interpret the Constitution &mdash; and that we in this House have a responsibility to safeguard those rights, it is important for us to reverse the decision taken by this House to impose this tax.  Residential property tax is an inequitable and socially damaging tax on homes and families.  It is an unfair tax which we should remove.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about who started what and who first introduced residential property tax. That debate can take place during the general election, towards which we now appear to be heading.  It is important to realise that most people are under financial pressure in their daily lives to pay their mortgages, electricity bills and telephone bills and they do not need residential property tax on top of the other pressing expenses of running a family home.</P>

      <P>I consider residential property tax to be a crude, anti-family and anti-Dublin tax.  I call on this Fine Gael led Government to seriously question the future of this tax and I look forward to the proposals of the Minister for Finance in the January budget.</P>
      <P>I wish to review the history of this tax and the Government's approach to it. When this Government took office it made two commitments on residential property tax.  First, it promised to reverse the regressive changes introduced by the Leader of Fianna Fáil when he was Minister for Finance in 1994.  Does that leader now expect the home owners of Dublin to fall for an advertising campaign by a party which a mere two years ago virtually doubled the number of taxpayers paying RPT and brought many home owners in Dublin into the RPT net?  We changed the decision he made in our first budget in 1995.  Secondly, we gave a commitment to review the future of RPT in the context of a professional study commissioned on local government.  That study's report has been published and is the basis for the ongoing review of local authority financing and funding and the future of RPT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We delivered on our first commitment and we are delivering on the second.  By contrast, the Fianna Fáil party is now calling for the abolition of the residential property tax.  This is the party which in 1994 reduced the valuation threshold from £90,000 to £75,000 and the income threshold from £30,000 to £28,000.  In his last budget, the Leader of the Opposition brought approximately 18,000 extra taxpayers into the RPT net.  My constituents might not like RPT but I credit them with more intelligence than the Opposition.  They can see the difference between the soft words of <Col N="1278" /> the fancy advertising campaign today and the harsh actions of two years ago.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has said that RPT is inequitable, that it is biased against Dublin taxpayers and that mortgages are not factored into it.  It implies the Government is unaware of these problems or ignoring them but, of course, it is wrong.  Why else did we give a commitment to review the future of this tax?</P>
    <P>The study on local authority financing was completed and published earlier this summer.  The results of that study are now being reviewed.  There have been problems with local authority financing for many years.  What did Fianna Fáil do about that?  Within 18 months this Government has commissioned and published an independent study.  In contrast, the Opposition, for the most transparent of motions, tabled this motion for the day after RPT returns were due.  The Government did not rush into completing its review of local authority financing by the same date.</P>
    <P>I look forward to considered proposals from the Government.  However, it is important when reviewing the RPT to review the overall economic situation and to look at present economic growth, employment creation, low inflation and low interest rates.  We must look at what happened to mortgages in the last few years.  Many of my constituents remember the mortgage interest rates when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were last in Government &mdash; they were 4 per cent higher than they are today.  On a £35,000 mortgage, that represents a £1,400 saving annually &mdash; £125 per month &mdash; under the economy managed by this Government.</P>
    <P>However, escalating house prices in Dublin are causing huge concerns about the range of houses whose net value continues to increase.  That has to be taken into account when considering this tax.  These are family homes and their owners, many of whom are on fixed incomes, do not intend to sell them to make a profit.  With spiralling house prices, RPT becomes a very <Col N="1279" /> unfair tax which particularly affects Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government has honoured its commitment to the people and we await the review of local government financing.  What trust can the electorate have in the alternative?  Fianna Fáil, which had seven years in Government to do something about it, lowered the property value threshold to £75,000 and the income threshold to £28,000.  I am confident this Government, led by Fine Gael, is committed to a comprehensive examination of the taxation situation, to reducing the tax burden of PAYE workers and to reviewing this tax in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this important debate which affects many constituents, particularly in Dublin.  We are talking about a taxation on wealth which is now threatening people with average incomes and houses.  On Monday evening, Deputy Bertie Ahern looked ridiculous on the 6 o'clock news launching his party's Saatchi and Saatchi poster campaign. This debate is part two of the grand strategy of binning the property tax. The posters scream at us, but it is a pity he is the same Deputy who began the current property tax controversy in his 1994 budget by doubling the number of people paying RPT in one fell swoop.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the examination of the residential property tax in the context of an overall review of that tax linked with domestic service charges, which impact on considerably more people.  Fianna Fáil is reluctant to be upfront on this issue as many of its councils have been happily collecting these charges for the last decade or so. In 1985 promises were made to abolish service charges.  On its return to power, not only did it not abolish them, it increased them in every local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Fianna Fáil explain to the electorate why it is determined to make one tax an issue at this stage while avoiding addressing others, in particular water charges.  The electorate expect little from Fianna Fáil whose members are <Col N="1280" /> quite happy to cry about farmers one week, residential property tax the following one and about different issues as they arise.  Deputy Cowen says Fianna Fáil is a national party.  In effect what he means is that Fianna Fáil is determined not to do anything to offend anybody.  Deputy McCreevy and Cullen have been moaning about public and social welfare spending while calling for a reduction in taxation, which equation could not withstand scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for the Environment assumed office most local authorities have upgraded national and local county roads to a standard never before witnessed.  This can be done only by finance raised through taxation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party must be pleased with its expensive launch on Monday last which warranted a six-inch column in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which Deputy McCreevy was quoted as referring to the residential property tax as a throwback to a socialist ideology warranting a rebuttal for its own sake.  The most recent Forfás report &ldquo;Shaping our Future&rdquo; tentatively suggested that increases in the revenue yield from residential property tax should be examined.  I have closely examined the contributions to that report and have found no famous socialist contributions among them.  Presumably Forfás is alluding to the debate about the relationship between the tax base and income tax, a debate into which Fianna Fáil was prepared to enter while on the Government benches but not while in Opposition. The yield from capital and property taxation here has declined considerably in the past two decades and is one reason for our over-reliance on income tax and the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>My problem with the residential property tax is that it yields a meagre amount of money which is of no benefit in reducing taxation on income and neither does it raise money for required social changes or services.  It cannot achieve those objectives and is cutting into the income of ordinary households in certain parts of Dublin.  It has no potential for yielding any meaningful <Col N="1281" /> revenue.  Neither has it succeeded in imposing a ceiling on house prices.  In effect, it is an anti-Dublin tax.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem occasioned by this residential property tax is the fear it instils in people.  Since the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, reduced the threshold, which was revised by his Labour Party successor, Deputy Ruarí Quinn the Opposition parties have sought to instil fear about the tax in the minds of the electorate.  Surprisingly, given their otherwise inept performance, they have succeeded, through duplicity, promoting ignorance about the tax, its limits and its various provisions such as marginal and child relief intended to mitigate its effects on certain households.  They have succeeded in frightening people who do not and possibly never will have to pay the tax.  As the Tories in Britain will confirm, fear is a very useful electoral weapon and can dissuade people from voting for certain people.  It does little to create a sense of community or solidarity.  It is divisive, negative and a poor reflection on any party that would adopt such a weapon.</P>
    <P>By far the most positive outcome of this debate has been the attention it has drawn to service charges and the financing of local government generally.  Will the Fianna Fáil Party, whose leader according to recent newspaper reports favours the allocation of increased powers to local councillors, indicate how his party proposes to increase those powers and how they will be financed?  Does Fianna Fáil contend that the residential property tax is dissimilar from a form of rates?  They should make themselves abundantly clear before this debate concludes.</P>
    <P>Last evening Deputy Bertie Ahern alluded to Cabinet confidentiality and then proceeded to refer explicitly to Cabinet negotiations in the run-up to the 1994 budget in a manner which hid little from those present.  This is the person who seeks to lead the country into <Col N="1282" /> a new century, yet seeks to bend constitutional privilege for political advantage.  This tax was introduced as a tax on wealth but is beginning to develop into a tax that may affect people without any wealth.  If it is to be dealt with, we should deal with it in conjunction with dealing with a tax which is even more unjust &mdash; service charges, which affect a huge number of people and which needs to be addressed much more urgently than does residential property tax.</P>

      <P>The debate on this issue, I suppose, is a caricature of Irish politics as practised for far too many years.  I am sure members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats take themselves very seriously on this issue.  However, there are few people outside this House who take them seriously on it.  The difficulty of being confined to Leinster House and the rarefied atmosphere we all breathe is that, on occasions, we lose touch with reality.</P>
      <P>The electorate is not fooled, does not have a short memory and has not forgotten that, in the course of the existence of this tax, every single party represented here has been in Government at some stage.  Of course, the distinction in the case of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; as other speakers have mentioned &mdash; is that they sought to extend it-to a much greater number of people and to far more modest houses that those to which it had applied at any one time prior to the 1994 budget.  The approach taken by both opposing parties on this issue is simply a piece of hypocritical electioneering, the type of politics that makes people outside this House cynical of politics, politicians and all who inhabit this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats in Dublin have been distributing glossy leaflets requesting people to join their campaign against the residential property tax.  I am sure many people have signed up but I am equally sure most people who did so remember that the Progressive Democrats were in Government with <Col N="1283" /> Fianna Fáil for two years and did absolutely nothing about that tax within that period.</P>
    <P>I have always considered this a daft tax, not just because it is unfair to people who live in Dublin.  Its unfairness has become more apparent in the last 18 months because of the dramatic increase in the value of houses, particularly in the city and county of Dublin. It has always been a daft tax because the cost of procuring its yield by way of administrative expenses just about matches the amount of revenue it yields. It is a tax that achieves nothing other than irritating people.  In December, 1995, a person may not fall into the tax net but if, the following March or April, someone in that estate sells his house for, say, £20,000 or £30,000 more than anyone might have anticipated everyone in the estate will suddenly find themselves in the net.  The reality in Dublin is that some fairly modest, semidetached houses fall into the net.  The link between this tax and domestic water charges is hogwash, nonsense of the highest order.  There are people paying residential property tax, and families who fall into that tax net this year, who pay and will continue to pay water charges.  They are paying both taxes.  As every party in this House knows, the hoary chestnut of dealing with the problems of financing local government in a manner acceptable to the majority of the electorate has been a difficulty to which no Government has been able to find a solution acceptable to the general electorate.</P>
    <P>Since rates were abolished none of the parties in Government has come to terms with how to finance local government on an independent basis in a way that is accepted by the general population.  Dealing with the issue of residential property tax should not await some miraculous solution to the problems of financing local authorities.  The tax should be abolished.  The Government is reviewing the effect of the tax, but we should not tinker with it.  If many of those who unfairly find themselves in that tax net are taken out of it next year <Col N="1284" /> it is clear that the administrative cost of running the tax in 1997 would exceed any take on it.  The State makes no money from it, it irritates people, it is unfair and anti-Dublin and should be abolished.</P>
    <P>People should not be fooled by the rhetoric from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on this issue because it is nothing but hypocrisy, cynical electioneering designed to create a general public amnesia of the record of both those parties in Government.  The way those parties vote on this issue today does not deserve to be taken seriously.  All we have seen is slick media campaigning in advance of the next election, bolstered by debate in this House, which will not fool the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something vaguely pathetic about the spectacle of the leader of the largest party in the House chasing the PD agenda in the same manner as he solicited the PD party throughout the summer.  That he should select a subject that his own actions as Minister for Finance transformed into a contentious issue in politics for the first time highlights the uncertainty that besieges the Fianna Fáil Leader.  I challenge any Member on either side of the House to produce evidence that the RPT was an issue of even the slightest concern before Deputy Bertie Ahern, as Minister for Finance, widened the scope in 1994 to double the number of householders liable to pay RPT.  Not only was Fianna Fáil in office happy to implement RPT, but having been in Government for seven successive years Deputy Ahern was happy in 1994 to broaden this tax significantly.  This Government undid the changes made by Deputy Ahern.  Yet Deputy Ahern will have the public believe that this is a major issue in politics warranting a high profile campaign involving precious Private Members' time and a billboard campaign featuring, I am told, the indefatigable Deputy McCreevy and a dustbin.  It is especially salutary to note that <Col N="1285" /> neither the Fianna Fáil campaign nor this motion contains any reference to water tax.</P>
      <P>The public would be well advised to recall the last billboard campaign run by Fianna Fáil a decade ago, the most memorable of which was the infamous &ldquo;Health Cuts Hurt The Sick, The Old And The Handicapped&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil ruthlessly exploited the sick, the old and the disabled for political advantage at that time.  However, in office Fianna Fáil deepened the health cuts and the plight of the old, the sick and the handicapped went out the window until the then Taoiseach was reminded of them in a general election two years later in 1989.</P>
      <P>This is a repetition of the cynical and opportunistic campaign of a decade ago by Fianna Fáil on health cuts, except that on this occasion there is no saving grace.  Not even the robustly selfish Progressive Democrats when in Government gave a second thought to the abolition of RPT.  Not even during the period when he ran the 1989-92 Government from exile did Deputy Michael McDowell as much as raise this issue in his <i>Sunday Independent</i> column, and there are not many issues about which one can say that.</P>
      <P>More than half the yield from the present RPT comes from the 4,000 or so taxpayers whose houses are worth more than £175,000.  Some, but not all, of these taxpayers are PAYE contributors who are therefore paying £1,000 per annum or more in addition to a marginal tax rate of 48 per cent.  For a household whose aggregate income is £100,000 per annum and whose house is valued at £200,000 RPT is roughly £1,500 or 1.5 per cent of £100,000, just a little more than the 1.25 per cent health contribution payable on their gross income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Altogether RPT currently affects about 23,000 households.  Those whose aggregate household income exceeded £30,100 per annum in the 1995-96 tax year and whose houses were worth more than £101,000 last April where <Col N="1286" /> household incomes are more than £30,100 but less than £40,100, there is marginal relief; and there are also reliefs in respect of dependent children and people who are elderly, incapacitated or widowed.  The result is that most of the estimated £13.5 million which will be raised through RPT in 1996 comes from people whose incomes are well in excess of £40,000 per annum, whose houses are worth substantially more than £125,000 and whose households do not comprise many of the people in our society who are at greatest risk of poverty, that is the young, the old, the ill or the disabled.  It is interesting to note that if the house value threshold for RPT were raised to £125,000 the number of people paying this tax would be almost halved while the yield would only be reduced by about 10 per cent.  Therefore it is clear that most of the tax is being paid by the wealthiest households.</P>
    <P>It is beginning to look as if the Opposition parties want to revert to the era of auction politics irrespective of considerations of equity or economic growth.  Even the highminded Progressive Democrats are prepared to drive Fianna Fáil down this road using, in the process, the Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Ahern, as a ventriloquist for Progressive Democrats policy.  In fairness, this motion is probably the brainchild of the man the Progressive Democrats left behind, Deputy McCreevy, the Progressive Democrats cuckoo in the Fianna Fáil nest.  Deputy McCreevy makes no bones about his advocacy of the cause of the wealthiest in society at the same time as he rails against what he calls &ldquo;the poverty industry&rdquo;&mdash; those who seek to champion those who have no fear of RPT bills because they have no jobs, or in many cases no hope or poorly paid jobs, poor living accommodation or rented accommodation.</P>

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, resorted to his usual tactic of vulgar abuse.</P>

      <P>While it was very amusing &mdash; I enjoyed it greatly &mdash; he resolutely refused to answer the questions posed in the motion.  This demonstrates that the Government is in a state of confusion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State and Deputy Eamon Walsh who spoke before him were wrong to link the question of residential property tax or family home tax to that of service charges.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the revenue raised from residential property tax is not used to fund local government.  The <Col N="1290" /> funding of local government is a separate issue.  What we are dealing with is the principle of a tax on the family home.  It is wrong, iniquitous and inefficient.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, conceded that there were inequities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>So do I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that admission.  As anybody who has read a basic textbook on taxation will be aware, the first chapter is always taken up with what are called the canons of taxation, the yardsticks against which a good taxation system should be measured.  The first principle is that it should be equitable.  Two Ministers of State have now admitted that residential property tax falls at the first hurdle, it is patently and blatantly inequitable.  I am delighted that the Government has conceded on that point without promising or giving a commitment to abolish what it concedes is an inequitable tax on the family home.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh said that residential property tax was a wealth tax.  There are many assets such as cash deposits, heirlooms, antiques, paintings, large country estates and so on which constitute wealth, as I understand the term.  Yet, one item, the family home, is singled out for the imposition of this tax.  That is iniquitous.</P>
      <P>Residential property tax is inefficient because the net revenue yield is £12 million.  As the Minister of State well knows, if the time, energy and effort directed into collecting this tax was expended in the anti-evasion unit to obtain some payment from those who are not paying tax the State would be a net beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week on television Deputy Jim Mitchell defended residential property tax on the basis that if we were to get rid of it we would be narrowing the tax base and increasing the burden on PAYE taxpayers.  That is a patent nonsense.  The yield is £12 million.  I have heard Ministers for Finance announce <Col N="1291" /> in various budgets during the past 14 years that they were giving away hundreds of millions of pounds in tax reliefs, the net effect of which was a tax concession worth less than the price of a pint per week to the average family, yet we are now expected to believe that the foregoing of £12 million would virtually cripple the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, concentrated heavily on the fact that only 2 per cent or 20,000 taxpayers pay residential property tax but it impacts on people in another way.  Let me explain what I mean.  The crudity and absurdity of this tax was finally demonstrated to me last Monday night when I had a meeting with a group of residents from what is admittedly an affluent housing estate in Limerick city.  They are paying every conceivable form of taxation.  Those in the PAYE sector are paying income tax, PRSI, income levies, water tax and so on while those in business are paying corporation tax and all the other forms of taxation, including commercial rates on their business premises.</P>
    <P>The question which exercised their minds and which they put to me was whether they would be subjected to residential property tax.  Some months ago a house in the estate was sold for the sum of £96,000-£97,000.  If another house in the estate is sold in the near future for a sum which exceeds the magic figure of £101,000 these people will suddenly be catapulted into a new taxation regime.  If a sale takes place the circumstances of the people living in this estate will not change.  Yet, if a price in excess of the magic figure is generated that single event will catapult them into a new taxation regime despite the fact that in a nearby estate where houses are £10,000 to £15,000 cheaper there are people, in terms of real wealth and income, who are infinitely better off. Some of the people living in the estate I am talking about have no mortgage while others own about 2.5 per cent or at most 5 per cent of their property because they have a 95 per cent mortgage.  Is it fair, equitable and just that <Col N="1292" /> they will have to pay the same amount of tax?  Nobody could seek to argue for a moment that it is.</P>
    <P>The Government has concentrated on the changes it has made.  One can raise the thresholds, increase marginal relief and provide exemptions for the handicapped, the sick and the elderly but the basic principle underlying this tax remains the same.  People in similar financial circumstances will pay different amounts depending on where they live. This is not fair, equitable or just.  The Minister of State, who is in business, knows how the people on whose behalf I am speaking feel.  This is an iniquitous tax.  It is built on a principle which is demonstrably false.  Instead of increasing marginal relief, raising the income thresholds or providing for indexation, other than the CPI, the best thing to do is to consign this tax to the dustbin of history where it beongs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, for sharing his time with me in this important debate.  It is important that we get straight to the point.  My colleague, Deputy McCreevy, is proposing that we should agree to abolish residential property tax given that it unfairly penalises those who reside within certain regions.</P>
      <P>If we were to take seriously the contributions of Deputies to the debate both today and yesterday, we should simply abolish this tax because it seems that everybody is against it.  It is time we had some degree of credibility in the debate.  Even the infamous Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has a knack when under pressure of using the old adage that attack is the best form of defence, did not face up to the real question but instead attacked some of my colleagues without addressing the issue of residential property tax.</P>
      <P>It is important to outline the history of the tax.  It was first introduced by a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in 1983.  As a former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, stated in his autobiography:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> The income related property tax was an idea of mine which I had worked on during 1982 with my daughter-in-law, Eithne.  Naturally enough when I put this to Dick Spring during our post election discussions, he was happy to accept my proposals.</P>
    <P>I am happy to put that quote on the record of the House although I am sure some of my colleagues have already done so.</P>
    <P>We must be fair to the Fianna Fáil Party.  My party leader, Deputy Ahern, was criticised by many Deputies today, particularly those of the Labour Party. They have some neck to make such criticisms because in 1994, the Government of which my party leader, Deputy Ahern, was a Minister, decided to adjust the valuation and income thresholds.  If those Deputies had bothered to check with their party leader and those who were in Government at the time they would know that this was a Labour Party agenda.  It is unfortunate, however, that rather than accept that fact they decided to use an old political trick and go on the attack.</P>
    <P>I realise Cabinet confidentiality must be respected in this House but Fianna Fáil was attacked in the past for being unable to compromise with other parties in power.  We are told Fianna Fáil is a stubborn party but the truth is that the Labour Party got its own way in regard to this issue.  If the Labour Party Deputies are listening I hope they will accept that fact and not attempt to twist the facts of history.</P>
    <P>This is a cruel, anti-family and anti-Dublin tax.  If Deputies were honest with themselves they would follow Deputy McCreevy, the other Fianna Fáil Members and the Progressive Democrats Members through the lobbies today to vote for this motion.  It was obvious from her contribution that Deputy Frances Fitzgerald is tortured by this debate and will find it difficult to walk in the opposite direction to our party when the vote is called shortly.</P>
    <P>This debate is connected to the whole <Col N="1294" /> debate on local authority service charges.  Many Members of this House have been members of local authorities and we are very much aware of the need for proper local authority financing. Our party spokesman, Deputy Dempsey, offered to co-operate with the Government on this issue but, unfortunately, it decided not to accept that genuine offer.  A White Paper on local government reform, promised by the Minister for the Environment, has been binned until after the next general election.</P>
    <P>Governments are elected to govern and to make difficult as well as easy decisions.  We have heard much good news recently and the Exchequer returns indicate that a great deal of money is available for a tax giveaway in the next budget; that has been well signalled.  Many favourable announcements have also been made about transfers from Europe, but it is clear that this Government has decided that if any problem or difficulty arises, they will simply kick it out of the way.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, got his way on the issue of the disconnection of householders who had not paid their water charges, on which there was a great deal of fudging, I said that the issue of local authority service charges would not be dealt with until the next Government comes to power.  I hope Fianna Fáil will be involved in such a Government because I know it has the ability, as it has shown in the past, to face up to such difficult issues.</P>
    <P>Local government is entitled to a proper system of local finance and with the opportunities that now exist to lower the level of taxation for PAYE workers in particular, such a system could be provided.  It is quite evident, however, that this Government does not have the guts to do that.</P>
    <P>We have heard some fine speeches here today, particularly from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who spoke about the need for tax and welfare reforms and then sat down.  I have heard that before and it is an insult to <Col N="1295" /> this House that the Minister of State would come in here and make various accusations about Fianna Fáil.  He is entitled, and indeed has a duty, to put forward concrete proposals during Private Members' time.  When he first came into this House, the Minister of State made various outlandish allegations and statements but on this issue he stated that this tax was anti-Dublin, anti-urban and anti-family.  Fianna Fáil Members agree with him but we would like to see some consistency with regard to his views on this subject.</P>
    <P>I will make some further brief comments, because I want to share my time with Deputy McDowell who supports Fianna Fáil on this matter, on the reasons this tax should be abolished. The tax discriminates against urban homes, mainly in Dublin, where values are higher; we have seen that in recent times.  Nearly 80 per cent of the tax is paid in the Dublin area.  Children's income is included in the assessment and children may have to leave the parental home; that is the reason I say the tax is anti-family.  There is no ceiling on RPT.  Taxes are unproductive when they are on property.  The tax reduces jobs in the building sector because people will not invest in home improvements and move upwards in the market.  The tax is anti-family because it is related to both home incomes, in other words, a type of poll tax, and to house values, a property tax.  Many rural householders with lower value homes but higher home incomes will avoid the tax.  This tax divides rural and urban Ireland and in that way it is a most contentious tax.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of hypocrisy in the debate.  All the parties in Government, particularly the Labour Party, attacked Fianna Fáil for what it did in the past.  They need to be reminded, however, that they introduced this tax in 1983.  Fianna Fáil made adjustments to it in Government but that was done out of a sense of compromise with the Labour Party in Government.  Now that we are in Opposition and free of the shackles of a Coalition Government, we are not only entitled <Col N="1296" /> but duty bound to produce our own policies.  Our policy on this particular tax is that it should be abolished.  I call on Deputies who feel strongly about this issue to act according to their statements and vote in favour of the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that a few days ago was the last occasion taxpayers will ever pay residential property tax because, one way or another, either this Government will remove it in the next budget or it will be removed by the electorate before the next payment date is due.  It is the end of this tax and I welcome that fact but I also reject completely the suggestion by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that the opposition to this tax is being cynically exploited for political purposes.  This tax is unfair and every Government Deputy who has spoken in the debate thus far has admitted it is unfair, but they believe the public had no voice until recently and nobody was willing to bring it to a head until recently.</P>
      <P>People living in areas where this tax particularly bears down on ordinary families will no longer tolerate it.  Deputy Broughan was on radio with me last night and announced to my astonishment that the Labour Party was in favour of repealing this tax.  If it is in favour of repealing it, who is holding out to keep it?  Is it the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who in the last few minutes said he believes it is unfair, or is it the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa?  Who is holding us to ransom to keep this tax in place?</P>
      <P>The question that really arises at this stage is not whether this is the last occasion on which the tax will be paid, but whether the reason it is going is that those ideologues who justified it year in year out in the past, who made a virtue of it, who said that it was the comfortable people in this country who were squealing, are now afraid of judgment on the issue and are running like scalded cats because they know they cannot justify this tax any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> People can get up in a heap about the fairness or unfairness of this tax.  At least one Member of Government rank in this House has managed to evade the tax because her house was occupied by James Joyce at one stage in the past. Are we not all famous men and women in our own ways?  If it is possible for one Member of the House to do it, could we not all throw open our houses to the public now and then, simply based on our own fame and, thereby, walk away from the tax?</P>
    <P>There are other manifest injustices in the tax.  For example, a High Court or Supreme Court judge might be earning at full power up to the age of 72 and be liable for RPT at 1.5 per cent a year on a house worth £300,000.  If, on reaching the age of 65, he or she takes the simple expedient of transferring the home into their spouse's name on the presumption that the spouse has no income of their own, they avoid taxation liability completely.  This can be achieved by simply signing the house for a number of years into the spouse's name.  That is not figurative, it is a real possibility.  It applies to businessmen and to many people who, if there were equity in this tax, would be liable for it.  By juggling pieces on a board, they can walk away from the tax.</P>
    <P>I published a leaflet on residential property tax which showed that a couple who owned a house worth £180,000 and who were lucky enough to also own a holiday home worth £80,000 would, on one scheme of ownership, owe the State £2,490 in tax, but by shifting the properties between them to minimise their tax exposure they would end up paying nothing.  What is fair about a tax like that where one couple can end up paying nothing because they have had good advice and have shifted their houses around between them and another couple living in an identical house and with the same income have to earn £5,000 gross to pay £2,490 net to the Exchequer on foot of this tax?</P>
    <P>Another point we must bear in mind is the rise in house prices.  How can people on fixed incomes plan their <Col N="1298" /> affairs if they may become liable this year or next year to pay an extra £1,200 in RPT because of a surge in house prices?  Last night the host of the radio programme on which I appeared said this was a tax for rich people.  However, two primary teachers, both working and living together in a modest terraced house in my constituency, not even a semi-detached house, could be well into this tax band.  They are ordinary people working hard to try to improve their situation.  They are trying to establish a family.  Both have to work outside the home and frequently have to pay someone to look after the children at home. These are modest people.  They are not the wealthy, the plutocrats in our society.  They get clobbered by this tax for living in a particular part of the city. It is an inequitable mean-minded illogical tax.  The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, for whom I have an immense personal fondness but with whom I am not on the same political wavelength described the genesis of this taxation in great detail in his autobiography &mdash; we have heard about it on a number of occasions in this House.  The mind boggles as to what other schemes were on the table when the pair produced this as the most workable of the proposals they had for introducing social justice in our society.  The mind boggles as to what was discarded as unworkable, unpopular or unfair if this was considered fair.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be glad to hear that I was present at a meeting when a very senior member of that party, whom we may have mentioned in the past few minutes, was urged to index tax bands and allowances.  I will not say whence the words came, but they resonate in my ears to this day &mdash;&ldquo;indexation of tax bands and allowances would be end of all social justice&rdquo;.  These are the people who wrote articles later saying that the tax system is unduly onerous on those at the bottom of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> When they were given the opportunity to index it and to keep it fair, they turned it down.  Without being personal or vindictive, this is the last year in which Irish people will pay residential property tax. The reason this is so, the reason Labour Party Deputies are running away from the issue and discovering its unfair qualities for the first time, the reason Democratic Left suddenly realised this is an insupportable tax is that the Government parties fear they will be hammered in Dublin at the next election if they do not give up on this tax in the next budget.</P>
    <P>The reason Government parties will not accept this motion today and table an amendment to the effect that RPT will be abolished in the next budget is that they want to increase the sense of pleasant surprise in the next budget and to increase the size of the bag of goodies so that everybody will be seen to have delivered to his or her constituency the next time round.  Instead of being man or woman enough to come into the House and say it will be abolished, this ridiculous game of mental striptease is being played; it may or may not go or it might or might not be modified.  I say it will go because if it does not the government that does not make it go will itself go and in short order.  This is, therefore, a moment of considerable pleasure to me.  Those of us who have opposed this tax, who asked ordinary people to subscribe to leaflets &mdash; Deputies Rabbitte and Shatter were somewhat disparaging about this &mdash; to write to Government Deputies and make their views clear, have brought about a situation in which this unfair tax will now go, and no one will lament its passing.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of Deputies in this House who will not even put their heads above the parapet.  They have been vociferous defenders of this tax in the past, but none of them has contributed to this debate to say that it is fair tax or that they would go up on the cross, so to speak, to defend it or to keep it there. It is suddenly not a matter of principle any more, quite the reverse; it is a matter of shame, a matter that nobody <Col N="1300" /> wants to be associated with.  Those of us who brought this issue before the electorate and told them that if it was not abolished in 1996 it would be abolished in 1997 can claim the credit for this implosion on the part of the supporters of residential property tax.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested that the Govenment wants to involve the Opposition in an all-party process to examine the issue of local government finances.  In 1993 during the budget debate in this House I suggested that this be approached on an all-party basis.</P>
    <P>In 1994 and 1995 I made the same offer.  In 1996, the matter was discussed at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Now, coming into 1997, the notion of an all-party committee is suddenly attractive to the Government as a vehicle for avoiding responsibility on this issue.  It is too late for that; let the Government govern and the people decide.  One cannot wait until the 11th hour and 59th minute for an all-party process when the best process is through the ballot box.  If local government finances are to be decided by an incoming Government, it is up to the parties to secure a mandate one way or another on the issue, and do what must be done about local government, which has nothing to do with residential property tax.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to give the Government's reply to the Fianna Fáil motion and to further commend to the House the Government's amendment to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Bertie Ahern accused the Government of &ldquo;suppressing hundreds of millions&rdquo; in tax revenue when preparing this year's budget. There is no foundation for this suggestion which I was surprised to hear from a former Minister for Finance.  The Department's tax forecasts for this year were prepared in the usual way taking a prudent but certainly not pessimistic view of economic prospects and with the technical assistance of the Revenue <Col N="1301" /> Commissioners.  Much of the extra buoyancy in tax receipts is attributable to stronger economic growth generally and in particular to stonger employment growth and higher consumer spending than was foreseen either by the Department or almost any other economic analyst at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>The budget was based on GNP growth of 5 per cent.  At that time, the Central Bank was forecasting 4.8 per cent; the ESRI, 5 per cent and Davy Stockbrokers, 5 per cent also.  The Department of Finance's budget day forecast of an increase in employment of 31,000 &mdash; 2.5 per cent &mdash; was in line with that of the ESRI and most other independent forecasters at the time.</P>
    <P>The Department's forecast of growth in consumer spending of 4.5 per cent was one of the most optimistic at the time.  It compares with forecasts of 3.25 per cent by the Central Bank, 4.25 per cent by the ESRI and 3.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent by the EU Commission and the OECD respectively.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to look back on what some of the market analysts said just after the budget was published.  For example, Davy Stockbrokers said on 23 January:</P>
    <P>We don't quibble much with the Department's tax projections... Overall the EBR target looks achieveable but an undershoot is not the highly probable outcome that was obvious on other Budget nights in recent years... We are at one with the Department of Finance in forecasting a deceleration in the pace of growth this year and a 5 per cent rise in real GNP.</P>
    <P>NCB Stockbrokers said:</P>
    <P>In our view the Budgetary targets should be robust.  If anything the official tax revenue forecasts err a little on the conservative side.</P>
    <P>The real facts about residential property tax should not be concealed.  The tax has been in existence since 1983.  The first major change in RPT was introduced in <Col N="1302" /> 1994, when the value and income thresholds were reduced to £75,000 and £25,000 respectively, thereby widening the number of households affected by the tax.  This Government's <i>Programme of Renewal</i> gave a specific commitment to reverse the changes introduced in the 1994 Budget.  This commitment was met at the earliest possible date in the 1995 Budget and subsequent Finance Act.</P>
    <P>I hope that we have finally put to rest the myth that those paying RPT are paying huge amounts.  The figures produced by the Revenue Commissioners on RPT show that 30 per cent paid less than £100 and 71 per cent paid less than £500 last year.  Of course, a person exceeding the income exclusion threshold and living in a substantial urban property may be faced with higher RPT liabilities but, even then, he or she will be eligible to avail of the reliefs to reduce his or her actual liability, for example, by 10 per cent for each dependent child.  The statistics from Revenue also prove that the incidence of RPT is quite small affecting some 2 per cent of income tax payers.  I quote those figures not to trivialise the debate or the tax but to ensure that a proper sense of perspective is maintained.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister of State's speech last night knocked on the head the myth that RPT is a Dublin tax. Statistics show that three-quarters of RPT is paid by persons in Dublin city and county but the reasons for this are equally relevant to any capital city in the world &mdash; most of a country's valuable residential properties are found in capital cities and income in capital cities tends to be higher.  This means that in any national tax based on market values it is inevitable that persons in high value areas will pay a disproportionately higher proportion of the overall tax.  It is disingenuous to suggest that this means that the tax is unfair or biased when it must be accepted that the market values are the most equitable for assessment.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, rightly took the time last night to highlight the many other improvements in personal and business <Col N="1303" /> taxation brought forward by this Government.  All of those measures are in direct contradiction to the charges made by the Opposition speakers and I again place on record the Government's commitment to continue to develop a climate for enterprise, investment and individual reward.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from statements made in this House by members of all political parties &mdash; not only this afternoon and last evening but over the last number of years &mdash; that a vast number of them are against the residential property tax.  I know I will bore the House by repeating some of those comments but it is worthwhile doing so.</P>
      <P>On 23 March 1994, Deputy Rabbitte, who is now a Minister of State, made a statement in the House with regard to the changes in the residential property tax.  He confirmed today that he still holds the view that the tax was anti-Dublin, anti-urban and anti-family.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, who was the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance in 1994, was very critical of the tax.  He gave a good example of the effect of the tax in 1994 when he said that a person who might have come to work in Dublin years ago and bought a modest house would find himself paying £850 in residential property tax.  That was over two years ago so one could increase that amount substantially due to the increase in house values since.  To illustrate that the rates are biased, Deputy Yates compared a house in Dublin to one in Letterkenny, County Donegal, where a resident would have paid £240.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 24 September 1996, eight members of the Labour Party signed a statement in Dublin stating that the residential property tax should be abolished.  They have seen the errors of their ways and I am sure they are pushing within the Labour Party to have the tax abolished in the forthcoming budget. They know it was never envisaged that <Col N="1304" /> ordinary people, who are being hit now by the tax, would come into the tax net. They see the effect the tax will have at the next election and they are looking for its abolition.  No doubt the Minister for Finance will give them a good ear.</P>
    <P>The Minister who introduced the tax in the 1983 budget was Deputy Dukes and he made the following statement in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 25 August 1996:</P>
    <P>It was a bad tax.  I say that as the minister who brought it in.  Labour wanted some other element of capital taxation so that they could say to their perceived group of voters, who wouldn't be paying it, that there was a way which better off people would contribute.</P>
    <P>It produced a lame duck, a difficult to manage system that was arbitrary and led to more aggravation than revenue.  It was always going to produce anomalous situations.  I'd prefer to see it gone, quite frankly.  The taxation system should not be something that determines how people go about choosing the kind of house they are going to live in.  It was a badly designed tax which was brought in for a reason which had nothing to do with the taxation of residential property.</P>
    <P>I am sure he has not changed his mind even though he has not come into the House today.  When Deputy Dukes makes a statement he stands by it.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left is made up of two elements: the provisional Democratic Left of two Members, Deputies Lynch and Byrne and the official Democratic Left in the Cabinet.  The provisionals make skirmishes and let the people know the real policies of Democratic Left and that bartering goes on within the Cabinet.  In yesterday's edition of <i>The Examiner</i> Deputy Lynch stated that the residential property tax would go for the simple reason that the service charges have to be abolished as well. One will be bartered against the other. The reason is it also suits the Labour Party &mdash; that Mr. Joe Higgins, who has <Col N="1305" /> been campaigning against water and service charges made a big impact in the last by-election in Dublin.  If both wings of Democratic Left and The Labour Party can agree with Fine Gael, who want to get rid of the tax, it can be used as a bartering tool.  As Deputy McDowell said there are vested interests on all sides.  There is nothing surer that residential property tax will be abolished in the next budget.</P>
    <P>It is tautology at this stage to continue to say it is arbitrary, inequitable, unfair and strikes at the heart of the family.  It is striking at the heart of more and more families throughout the country than was ever intended as the value of houses has escalated enormously during the past year or so.  It is a wealth tax which was insisted on by the Labour Party to get funding from the wealthy but it is now hitting people who could not in any manner or form be declared as wealthy. The Labour Party pushed for changes in the rates and limits in 1994.  It was the baby of some of the militant plinth-loving camera-hugging left-wing members of the Labour Party who insisted there would be changes in 1994.  For Members to come in and blame Deputy Ahern for carrying out those changes is a bit rich. We are all aware that in a coalition Government there must be compromise.  When parties threaten at every hands-turn to pull out of Government unless they get exactly what they want and when sectors of a party threaten their leadership they will pull the plug unless something radical is done the result is that the tail is wagging the dog. That happened in 1994.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to listen to the ordinary people who are asking that this tax be changed and to Members from every political party and announce he will remove it.  We all know he will do it. Members from all sides have requested it to be changed and have pointed out the reasons for change.  There will be no political advantage if he announces it on budget day.  Every party, including the Labour Party, has said it because it knows what will happen.  The Fine Gael <Col N="1306" /> Party surprised me because it has kept quiet about it even though I am aware that behind the scenes it is saying it must be done because its supporters are those most affected.  I ask the Minister to come clean, announce it and get it over and done with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes remaining I would like to quote a fairly good synopsis of why we should abolish residential property tax.  Deputy Michael Ahern has made some apt quotations from Deputy Alan Dukes in a recent interview where he spelt out the reasoning, the background and the political goings-on prior to its introduction in 1983.  He, as the Minister for Finance who introduced it, gave the reasons it should be abolished.  I quote from another person some comments on the reason it should be abolished.  He said:</P>
      <P>We are happy to support the campaign of the Home Owners Rights Association and put pressure on the Minister for Finance to abolish the tax...</P>
      <P>In this context Fine Gael is happy to support the petition and to endorse it with our individual signatures.  We sincerely hope that the Government will reconsider their position in this matter and realise that, in effect, the RPT is a surtax on incomes as family homes provide no liquidity or income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is from a letter written by Deputy Yates, the then Fine Gael spokesperson on Finance in April 1994.  Deputy Yates and other Fine Gael Deputies signed a petition which called on the Government to abolish residential property tax. Of all the people who contributed, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, appeared to be the only person who spoke in favour of retaining the residential property tax.  All the others referred to the inequities and the anomalies. Deputy Frances Fitzgerald went very far down the road and said she would abolish it.  Deputy McDowell was able to inform the House that the new political guru of the Labour Party, Deputy <Col N="1307" /> Broughan, announced on a radio programme last night, on behalf of the Government, that it would be abolished. I am sure this was news to the Minister, Deputy Taylor.  While I respect Deputy Broughan I did not think Deputy Spring had given him a licence to announce Government policy on the radio.</P>

      <P>Maybe the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will be left on her own because her speech was the only one that gave any credence to it.  An interesting point from her speech &mdash; it is a gem and should be pinned up in all Government Departments as to how to write the obvious &mdash; reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> As already stated, the present value exemption threshold is £101,000.  If on 5 April 1996 the property was worth less than that amount there is no tax liability regardless of the size of household income.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether people go on courses to write such material but would they please go on a new course because this is blindingly obvious even to Members of Democratic Left and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>This whole debate and the run-down to the abolition of the residential property tax is perhaps a commentary on the political system and the way it has changed in the past number of years. Speakers in the House have reminded us that Democratic Left and the Labour Party are after the votes of the middle ground rather than the extremes and are competing with one another to abolish this tax.</P>
    <P>For the past 30 years or longer they have made numerous speeches on taxation of the rich.  Maybe it is good that the type of nonsense we had to endure during that period is coming to a head.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the necessity for strategic alliance in this context. Deputy Brennan was highly critical of the very concept of the strategic alliance transaction.  The Bill deals with the reality of the evolving telecommunications markets and the strategic alliance is part and parcel of this response.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan is a critic of the alliance concept, the alliance agreement, the alliance process, the alliance partners, the alliance terms and the alliance advisers.  While the Deputy is unlikely in these circumstances to be converted to the benefits of an alliance agreement.  I will nonetheless make the following relevant points.  Alliances are common internationally.  In the last few years successful transactions have taken place in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Belgium.  Fresh alliance processes are slated for Portugal and South Africa.  The alliance process has also been used in the past in New Zealand and in numerous other cases.  Why has this happened?  It has happened because alliance processes have proven to be successful in developing telecommunications capability, in equipping operators for competition and in bringing advanced services for customers to the market place.</P>
      <P>KPN-Telia are major international players.  It was the company identified as an ideal choice by the Communications Workers Union.  KPN-Telia is a major player in successful alliances. They won the competition to supply telecommunications services to the Czech Republic.  As individual companies they have taken up investments in Asia and in the former Soviet Union. The consortium was runner up in Belgium to Ameritech and are likely to be participants in the Portugal alliance process.  As well as being successful in their own right, they have been successful as consortia members in the international environment.  Perhaps we should ask why they have been so successful.  These companies have successfully gone through the liberalisation process in their own countries.</P>
      <P>The remarks of many critics about the alliance deal could be summarised as &ldquo;cash is king&rdquo;.  The argument could be distilled to the point that all one needs to compete in the telecommunications market is cash.  That was the preponderant thrust of the contributions from Members opposite.  According to those critics &mdash; Deputy Brennan in particular &mdash; pension funds could contribute more in cash terms and they claim, therefore this is not a good deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>KPN-Telia bring much more than cash to the deal.  They bring technology people, skills and hardware.  They bring their wherewithal to partner Telecon Éireann to liberalisation and beyond Their strategic contributions are a key part of a deal which encompasses 85 <Col N="1313" /> separate initiatives.  The deal incorporates more than 100 job years of management input and this key part of the alliance equation will be delivered.</P>
    <P>Independent financial comment on the terms obtained for the deal has been positive.  Members opposite should read some of those comments, one of which stated &ldquo;Lowry has got it just about right&rdquo;.  Because of its intrinsic merits, the deal received widespread welcome from various interested parties.  The structure of international telecommunications is evolving around a number of key alliances.  World Partners (Unisource &amp; AT &amp; T), Concert (BT &amp; MCI) and Global One (Sprint, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom) are giants on the world stage.  It is inconceivable that Ireland could choose to ignore those developments.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy O'Malley, the transaction generates cash for the Exchequer from closing.  Of the total financial proceeds to be generated, £220 million will be invested in the company. The remainder will benefit the Exchequer by offsetting the State's liability to the pension fund.  Deputy Brennan put forward the argument that KPN/Telia would invest substantially in the company and then do everything possible to depress value to minimise the payments to be made by the company under the financial terms of the transaction.  When would this depression of value occur?  It would happen in the next three years, the crucial period leading to liberalisation. What telecommunications company would adopt such a boomerang strategy to deliberately denude the company of value in a partly protected market in order to spring back into maximum value in a wholly open market?  No company would, and KPN/Telia certainly have not.</P>
    <P>The Government has undertaken a justification procedure on the derogation from competition, a process that is ongoing.  At this stage remarks on <Col N="1314" /> final Commission thinking on the subject are pure speculation.  The Commission has not indicated that Telecom Éireann will be required to divest itself of its interests in Cablelink.  The Government has decided that, in the context of the alliance, Cablelink will be the subject of a separate dynamic business plan leading, without undue delay, to the development of a platform for delivery of a range of communications services which is open to a variety of competitive providers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley called into question the Government's commitment to liberalisation of the market.  If the Government set out to impede competition, it has achieved very little.  A second GSM licence has issued this year.  We have chosen not to opt for the full derogation from competition and formed a strategic alliance that will accelerate the transformation process.  Our commitment to independent regulation in the legislation clearly signals our intention to create an open and fair environment for competition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked why we are entering this alliance.  The answer is very simple.  An extensive programme of EU liberalisation measures points clearly in the direction that national regulatory authorities will be separate and independent from the operators and owners of telecommunications networks.  The telecommunications industry, consumers and not least parties across the political spectrum agree on this issue.  The first steps were taken some time ago and I am now bringing before the House the process of delegating the necessary legal authority to an independent regulator.</P>
    <P>It would have been foolish to embark on a search for a strategic alliance parnter without a proper regulatory framework in prospect.  Further legislation on this subject will be introduced in future.  Additional regulatory functions will be identified in due course, whether arising from EU obligations or from market circumstances.  The remaining legislation will need to be <Col N="1315" /> reviewed in the light of emerging competition in the telecommunications market and there is the obvious need to consolidate our telecommunications and wireless telegraphy codes.  In saying that there will be a multisectoral regulator later, I was referring to the Government's proposals for a wider ranging authority covering the energy and communications sectors and the establishment of such a body will require further legislation.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of the independence of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.  Deputies Brennan, O'Malley and Noel Ahern appear to have missed the vital provisions of the Bill that underline this. Paragraph 10 of the First Schedule provides that the Director shall be independent in the exercise of his or her functions and, under paragraphs 4 and 5, may not be removed from office except for the usual incapacity reasons.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 state clearly that it is the existing functions of the Minister that are transferred and that the Director can do all such acts or things as are necessary to carry them out.  Under paragraph 5, he is entitled to the necessary staff and other resources and, under section 6, to secure the necessary funding.  Under paragraph 12, he can appoint additional staff with the consent of the Minister for Finance to ensure overall numbers are controlled.  The fact that his opinion is inside the Civil Service does not impugn his legally separate identity and independence.  The fact that his staff will be civil servants on secondment does not render them or him subject to the control mentioned by the Deputies.  Other offices, such as that of the Director of Consumer Affairs, could hardly be said to be under the contol of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Deputies raised the question of the price cap dealt with in section 7. Again, they appear to have grasped the wrong end of the stick.  The price cap is designed to ensure that there can be real price reductions in the overall basket of services and when inflation is low this can translate into real nominal <Col N="1316" /> reductions.  It is not, as Deputies appear to believe, a mechanism for increases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív referred to the differentials between trunk and local call prices in the context of the imposition of a price cap.  What the Deputy advocated would be ideal in due course, but it is not a simple or straightforward procedure.  Price reductions on the scale demanded would have major implications for the country.  Trunk call prices are set to fall and I hope the target set by Deputy Ó Cuív will be realised within a reasonable timespan.  It is certainly not something which can be achieved overnight without major cost implications.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question about the definition of telecommunications services used in section 7.  This is necessarily broad in order to protect consumers from predatory tariff adjustments in markets where competition is insufficient to drive prices down across the board.  The definition provides no protection for the dominant position of any service provider but ensures maximum consumer protection.</P>
    <P>The importance of this Bill cannot be underestimated.  The availability of advanced telecommunications is increasingly important for the maintenance and enhancement of Ireland's competitive advantage.  My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, outlined the main considerations when he introduced the Bill.  In particular, developments in telecommunications technology are increasing capacity, reducing costs and extending the range of services on offer. In addition, the growth of the services sector throughout the world requires more and more information transfers. There is a significant opportunity for Ireland to achieve additional economic growth and job creation through the further development of the services sector and the availability of competitively priced advanced telecommunications will be necessary if Ireland is to avail of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to <Col N="1317" /> having a telecommunications sector which would underpin further economic growth and job creation.  The Bill puts in place a number of important enablers for this: by facilitating the transformation of Telecom Éireann through the strategic alliance; by establishing an independent regulator for the sector; and by putting in place a new system for regulating telecommunications tarriffs. These enablers must be put in place as <Col N="1318" /> early as possible in order to facilitate the further development of the sector without interfering with the development and implementation of longer term solutions relating to regulation and liberalisation of the sector.  I have covered most of the points raised by the Deputy and I thank the House for its attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short but important Bill is to amend the Civil Liability Act, 1961, and the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, so as to increase the maximum amount of compensation that may be awarded by the court for mental distress to dependants of a deceased in fatal injury cases under those Acts, and to extend the categories of persons who have a right to claim such damages as well as damages for loss of benefits and for any funeral expenses.</P>
      <P>Part IV of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, gives to dependants of a deceased a right to claim damages as compensation for mental distress, for loss of pecuniary benefits and for funeral expenses where the death has been caused by the wrongful act of another. They are in the nature of a class action, where one case is taken for the benefit of all the dependants.</P>
      <P>The dependants of a deceased generally have a cause of action under Part IV, if, first, the circumstances were such that but for his or her death, the injured party would have been entitled to take an action for damages against the party who caused the fatal injury.  Second, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that there was a family type relationship in existence between the claimants and the deceased.  The right of action is confined to family relatives including spouses, children, grandparents, brothers and sisters.  Part IV does not extend to cohabitants or to a spouse whose marriage to the deceased was dissolved or annulled even though it may be the case that persons within those categories may have suffered loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most actions under Part IV, the <Col N="1321" /> substantial damages payable are those which relate to the loss of pecuniary benefits, which take account of the deceased's income and future prospects. The level of damages are of such amount as the judge may consider appropriate resulting from the death, apportioned to each of the dependants. Damages are fixed by the court to compensate for the dependant's future losses.  In the event of contributory negligence on the deceased's part, the level of damages are proportionately reduced.  In certain circumstances, most commonly where a child dies, loss of pecuniary benefits does not arise.</P>
    <P>The maximum amount of compensation payable for mental distress in fatal injury cases was set at £1,000 in section 49 of the 1961 Act and that figure was increased to its present level of £7,500 by the Courts Act, 1981.  The level of damages fixed by the court, subject to the maximum prescribed by law, is the total of such amounts as the judge shall consider reasonable compensation for mental distress resulting from the death to each dependant.</P>
    <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, as amended by a series of amending Acts, the latest being the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, contains provisions which correspond to those in Part IV of the 1961 Civil Liability Act.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for certain important changes in the definitions section of Part IV of the 1961 Act.  A fact in society in recent decades, which cannot be ignored, in terms of the law on civil liability, is that many couples, not being married to one another, live together as husband and wife and others still have foreign divorces which are entitled to recognition in the State.  The narrow definition of dependants who are entitled to claim damages under Part IV of the 1961 Act needs to be broadened.  Cohabitants and former spouses may suffer financial loss because of the death of their partner or former spouse.  The 1961 Act does not <Col N="1322" /> cater for that and I am now glad to do something about it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the effect of section 1 is to amend the definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; in Part IV of the 1961 Act so as to extend that definition to include persons who, not being married to one another, have been living together as husband and wife for at least three years before the date of death of the other.  Those persons will be able to claim all of the damage provided for in Part IV, that is, damages for loss of pecuniary benefits, for funeral expenses and for mental distress.  There is provision in section 2 (1) (c) to the effect that the court in determining the damages to be awarded for loss of pecunairy benefits, must take into account the fact, if it be the case, that the cohabitant had no enforceable right to financial maintenance by the deceased.  A key feature of the claimant's entitlement to damages will be dependency.</P>
    <P>Section 1 also broadens the definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; to include a person whose marriage to the deceased has been dissolved by a foreign decree of divorce that is entitled to recognition in the State.  Such a person could have been in a position of dependency on the deceased former spouse and it is reasonable to entitle that person to claim damages under Part IV.  However, the effect of section 3 is that a divorced spouse will not be entitled to claim damages for mental distress.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring forward an amendment in due course to the definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; in the present Bill to include persons whose marriage has been dissolved in the State.  Alternatively, should the Bill be passed before the Divorce Bill I shall propose an amendment to the Divorce Bill to cover the point.</P>
    <P>Section 2 increases the maximum amount that may be awarded to dependants for mental distress in fatal injury cases from £7,500 to £15,000.  The adjustment of the maximum figure to £15,000 is in line with the increase in inflation during the period from 1981 to date.  In providing for this increase, I am <Col N="1323" /> conscious that no money can compensate for the loss of a close family member.  However, the provision in the 1961 Act was not framed to place a monetary value on the life of a deceased person. Rather it is a <i>solatium</i> or a statutory acknowledgement that such pain and grief merits court recognition when a compensation award is being made.  It is an admission of the need to recognise the existence of this distress in some tangible way.  The law is not silent on the matter of grief and the provision probably goes as far as it can to give the matter recognition.  Section 2 also enables any future increases in that level of compensation to be made by way of ministerial order, taking into account the value of money in the State at the time of the increase.  The House will agree that is a sensible way to proceed for the future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, as amended, contains provisions which correspond to those in Part IV of the 1961 Act.  Accordingly, section 4 makes provision for amendments to section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, which are consequential on the amendments provided for in sections 1, 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>A final point of detail is that, by virtue of certain subsections in sections 1, 2, 3 and 4, each of the amendments in those sections shall not have effect in relation to a cause of action that accrues before those amendments come into operation.  The amendments will come into operation on the date of the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the changes provided for are important in their own right.  The increase in the maximum level of damages for mental distress is overdue and that level can, on the basis of ministerial order provided for in the Bill, be subject to more regular revision in the future.  The extension of categories of dependants who can claim damages for mental distress and for loss of pecuniary benefits or for funeral expenses makes the law more equitable. I am happy to take this opportunity to <Col N="1324" /> bring our law in this area up to date.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister recognises the importance of this Bill coming into operation without delay. Perhaps, we can discuss that further on Committee Stage.  The amendments will come into operation on the date of the passing of the Bill.  I will comment on other aspects of that later.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a welcome amendment to an Act which has been of great benefit to the surviving dependants of deceased family members.  Most Deputies will have encountered tragic circumstances in which a family member is killed through negligence or wrongdoing and the family is left without a spouse, who may have been the breadwinner.</P>
      <P>It is a very tragic position and the dependants should be adequately compensated.  In debating this Bill we are examining the position which obtained in 1961 and ascertaining how we might reshape it to meet the circumstances prevailing today.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Question No. 12 from Deputy Woods on 25 October 1995, which sought my commitment to Fianna Fail's proposal for the establishment of a commissioner for <Col N="1325" /> children in advance of the divorce referendum, I pointed out that the law and administrative measures already contained within them substantial protections and supports in relation to children, that the divorce referendum proposal, as contained in the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill as well as the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill containing the details of divorce, were designed in such a way as to facilitate best the welfare of children.  I made clear that while the proposal in relation to a commissioner for children was of some interest it would have to be examined carefully as to its precise role and operation.  In reply to Questions Nos. 12 and 62 of 6 December 1995 as to progress made on examination of his party's proposal, I indicated that I was not in a position to go beyond what I had already said in the House on 25 October 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently been given to understand that the proposal for a post of commissioner for children would mean the following: as part of a mandatory process the commissioner would inform parties to separation and divorce proceedings about the effects on children of marital disharmony, marriage breakdown, separation or divorce &mdash; as the case may be &mdash; and of ways and means to avoid the harmful effects on children; where in the separation or divorce proceedings the judge was satisfied that the physical, moral, emotional, educational and psychological welfare of any child was not being adequately served by the parents who are parties to the proceedings or by their representatives, the commissioner must be made a party to the proceedings for the purpose of representing the children; for the purpose of discharging his or her functions the commissioner would be entitled to engage the services of such professionals as appear to be necessary; the costs incurred by the commissioner in discharging his or her functions would be awarded against either parent at the discretion of the court, and an office of commissioner for children would be <Col N="1326" /> established and maintained out of the Exchequer purse with so many officers as the Minister for Finance would determine.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that at no stage in the run up to the referendum were voters told that one of the conditions for the obtaining of a decree of divorce would be mandatory attendance at information sessions about the effects of divorce on children.  The divorce referendum proposal on which the people voted had no such provision nor did the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill or that Bill as now passed by this House.  It is open to question in any event as to whether persons should be compelled to attend at information sessions on separation and divorce.  The question also arises as to whether such an exercise, in some cases, would be wasteful of valuable resources that would largely fall to be paid by the Exchequer.  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission recommend a system of family courts in which an information pack would be given to parties to proceedings.  There is merit in that proposal and I am sure it is one that will be addressed by the courts service and, in the context of its current review of operation of the courts, by the commission on the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has already indicated that she will examine the concept of a family court system in the light of any recommendations made by the courts commission and the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to representation of children in family law proceedings, the present provisions in this area are contained in the Child Care Act, 1991. Under section 25 of that Act the court may make a child a party to all or part of proceedings under Part IV, care proceedings, and Part VI, child in care of health boards, and it may also appoint a solicitor to represent the child.  Provision is made under section 26 for the court to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> where the child is not a party to the proceedings.  In joining a child as a party to proceedings or in appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i> the court must be satisfied that <Col N="1327" /> it is necessary in the interests of the child and of justice to do so.  The costs and expenses of the solicitor or guardian <i>ad litem</i> are payable, in the first instance, by the local health board.</P>
    <P>My understanding also is that in proceedings between parents under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, children have been joined as parties through a next friend in exercise of the court's obligation to regard a child's welfare as the paramount consideration. The law as it operates in relation to the Acts of 1964 and 1991 would also operate as appropriate in separation and divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>I am aware of recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission on the representation of children as well as a system of guardian <i>ad litem.</i> I am giving attention to those matters in the context of the Children Bill which is being drafted to update, among other matters, the law on guardianship, custody of and access to children and, if provision on either or both of those matters is found to be feasible and warranted I shall make appropriate provision in that Bill for them.</P>
    <P>In making their recommendations on legal representation and on guardians <i>ad litem</i> the commission noted that the best approach in some cases will be for a judge to interview a child in chambers. The commission acknowledge that this is a practice which is used in our jurisdiction as in others.</P>
    <P>A reality whcih cannot be ignored is that the provision of separate representation for children whether it is in the context of office, the establishment of an office of a commission for children as proposed by the Deputy or otherwise, could add substantially to the cost of divorce or separation proceedings.  This could have the potential of making proceedings more adversarial and complex. Spouses have an important and personal responsibility to ensure that their separation or divorce is managed in a way which impacts with minimum trauma upon any children who are a party to that marriage and that the children do not become a weapon in the emotional <Col N="1328" /> battles which regrettably can be a feature of marriage breakdown worldwide. For these reasons my Department has been particularly active in promoting the wider use of mediation and counselling as an alternative to court resolution of marital disputes.  Our separation laws are designed to direct couples' minds to the possibilities for a mediated settlement and the Family Law (Divorce) Bill does likewise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would also draw the attention of the Deputy to section 47 of the Family Law Act, 1995 under which the court may order a report on the welfare of a child or any party in separation and certain other family law proceedings from a health board, the Probation and Welfare Service or any person.  These are most important child-centred provisions which are being extended to divorce proceedings.  This will ensure that, where necessary, there will be available to the court an in-depth background report on the welfare of a child.  I regard those provisions to be potentially more important to the court in making decisions in relation to children than separate representation and a system of guardian <i>ad litem.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that a commissioner for children, with an office and the resources that would be involved, together with the concentrated, positive representation of children it would entail, would constitute far better protection than that contained in the long list the Minister read out of the activities of different Departments, the courts and so on, acting in a piecemeal fashion?  It is no wonder that children are experiencing difficulties today, are abused, set aside and disappointed or resort to drugs because, as we know, a great deal of their problems emanate from marital difficulties, broken families, conflicts with the law and so on.  Does the Minister accept there is need for an office of commissioner for children, a comprehensive rather than narrowly-based office, with wider powers somewhat along the lines referred to by him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced of the Deputy's suggestion.  The very extensive provisions and protections for children in marriage breakdown, which were recently introduced, are effective and will continue to be so.  Courts have power under the legislation to obtain reports and appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> where necessary and judges have the right to interview children privately in chambers to ascertain the position.  All those factors provide for an extensive and broad-ranging system for the protection of children who tragically and sadly are caught up in marriage breakdown, whether in separation or, as it will be, divorce.  We will have to see how that system operates when the divorce legislation comes into practice.  I am prepared to keep an open mind on the subject to see how it works in practice and whether the extensive provisions in the existing legislation and the Divorce Bill will be adequate.  That matter will be kept under ongoing review and if further measures are necessary in due course I will be very happy to consider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for at least giving some consideration to the proposals, but he should consider setting up a commission for children. There is a constitutional requirement on the Government to provide protection because currently children are not being protected.  Rather than waiting for all the details to fall into place to see how the system works over a period, will the Minister join me in my vision of the future?  The people looked to the future and decided in the referendum that we should have a divorce jurisdiction. Should we not now look beyond these difficulties and, if we genuinely want to protect children, appoint a commissioner for children, with a well resourced office?  I was disappointed the Minister mentioned costs so often.  Costs should not be an issue in this instance. By ensuring that the existing measures are properly utilised, the kind of office we are talking about could be very efficient and effective without great <Col N="1330" /> cost.  Will the Minister look forward and consider appointing a commissioner who would provide protection for children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that everything possible must be done to protect children.  That was a key factor of the divorce referendum.  We have written into the Constitution the prior requirement that the interests and protection of spouses and children must be provided for before a court may grant a decree of divorce.  That important provision is reflected in the Divorce Bill which was passed by this House.  The Child Care Act contains very extensive measures for the protection of children, such as provision for applications for custody and access to children and care of children, and they will apply in cases of marriage breakdown.  Those measures, together with the power in the Family Law Act to obtain reports where necessary from the Probation and Welfare Service, will meet the requirements.  An extensive broadly-based system of protections is in place which will operate reasonably well in the case of marriage breakdown.</P>
      <P>There are always difficulties for children in marriage breakdown and I am not in a position to say whether the device suggested by Deputy Woods of making mandatory provision for interviews and so on would be counter-productive.  We will bring the divorce legislation into operation, get the system up and running and see how it operates for the spouses and children involved.  We will then re-examine the matter and whatever further action is required will be sympathetically considered by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 19 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and I expect it to be published in the current Dáil session.  I have had consultations with a wide range of interested parties and bodies about the proposed legislation and I am available for further consultations as necessary.  The views and suggestions put forward by various bodies during the consultations have been noted and will be taken fully into account in the finalisation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1996, which was published on 3 July 1996 prohibits discrimination in employment in both public and private sectors on a wide range of grounds.  The Bill prohibits discrimination on age grounds, subject to certain conditions, in relation to all aspects of employment including discrimination in recruitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> I am not aware of any court decision which would warrant a review of the proposed equal status legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In his consultations has the Minister reached a point where he has resolved the difficulties that arose in the management of premises?  We are very anxious to move this legislation forward and the longer it is delayed the more controversy develops.  The Minister has received proposals from, for instance, the Licensed Vintners' Association.  Has he made progress in resolving the thorny issue where a publican needs to maintain the right to refuse entry to the premises?  Will the Minister give an up-date on that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is in course of preparation in my Department and Deputies will have to await its finalisation.  I listened sympathetically to the representations put to me.  Consultations are ongoing with interested people, groupings and associations and all proposals put to me receive careful examination and consideration.  I will be happy to discuss the details of the Bill with Deputies when I am in a position to publish it, which I hope will be soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe it will be possible to reconcile the disparate interests in this case?  The principal protagonists are the vintners and representatives of the travelling community.  A formula has been put to the Minister.  Has he viewed this sympathetically and does he believe that he will be able to reconcile these interests?  I am sorry to say that there has been polarisation on that topic.  I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether it will be possible to reconcile what she describes as conflicting views on this complex issue.  It is always possible to reconcile everything except the irreconcilable.  I am taking all views into consideration in finalising the legislation.  It is regrettable that an extensive debate seems to be taking place outside <Col N="1333" /> the House on this subject as though the proposed Equal Status Bill will refer to nothing else but pubs and travellers.  It will deal with the supply of goods and services to a large range of categories of people who are seen to be disadvantaged in other areas.  For example, the supply of an insurance policy, mortgage or bank loan to a woman as well as people with disabilities will be covered as will age discrimination.  It is regrettable that it is coming down to a net point of pubs and travellers, an important issue, but far from being the only one involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to this matter.  I thank the Minister for giving us an assurance that he will publish the Bill this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my hope and expectation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will be glad to hear that.  In the meantime, he might consider bringing together people who have opposing views.  It might be useful to bring together the travelling community, licensed vintners, restaurateurs and other who have expressed concern about the Bill to try to find a workable solution.  We cannot go much further until the Minister puts his proposals on the table.</P>
      <P>In the latter part of my question I asked the Minister if he will consider removing without further delay age discrimination regarding entry into the public service.  The situation throughout the public service is very confusing. When we discussed this matter before I mentioned to the Minister that there was an age limit of 50 for a lower clerical position.  I am glad to say that the man to who I was referring, who is 51 years of age and is fit and active, has since got a good job in the new Marks &amp; Spencers in Dublin.  It is crazy that he is refused entry to the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has the makings of some good questions to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment and perhaps one or two others.  He should direct questions regarding the cases he cites to the appropriate Minister.</P>
      <P>Age limits for recruitment to the public sector are not enshrined in legislation.  Legislation governing recruitment to the Civil Service is silent on the question of age limits.  After the enactment of the Employment Equality Bill, 1996 public sector employers as well as others in the private sector will have to comply with its terms as far as age equality is concerned.  It comes under the ambit of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to irreconcilable differences.  I am sure he realises that many groups are dismayed at the delay in publishing the Equal Status Bill.  A way must be found to free the blockage sooner rather than later. Would it be possible to facilitate a face <Col N="1335" /> to face meeting of those with irreconcilable differences?  Does the Minister think this would be a good idea or that it would be possible to free the blockage within the Department?</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned that many areas will be encompassed by the Bill, particularly those which affect the status of women.  It is ironic that when we refer to women &mdash; I am not saying that the Minister refers to them in this way &mdash; we refer to them as if they were a minority group although they are in a slight majority in this society.  How near is the Minister to reconciling these irreconcilable differences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, I am sure unintentionally, misinterpreting what I said.  I did not say there was anything irreconcilable in the preparation of the Equal Status Bill.  What I said was that the only issues which are not reconcilable are those which are irreconcilable. My objective is to produce legislation which is appropriate, balanced, fair and reasonable.  I am working very hard to achieve this.  It is very important that we should introduce such legislation.  As Deputies know, the legislation will enable Ireland to ratify a very important international convention on racism which has been ratified by 140 countries worldwide.  It is extremely important that we ratify this convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will meet anybody who wants to meet with me in connection with the legislation.  Yesterday I had a meeting with another Chamber of Commerce.  I do not think it is necessary or advisable to bring together groups that may have different approaches to it.  This is the place to discuss those issues and to consider any compromises that may be appropriate.  We do that very well in this House under the guidance of the Ceann Comhairle, and we will do so in connection with this Bill.  I hope we will bring forward good legislation on a difficult and complex area.  I look forward to the debate on this legislation and I will continue to have a sympathetic ear to the views of various groups but, even more <Col N="1336" /> so, to the views of Deputies on all sides of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a copy of the report entitled &ldquo;Quality Through Equality in Dublin Corporation&rdquo; and I welcome its contribution to furthering equality of opportunity in the workplace.  The report, which presents the findings of an analysis of employment equality in Dublin Corporation, received the full co-operation of the management and staff of Dublin Corporation and of the main trade union, IMPACT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study was promoted by the Employment Equality Agency and cofunded by the European Social Fund with a view to establishing a model of best practice with regard to equal <Col N="1337" /> opportunities for Dublin Corporation, which would also be relevant and adaptable for use in other similar public sector employments.</P>
    <P>While this report is first and foremost the work of Dublin Corporation and IMPACT I have brought the report to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Employment Equality Agency that the dissemination of the report among other local authorities is under way and it is expected that it will provide a valuable model for best practice as regards equal opportunities in this sector.</P>
    <P>I am aware from my Department's contacts with the Department of the Environment that concerted efforts are being made across local authorities to pursue equal opportunities policies and plans.  I am hopeful that progress in this area will be confirmed when a further survey of equal opportunities in this sector, planned for 1997, is undertaken.</P>
    <P>The report is one of a number that deals with the subject of equal opportunities in the public sector.  When I published the report on a survey of equal opportunities in the public sector in 1993, I indicated that I considered the level of inequality in public service employments to be unacceptable and I urged all public sector employers to adopt equal opportunities policies and practices.  I am pleased that many local authorities and particularly Dublin Corporation, the country's largest local authority, are actively pursuing an equal opportunities agenda.  More recently the Joint Committee on Women's Rights published a report on women in management in local administration in the local authority sector.  I welcome the interest and commitment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee in this regard.</P>
    <P>Of course there comes a point where action is needed to follow analysis.  I am particularly impressed in the case of this most recent report that it was a joint report of management and staff <Col N="1338" /> interests.  I understand from the Employment Equality Agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, that there is a significant depth of commitment by both sides to progress the matters raised in the report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the gender composition of interview boards specifically referred to by Deputy Woods, I am informed by the Local Appointments Commission that, to date in 1996, of 99 interview boards convened for managerial and professional appointments in local authorities, both sexes were represented on 86 boards.  Furthermore, every in-house interview board in Dublin Corporation in the last year contained female representation.  This is a major improvement on previous years and provides real evidence that the question of equal opportunities in local authority employment is receiving increasing attention.</P>
    <P>While the report suggests that a direct correlation exists between the gender of interview board members and that of successful applicants, other variables involved such as the gender composition of the candidate pool to be interviewed can also affect the decisions of interview boards.  However, in so far as the composition of the boards may affect such results, I am glad to note that Dublin Corporation and the Local Appointments Commission are committed to ensuring the participation by women on future selection interview boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there should be a 50:50 ratio of men and women on all future interview boards and that this target is readily achievable?  I accept that may be difficult to achieve on boards where there is a chair and a certain number of interviewers, but if there were, say, four people on a board, the objective should be to have two men and two women on that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply, the Minister stated that 86 out of 99 boards in 1996 had both sexes represented but there must be equal representation by women on these boards; I am sure if the Minister examines those figures he will find that there was not equal representation in <Col N="1339" /> those cases.  We should take this matter seriously because various surveys have shown that in the public service, for example, there are just over 22 per cent of women at assistant principal officer level and only 12 per cent at principal officer level.  Those are the broad grades where there should be major participation by women.  I realise the percentage of women is much smaller at the higher grades but the grades to which I have referred are the most important. Will the Minister agree there should be a 50:50 representation of men and women on these boards as far as is possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a worthwhile objective to work towards and I fully support it.  The figures I have given, however, show a major improvement on the position that has pertained up to now where there was not any female representation on most of these interview boards.  All the research indicates that to work towards the attainment of equal opportunities, the composition of interview boards is crucial and the presence of at least one female representative on those boards is vitally important. It is good to see that the work we have been doing is achieving results and that we are now beginning to make major inroads into this important aspect of equal opportunities.  It is only one aspect of equal opportunities but I am sure the Members opposite will agree it is an important one.  We must progress from here on and ensure we get representation from both sexes on all interview boards and, in due course, attain the ultimate proposed by Deputy Woods, which I wholly support as an objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct when he says we are at least moving in the right direction.  He referred to the report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights which painted a bleak picture of the number of women in management positions in local authorities.  Unfortunately, the position is not improving although, it may when <Col N="1340" /> there is a better balance of women on boards.  The Minister referred to other variables, for instance, the pool of women which may be drawn from.  This is critical.  Is the Minister aware that although there may have been a breakthrough in the Local Appointments Commission, internal boards within local authorities leave much to be desired, and very few women are ever on these boards?  How might that be addressed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh may have missed one comment I made in my rather lengthy reply when I said that every in-house interview board held in Dublin Corporation in the past year contained female representation.  That is very satisfactory.  I do not know what the position is in other local authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not doubt it, but the fact that we have this report as a benchmark is extremely helpful.  The Employment Equality Agency has taken it up with great vigour, is disseminating it to the other local authorities and working on it with the Department of the Environment.  The arrangements I was involved in for the funding and preparation of this report were extremely helpful and worthwhile.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Local Appointments Commission interview boards and their gender composition, Members will be interested to know that in 1996, 82 per cent of boards had a woman member compared with 30 per cent in 1995 whereas in 1994 and 1993 no interview board had a balanced gender composition.  We are definitely moving in the right direction.  The production of these two reports, the Oireachtas committee report and the Corporation's report, is a major benchmark which will provide a basis for continuing improvement in this regard.</P>

      <P>The figures are impressive.  It is good to know that some progress has been made.  It is disturbing <Col N="1341" /> that there is a correlation between a gender imbalance on an interview board and the success or otherwise of applicants.</P>
      <P>I understand that following the recent survey another survey will be carried out in 1997 to monitor progress. Obviously, there is a certain amount of monitoring at present if the Minister can tell us that 86 of 99 interview boards had a gender balance.</P>

      <P>I have no specific information about what other monitoring may be going on through the Department of Health.  Perhaps the Deputy could put down a question on that and I could make inquiries of the Department of Health.  The Deputy is right in saying that in 1997 a further detailed survey will be undertaken in the area of equal opportunities in the environment sector.</P>

      <QRef>[17307/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has no involvement in relation to the provision of Social and Structural Funds to people with disabilities or the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> The Community Support Framework for Ireland for 1994-99, which includes the Social and Structural Funds of the EU, contains a standard clause requiring the actions and measures taken within the framework to promote equality of opportunities between men and women.  In particular, in the area of the human resources operational programme, which provides training and retraining for those in employment and those seeking reintegration into the labour market, some £7.7 million has been dedicated to special provision for women.  This involves support for employment and training courses for women returning to work, management training, training for non-traditional work, for child-care workers and managers and guidance and information initiatives for women.</P>
    <P>A Nova Project under the European Social Fund entitled <i>Quality through Equality,</i> which was organised by the Employment Equality Agency under the aegis of my Department and which has just been completed, has developed practical models of equal opportunities policies for application in the public and private sectors which should help to actively promote equality in employment.</P>
    <P>I have also availed of the opportunity of Ireland's Presidency of the EU to specifically promote equal opportunities with regard to Structural Funds.  A recent Council of Social Affairs Ministers in Brussels recorded political agreement on this measure which is expected to be formally adopted in the near future.  I have also put forward a draft resolution on equal opportunities for women and men and the EU Structural Funds, for adoption by the Social Affairs Council as a Presidency initiative.  The resolution is intended to give renewed impetus and commitment to the principle of mainstreaming gender equality into Structural Fund programmes, especially in the context of the mid-term review.  This resolution has been agreed and will be adopted at a forthcoming meeting of the Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> I also propose to host an EU Presidency conference on disability equality in mid-November at which the issue of Social and Structural Funds for people with disabilities will be discussed.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has examined this issue and I await any recommendations that might ensue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that during this period of tremendous expansion, development and investment in this country by our European Union partners, particularly while we hold the Presidency, many of the developments which have been sought after over the years, especially for people with disabilities, should be put into operation? Would the Minister arrange to monitor what is happening so that he can report back to the House on the extent to which these funds are being used, in particular to ensure that people with disabilities benefit from Structural Funds?  I note the Minister says that he will have a conference in mid-November at which some of these issues can be raised and discussed.  It is crucial that steps be taken and funds used to promote the well being of people with disabilities in our society.</P>
      <P>That relates to access to buildings and transport and a number of other issues on which I had tabled questions to the Minister which were transferred to other Ministers.  In this regard there is a monitoring role for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of rights for people with disabilities is a matter of major concern to the Government.  That is part of the reason for the introduction of the Employment Equality Bill and Equal Status Bill which will provide major protections for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level, the position regarding people with disabilities is different in character from that on gender issue in the sense that the question of equal opportunities between men and women is of course addressed in the existing <Col N="1344" /> treaty whereas people with disabilities are not dealt with in the existing EU treaties.  However, the question of including reference to people with disabilities and making provision for them in some respect is under active consideration in the Intergovernmental Conference to lead to a new EU treaty.  That is a very welcome development.  My Department is actively involved in prosecuting that and I hope the new EU treaty which will come about when the Intergovernmental Conference concludes will have major provisions for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, various fundings are provided, such as Helios and Horizon. There are three anti-poverty programmes which provide social fund assistance to those groups and have done so over the past decade.  My Department has no direct involvement in dealing with those funds but we will remain in close consultation with the Departments which have the responsibilities for administering those funds. We will of course continue to press for equivalent funding in future years.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister speak on the Intergovernmental Conference with regard to people with disabilities and I have just come from a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs where people with disabilities from the Centre for Independent Living and Rehab painted a bleak picture in regard to the urgent need for funding.  I am delighted that this is being looked at seriously.  Rehab made the case for funding for its workshops and to expand the excellent Gandon Project, which involves people with and without disabilities working together in the workplace.  Will the Minister ensure that funding for the needs of people with disabilities in both organisations is a priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rehab has upwards of 600 or 700 people on projects at present and there is no funding.  The organisation is over £2 million in the red and if the Minister is committed to assisting and supporting <Col N="1345" /> them, as he just said, it will happen in the budget.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 18 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The family mediation service of my Department is a professional confidential service which enables couples who have decided to separate or who have already separated to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a trained mediator, without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  All issues are included in the negotiations, such as ongoing parenting of the children, the family home, family finances, pensions, property and any other issues relevant to the separation.</P>
      <P>As part of a programme for development and expansion of the family mediation service, two new posts of area mediation co-ordinator have been created, one for the existing family mediation centre at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin, and one for the new centre at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick.  Competitions to fill these posts have been held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission and I understand appointments are imminent.  The persons appointed will be responsible for delivery of a quality mediation service, with the assistance of a team of mediators, each for his or her own geographical areas of responsibility.</P>
      <P>The appointment of area mediation co-ordinators will facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice, who have the necessary training and experience and otherwise meet the standards set by the family mediation service to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre or to relieve pressure on the centres at Dublin or Limerick.  The allocation of cases to private mediators would be done through the family mediation service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  In the past the family has been the bedrock of Irish society. The House passed the Divorce Bill recently because it will help families who are parting and it was the will of <Col N="1347" /> the people.  I always wonder what is better, to try to keep families together or apart and, for a huge number of reasons into which I will not go, I would come down in favour of keeping families together.  There is a duty and responsibility on us to do that.</P>
      <P>Obviously, additional resources must be put in place to support the various divorce measures.  On the other side, we should be putting in place resources to try to keep families together as much as possible.  The Minister mentioned family mediation in his reply but he is talking basically about when couples have separated in regard to the ongoing parenting of children, etc., whereas I would have thought any family mediation would be an effort to try on behalf of the State in the first instance to keep these families together as much as possible.  Additional resources need to be put into that area.  What efforts are being made in that regard?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned area co-ordinators also.  When will they be put in place?  Down the road, is there any intention to open full family mediation centres outside Dublin and Limerick as there are quite a number of other regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenneally may not quite have followed that I was talking solely about mediation.  His question referred to what is more usually described as counselling.  I did not deal with counselling in this reply because the question was about mediation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share his concern as far as funding and resources for counselling and mediation are concerned.  I am happy to tell him that the funding which I have made available for marriage counselling, which has as its object of course the resolution of difficulties and keeping spouses together, has been increased hugely since I took over responsibility for it.  All the main family counselling organisations, the largest of which is Accord with branches all over the country including Cork, have received increased funding from my Department during the past few years which has <Col N="1348" /> enabled them to expand their operations.  The question deals with mediation which covers a different line of operation where the marriage has come to an end.  It facilitates spouses to work out their differences on an amicable basis outside court where property and children are concerned.</P>
    <P>Mediation is a very skilled operation and requires skilled people.  The position so far as the evolution of the mediation system and profession is concerned is that, relatively speaking, it is still in its infancy.  The number of skilled, trained professional mediators is small.  We have no regular organised training system or professional qualification as such.  That will come and is in the process of evolution.  The Government service operates at two levels. Until recently there was only one family mediation service, located in Dublin.  I felt we had to have a second one outside Dublin and the Limerick centre was opened on 17 May.  We are recruiting two key people to be known as area co-ordinators, one for Dublin and one for Limerick.  That will enable both centres to operate on an extended basis and it will also enable us to avail of the relatively small number of trained mediators who operate in private practice in a number of locations around the country.  There are only about 17 or 18 people who have the necessary qualification and who are in private practice. The idea is that they will be employed on a fee per case basis by the family mediation centre in appropriate cases and people would be referred to them after assessment at the head office in Dublin.  In the fullness of time when more skilled mediators are available my hope is that we will have a third centre in the most suitable location, perhaps in the North or in the midlands.  However, it would be premature to consider that at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is a lack of trained mediators, it is welcome that we will have area co-ordinators operating from Dublin and Limerick.  Will the available trained mediators be paid the <Col N="1349" /> going rate?  I am concerned at the amount of funding made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about private practitioners.  Even though they are few in number, they are available.  While the Minister has made extra funding available these moneys are never enough. Will those people come under the mediation co-ordinators and, if so, will they be paid what they might ordinarily be paid in private practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what the rates of pay might be for the private mediators who will work with the family mediation centres.  We have not reached that point yet.  I do not know whether a standard fee arrangement operates or if they have different fee arrangements. Obviously that will have to be negotiated on and discussed with the private mediators and we have to inquire if they are prepared to operate in this way. They would be independent contractors and would be employed on a fee per case basis which would have to be negotiated.  Interviews have already taken place and the appointment of area co-ordinators is imminent.  They will make contact with private practitioners around the country to ascertain if they are prepared to operate within the scheme on this basis and to discuss the fee base.  It would be premature to say what the basis will be but it will have to be resolved by negotiation with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation has handled approximately 250 cases annually.  On average, couples require about six sessions, each of two hours duration. The service is provided free.  What we <Col N="1350" /> are talking about is a skilled professional operation and not an in-out one where couples come in for half an hour and that is the end of the matter. The average case takes up some 12 hours.  The breakdown is that of the approximate 250 cases dealth with, 61 per cent resulted in an agreement being reached, 32 per cent failed to reach agreement and 7 per cent resolved to continue with their marriage.  One would wish that the latter figure was considerably higher.  It has a high success rate in that 61 per cent of cases resulted in an agreement being reached outside of the courts which meant that they were relieved from the pressures which exist in the family courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The service operates under the aegis of my Department and reports to it.  Quality control is exercised by the officials of my Department.  The co-ordinator is in charge of the overall service.  Until recently, and since the inception of the service, Maura Wall Murphy was the director, a person of tremendous ability.  The building up and development of this service owes a huge amount to her.  I welcome this opportunity given to me by Deputy Wallace to pay a major tribute to her.  She is now retired but gave wonderful service.  She developed the necessary skill and professionalism.  I visited both centres and was enormously impressed by what I saw.  The care and attention to detail given in respect of each case is remarkable when one considers the service is provided free of charge to those who wish to avail of it.  Twelve hours is <Col N="1351" /> devoted to each case, six two-hour sessions, and every aspect is gone into with tremendous patience and skill.  The dedication of the mediators who work there and provide a public service is something of which we can be proud.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 9, 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities hopes to be in a position to publish its report around mid-November.  I have not received a copy of the report but, when it has been presented to me, I can assure the Deputy that its recommendations will receive very careful consideration from me and from my colleagues in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of interest in the proposed Council for the Status of People with <Col N="1352" /> Disabilities has exceeded all expectations.  The extra time and resources required to respond to the unprecedented demand by people with disabilities for inclusion in the process was evident by last June to the <i>ad hoc</i> establishment group who are overseeing the setting up of the interim council.  For this reason and, in consultation with me, it decided to defer the launch of the interim council until early 1997. However, it is hoped to have the county networks and the national board in place by the end of 1996.  The formal launch of the interim council will, I am informed, take place at the end of March 1997.  In the meantime, however, both county networks and the national board will have met and started their work.</P>
    <P>I recently published the Employment Equality Bill which will prohibit discrimination in employment on a range of grounds, including disability.  I intend to publish the Equal Status Bill which will prohibit discrimination on the same grounds in non-employment areas before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>When the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has issued its report the Government will consider what further legislation is necessary to secure the rights of people with a disability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has there been a delay in the publication of the report by the commission?  Is this due to a particular difficulty or the pressure of work?  I was glad to hear of the overwhelming response to the proposed Council for the Status of People with Disabilities &mdash; this did not surprise me &mdash; but I am disappointed that it will take longer than anticipated to set up the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my questions today related to the centre for independent living and the cap on the Rehab lottery prize money.  The Minister said that these matters do not come within his specific remit but, given his overall responsibility for the issue of disability, will he take on board the urgent need for the <Col N="1353" /> establishment of the centre for independent living and the enormous damage the cap on lottery prize money is causing to Rehab and, as a result, to the prospects of the many people with the disabilities who wish to be trained, find employment and be productive members of society?  Does the Minister agree it is very important to address those issues and to explain why there has been a delay in the publication of the commission's report?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks made by the Deputy about the Rehab lottery prize money and the centre for independent living.  The Deputy should consider raising these issues with the relevant Ministers.</P>
      <P>The commission's report should be available shortly.  I do not know if there has been a delay in its publication but the commission has been doing extensive work.  It often meets in my Department and I see its operations.  One has to remember that this report will be very extensive and will in every way be comparable to the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. In other words, it is designed to, and will, cover all aspects of the lives of people with disabilities.  It is a major undertaking and one must take into account the enormous range and spectrum of disabilities, for example, physical disabilities, mental disabilities etc. and all aspects of the lives of disabled persons.  It is an extensive operation and I have asked the commission to take the greatest possible care with it, which it will do.  It has carried out extensive research, had listening exercises and met with the many organisations, representatives etc.  From what I hear it has done a remarkable job and when the report is published it will be a benchmark for many years to come, just as the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women was in the lives of women.</P>

      <P>What consultation has taken place between the Minister <Col N="1354" /> and the representatives of people with disabilities?  In terms of the overall situation for the disabled community, how representative are these contacts?  What contact has the Minister had with people who suffer from cerebral palsy? In excess of 100 children are born with this condition every year.  Will the Minister elaborate on the contacts he has had with the disabled community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibilities of my Department in terms of people with disabilities is on the anti-discrimination side.  That is the reason I set up the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and propose to introduce two protective measures, the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill.  The Minister for Health has a major role in this area in so far as funding, health care etc. are concerned and the thrust of the Deputy's points may be more appropriate to the aspects of the matter dealt with by him.</P>
      <P>I have ongoing contacts with disability organisations.  My officials and I meet with them from time to time, while I attend their functions and meetings whenever I can and listen to what they have to say, which is extremely important.  The commission has done this on a wide ranging basis.  It conducted listening exercises which were attended by enormous numbers of people, many of whom said it was the first time a Government organisation or representative had asked their views on matters and was prepared to listen to what they had to say.  This new and very important development was initiated through the formation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have ongoing consultations with the many organisations dealing with cerebral palsy.  There are many organisations dealing with the entire spectrum of categories of people with disabilities. This is an ongoing development and it will be an ongoing procedure in my Department.</P>

      <P>The allocation of social welfare moneys and the setting of rates are matters for the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance. These matters are outside the remit of my Department in so far as the specifics are concerned but my officials and I have ongoing consultation and contract on all aspects of the lives of people with disabilities and I am sure the commission's report will address the question of financial supports.  If the Deputy has a particular question on social welfare for people with disabilities he should address it to the Minister for Social Welfare who has responsibility in that area.</P>

He has responsibility for Equality and Law Reform matters and people are not satisfied with the progress being made in these areas.  It is easy to refer me to another Minister but the Minister has responsibility in this area and he has not articulated his real concerns or given me convincing replies to my questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I express my sincere condolences to the family of Mrs. Bridget Ellen McCole on their tragic loss.  I know it is a very difficult time for them.  I will put the facts before the Dáil in a manner which will not add to their grief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to make a statement on the admission of liability by the <Col N="1392" /> BTSB in the legal case.  I understand a joint statement was agreed yesterday by the solicitors for the late Mrs. McCole and the solicitors for the BTSB.  I take this opportunity to put this statement on the record of the House.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>There have been significant developments in this case over the past few days.  In view of the tragic circumstances that have arisen, there will be an announcement in the High Court on 8 October 1996.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, there are three separate and distinct defendants in this case, namely, the BTSB, the NDAB and the State, each defendant having separate legal representation. The BTSB, on the advice of its legal advisers, admitted liability in this case on 20 September 1996.</P>
    <P>On 15 May last, on the advice of its lawyers, the BTSB made a lodgment into court in accordance with Order 22 Rule (1) of the rules of the superior courts.  It was open to the lawyers for the plaintiff to advise the plaintiff to accept this lodgment at that time.  The lodgment was not accepted.</P>
    <P>I understand the BTSB since April was involved in an extensive review of the facts of its cases which go back over 25 years.  The various allegations made in the proceedings were put to such witnesses as were available to give evidence, bearing in mind that many potential witnesses are very elderly.  On consideration of the outcome of this extensive and time consuming review and, following legal advice, the BTSB decided to admit liability in this case.  I understand this admission of liability was conveyed by letter of Friday, 20 September, by the solicitors for the BTSB to the solicitors for the plaintiff. I understand also that the BTSB in that letter expressed its unreserved apology to Mrs. McCole for all she had suffered as a result of its negligence.  It was also conveyed in this correspondence that full compensation would be paid and party and party costs in respect of her personal injuries, loss and damage <Col N="1393" /> together with the party and party costs of the other defendants, if any.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 26 September, I understand the solicitors for the BTSB again wrote to the solicitors for the plaintiff. This correspondence highlighted the tribunal option open to the plaintiff and indicated that the BTSB would facilitate the plaintiff in availing of this tribunal option if she wished to do so or felt that the tribunal's power to make provisional awards best met her requirements given her changing medical condition at that time.  The solicitors for the BTSB further indicated they would agree to an adjournment of the court case should the plaintiff choose the tribunal option.  The tribunal option and the offer to adjourn the case were rejected by the plaintiff's solicitors in a letter of Friday, 27 September.</P>
    <P>I understand that following the sudden and serious deterioration in Mrs. McCole's health in the afternoon of Monday last, 30 September, settlement talks were initiated by Mrs. McCole's legal advisers with the legal advisers to the BTSB.  These negotiations culminated in a settlement being reached in the afternoon of Tuesday last.</P>
    <P>Because of the media comment today, some of which is not factual I feel I should give some indication of the outcome of these negotiations.  The amount of the settlement quoted in the media is inaccurate.  I understand that the compensation agreed for Mrs. McCole is in the mid range of awards made by the compensation tribunal and accepted by claimants to date.  I understand also that the amount agreed, £175,000, is exactly the amount of the lodgment paid into court in May last which could have been accepted at that time.  In addition, I understand that the plaintiff has agreed strike out proceedings against the NDAB and the State parties, namely, the Minister for Health, Ireland and the Attorney General.  It has been agreed that the BTSB will be responsible for the legal costs of all parties involved.  I understand also that the BTSB, on its <Col N="1394" /> behalf and on behalf of its staff, will make a public apology to Mrs. McCole's family for the suffering and distress caused to her through its fault.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by some of the representative groups that the compensation tribunal would cease to operate.  There is no reason the tribunal should not continue its work and continue to hear cases.  The tribunal has been operating smoothly, effectively and fairly and I have no reason to believe this will not continue to be the case in the future.</P>
    <P>The tribunal scheme provides that the Minister for Health, if he considers it appropriate, may amend the scheme, but no such amendment shall operate to remove, restrict or diminish in any way rights or benefits conferred on persons entitled to claim under the scheme in its unamended form.  As I have already stated in the House on numerous occasions, if I have evidence and I am convinced that the workings of the tribunal are not serving the very best interests of the claimants or if in my opinion such amendment would improve the scheme, I will use my powers under the scheme to ensure that the tribunal is at all times meeting the needs of persons infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Apart from the compensation issue, there is also the question of health care services for victims of this tragedy.  The House will be aware that I have agreed a comprehensive health care package with the various representative organisations.  On 23 September 1996 the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996 came into effect.  Deputies are aware of the terms of the Act and the services it will provide in respect of GP care, medicines and appliances, dental care, nursing and home help, optical and aural care and counselling.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House last Thursday, health boards have appointed a liaison officer in each health board area to ensure the smooth operation of the delivery of services under the Act, to act as contact point for individuals and with the various interest groups whose members will avail of services under the Act.  Lest <Col N="1395" /> there be any doubt about the matter, I confirm that whatever resources are required to implement the Act fully will be provided by the Government.  These new primary care services are, of course, in addition to the special hospital in-patient and out-patient services established and developed in the past two years.  A sum of £2 million was provided for these services this year.</P>
    <P>There are two other remaining elements in the health care package to which I would like to refer.  I have agreed to establish a statutory consulative council on hepatitis C.  My Department has consulted with the representative organisations on the contents of a draft establishment order.  A further draft of the order was sent to the representative organisations in recent weeks for their views.  This new draft takes account of the earlier views of the organisations.  As soon as I have received their responses to the latest draft of the establishment order I will be setting up the consultative council.</P>
    <P>The final element of the health care package involves the establishment and funding of a special programme of research on hepatitis C under the aegis of the Health Research Board.  This programme will include research projects into hepatitis C as it relates to persons infected through the use of anti-D.  I have allocated £100,000 for this year in respect of suitable projects.  I understand there has been a good response to the Health Research Board's public advertisement for research proposals and a decision on projects to be funded will be taken by the board in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the light of the events of recent days, I will reflect with my colleagues in Government on all matters relating to the hepatitis C issue.  If there is any action which I believe would be in the best interests of all those affected by this tragedy, I will not hesitate to act.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf, and on behalf of my party, I express sincere condolences to the McCole family on the tremendous <Col N="1396" /> tragedy which has befallen them.  I hope this debate does not add to their tragedy.</P>
      <P>This is the fourteenth time in eight months we have raised this matter.  We asked for four things, the truth, a statutory tribunal, an admission of liability and negligence and a public apology. The lawyers for this individual were refused an early date for hearing, an application based almost exclusively on the state of the woman's health and the prognosis.  The State showed a lack of compassion and challenged her case at every turn.  Her case had become virtually the only judicial inquiry into the whole mess surrounding hepatitis C.  I do not believe any of us could imagine the pressure this brought to bear on Mrs. McCole.</P>
      <P>The Government began its term with a promise to pay fair compensation to the women infected with hepatitis C through contaminated anti-D.  That was laudable and honourable, but no more than one would expect given the circumstances surrounding this awful tragedy. The negligence of a State board in the manufacture of a blood product led to its becoming contaminated.  This was a product designed to save lives, but because of gross contamination it has ruined the lives of victims and left them with a potentially fatal illness for which there is no effective cure.  The reality for the victims is very different from those paper aspirations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the victims have before them is an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal founded firmly on a Government agenda to shut the door on the problem and to pay out money quickly in the hope that it will go away. This Government is forgetting the simple equation that the problem will not go away because hepatitis C will not go away.  In December 1994 the Government used the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; in the context of this issue.  The word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; implies that people are treated with respect and dignity.  It implies that one should try to address expressed needs. Fair means just treatment.  However, the treatment meted out to the hepatitis C victims has been anything but fair and <Col N="1397" /> just.  It has been marked by a callous insensitivity towards their rights and views.  They are faced with a rigid Government agenda which denies them their basic rights and the truth.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister state that steps were taken as far back as 1 May to settle this case.  Two of the dates he mentioned have a particular significance.  He stated that the solicitors for the plaintiff were notified on 20 September of the admission of liability by the BTSB and that on 26 September, an even more significant date, the solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors.  On 26 September I tabled a question to the Minister in the name of my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, which stated:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Health if he or any of the State agencies under the aegis of his Department have made approaches to settle the hepatitis C case which is due to come before the High Court on 8 October 1996; if he intends to offer an out-of-court settlement in the case; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply stated:</P>
    <P>The High Court case in question is fixed to commence on 8 October.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any matter relating to these proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave that information in the full knowledge that attempts had been made as far back as May to reach an out-of-court settlement in this matter and that a letter had been sent to the plaintiff's solicitors admitting liability and negligence in the case.  We all know a tribunal was established in another case on foot of incomplete information given in this House.</P>
    <P>We have not heard the truth on this matter from the Minister &mdash; as we discovered from that parliamentary question &mdash; from the Blood Transfusion Service Board or from any of the agents or agencies acting on behalf of the people involved in this case.  On RTÉ radio this afternoon the Minister stated that the <Col N="1398" /> BTSB admitted liability and that he is glad it has done so.  When did he reach the conclusion that he would be glad if the Blood Transfusion Service Board admitted liability?  What did he mean by the term &ldquo;...totally illogical, if the Blood Transfusion Service Board were not to admit liability in other cases that would come to court&rdquo;?  Is the Minister stating that the Blood Transfusion Service Board will admit liability only if victims bring their cases before the courts and that those who have taken the route he has pushed &mdash; the route of the tribunal &mdash; will not get an admission of liability from the Blood Transfusion Service Board?  Where does that leave them?</P>
    <P>Clause 8 of the tribunal expressly provides that no compensation will be made on a basis which reflects the principle of exemplary damages.  This is surely an area in which the Minister has the power to amend the tribunal and where, on reflection with his colleagues in Government, he could amend it. Does he propose to do that and when?</P>
    <P>What was discovered by the Blood Transfusion Service Board in the last three or four months which it did not already know?  Obviously, that discovery, whatever it was, indicated it had no choice but to admit liability and negligence.  Who were the people in the Blood Transfusion Service Board at the time who did not speak to Miriam Hederman-O'Brien?  Where are they now and what has been done to get them to speak to somebody in the meantime?</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister in July if he would reconvene the expert group because of the fact that this new file, information and docket had come to light.  He told me it would not serve any useful purpose.  Now it would appear he is prepared to do so when a victim has died.  There were never any resignations sought from the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Why?  I suggested in the House, and I was supported by Deputy O'Donnell, that the negligence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board bordered on criminal negligence.  Both Deputy O'Donnell and I suggested that <Col N="1399" /> the Minister refer the file and the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report to the Director of Public Prosecutions but he was not prepared to do that.  Is he now prepared to send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that at this stage there is any victim of hepatitis C who could have further confidence in the tribunal which the Minister set up.  We have consistently said that we want this matter to be dealt with fairly and equitably.  We want the truth for victims. That truth, it would appear, will only be found by more and more victims taking their case before the courts.  The only way we can ever get to the bottom of this matter is by having a judicial inquiry into it, which we suggested at the beginning.</P>
    <P>Now that the Blood Transfusion Service Board has accepted liability and admitted negligence, is the State also accepting liability and admitting negligence?  I ask the Minister not to repeat to me what he said on the news today, that the Department of Health is one thing and the Blood Transfusion Service Board is another.  It is an agency of his Department and it is paid for by the same taxpayer who pays for the Department of Health.  Will the Minister please explain if the Department of Health and the State accept liability in this case?</P>

      <P>I would like to express my sympathy to Mrs. McCole's family and to the other victims of this scandal watching developments carefully, as is their right.  I want to dwell for a moment on a curious development on the news at 1 o'clock and in the House today when the Minister started to build a distancing vehicle between the State and the BTSB.  This is a masterpiece of political fiction.</P>

    <P>Never before in this House has there been an attempt by the Minister to distance himself as a defendant or to distance the State as a defendant.  All the times he responded to questions and to the many debates in the House, he said he was constantly constrained in what he could tell the House by the fact that <Col N="1400" /> he was a defendant in these matters.  I raised the question at the time &mdash; and I do so again today &mdash; that although the Minister is a defendant in this case and still sees himself as such, who is looking after the public interest when he is so constrained in what he can say to the House?</P>
    <P>This débâcle has highlighted the impotence of Dáil Éireann as an inquiring body and as one which holds the Executive and its State agencies to account.  This House has failed from the beginning to extract the truth.  It is entitled to the truth in response to questions legitimately put in the public interest.  Because the State was a defendant &mdash; and it seems it is still one &mdash; this House will not extract the truth. The truth in so far as we know it, the fact that the board has admitted liability, has only come out because of a court action.  It highlights yet again how this House has no role and has been denied one in extracting the truth in public affairs.</P>
    <P>After all the debates when Dáil Éireann sought to extract information from the Department and the Minister as to the extent of State liability, there was the constant distraction and statements by the Minister that he was constrained because he was a defendant. Now that the truth is out I do not accept that the Minister is attempting to distance himself and the State from the board.</P>
    <P>This Government which came into office on the wreckage of an Administration which fell because of a lack of openness and accountability has used the same tactics in all the debates in the House in seeking to avoid the truth.  We have not had openness; it has been replaced by brazenness in the House today.  We have seen the creation of this fiction in which there is a difference between the board, which has admitted liability, and the State, which it seems has not accepted liability or negligence. That is fiction and nonsense.  The board is the State; it is the State which pays and establishes it.  The Minister appoints the board and it is the State which will <Col N="1401" /> pay the compensation.  There is no difference.</P>
    <P>The truth has come out.  This deathbed conversion to liability on behalf of the State came about because Mrs. McCole was dying and she had to choose between getting nothing or making a settlement.  It was only in those awful personal circumstances of that case that the State was forced to admit liability.  I do not want to entertain the notion that the board is separate from the State.</P>
    <P>The admission of liability by the board to all intents and purposes is an admission by the State of its negligence not only to Mrs. Cole, but to over 1,000 women and men infected with hepatitis C through contaminated products.  The Minister may try to persist with this fiction but it would be a disgrace if that was to continue.  It is fiction which nobody believes.  The board is appointed by the Minister and it is a statutory body run and funded by the Department of Health; it has no private status.  If, in commercial terms, the board had shares, the Minister would be the major shareholder.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and the Minister secured the resignation of its chief medical officer and chief executive and the Minister presided over the settlement package, the golden handshake, which I understand in one case was £250,000.  Compare that to the settlement which Mrs. McCole received. What justice was there in that settlement?  That was not an award for compensation; it was a settlement made by a desperate woman who faced that or a small amount of money.  The State, in the form of the Minister, is politically responsible for the débâcle from the beginning.  The Department set up the tribunal with a £60 million package for compensation.  Now that there has been an admission of negligence, we can see that the tribunal was an elaborate damage limitation exercise.</P>
    <P>As we went through the various debates the Minister took credit for trying to sort out this matter, which was a <Col N="1402" /> difficult one.  However, the question must be asked: at what point was the Minister aware that the game was up, and the State was liable?  When did he or his Department consult with the board regarding its decision to reverse its position on liability?  Was that position known to him when he answered questions on 1 May last?  Detailed questions were put to him and again he gave the excuse that because he was a defendant he was constrained in what he could tell the House.  The House has an absolute right to answers to those questions.  It has privilege for that reason.  It has an inquiring role independent of the courts.  When Ministers are asked questions, they must provide the answers even if they are defendants in court cases.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister persist with a preference for the tribunal?  I believe that route was preferred by the Government because it was a damage limitation exercise.  It skirted the crucial issue of liability, it did not deal with it and it was not an inquiring body.  The tribunal was a mechanism for paying out compensation to the women as a class or a group.  The enormity of this scandal has not been grasped because the women were treated as a group and it is only when the tragic cases of individual women and their families come to court that the issue will be very painful politically.  During each court case the individual tragedies will be disclosed to the open court.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the Government preferred the tribunal.  It was neat, quick and less politically embarrassing.  With each tragic case, such as Mrs. McCole's, that went to court, the BTSB would be faced with the ultimate shame of being found liable for negligence and because Mrs. McCole died tragically, it had to admit liability.</P>
    <P>From start to finish this case has been handled very badly.  The admission of liability by the board must reflect back on how the golden handshakes were negotiated.  It must have some implication regarding the settlements and pension packages agreed at that time <Col N="1403" /> because the admission of liability retrospectively colours everything that has gone before &mdash; it colours the tribunal.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of the Government, were the Minister or his Department officials party to the decision by the BTSB to contest liability in the hepatitis C compensation cases?  Was he or any of his officials party to negotiations when the BTSB decided to reverse its position and admit liability? When did those negotiations take place and was the Minister kept informed of them?</P>

The State opposed an early hearing, but the court decided in favour of Mrs. McCole and she was given an early hearing date.  The precise request of her legal team was for a June date but the court, for reasons best known to itself, decided that October would be an appropriate date.  In the normal course of the listing of cases, the case would not have come up for a considerable time, maybe 18 months or more but those matters are hard to predict.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy should let me answer her questions.  The charge being indirectly laid here is that I misled the House.  I did not mislead it.  The answer to the question states that because the court case was coming up I could not give the information requested.  I did not mislead the House in any way, but I could not give the information requested because I was legally advised that it would be improper if I revealed any information as to the negotiations that were taking place between the BTSB's legal team and the plaintiff's legal team.  If the court case, the hearing for which was set two weeks after that question had been filed, had proceeded, the issue of the admission of liability would have arisen during its initial stages.  It was not up to me to make that information public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is very forthright today in talking about the accountability of the Minister, but it is not only Dáil Éireann that is involved in this.  There is a constitutional principle, that of the separation of powers, and under it matters appropriate for the court are matters for the court.  I was advised that if I had given the information requested, I would have crossed that line.  I did not mislead the House and if Deputies read the answer to that question they would note that I said I was unable to give the information requested because the case was coming up in court.  I did not mislead the House in any way at any time on this matter.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn mentioned the number of times we debated this matter and I have been as forthcoming as possible on this and I will give all the information I can on it, but there is a separation of powers and <Col N="1405" /> there are issues that are proper to the courts.</P>
    <P>Regarding the reference to today's interview when I said it would be totally illogical for the BTSB not to admit liability, what was before the courts and agreed by settlement was an individual woman's case for personal damages, which would be analogous to any personal damages case.  The admission of liability is strictly in respect of Mrs. McCole's case.  I was making the point that regarding other cases filed in court and at various stages of preparation, it would be totally illogical for the BTSB to admit liability in Mrs. McCole's case and not to admit it in all subsequent cases that arose from the same series of events.  It is up to the BTSB to clarify the position, but I cannot see how it would refuse to admit liability in any subsequent case.</P>
    <P>On the principle of exemplary damages, as Deputies are aware, a number of issues were before the courts.  There were cases against three defendants who were separately represented in respect of whether they were negligent, including the BTSB because it runs the blood transfusion service, the Department of Health because it has a supervisory role and the National Drugs Advisory Board because it is responsible for licensing products and medicines.  In their distinct ways they all had a role.  I have been legally advised that the Department of Health does not have a liability because it acted properly and that is the advice I am following.  The BTSB had a different role and it had to make up its mind.  One issue is that three defendants were being sued for damages before the High Court.  Another is that Mrs. McCole claimed exemplary and aggravated expenses as well as what I would describe as the normal damages that are claimed in a court case.  Under the settlement while the BTSB accepted liability, it did not accept liability for exemplary or aggravated damages and another case may be brought to court on that basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> There was a discovery of documents in the course of the case.  At one stage I was informed that 5,000 documents were requested and the discovery process proceeded for a considerable time as it was necessary to carry out a full and thorough search to make sure that all relevant documents were available. This matter has been raised in the House before.  While Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien did not see new documents that came to light, she and I are of the view that they did not add to the totality of the evidence.  Perhaps they did add to it but that was a matter to be tested in court.  That body of documents is still the relevant core of evidence for any subsequent case which comes to court.</P>
    <P>I was asked whether I will reconvene the expert group.  I will think about it.  It would be very easy for me today, in the shadow of the great tragedy which has befallen Mrs. McCole and her family, to say I will do this.  I will consider it if I think there would be merit in it and it would help the other victims.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the Director of Public Prosecutions and criminal negligence, I understand that Positive Action referred the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions and some Deputies also referred the report by Miriam Hederman-O'Brien to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I further understand they were told it was not a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I do not know of any statute law which refers to criminal negligence.  There is a common law offence of criminal negligence. The test of proof in such cases is &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo;.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions wants to examine the situation further I have no problem with that.  However, the Director of Public Prosecutions decides who is prosecuted in this State rather than the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The State does not admit liability because my legal advice is that the State is not liable.  The roles were distinct. The Department of Health, the Attorney General and Ireland &mdash; we are talking directly about the Department <Col N="1407" /> of Health &mdash; has a supervisory role over the BTSB.  It is not true to say, as Deputy O'Donnell maintained, that we are inventing some kind of fiction.  It was quite clear every time I spoke in the House that there are different defendants all represented by different legal teams.  The different defendants are being sued for negligence in exercising their different functions.</P>
    <P>I was aware of an exchange of letters between the BTSB and the legal team of Mrs. McCole.  I was told in advance that the legal advice of the BTSB, after it had reviewed its position, was to admit liability.  I was not asked for my permission or to make a policy decision. Whether Deputies like it, the BTSB is a separate legal entity.  It is run by a board which makes its decisions in accordance with the legal advice it receives.  It would be totally improper of me to give a direction on the matter.  It can be politically inconvenient for me if such boards act in a particular way but I cannot direct them, especially on matters such as this where it is crystal clear there are separate defendants before the courts.</P>
    <P>The issue of a judicial inquiry was raised again by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who asked why we do not set up a judicial inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter.  I sat in this House when people shouted for a judicial inquiry to get to the bottom of the beef scandal. After £35 million of legal fees, did we get to the bottom of that matter?  I suggest we are much further down the road in respect of this issue.</P>
    <P>I am not distancing myself from the BTSB.  I am saying there are separate defendants with separate identities and separate responsibilities.  In terms of negligence, if the Department of Health was proved to be negligent it would be in respect of its statutory role, which is, in general terms, a supervisory one.  If the National Drugs Advisory Board was deemed or proved to be negligent it would be in respect of its role, which is a licensing one.  The body directly involved is the BTSB which, after it <Col N="1408" /> reviewed the case and on legal advice, reviewed its position.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked whether I was a party to the decisions by the BTSB on what course it would follow in the first instance.  I was not but I was informed of what it intended to do.  I was asked if I was a party to the decision to change its position, admit liability and advance an apology.  I was made aware of its position but I was not a party to that decision and neither were my officials.  The roles were kept separate.</P>
    <P>There is a general implication that I should have come into the House at any time.  There is an implicit accusation that when the lodgment was made last May I concealed that information from the House.  The lodgment was made under Order 22, Rule (1), of the rules of the superior courts.  If Members check that in the Library they will find one of the rules is that it is so confidential that it is not even to be mentioned to the judge.  It is to be communicated between the legal team of the plaintiff and that of the BTSB in this instance. Anybody who mentioned it inside or outside the House would be deemed to be in contempt of court.  The courts take a very rigid view of that.  When there was speculation in the newspapers about a lodgment, the Chief State Solicitor wrote to the proprietors of the newspapers pointing out that fact.</P>
    <P>I can only operate within the rules. While this House is entitled to the fullest possible information, there are matters which are proper to the courts.  I can go right up to the line but I cannot cross it.  I could not have announced the terms of the lodgment in the House because of the rules of the superior courts.  In the same way, it would not have been proper of me, within two weeks of a High Court trial, to announce in the House that there was an exchange of letters between solicitors which would involve an admission of liability and an apology.</P>
    <P>The theory is being canvassed by Deputy O'Donnell that the only reason there was a settlement on a particular night was because people were <Col N="1409" /> informed that Mrs. McCole would not survive very long.  If the people involved in the negotiations were of that frame of mind, they need not have admitted liability at all or made any apology.  The theory is that it was forced to the line and once poor Mrs. McCole passed away nobody would have any further liability, except for nugatory amounts &mdash; we all know that once a person dies very little money is paid.  However, before the very serious deterioration in Mrs. McCole's health, the BTSB had communicated it was prepared to admit liability and apologise.  It was not the coming to light of any medical information which suggested Mrs. McCole would die before the High Court case which triggered events.  It might have triggered the monetary settlement at the end but it did not trigger the admission of liability made on 20 September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for confirming that when he answered the parliamentary question on 26 September last he had in his possession information which he did not give to the House.  Is the Minister aware that the reason the court decided not to give the victim the early hearing date was because the Blood Transfusion Service Board said it would not be ready to defend its action until October?  It is ridiculous for the Minister to say the court made the decision and nobody else suggested the date of October.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it would be totally illogical if the Blood Transfusion Service Board was not to admit liability in other cases before the court.  Is it logical for it not to admit liability in the case of all the other victims who will go before the tribunal?  If it is right in one set of circumstances to admit liability, how can the Minister allow the other victims who were infected in the same way by the same State agency to go before a tribunal without the agency admitting liability?  How can the Minister defend that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the discovery of the famous file, on 1 May last the Minister indicated to the House that, despite the <Col N="1410" /> file having been found a number of weeks earlier, neither he nor his Minister of State actually saw the file.  In the midst of a huge scandal, at a time when the Minister had to come before this House and answer parliamentary questions, he had not asked even once for the file.  Has the Minister since asked for it and has he seen it?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn refers again to the question in the name of Deputy Joe Walsh to which I replied in writing.  I did not conceal any information whatsoever from the House.  Because a matter was coming before the courts, I was not in a position to give information; in effect, that was the answer.  It is not that I would not give information but rather that I could not give information.</P>
      <P>On the logic of the admission of liability, if there were no tribunal and we were talking about something like the Stardust tragedy in respect of which I was instrumental with the then Attorney General, John Rogers, in establishing the tribunal, their cases had been in the courts, totally tangled up for four or five years and people could not obtain compensation.  In circumstances like that, what would happen is that different plaintiffs would enter into discussions with the representatives of the BTSB and, because there was an admission of liability, the argument would be about the settlement figure, about the quantum of damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in the tribunal a ready-made scheme working very well measuring the quantum of damages.  It seems it will be possible for the tribunal to continue to measure the quantum of damages and the BTSB to apply what it has done in the case of Mrs. McCole to the other plaintiffs, some of whom are going through the courts and others through the tribunal.  That is a view I am giving. I have had no discussions about this matter, but it would be very peculiar if the admission of liability did not apply to other plaintiffs as well, even if they were going through the tribunal.  I do <Col N="1411" /> not know what mechanism can be put in place to organise that.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House once more that the events about which we are talking and the infection of poor Mrs. McCole occurred in 1976, 20 years ago.  The other significant date in the whole saga for anybody who is familiar with it is 1991.  It was the Deputies in Opposition who were in Government at that time, so they should not get into a political blame game.  This has been going on for 20 years and every party in this House has been in Government over that time.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in coalition in 1991.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Closure of Pig Slaughtering Plants.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity to raise the very serious matter of the discontinuance of pig slaughtering and processing in my constituency in Counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Long before such production became so intensified, with very large numbers of animals and <Col N="1414" /> computerised feeding systems, both counties had been the largest pig producers nationwide.  Unless their slaughtering and processing industry is reinstated the potential for future production in that region will be bleak with the closure of two plants.  The McCarren plant in Cavan which had been experiencing labour problems closed partially and eventually completely.  That was followed by the closure of the Dawn Pork and Bacon plant in Monaghan.  I was informed that its premises required substantial funding to bring it up to the standard required by the relevant EU legislation.  These closures have put well in excess of 200 people out of work in addition to the spin-off effects in many other areas.  There is much talk about improvements in employment generally but in that area in the period November 1994 to April 1996 there was a 12 per cent increase in the numbers of people unemployed in Monaghan alone.</P>
      <P>When one examines the history of pig slaughtering one discovers that in 1989 there were 20 pig slaughtering units slaughtering 2.1 million pigs; in 1995 that figure had been reduced to eight slaughtering units, in line with IDA policy at that time when that agency conducted a survey based on the Danish production system.  In 1996 that figure has been reduced to six plants slaughtering 2.9 million pigs.</P>
      <P>Whether one is engaged in producing cattle, pigs or poultry, it is generally accepted that one should locate one's processing plant as close as possible to one's primary producers.  That has been an accepted principle over many years since the transportation of livestock or poultry over long distances tends to affect the quality of the meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>North of a line from Drogheda to Galway where there is much pig production no work is being done and nobody is earning money.  Four companies control the slaughtering and processing of pigs, with one of those accounting for 50 per cent of total slaughtering.  Prior to the setting up in Northern Ireland of the Unilver Group most of the pigs produced in Armagh, <Col N="1415" /> Fermanagh and Tyrone were slaughtered in plants in Monaghan.  I would like to know why those plants had to close.  Fewer people are now involved in pig production in the South.  One month ago the price of Irish grade E pigmeat was 16.6 per cent less than the EU average, with the German producer recording 37p per kilo more than the British producer who, in turn, recorded a 23 per cent increase on the Irish producer.  I ask the Minister to undertake an indepth study of pig production and processing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for raising this issue.  I share his concern about the loss of jobs resulting from the closure of two pig slaughtering plants in the Cavan-Monaghan region since the beginning of this year.  In each case closure came about when management took a commercial decision to cease operations.  The two plants concerned are McCarrens of Cavan and Dawn Pork and Bacon, Coolshannagh, Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of McCarrens, the company had, I understand, suffered trading losses in 1995.  It brought in a rationalisation programme in 1995 which improved matters temporarily. However, the arrival of a major pigmeat processing plant in Northern Ireland towards the end of last year caused a shortage of pig supplies in the South, and drove up pig prices here.  The new Northern Ireland firm was sourcing some of its supplies south of the Border and was offering higher prices.  Naturally pig supplies moved northwards. An indication of this movement is that pig slaughterings in Northern Ireland for the first eight months of 1996 are about 17 per cent higher than at the same point in 1995.  Corresponding figures for pig slaughterings in the Republic show a decrease of about 5 per cent for the same period.  Historically there has always been a two-way movement of pigs north and south of the Border, greater numbers coming southwards.  This situation has now been <Col N="1416" /> reversed, with large numbers of pigs being lost to the processing sector in the South.  Under the Single Market rules of the EU, I cannot stop the movement of pigs to Northern Ireland.  Neither can I give national aid to the pig industry as the common organisation of the market in pigmeat precludes me from doing so.</P>
    <P>This situation has meant that pig prices have remained at a high level due to curtailed supplies.  McCarrens, I understand, felt unable to continue full trading because of the high pig prices and operated the business on a scaled-down level for a number of months, producing cooked meats only.  Further plans for rationalisation were put by the company to the workforce in recent months, but were rejected.  Consequently, the company decided to cease all operations at the plant in August last.  Forbairt has been in close contact with McCarrens all through this difficult period.  As recently as last week McCarrens management met Forbairt and had useful discussions.  Suggestions were made by Forbairt to McCarrens with a view to the resumption of operations on a viable scale at the plant.  The full resources of Forbairt have been laid at the disposal of the company to get a successful resumption of operations at the plant.  My Department is liaising with Forbairt and monitoring the position. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot intervene in what is essentially a dispute between workers and management.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Coolshannagh plant, here again the closure was due to a commercial decision being taken by management.  Dawn Pork and Bacon Company bought this plant late in 1995. At the time of purchase, management was notified by my Department that major deficiencies in the slaughtering facilities needed to be rectified, for the plant to come up to the standards set down in EU regulations.  My Department's role is to ensure that these standards are met.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department met management of this plant about three weeks ago to discuss the impending <Col N="1417" /> closure.  Management explained that the high cost of pigs at present did not allow it the scope for the substantial capital investment needed to bring the plant up to the required EU standards.  It had decided to cease operations at this plant.  The firm was not in a position to give a commitment that it would recommence operations at the plant at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>With the high price for pigs prevailing the processing margins in 1996 have declined.  It is essential that processing plants become as competitive as possible.  The immediate short-term need is for plants to increase their cost competitiveness and market performance.  To this end Forbairt will actively pursue, over the medium term, initiatives to bring processing capacity in the northeast region back to a satisfactory level of production in a manner consistent with the new competitive environment.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the industry is good. Supplies are expected to become more plentiful in the latter part of this year, and at the beginning of next year.  The August 1996 pig census shows that pig numbers in Ireland have increased by 6.2 per cent compared to August 1995. Numbers of pigs are now running at 1.6 million head compared to 1.5 million head a year ago.  The marketing of these additional supplies should restore balance to the market and ensure that pig prices are at competitive levels.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor the situation, and will keep in contact with Forbairt about its efforts to restore the processing capacity in the Cavan-Monaghan area to a satisfactory level.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Beef Processing Companies' Bonds.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the question of the forfeiture or otherwise of bonds given by beef processing companies in Ireland to the value of £30 million.  Under the regulations the decision on forfeiture or <Col N="1418" /> release of these bonds, which relate to export refunds, should be made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I was very surprised, therefore, when in October last year we were informed that the Government had decided that of the remaining £30 million in bonds and guarantees, £7 million would be forfeited, £17 million would be released and £6 million would be left in abeyance as that amount was stated to be in doubt.  That decision was made on 17 October 1995, but almost exactly one year later it has not been implemented.</P>
      <P>It was reported last Sunday in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that the Government was looking again at the question of the release of the £17 million in bonds because of statements about irregularities by the company concerned which were made by two former employees &mdash; it appears those two men were former employees of Goodman International.</P>
      <P>I made a statement about this matter on 19 October last when I said that it seemed there was an element of &ldquo;deal&rdquo; or arrangement between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Goodman International whereby it would forfeit only £7 million worth of guarantees and release the remainder. The Department has not delivered on its deal, presumably because of the public-spirited act of the two former employees in giving it information in writing about breaches of regulations in export refunds.  Presumably the Department recommended to the Government a year ago the release of these moneys, but it has refused to act on that recommendation, and it is to the credit of the Government collectively that that is so. The question arises as to why the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry wanted those moneys released when it was well known that there were widespread abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently published report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the appropriate accounts for 1995 shows in paragraphs 37 and 39 that there were disallowances by the European Commission in respect of beef export <Col N="1419" /> refunds amounting to some £2,783,221 and £1,552,544.  These were disallowed against the Irish Exchequer because the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry wrongly released bonds and guarantees to the company.  That disallowance against the Irish Exchequer was in respect of the clearance of the 1991 accounts.</P>
    <P>The £30 million still held by the Department relates to export refunds in the years 1987-89 when the activity of the Goodman company in Iraq was at its height.  Even though the Government decision of 17 October last was to the effect that a figure of £7 million would be forfeit that, apparently, has not yet happened.  The public is entitled to know why.</P>
    <P>What has happened in relation to this £30 million worth of bonds and to the sum of approximately £4.3 million reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General conclusively proves that the finding of the beef tribunal at page 566, &ldquo;that there was no abuse of the export refund subsidy regulations in respect of the export of intervention beef to Iraq&rdquo;, is clearly incorrect.  That finding was based on evidence given by officials in the Department supported by people from Goodman International.</P>
    <P>The Department has a great deal to answer which it consistently tries to avoid.  The fact that it was prepared to do a deal of the kind described as recently as last year with the Goodman organisation should be a matter of great concern to everybody.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the loser in the long run from all of this is the Irish taxpayer who has to pick up the tab for the failures of the Department to penalise malpractices and fraud in the beef export refund scheme as well as the beef intervention scheme where the Irish taxpayer has already been fined a sum in excess of £70 million. How long are we supposed to tolerate this type of activity from the Department?  How much longer does the Minister intend to stand over the close relationship between certain elements in his Department and the firm owned <Col N="1420" /> by a man about whom he said he would shed no tears if he departed from the Irish beef scene in the morning?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to give a full explanation of all these matters and full disclosure of all the relevant facts in terms of the relationship of his Department with Goodman International over many years, facts which have been concealed successfully from the public view for a long time.  Will he tell us if the new accounting officer of FEOGA funds has yet been appointed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the European Union rules a security must be lodged with the Department for advance payment of export refunds to ensure that the specified conditions for export are fully complied with.  In almost all cases the security provided is in the form of a bank guarantee and this guarantee can be called upon where the exporter fails to adhere to the full rules and regulations.  Once all of the required documentation has been submitted to the Department and once this has been cross-checked and processed by the relevant officials the guarantees concerned must be either forfeited or released.  A guarantee that has been provided against a specific export refund transaction cannot under any circumstances be used against any other liability which may exist.</P>
      <P>In October 1995, following completion by my Department of the processing of a large block of export refund guarantees in respect of one beef processor for beef exported before 1990, I sought the agreement of the Government to forfeit guarantees amounting to £7 million approximately and to release a balance of £17 million.  A residual amount of £6 million in guarantees was being retained at the request of the European Commission to allow for further scrutiny.  This amount is still being dealt with by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government decision, and after a forfeiture-release letter was issued to the company concerned in October 1995, confidential information relating to these releases was received <Col N="1421" /> from the Commission.  This information had been supplied by informants.  All forfeiture and release work was immediately suspended pending the outcome of a full Commission and Department investigation.  The additional information received in the period November 1995 to February 1996 involved reviewing files on which more than £20 million of advance payments had been made.  This review allowed the Department to put some additional forfeitures in place.</P>
    <P>Following this complete investigation, and following thorough verification work by Commission auditors, a revised forfeiture of some £7.3 million in guarantees was issued to the company in February this year.</P>
    <P>In early March further information was received concerning these guarantees.  This warranted further investigation before steps were taken to close any files.  A confidential investigation was undertaken without delay by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. Again, the Department suspended the forfeiture release work.  Information has been received over a period of time since March &mdash; the most recent communication being only last week.  This information has been continually assessed.  As of now there is no evidence that the forfeitures determined last February should be significantly amended but investigations are continuing and it is not possible to say what the outcome of these investigations will be or when they will be completed.</P>
    <P>During the period the relevant Commission authorities in Brussels have been kept informed of all relevant developments and have been in communication with us on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that while I would normally be only too willing to supply him with details of any case, in the circumstances of an ongoing confidential investigation any further public comment would not be helpful. As matters stand I am threatened with legal proceedings and further public <Col N="1422" /> debate at this time is clearly not appropriate.  My top priority in this matter is to ensure that both EU and Exchequer funds are absolutely protected.  I am determined to ensure that the proper and correct course of action will be taken on this file.</P>
    <P>To respond to some specific points raised by the Deputy, the new FEOGA accounting officer has not yet been appointed or recruited.  In my experience there is no special or close relationship between the civil servants dealing with these files and investigations and the company to which the Deputy referred.  My role, and that of the Department, is to establish the correct level of forfeitures and releases.  I hope to bring the matter to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach tráthnóna agus éisteacht leis an gcás a dhéanadh.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will recall that when we were Members of another House this was a hobby horse of mine. Some progress has been made but not enough to satisfy me.  As a great believer in technology I am always surprised at how slow technological industries, such as communications industries, can be in responding to the realities of modern life.</P>
      <P>The telephone charge areas were instituted in 1956.  At that time outside Dublin and the main urban centres the telephone service was operated manually.  Telephones were few and far between.  September marked the tenth anniversary of the introduction of an automatic telephone service in Corr na Mona where I live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a direct link between the cost of making a telephone call and the distance of the call as one had to put it through a series of operators.  The manual service was eventually phased out in the first half of 1987.  Since then all calls <Col N="1423" /> have been made through an automatic system.</P>
    <P>Dramatic changes have also taken place in the methods by which telephone calls are transmitted from single lines running on poles along railway lines and roads to microwave links over which the vast number of calls, particularly long distance calls, are now transmitted.  Single cables can now carry a large number of telephone lines and calls.</P>
    <P>The number, weight and cost of transmitting cables is, in absolute terms, decreasing rapidly with the development of technology, particularly through advances such as fibre-optics. Even in rural areas they no longer connect a cable in isolated farm houses, rather two small aerials are erected. Everything has changed, except the charging system.  Some changes have occurred in the past ten years in the charging system but we are still operating a system which is based largely on charge groups and distance rather than on the cost to the provider of each individual call.  There is a huge difference between the number of subscribers in each district with some areas having as few as 10,000 subscribers and Dublin city having in excess of half a million subscribers available at a local call charge.</P>
    <P>The position currently is that in most counties a call to the county town from certain areas of the county is a trunk call.  The huge difference in the cost to the subscriber living in different areas is apparent if one analyses the relative costs of making a telephone call in different areas.  For example, a telephone call from Galway to Ballinasloe, or from Ballinasloe to Galway, is up to three times dearer during the day, and nine times dearer at night, than a local call.  Similarly, a long distance trunk call from, say, Dublin to Galway or from Galway to Limerick is up to five times dearer during the day and can be up to 18 times dearer at night than a local call. That is ridiculous when there is no extra cost for these calls to Telecom Éireann when the infrastructure is in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> I referred to multiples of three, five and 18 but it is interesting to compare that to the price difference between placing a call from Galway to Limerick, for example, and the cost of a call from Galway to London.  Whereas during the day a call from Galway to Limerick is up to five times dearer than a local call, the call from Galway to London is only 1.3 times dearer than the call from Galway to Limerick.  At night, the call from Galway to Limerick can be up to 18 times dearer than a local call, depending on the duration of the call, whereas it is only 1.6 times dearer to ring London than it would be to ring Limerick from Galway.  That is extraordinary. Obviously competition has affected international calls but Telecom can continue to milk subscribers for the local trunk calls.</P>
    <P>We must move towards a uniform cost structure irrespective of where one is calling to or from in the country.  This structure would be in line with the way subscribers are currently charged for Eircell services and the weekend service.  The first step in this direction would be the elimination of the A rate trunk call and the incorporation of the existing A rate areas into local call areas.  This would sort out the Ballinasloe to Galway problem, etc.  At the same time the B rate trunk call could be reduced to an A rate trunk call.  There should then be a fixed time limit on a programme eliminating all trunk rates within the State and the whole State should become one call charge area.</P>
    <P>Another issue of great importance is that all areas in the country be given equal access to all telecommunications services as they develop.  This relates to the provision of Eircell services and other cellular phone services throughout the State, as well as the provision of ISDN lines, etc.  It should be a firm policy of the Government that all telecommunication providers would have to service the entire State, without exception, on an equal service basis.  Anything else will only further stunt the growth of rural areas and add to the problems we already have in relation to imbalance of <Col N="1425" /> population.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the social and economic importance of ensuring access for peripheral regions to efficient and competitive telecommunications services is without question.  Ireland is itself a peripheral economy within the EU and, therefore, a high quality advanced telecommunications service for the whole country is essential if the Irish economy is to achieve its objectives of economic development and job creation.  To this end, the Government is fully committed to achieving the target that has been set of a telecommunications sector in Ireland which is in the top 25 per cent of OECD comparisons in terms of price, quality and range of services.</P>
      <P>The telecommunications infrastructure provided by Telecom Éireann throughout this country is already considered to be well advanced and, as it stands, is in the top 25 per cent of European telecommunications comparisons. For instance, 80 per cent of the telephone exchanges in the country are operated using digital technology.  Over the next four to five years, further investment of approximately £200 million per year will be made in the network as part of Telecom Éireann's ongoing capital investment programme to provide customers nationwide with an advanced telecommunications service which is both efficient and competitive. This will involve the continuation of the roll out of fibre optic cable and ISDN, Integrated Services Digital Network, to which the Deputy referred; further digitalisation of exchanges throughout the country with an overall target of complete digitalisation by the year 2000; and the further extension of the GSM mobile coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements are being introduced nationwide and many of the country's peripheral regions such as the <Col N="1426" /> Border areas and the offshore islands are already benefiting from access to a range of advanced services as a result of Telecom Éireann's capital expenditure programme.  Telecom Éireann's objectives are that all local exchanges will have access to ISDN within the next two to three years and that there will be fibre optic connections to all main towns in the country by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>EU Structural Funding mechanisms are also contributing to the accelerated development of telecommunications infrastructure and services, particularly in peripheral regions.  The INTERREG Programme, which is administered by the EU, runs from 1994-99 and provides funding to improve infrastructure in Border areas.  In January 1996, approval was granted to Telecom Éireann for EU assistance for a number of projects under the INTERREG Programme. These projects involve investments totalling £16 million in fibre optic cabling and exchange replacement in the Border area.  Eight million pounds of the total investment is being provided by the EU.</P>
    <P>The INTERREG Programme will accelerate the provision of new and upgraded infrastructure and services in Border areas.  Telecom Éireann also receives funding for the development of telecommunications infrastructure nationwide under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme (EIOP).  This provides for investment by Telecom Éireann of approximately £55 million with about 50 per cent of this being provided by the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann's policy is to approach the development of the network on a national level, on the basis that the telecommunications network is an integrated system and that investments or improvements in any given area of the network will improve the network as a whole and therefore improve the services available to all customers, irrespective of their location in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> Business customers in particular require a high level of advanced telecommunications services and over the past number of years Telecom Éireann, working closely with the IDA, has been instrumental in attracting over 30 foreign companies to locate in Ireland. Indeed, a number of high technology companies dependent on a high quality, advanced and efficient telecommunications service have located in the peripheral counties of the Border region.</P>
    <P>KPN and Telia, the two partners in the consortium chosen recently by the Government as the strategic partner for Telecom Éireann, are among the world leaders in terms of quality and efficiency. I am confident that customers throughout the country will benefit in the near future from higher quality basic services delivered more efficiently and will be able to avail of more and more new services as telecommunications technology evolves. Business customers will benefit from a wider range of advanced services, particularly international services, through the consortium's involvement with Unisource and Uniworld.  The provision of a wider range of advanced services will enable Ireland to continue to develop as a successful base for high technology industry.</P>
    <P>At EU level, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is also involved in helping to shape EU policies on those telecommunications issues which have the greatest effect on peripheral regions.  Principal among these are those measures connected with the concept of universal service. Simply put, universal service in telecommunications refers to the provision of basis telecommunications services to all users at an affordable price &mdash; the Deputy mentioned costs.  This means guaranteeing citizens access at an affordable price to a voice telephony service over a line allowing them to use fax or to hook up to a computer.  It also means that users must be offered operator assistance, emergency and directory inquiry services and that public pay phones are widely available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> The concept has been the subject of continuous debate and consultation since the Commission first put forward its proposal for complete liberalisation of the sector in 1992.  All sides are agreed, however, that liberalisation must be accompanied by the guarantee of a universal service.</P>
    <P>In our Presidency role we have the opportunity of having a large influence on the progress of the measures connected with universal service which are now on the table for discussion and were a matter for discussion at the Telecommunications Council meeting I attended last Friday.  These include the draft Interconnection Directive, which contains proposals on the costing and funding of the universal service, and the recent draft adaptation of the Open Network Provision, or ONP, Voice Telephony Directive which addresses the key issues of scope, quality and affordability of telephone services.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that we aim to achieve as much progress as possible over the next three months in copper-fastening this guarantee of a minimum level of service available to all citizens at an affordable price no matter where they live.</P>
    <P>Ensuring the development of a high quality telecommunications sector in Ireland that is efficient, competitive and accessible to all customers, irrespective of their location, is one of the Government's top priorities in the context of the economic and social development of the country.  I thank the Deputy for his interest.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the matter of Aer Lingus discontinuing its daily commuter flight to and from Sligo Airport.  From a date in November the Aer Lingus service will no longer operate and tenders have been received for the service.  Up to a couple of years ago, Aer Lingus operated two flights per day to Sligo.  Now the only <Col N="1429" /> flight being operated by our national airline is to cease.  If the successful tender company pulls out of Sligo in a few years' time we will be left without an air service to and from the county.</P>
      <P>The figures put to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications regarding the Aer Lingus flight to and from Sligo by Conor McCarthy, the chief executive in charge of commuter flights in Ireland, showed that the Sligo service was not viable.  However, those figures must not be looked at on their own.  The majority of customers who fly into Sligo from Continental Europe and Great Britain like to fly Aer Lingus direct because they have confidence in the airline.  In 1990, over 50,000 people flew into Sligo Airport.  So far in 1996, because of the limited availability of seats, only 20,000 people have flown into Sligo.  Aer Lingus has a beautiful aircraft, the Fokker 50 &mdash; I have flown in it from Sligo and to different parts of Europe and Great Britain.  The Sligo service must be looked at as part of an overall package comprising continental travel.  Looked at in this way, it would prove to be profitable.</P>
      <P>The ending of this service is a further downgrading of the west.  It is a further blow to the already crippled infrastructure of this county, given that the Sligo railway line has the worst trains and tracks in the country.  I recently visited Donegal airport at Carrickfin.  It is one of the most beautiful regional airports. I propose that Aer Lingus should cover both Sligo and Donegal airports as part of their regular service.  This would make sense as there is only 15 minutes flight time between the two airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note the amounts of money granted to regional airports for the years 1989-93.  Under the Structural Funds programme Donegal received £1,711,000; Waterford, £1,402,000; Galway, £591,000; Knock, £215,000; Sligo, £202,000 and Kerry, £6,310,000.  Kerry Airport received almost £6.5 million which provided a new jet runway that is 6,000 feet long to <Col N="1430" /> enable the Tánaiste to fly the Government jet into his local airport.  Kerry received £6,108,000 more than Sligo Airport whose runway is only 3,839 feet long.  How can the Government justify giving that kind of money to one regional airport?  The Tánaiste has robbed the national cake for personal and political reasons.  The people must realise what he has done.  I cannot understand how his Cabinet colleagues allowed him to hijack the Structural Funds in this way.  It is a shame that such a thing has happened.</P>
    <P>It is also strange that the infrastructure in my part of the country has notably deteriorated in recent times. Thousands of pounds of tourism revenue will be lost to the west.  The Minister of State who is present this evening is not at the Cabinet table, but this says much about the Government of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and suggest that he put the question of the division of the national cake to the Tánaiste who might be better qualified to answer than I am.  As far as Sligo is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, in consultation and co-operation with Sligo North West Airport has, for some time, been trying to have the Sligo-Dublin route included in the essential air services programme in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme was introduced following consultation with the regional airports and also with the European Commission, as required under Council Regulation 2408/92.  The programme is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions served by the four regional airports concerned, including Sligo, and expand the range of access options for tourists and others. The programme also serves as an inducement for the attraction and development of industry in the regions <Col N="1431" /> by providing quick access for both Irish sales staff and foreign buyers to the marketplace and to the production facility.</P>
    <P>The programme already applies to the Donegal-Dublin, Galway-Dublin and Kerry-Dublin routes and involves an Exchequer subvention to assist an airline to meet the public service obligations applying to the route.  I am not in a position to debate with the Deputy the figures he has put on the record but, in relation to that level of subvention, I must accept what he says as true in the absence of any contradiction from my officials.  If a subvention is given to assist an airline to meet public service obligations applying to the route I can only deduce, if the Deputy's figures are correct, that there must be far greater public service obligations in Kerry than in Sligo.  The Deputy may take that up in a different forum and with a different Minister.</P>
    <P>Following two earlier unsuccessful calls for tender in respect of the Sligo/Dublin route, the public service obligations attaching to this route were revised in consultation with the airport company and re-advertised earlier this year.  This was done in order to enhance the prospect of getting a suitable operator.  The main public service requirements now attached to the Sligo/Dublin route are for a pressurised aircraft providing two round trips daily in summer and one in winter.  Currently there is one round trip daily all year round.  The increased frequency in the summer months was necessary to cater for the increased volume of tourist and other traffic in those months.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the EU Regulation governing the programme, if a contract is awarded to an operator on the route no other airline may operate a service on that route for the duration of the contract.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently assessing a tender for the service.  There are a number of aspects which need to <Col N="1432" /> be clarified before a final decision is made on the award of the contract.  I am extremely hopeful that these issues can be resolved and that a contract for the provision of the required service will be signed in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus currently provides a once daily air service in each direction on the Sligo-Dublin route.  It submitted a bid in response to the current call for tenders under the essential air services programme.  The bid, however, did not comply with the public service obligations agreed with the airport company and advertised in the European Official Journal and so could not be accepted. The Deputy should understand that point particularly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it but I do not agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If and when a contract for the route is awarded to another airline, Aer Lingus, as I explained earlier, will have to withdraw from the route in order to comply with the EU Regulation.  The new carrier will, however, be operating an increased frequency during the summer season.  I am satisfied that this will benefit tourism development and other economic development in the Sligo region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, Aer Lingus continues to provide a Sligo-Dublin service and has undertaken to co-operate fully with the successful bidder to ensure that the route is maintained and developed to the greatest possible extent, particularly in regard to interlining and onward connections at Dublin Airport, a point made by the Deputy.  I understand that the route has not been included in the Aer Lingus winter schedule.  It has been omitted on the assumption that there will be another airline on the route during the winter period.  I understand that the company will continue to provide a service for a limited period after the end of the summer schedule to enable a new operator to set up on the route and I <Col N="1433" /> express my appreciation to Aer Lingus for the goodwill and co-operation it is showing in regard to the inclusion of the Sligo-Dublin service under the essential air services programme.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy, of course, that Aer Lingus operates to a strict commercial mandate.  In the <Col N="1434" /> unlikely event of no operator being successful under the current tendering procedure, it would be open to Aer Lingus to continue to provide a service on the route, but that would be a matter for the company's commercial judgment.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 8 October 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 24 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>As and from September 1996 there are 27 full-time law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.  The waiting periods for legal aid advice in each of the 26 centres operating on 31 August, 1996 are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In seven centres the waiting time was one month or less, in five centres the time was between one and two months, in nine centres the time was between two and four months, in four centres the time was between four and six months, and in one centre the time was eight months.  Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking whatever remedial action is considered necessary.  Appropriate steps have been taken to reduce the waiting list in those centres where increases have occurred.  I should point out, however, that the very success of the board in carrying out its mandate raises its profile and attracts an ever increasing number of applicants for legal aid and advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new full-time law centre was opened in Navan in September bringing the total number of full-time law centres <Col N="1357" /> to 27.  I am advised that Cavan law centre, with a staffing complement of three, will be opening in early November and two new centres, at Newbridge and Tullamore, are expected to open to the public by the end of 1996.  This will bring the total number of full-time law centres to 30, and should lead to reductions in waiting times in those and adjacent catchment areas.</P>
    <P>The reduction in waiting times for appointments with solicitors and the expansion of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice have been among my priorities since taking office.  I have ensured, and will continue to ensure, that the board has the resources to expand and develop its services, consistent with its requirement to provide legal aid and advice as widely and as quickly as possible throughout the country.  The extra resources which I have provided over the past four years is evidence of my resolve in this regard.</P>
    <P>The rapid and nationwide expansion the Legal Aid Board has undergone since 1992 has been undertaken in order to ensure that an effective civil legal aid and advice structure is in place to provide, among other matters, legal aid and advice to couples whose marriages have broken down.  This expansion can now be seen as necessary and timely having regard to an anticipated increase in applications to the board for legal services on the introduction of divorce. Funding to the Legal Aid Board has increased from just under £2.7 million in 1992 to £6.5 million in 1996.  This represents an increase of just over 240 per cent.  In the same period the staffing levels in the board have increased from 99 to 224, an increase of just over 225 per cent.  I will continue my efforts to ensure that sufficient resources are made available to the Legal Aid Board to enable it to provide an adequate response to all challenges which it may face in the future and, in particular, the challenge which will be posed by the introduction of divorce legislation, subject of course to budgetary considerations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the agency's present functions is to advise me on the workings of existing legislation and make proposals for amending it.  Accordingly, there have been ongoing consultations with the agency in the preparation of this Bill. <Col N="1359" /> These consultations have included consideration of resource levels and structures and have assisted me in securing an allocation of £750,000 for the agency in my Department's Estimate for this year.  This provision includes a significant increase for additional salary and operational costs which could arise in 1996 as a result of any broader remit.  I am also considering what provision can be made for the authority, as it will be known, for 1997 to enable it pursue its role in relation to all its proposed functions under the Bill.</P>

    <P>My Department is represented on the Monitoring Committee on the Employment of People with Disabilities which operates under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> This committee is concerned with the issue of enhancing the employment prospects of people with disabilities in both the public and private sectors.  I understand that the monitoring committee commissioned a survey in the first three months of 1996 to ascertain the <Col N="1360" /> most up to date statistics in respect of semi-State bodies.  I will make arrangements to have a copy of the survey supplied to the Deputy.  My Department also maintains contact with various Government Departments and IBEC with a view to improving the employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I recently published the Employment Equality Bill which will prohibit discrimination in employment on a range of grounds including disability.  The future enactment of this Bill will assist the employment prospects of people with disabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The possibility of recovering a child who has been wrongfully removed from the State or improperly retained abroad by a parent has improved greatly in recent years.  The credit for this goes to the operation of two international conventions, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and a Council of Europe Convention on child custody which were given the force of law in the State by the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991. Prior to that legislation there were no formal arrangements whereby rights of custody of parents in the State could be recognised or enforced in another state. As well as important legal provisions in those conventions which facilitate recognition by foreign courts of rights of custody, a key feature of the conventions is that they provide for the establishment of a central authority in each contracting state to carry out functions which are specified in the conventions. All central authorities are obliged to initiate steps to trace a child; to seek the child's return or secure access to the child; to arrange, if necessary, for court proceedings to secure the return of, or access to, the child; and to collate and send to other central authorities information about the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the operation of those functions, I can confirm that the central authority which operates in my Department for the purposes of both conventions has received full co-operation from other central authorities.  The Deputy will <Col N="1363" /> appreciate that I could not undertake, in reply to questions, to discuss the details of any particular cases.  I say that in the knowledge that from time to time some cases of child abduction get considerable publicity.</P>
    <P>The total number of cases dealt with in 1995 by our central authority was 132.  Of that figure, 62 were abductions into the State and 70 were abductions from the State.  In 14 of those 62 cases of abductions into the State the court ordered the return of the children concerned; in two cases the court refused to return the children; in 19 cases the parties reached agreement, 16 applications were withdrawn and 11 cases were awaiting resolution at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In 18 of the 70 cases of abductions from the State foreign courts ordered the return of the children; in four cases the foreign courts refused to return the children, in 19 cases the parties reached agreement; 13 applications were withdrawn and 16 cases were awaiting resolution at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The operation of both conventions is the subject of regular review under the auspices of the relevant international organisations, namely, the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Council of Europe.  Both conventions provide specifically for those reviews and my Department has participated in them.</P>

The Bill that I am proposing follows on a review of the law in this area and it takes into account representations made by various interest groups.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxable income is that part of income on which tax is actually calculated.  In arriving at a figure for taxable income deductions from gross income must be made, in accordance with the Income Tax Acts, in respect of expenses, capital allowances, stock relief, interest repayments on borrowings, contributions towards medical assurance, retirement annuities and basic personal allowances, or exemption limits, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The figures for the taxable income of farmers on Revenue records for 1992/93, namely £347 million for full-time farmers and £138 million for trader-farmers, correspond with gross income figures of £590 million for full-time farmers and £200 million for trader-farmers.  The figure of £200 million attributed to trader-farmers includes income from trades or professions other than farming which is not distinguished in the total.  Employment income of £275 million earned by farmers or their spouses and which is liable to tax under PAYE is also excluded from the figures of gross income attributed to both full-time farmers and trader-farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Revenue figures relate to a total number of 77,200 farmers, that is, 61,500 full-time and 15,700 trader-farmers, who were formally assessed to tax <Col N="1366" /> on their income tax returns for the income tax year 1992/93.  Many of those assessments were for zero tax amounts.</P>
    <P>The remaining farmers on tax records are not formally assessed to tax annually because their incomes are clearly too low to attract a tax liability.  Details of the incomes of these individuals are not available.</P>
    <P>A precise reconciliation between the income figures of farmers emerging from Revenue records and the figures included by the CSO in the Statistical Bulletin is not possible because each set is compiled independently of the other. Some of the main differences between the two sets of income figures are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the CSO figures are inclusive of the amounts of interest payable on borrowed capital, while the Revenue figures exclude this factor;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the CSO figures include all subsidies payable to the farming sector, whereas the Revenue figures include this factor only where the subsidy is an income subsidy and regarded as income for tax purposes, and then only for the cases who are formally assessed to tax on an annual basis;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the CSO figures are based on their estimate of the income arising in the overall agricultural sector as against the Revenue figures which are limited to the individuals who are formally assessed annually;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the CSO figures include the income from agricultural production of agricultural contractors, co-operatives, institutions and commercial concerns, which are excluded from the Revenue figures.</P>

This measure was agreed so as to allow the operators, including Aer Rianta, sufficient time to diversify their activities.  There have been no proposals in respect of duty free shopping from the Commission to date and the Commission recently confirmed their opposition to the retention of duty free shopping beyond 1 July 1999.  In the absence of any such proposals, the facilities in question are due to cease on the date mentioned.</P>

My Department's records indicate that Coláiste Mhuire catered for an enrolment of approximately 430 pupils in the late 1960s.  The capacity of this school is now considered to be between 300 and 350 pupil places.  Scoil Caitríona, which was built in 1972, can accommodate around 500 pupils.

Information on early and temporary releases is published in the annual report on prisons and places of detention, the latest publication of which is for the year 1993. In addition, I have indicated in response to a number of parliamentary questions the number of individuals granted varying periods of short-term temporary release as well as those granted full temporary release each year.

      <P>To qualify for a contributory old age pension at age 66, a person is required to have been in insurable <Col N="1381" /> employment or insurable self-employment before reaching age 56.  This has been a feature of the contributory pension scheme since it was first introduced for employed contributors in 1961 and expanded later to include self-employed contributors.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this condition is to link entitlement to a pension to a reasonable level of social insurance contributions during the course of a person's working life.  Accordingly, a self-employed person who enters social insurance for the first time after age 56 is not entitled to a contributory old age pension.  Under existing legislation, it is not possible for such a person to qualify for a reduced rate of pension or to pay additional contributions to meet the shortfall in contributions.  Where, however, the person had earlier insurance as an employed or voluntary contributor for any period before age 56, self-employment contributions may be combined with those earlier contributions for the purpose of assessing entitlement to pension.</P>
      <P>In addition, contributions paid in an EU member state can be combined with contributions paid in Ireland to qualify for an old age contributory pension. Contributions paid in a country outside the EU, but with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, can also be combined with those paid in Ireland to qualify for a special pension under the agreement.  This latter situation arises only where the applicant does not have an underlying entitlement to a pension under existing social security legislation in either country.</P>
      <P>Recently it was decided to refund the pension element to self-employed persons who had earlier insurance confined to the period prior to 1953 and who were over age 56 when insurance for the self-employed was brought in in 1988. Approximately 150 people qualified for these refunds the total cost of which was £120,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No refund is made at present to self-employed contributors in respect of employee contributions made after 1953 <Col N="1382" /> and before 1988.  I am considering the question of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for such people and these contributions could be of value in that context.</P>

      <P>On taking up his responsibilities for the insurance sector, my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, was presented with proposals for legislation to provide for the capping of general damages awards in personal injury compensation cases subject to an overall maximum level of judicial award.</P>
      <P>These proposals were based on the premise that the high level of general damages awards by the High Court was a major contributory factor in high settlement costs of claims resulting in a heavy premium cost burden on the Irish traded sector.  However, there was insufficient empirical analysis to support this premise and the Minister of State commissioned consultants to undertake an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland, including the factors contributing to those costs and their impact on the international competitiveness of the traded sector.  The consultants were required to make recommendations based on the results of their analysis and evaluation.</P>
      <P>The report has been submitted to Government prior to its publication.  It is intended that the report's findings and recommendations will provide the basis for developing a programme of measures aimed at addressing the key factors which contribute to high insurance costs in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I share the concern of the airport companies, the airlines and the shipping companies about the possible effects of the abolition of intra-Community duty free sales.
