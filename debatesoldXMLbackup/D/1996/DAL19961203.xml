      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Definitive statistics on the level of unemployment are based on the Labour Force Survey.  The most recent results show that in the year to April 1996 the level of unemployment fell by 1,000 to 190,000.  Unfortunately, Labour Force Survey results are not available in respect of individual counties or catchment areas of social welfare offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report the following statement showing the number of persons on the live register in counties Sligo and <Col N="430" /> Leitrim at the dates in question.  However, the live register is not an accurate indicator of the level of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister of State referred to the Labour Force Survey, will he indicate why it has been used as a bible by certain other Ministers in regard to statistics for the past six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Labour Force Survey is carried out on a scientific basis.  A set number of households, 45,000, are assessed on an annual basis and it is recognised as the definitive measure of unemployment.  It is the normal measure used in other countries.  As I said in the House on previous occasions in regard to updating the statistics, it is proposed to introduce quarterly labour force surveys as and from 1997.</P>
      <P>For clarification purposes I will give details of the number of persons on the live register.  The Deputy requested figures for 1 January 1992, 1993 and 1994.  Those I have are end of year figures.  A total of 3,701 persons were on the live register in County Sligo in December 1992, 3,579 in December 1993, 3,377 in December 1994 and the figures for the months in question include 3,496 in April 1996, 3,498 in May 1996, 3,810 in June 1996, 3,855 in July 1996, 3,809 in August 1996, 3,590 in September 1996 and 3,404 in October 1996.  The number on the live register in County Sligo has fallen from December 1992, the first year in respect of which information is sought, to 3,404 in October 1996.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,821 persons were on the live register in County Leitrim in December 1992, 1,845 in December 1993, 1,837 in December 1994, 1,786 in April 1996, 1,820 in May 1996, 1,937 in June 1996, 2,110 in July 1996, 2,047 in August 1996, 1,935 in September 1996 and 1,782 in October 1996.  The number on the live register in County Leitrim has fallen from 1,821 in December 1992, the first year in respect of which information is sought, to 1,782 in October 1996, which represents a marginal decrease.</P>

I will do what I can to see if we can get that information.  I do not have it on file and there is no process currently by which it can be obtained but that is something that could be looked at.</P>

      <P>Bhuail an Coiste Monatóireachta le chéile ar 25 Meán Fómhair 1995.</P>
      <P>Déanann an Coiste seo na seirbhísí farantóireachta (idir paisinéirí agust lasta) ó chathair na Gaillimhe agus Rós A Mhíl go hÁrann a phlé.</P>
      <P>Tá ionadaithe ar an gcoiste ó gach oileán de na hóileáin Árann, ó na comhlachtaí farantóireachta agus ó na Ranna Rialtais ábhartha.  Is fóram fiúntach é chun na seirbhísí farantóireachta a phlé agus chun bealaí eagsúla a aimsiúd'fhonn an tseirbhís a fheabhsú.  Is é príomhchuspóir an Choiste ná teagmháil agus cumarsáid idir muintir na n-oileán agus soláthróirí na seirbhísí a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>De réir na moltaí sa Tuarascáil Idir-Ranna um Fhorbairt na nOileán, aistríodh cúraimí maidir le seirbhísí farantóireachta go mo Roinn féin ón Roinn Iompair, Fuinnimh agus Cumarsáide.  Is í an Roinn sin a bhí i gceannas ar an gCoiste Monatóireachta go dtí sin.</P>
      <P>Ó aistríodh na cúraimí, níor bhuail an Coiste le chéile ach tá socruithe anois go dtionólfar an chéad chruinniú eile an 6ú lá de mhí na Nollag.</P>

Nuair a bhí na moltaí as an Choiste Oileánda againn, dhéanamar scrúdú orthu agus thugamar freagra do daoine na n-oileáin.

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 4-7 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Leagann Tuarascáil an Choiste Idir-Ranna um Fhorbairt Oileán straitéis fhadtréimhseach amach maidir le forbairt eacnamaíoch agus shóisialta na n-oileán amach ón gcósta.  Is laistigh den chreatlach seo is féidir le Ranna Rialtais agus áisíneachtaí athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar pholasaithe reatha maidir lena n-éifeacht ar na hoileáin, agus sainriachtanais phobal na n-oileán a chur san áireamh nuair atá polasaithe nua i gceist.  Tá ról lárnach ag an gCoiste Idir-Ranna i gcomhordú an phróiséis seo agus i ndíriú ar cheisteanna a bhaineann leis na hoileáin.</P>
      <P>Tá dul chun cinn déanta i líon áirithe réimsí ó foilsíodh an Tuarascáil i mí Feabhra na bliana seo.  Ón uair sin i leith bhí an-chuid cruinnithe agam le pobail oileánda agus tá cuairteanna tugtha agam ar na hoileáin chun go bhfeicfinn dom féin na deachractaí a bhíonn acu ó lá go lá. Dá bhrí sin tá mé láneolach ar na ceisteanna seo agus tá mé sásta gurb í an stráitéis atá leagtha amach sa Tuarascáil an cur chuige is fearr chun inmharthanacht fhadtréimhseach a chinntiú do na hoileáin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> D'aithin an Tuarascáil rochtain idir na hoileáin agus an mhórthír mar an phríomhcheist gur chóir díriú uirthi i mbliana agus tá milliún punt breise curtha ar fáil i 1996 chun na críche seo amháin.</P>
    <P>Mar thoradh ar an gcóras nua oibre atá i bhfeidhm, bunaithe ar mholtaí sa Tuarascáil, tá tograí rochtana roghnaithe agus curtha in ord tosaíochta ag Coistí Oileánda na nÚdarás Áitiúil atá i gceist.  Go dtí seo, tá thart ar sé chéad míle punt ceadaithe agam do thograí práinneacha rochtana.  Tá mé ag súil go mbeidh mé in ann a fhógairt go luath go bhfuil maoiniú breise ceadaithe chomh luath agus a chríochnaíonn an Coiste Idir-Ranna an obair mheasúnaithe.</P>
    <P>Tá sé mar chuspóir agam iomlán an mhilliún punt a dháileadh roimh dheireadh na bliana má bhíonn tograí oiriúnacha ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Ón uair gur seoladh an Tuarascáil tá roinnt eile moltaí tábháchtacha á gcur i bhfeidhm.  Mar shampla:</P>
    <P>(i)  tá geallta ag an Roinn Oideachais go gcuirfear leas phobal na n-oileán san áireamh sna Boird Oideachais Réigiúnacha atá á moladh;</P>
    <P>(ii)  tá uasteorainn an tástáil maoine maidir leis an Deontas Lóistín do Cheantar Iargúlta méadaithe go suntasach i gcomhréir le deontais oideachais triú leibhéal;</P>
    <P>(iii)  tá gach ceann de na hÚdaráis Áitiúla ag cur plean oibre infrastruchtúir 3-5 bhliain le chéile do na hoileáin faoina gcúram;</P>
    <P>(iv)  tá na tearmaí tagartha do staidéar ar chur chuige straitéiseach maidir le forbairt turasóireachta na n-oileán á n-ullmhú i gcomhairle le Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann; agus</P>
    <P>(v)  tá socraithe á bhforbairt chun seirbhísí poiblí riachtanacha a sholáthar do na hoileáin trí úsáid theicneolaíocht an eolais.</P>
    <P>Bíonn teagmháil rialta idir mo Roinn agus Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann.  Bhí an cruinniú is déanaí agam le hionadaithe na Comhdhála ar an gceathrú lá déag de mhí na Samhna agus phléamar roinnt ceisteanna a bhaineann le pobail na n-oileán.  Orthu seo bhí dáileadh an mhilliún punt do sheirbhísí rochtana, oibriú an chórais a leagtar síos sa tuarascáil trína n-aithnítear tograí tosaíochta ag an leibhéal áitiúil agus phléamar freisin an dul chun cinn atá déanta maidir le tograí áirithe.  Tá an Rialtas lándíograiseach maidir le stráitéis oileánda agus maidir le cinntiú go dtagann comhoibriú agus tacaíocht iomlán ó na Ranna Rialais agus na háisíneachtaí atá i gceist chun leanúint ar aghaidh ag tabhairt feidhme do mholtaí na Tuarascála.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the widespread dismay in the offshore island communities at the lack of progress in implementing any of the recommendations in the inter departmental island report?  The Minister of State has been in office for two years and the <Col N="434" /> commitment to spend £1 million in this financial year has not been fulfilled although we are nearly at the end of the year.  Galway County Council has the largest offshore island population of any county.  The number one priority submitted to the Minister of State's Department was the provision of an air service to Inishbofin.  No report has been received in relation to that application other than a statement from the Department that until a feasibility study is undertaken the proposal cannot be further considered.</P>

      <P>When the report was published I indicated the model adopted by Cork County Council of an islands committee would be used as a model for submitting proposals to the Department for infrastructural developments on offshore islands.  Cork County Council islands committee consisted of members of island communities, represented by Chomhdháil Oileánn na hÉireann, and county councillors for the areas contiguous to the islands.  This system worked well.  It has taken other county councils some time to establish similar committees.</P>
      <P>The schemes submitted originally did not reflect the wishes of island communities.  This has resulted in delays.  Despite this, £600,000 has been allocated to projects properly analysed by the Department.  The islands off County Galway will receive approximately £800,000 this year.  It is clear, therefore, that they have not been neglected.  In the case of Inishbofin, I have approved the payment of a grant for the provision of lights on a helipad which were urgently needed.  When the formal documentation is completed for the feasibility study of a fixed-wing air service I am sure Galway County Council's request will be favourably considered.  Any delays are due to teething problems in operating the new system.  There are certain standards to be met.</P>

In recent days a grant to Galway County Council of £17,000 and an additional £5,000 for Clare Island have been approved.  As the House will recall, there was a ferry tragedy on Bere Island, following which the islands committee agreed to Cork County Council's proposal to construct a slipway at Pontoon Pier.  The islanders, however, wanted a slipway and pier.  It took from March to October to complete the documentation.  I am glad Cork County Council has agreed to put up £100,000 and my Department £328,000 to eliminate any difficulties encountered on the eastern end of the island.</P>

Does the Minister agree that the purpose of a feasibility study is to answer questions the Department might have on the feasibility of this project?  Sanctioning such a small amount of money could not have taken the Department six months.  The proposal was put by Galway County Council last June.

      <P>I am always willing to answer Deputy Ó Cuív's questions no matter how contrary they are.  Galway County Council or the island's committee applied in June.  At that time no indication was given as to who would own this airstrip.  My Department was not in a position to fund it when it did not know who would own the land.  Eventually, Galway County Council told us it was prepared to compulsorily purchase the land.  The committee has been working on a partnership model between local authorities, the Department and the islanders.  In some cases, this means the local authority makes a small contribution.  I said that Cork County Council spent £100,000 on the proposal for Bere Island. However, Galway County Council has not offered a shilling towards the proposal.  A partnership was not offered.  We did not ask for much, only that the idea of a partnership be put forward in the proposal.  Donegal County Council, Mayo County Council and Cork County Council have done this.</P>

There have been teething problems in the first year in regard to capital projects.  I do not want to be painted as the nigger in the woodpile holding up matters because that is not the case. Those who are holding up the projects are the county councillors who have their own pitches and are looking after themselves.  The issue is whether Galway and Mayo county councillors agree the islanders' proposals.</P>
      <P>I visited the islands and met the people there and when I came back I drew up a list.  When these matters came before the islands committee each council was asked to put forward proposals. In some cases reports have been returned and proposals accepted, but it was accepted that the priority in the first year was to provide safe access.  Deputy Ó Cuív is implying that county councillors were not aware that funds were available, but from listening to reports about this matter on the airwaves, Galway and Mayo county councils believed they did not receive enough money, but everybody knew that all the money has not been spent.  Having examined all the issues, we are now prepared to consider access to non-Gaeltacht islands and if proposals are not agreed in 1996 they will be considered in 1997.</P>

      <P>I have taken a keen interest in Semperit, Ballyfermot for many months, indeed long before the parent company announced plans <Col N="441" /> on 18 September 1996 to wind down its Irish subsidiary.  I believe that was a bad decision. However, given the realities of global commerce, it is one that is not reversible despite our collective endeavours.</P>
      <P>My principal focus, and that of IDA Ireland, has been on securing the sale of the Ballyfermot premises and equipment to another international tyre manufacturer.  I pursued that objective at my original meeting with senior Continental AG executives on Wednesday, 18 September 1996 in Frankfurt and again at a further meeting with them in Hanover on Sunday, 10 November 1996. On both occasions I sought the full co-operation of Continental AG with the IDA in pursuing a sale.  At the November meeting, I specifically sought the fullest co-operation of Continental AG in pursuing a sale to the US tyre manufacturer, Cooper Tire of Ohio.  On the following day, 11 November 1996, I was informed that the board of Continental AG had decided to co-operate with IDA in this matter.  I had previously met officials of Cooper Tire in Ohio on Friday, 27 September last in a top level promotional drive for the sale of the Ballyfermot facility.</P>
      <P>Arising from the outcome of the Hanover meeting, I instructed IDA Ireland to pursue the US company's interest with maximum vigour.  To this end, there have been ongoing contacts between IDA, Cooper and Continental-Semperit. To date, the US company has not been in a position to indicate its decision with respect to a possible purchase of assets at Ballyfermot. Cooper had indicated it would communicate its decision to IDA and Continental AG by 18 November 1996.  The IDA is in continuing contact with a view to reaching an outcome as soon as possible.  IDA personnel are in the USA this week for further discussions with the potential US purchaser.  Continental has given no commitment in regard to the equipment at the factory.  Obviously the question of equipment is a key issue to be dealt with in the context of IDA's endeavours to sell the plant.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the reply in which he detailed the dates of the various meetings.  He has identified the two main points, first, that the equipment must be sold with the firm if a purchaser is to be found.  Apart from moral compunction is there any other way that can be clearly emphasised?  Second, is the Minister aware that in a recent interview in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> Cooper Tire indicated it was not interested in purchasing Semperit?  Has the Minister any comment to make on that?</P>

      <P>In respect of the issue of equipment, the position is that this is currently owned by Continental AG.  On the other hand, the IDA has certain holds over Continental in respect of outstanding grant liabilities. Continental has indicated its willingness to cooperate with the IDA in the sale and obviously <Col N="442" /> the sale would involve the equipment also.  It would be essential to Cooper Tire that the equipment be included.  As far as Cooper Tire's plans are concerned, we have been in close contact with the company.  It has not yet indicated a decision.  It is clear that in the past the company considered the purchase of this plant and at that stage did not go ahead with it.  As of now, we hope a meeting will take place this week between the IDA and executives in Cooper Tire on this issue and we await the outcome of that.  These are decisions made not by the Irish Government but by commercial investors.  We have supported Cooper Tire and we await its final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Cooper Tire considers this a good investment and will take up the offer, but is the Minister aware of the interview in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> with a person who was described as a high placed executive in Cooper Tire?  Has he investigated that matter?  Are we going on a wing and a prayer with regard to any further discussions the IDA is having with that company?  What follow up did the Minister do when he read the interview in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> and how true are its contents?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I do not bend to every interview or report in the newspapers.  I have had high level meetings this week with the IDA in the hope of ascertaining Cooper's plans.  On foot of those meetings executives are in the US this week and it is hoped meetings will take place with senior executives in Cooper Tire.  We are determined to see this matter through.  Good opportunities remain to pursue a tyre manufacturing operation from Semperit Ireland and they will be pursued until we have a final decision one way or the other.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister expect Cooper Tire to make that decision?  I do not want to be pessimistic &mdash; I would rather be optimistic &mdash; but my soundings do not indicate optimism in that regard.  Are there any other potential purchasers of this plant?  In the context of the uncertainty and the fact that the plant is due to close on Friday with the last of the administrative staff leaving, will the Minister consider setting up a task force similar to that set up following the closure of Packard?  Will he consider establishing a similar type operation for the areas surrounding the Semperit plant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the continuing delay in reaching a decision is not a good omen but the matter must be vigorously pursued.  As to other interests, the IDA has made a wide range of contacts, not all of which are finally closed off but I understand Cooper Tire is the most realistic prospect.  In regard to following up on this matter now that substantial numbers have been laid off and the plant is closing down, I have already established an inter-agency group to assess the issues in the aftermath of the Semperit closure <Col N="443" /> and to identify the effective follow up action that would be necessary.  We already have had meetings to consider those options and examine the type of measures we should put in place to respond to this loss of employment.  The group is made up of a wide range of interests including agencies directly under my Department and local interests such as Ballyfermot Partnership and others who have a substantial input to make in this area.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ask the IDA to ask Semperit to discontinue the tasteless advertisement being broadcast on the radio up to last week encouraging people, to the background of a jolly jingle, to buy Semperit because it is good for everybody and good for the country? The advertisement is tasteless in a month which has seen more than 600 people lose their jobs in Semperit.  I do not ask this question facetiously; the advertisement was brought to my attention and I subsequently heard it myself.  It strikes a most discordant note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions for a new national economic and social programme opened in Dublin Castle on 23 October 1996 with formal presentations from Government and a wide range of interests, many of whom were represented for the first time at such talks.</P>
      <P>The Government has acknowledged that the NESC, and also NESF, have identified the issues for a new programme and have provided very useful suggestions and recommendations.  To date the talks are centred on five key strategic areas: macro-economic policy, comprising public expenditure, pay, tax and PRSI; action to promote enterprise and jobs; action to modernise enterprise and further develop workplace partnership; action to modernise the public sector; and action for greater social inclusion and a focus on equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's officials are making appropriate inputs to the discussions on each of these five areas, particularly in the context of the need to maintain and improve the competitiveness of Irish-based enterprise.  A competitive enterprise sector is the key to raising living standards, maximising the number of self-sustaining jobs and improving social inclusion by, <Col N="444" /> in particular, greater integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market.</P>
    <P>In respect of labour market policy, including action in respect of the long-term unemployed, my Department is promoting policies which support job creation and integrating the long-term unemployed into the active labour force. The Government's record to date is a good one on each of these matters.  Under the type of policies this Government is promoting I expect this good record to be continued.  The talks on a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are continuing and making progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the continued reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed will be a key objective of these talks. All the social partners recognise the crucial importance of this issue and we can be heartened by the reduction last year of 25,000 in the number of long-term unemployed and that was in sharp contrast to the four years before when there was an 18,000 increase in long-term unemployment. Progress is being made but there is complacency that this issue has been overcome.  It will be an important part of the talks and their outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being disingenuous and is incorrect about the long-term unemployed.  In the previous years to which the Minister refers the computation was on the basis of the live register and the number of long-term unemployed on that register has increased by 3,500 since this coalition Government was formed.</P>
      <P>I support social programmes because my party has been involved in them.  However, is it not becoming too cosy and does the frenzy about wages and conditions exclude people who cannot be represented?  I emphasise the needs of small businesses and the long-term unemployed.  If the talks are to mean anything, there must be definite objectives in reducing long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has put great store by the Government's success in reducing long-term unemployment.  How can it be a success when measures brought in by his Department have not got off the ground, as he admitted last week?  Will there be a specific numbers element in the plan to reduce long-term unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that a key feature of the plan will be a continuing reduction of the number of long-term unemployed.  I roundly reject the Deputy's suggestion that long-term unemployment has not been falling.  The <Col N="445" /> labour force survey is the authoritative evidence on long-term unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote the figures which are not very satisfactory for Fianna Fáil because they show a rise in the last four years of Fianna Fáil Government from 109,000 to 127,000 long-term unemployed, an increase of 18,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was followed by a decrease of 25,000 last year.  That is the reality. The Deputy's concerns about the live register are also being addressed.  The Minister for Social Welfare will be able to report an historic and unprecedented decline of over 20,000 in the number of people signing on the live register in the last number of months.  There is continuing progress in this area.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that we cannot afford to be complacent.  There is no cosiness in these negotiations.  We have clearly and explicitly included for the first time representatives of the unemployed, as represented both by the INOU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' unemployment centres.  We have also representatives of small and medium enterprises. There will be explicit reference to the needs of small and medium enterprises in the outcome of the talks as well.</P>
      <P>We must achieve a consistent reduction in long-term unemployment.  The Deputy will have seen in the recent Forfás document a clear underlining of the potential to reduce long-term unemployment to a figure of 50,000 by 2010.  We must consistently aim to bring down long-term unemployment figures.  It is a key issue the Deputy rightly emphasises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the figures he quoted for the Fianna Fáil Government were based on the live register and that the figures he now quotes are from the labour force survey?  What is the Minister's Department doing about Mr. Tutty's report from the Department of Finance which suggests that unemployment will increase in 1998?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm absolutely and categorically that the series I quote is a consistent series.  It is the labour force survey series on long-term unemployment, the authoritative measure on unemployment which is internationally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards projections for unemployment in the future, it is an extremely difficult area to predict.  Last year we had a significant fall in unemployment of 23,000.  This year we had a reduction of only 1,000 as measured by the labour force survey.  The trend in unemployment is influenced by variations in the number of people entering the labour market.  This year substantial numbers of women entered the labour market for <Col N="446" /> the first time.  There were also substantial numbers of returned emigrants.  In any given year it is difficult to predict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a projection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the report to which the Deputy referred but it is hard to be clear at this stage.  Government policy must continue to prioritise the increase in employment and the reduction in unemployment, especially the focus the Deputy rightly places on the reduction of long-term unemployment.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the need to safeguard the future of our indigenous newspaper industry; if he has concluded his consideration of the Report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement at the publication of the Report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry on 30 July 1996, I said that the indigenous industry was a vital one.  I agreed with the commission's report which states: &ldquo;The social, political and cultural role of the indigenous newspaper industry which distinguishes it from other industries consists primarily in its duty and in its ability to reflect a sense of national identity in an informative, integrative but also critical fashion&rdquo;.  On that occasion I also indicated my support in principle for the commission's recommendations that came within my Department's remit.</P>
      <P>On 26 November 1996 I reported to Government in regard to my role in co-ordinating the work of the various Departments on the commission's recommendations.  The Government has approved my intention to revert to them concerning legislation in relation to my own area of responsibility.  Specifically this legislation concerns below cost selling, merger control, regulation of ownership and concentration of media ownership.  On foot of the Government's recent decision, I am assessing legislative proposals on these issues and I expect to report further to Government in early 1997.  There are very complex legal and economic issues involved in this work.  I am taking appropriate advice on these matters before I bring forward specific proposals to Government.</P>
      <P>The recommendations relating to FÁS and the Labour Relations Commission do not require legislation.  I am ensuring that those bodies will provide all the necessary assistance to the industry.  Other Ministers will be pursuing matters appropriate to their own Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation or other Government action alone will not secure the future of a vibrant indigenous newspaper industry.  Charting a thriving industry <Col N="447" /> for the future is primarily in the hands of the industry itself.  They have the significant task of making newspapers more relevant to the needs of the modern marketplace for news and views, and also to the changing lifestyles and habits of our society.  Equally, the commission identified the task of improving competitiveness as a key one. The competitiveness agenda is not just confined to labour costs and numbers, important as these are, but must embrace issues such as work practices, printing, technology and distribution. The Irish newspaper industry must be prepared to confront these problems itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The two matters are intertwined.  It must first be established that legislation can be introduced which will be meaningful and workable.  As I said in my reply, there are complex economic and legal issues concerning a ban on below-cost selling.  In principle I accept the recommendations of the commission.  Whether we can bring forward legislation that will be robust and effective depends on a careful assessment of both legal and economic issues, which I am undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House last week, in response to a question from Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, considerable progress was made in relation to the application by my Department to the European Commission for readaptation aid for former Irish Steel workers made redundant due to the restructuring plan in 1994.</P>
      <P>I am now pleased to inform the House that a significant improvement on the readaptation aid package, originally approved by the Commission in December 1995, has been secured and formal European Commission approval was received late last week.  This new package represents a significant improvement in terms of the number of eligible workers, the amount of aid available and the payment conditions.  Readaptation aid will now be available for 209 former workers, made redundant in 1994, 1995 and early 1996. The total funding available from the Commission will be 627,000 ECUs and this figure incorporates the 376,806 ECUs approved by the Commission in December 1995.  Readaptation aid of 627,000 ECUs will result in payments of 3,000 ECUs per worker.  I understand that the Commission will make the funding available to my Department within two to three months and the Deputy may rest assured that payments will be made by my Department to the eligible workers as quickly as possible on receipt of the readaptation aid from Brussels.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the provision of matching funding from the Government.  As I previously indicated, the provision of additional matching funding does not arise in relation to the readaptation aid of 627,000 ECUs approved by the EU Commission for the Irish Steel workers made redundant in 1994, 1995 and early 1996. The extra statutory redundancy payments received by the workers constitutes the matching funding, and this has been accepted by the Commission.  In 1985, the previous occasion readaptation aid was paid to former Irish Steel workers, the extra statutory redundancy payments received by them also constituted the matching funding.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's point about making further applications under other programmes for funding to assist the former Irish Steel workers, I am not aware of any other specific aid which might be available from the EU for the former Irish Steel workers.  In any event, I understand that the average maximum aid available under Article 56.2(b) of the ECSC Treaty for workers made redundant is 3,000 ECUs per worker and, as I have mentioned above, this maximum amount has been secured for the former Irish Steel workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The redundant workers do not accept that the matching funding was provided by the Government through increased redundancy payments.  I do not accept it either because it <Col N="449" /> seems to be a breach of normal European relationships with regard to these matters.  There is now a large body of dissatisfied people, ex-workers of Irish Steel, who feel the State has let them down.  Irrespective of the increased payments, they are looking for the matching funding which is a feature of such funding.  Will the Minister meet the workers, as the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, did in the summer, and pursue the case with greater vigour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy takes that view.  The 1985 precedent is clear on the status of matching funds.  The redundancy payments of £4.3 million in respect of 209 people who were made redundant were accepted as matching funds in 1985.  That was the approach taken by Government in 1985 and the approach taken on this occasion by the Commission.</P>
      <P>There are significant improvements, a number of which have been missed by Deputies.  For example, on previous occasions aid was paid on a quarterly basis over an 18-month period which resulted in a very long phase.  On this occasion it will be paid as a lump sum.  Also, the Commission's view was that the payment should be confined to 2,000 ECUs per worker, but we successfully negotiated an agreement to pay up to the maximum of 3,000 ECUs per worker.</P>

      <P>Neither the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, who was in the Department in 1985, nor his brother, the Minister, are seen as friends of the ex-workers of Irish Steel.  The workers have informed me that when the redundancy payments were being negotiated there was no question that they would be taken as part and parcel of the matching funds.  These ex-workers would not be going on parade Saturday next to protest at how they have been treated if that was the case.  It appears that the Minister has taken an arbitrary decision based on an agreement made in 1985 which was not part and parcel of this new arrangement.  In these circumstances does the Minister not feel that there is an onus on him to match the EU funding?</P>

We put a huge effort into pursuing a successful future for the Irish Steel plant, which we have successfully done.  We have vigorously pursued this issue and again successfully negotiated an increase in the readaptation aid from 2,000 ECUs to 3,000 ECUs per worker.  My decision in regard to this was not an arbitrary one.  It is the accepted approach of the European Commission.  The precedent is clear.</P>

Will he ask his colleague if Senator <Col N="450" /> Sherlock reflects the true feeling of Democratic Left when he said it is a crying shame that matching funds were not provided by the Government?  He is a member of a party that is not only in Government but represented in that Department.  Will the Minister comment?  The Labour Party is also part of the Government, and it has been conspicuous by its silence over the past week, particularly in Cobh and east Cork.  It is time they stood up and were counted.

      <P>A decision by an employer, whether a private or public sector enterprise, to postpone the timing of a pay increase contained in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is a matter for that employer and the employees or their representatives, having regard to the particular circumstances of the employment.

      <P>I pay tribute to the Labour Court which has dealt with many difficult issues relating to this question.  Will the Minister agree that, in general, in relation to industrial relations, for example CIE, the Government has adopted a back seat approach?  Was it not appropriate that the Minister would have spelled out his views regarding the links being made?  It was wrong to link the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> negotiations with the viability plan for CIE. The Labour Court came down heavily on the side of the union and said that no such link should be made and that, in effect, a deal is a deal.  Will the Minister agree that under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> a deal is a deal and that it is unacceptable to make such links as it would constitute a breach of trust which is so important in regard to the whole question of social partnership?  He has allowed many industrial relations issues to drift; the CIE issue is a classic example.  This side of the House agrees on the need for a viability plan to be put in place but because so much time has been wasted we are now in a bottleneck in the run-up to a new agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of proper transparent and full disclosure by insurance companies and insurance intermediaries of all relevant information including all charges levied by investment product suppliers and intermediaries against clients' investments in their dealings with policyholders and prospective policyholders.  I am aware that market pressure and a greater level of awareness among consumers has contributed to a revision by some insurers of the way life insurance products are structured and sold so that persons taking out life assurance policies are clear as to the long-term nature of such policies and aware of the implications of their early encashment.  While I am hopeful that such market changes will permeate throughout the insurance industry, nevertheless the interests of consumers in this regard must be protected under Statute.</P>
      <P>My Department has been engaged in extensive consultations with the insurance industry and other appropriate bodies in regard to drafting regulations to provide for effective disclosure of all relevant information in this regard, to enable the policyholder to make a fully informed decision when taking out an insurance policy.  The issues surrounding disclosure should not be solely manifested in commission levels.  Information in relation to early surrender or encashment values, illustration of benefits, nature and type of policy, premiums review, sales remuneration and status of the supplier of the product is equally important as is proper provision of all other relevant information prior to completion of the proposal form.  These general principles should also extend to non life insurance products.</P>
      <P>It is also important that any new regime maintains in existence a strong, vibrant independent financial advisory sector. Independent financial advisers are a force for competition and a means of ensuring independence of advice.  They are a counter to dominance of financial services by big, powerful companies and can ensure a proper market in financial information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed transparency measures must be afforded the utmost consideration by all concerned as they will mark a fundamental change in the way insurance products are marketed and sold.  In this context discussions and negotiations with the insurance industry and consumer interests have been ongoing.  These deliberations, and other recent regrettable developments in the insurance market, have led to a re-evaluation of the thrust of the initial draft insurance regulations.  I am confident that this reappraisal <Col N="454" /> will be of long-term benefit to the insurance industry and consumers.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to provide as much information as possible to the House in relation to the structural changes which will inevitably occur, both as a result of the evolutionary nature of insurance regulation and the way in which insurance products are marketed and sold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the insurance industry has grown at a phenomenal rate in the past few years.  Prior to its recent expansion, people usually took out car and house insurance and insurance to cover their burial costs.  Nowadays people take out insurance to cover old age, ill health and so forth.  Will the Minister of State, in the course of his negotiations with the insurance industry, take into account the pyramid selling that is now part and parcel of the insurance industry?  Insurance is an extremely complex product and it will be expected to provide an income for the insured following an injury or other circumstance.  However, the introduction of pyramid selling in the industry means insurance is being sold by people who have little experience in that sector.  Will the Minister of State assure the House this matter will be included in his negotiations with the industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right to suggest the evolution of the industry is growing more complex.  The purpose of the ongoing discussions with the industry is to ensure a more intelligible and easily understood presentation of what is on offer to the prospective purchaser.  That includes information on early encashment or surrender values.  I have no doubt consumers will be able to shop around with more certainty and confidence that they understand what is on offer.</P>

      <P>Community employment is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those at whom the programme is targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present eligibility criteria for CE only came into effect earlier this year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the task force on long-term unemployment.  These criteria were designed to target the programme at priority groups and include provision for married unemployed persons to swop their social welfare entitlement <Col N="455" /> to qualify for participation on the programme.  As limited resources do not make it possible to provide CE for all long-term unemployed people it is necessary to target the programme at those most in need, such as persons in receipt of an unemployment compensation payment or persons in receipt of certain means tested social welfare payments.  In line with this, both men and women, single or married, who fulfil the eligibility criteria can participate on CE.</P>
    <P>CE is operating at or close to capacity, relative to available resources and to extend eligibility would be at the expense of the priority groups for whom the programme is designed.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be aware that married women working in the home are concerned about their exclusion from the community employment schemes.  The Minister says he is concerned about the long-term unemployed but many of these women gave up paid employment to work in the home and rear their children.  Now they find themselves debarred from community employment programmes to which they could make a significant contribution.</P>
      <P>Many married women are also discriminated against in terms of social welfare payments being paid from 1 January to lone parents and not to mothers in the home.  There is great concern that this Government is not interested in the role married people can play by returning to the workforce.  Recently the House passed Second Stage of the Employment Equality Bill, 1996. Does the Minister agree this scheme is discriminatory and, from the point of view of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, should be outlawed?  Can he assure the House he will make provision for women working in the home to play a meaningful role in community employment programmes in the future?</P>

      <P>The community employment programme is targeted at two priority groups &mdash; the long-term unemployed and lone parents who have been long-term unemployed.  Employment equality legislation permits targeting schemes at priority groups.  The Deputy's colleague recognises that the long-term unemployed is a priority group and that we must concentrate resources there.  There is a clear need in a programme such as community employment to target certain groups and that has been an <Col N="456" /> element in the programme since it was established.</P>
      <P>There is a consistent policy to identify people who are in greatest need of support of this nature, such as the long-term unemployed and lone parents, in order to get them back into the labour force.  That is a reasonable approach in addressing priority needs in the labour force.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware a person must be three years unemployed and in receipt of a social welfare payment to qualify for participation in community employment schemes. It is not possible for a person who works in the home and rears children to return to the workforce.  Many women working in the home have no opportunity to participate in these schemes as a result of the prohibitions imposed by the Minister.  The Minister should review the scheme in the forthcoming budget.  There are training courses available for married people working in the home but the Minister is aware that job expectation following those courses is about 16 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggests we should broaden the programme and not target it to such an extent.  That poses a difficulty.  The priority issue is long-term unemployment and the Deputy cannot have it both ways.  We are providing courses and support for people who wish to return to the workforce.  It is encouraging to note from the labour force survey that we had tremendous success last year in bringing an additional 30,000 women back into the labour force.  As this was not achieved before in the history of the State it clearly shows significant progress has been made in this field by the creation of a vibrant jobs market.  We are assisting those who require support, through specific reintegration programmes, but the community employment programme affords priority to the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>In addition, I am not clear as to the hazardous practices to which the Deputy refers.  However, I refer him to the reply given to Deputy Seán Ryan on Tuesday, 26 November 1996 by the Minister for the Environment concerning the use and location of plastic oil storage tanks as follows:</P>
      <P>At present, the building regulations do not impose any requirement in relation to oil storage tanks serving heating appliances in buildings whatever the material of tank constructions.  However, the amended building regulations and revised technical guidance documents, due to be published early in 1997, will include provisions on reducing the risk of spread of fire to such storage tanks.

      <P>If a standard or code of practice would assist the Minister for the Environment in drafting the building regulations or revised technical guidance documents referred to, I would be prepared to ask the National Standards Authority to draft such by reference to the work already being carried out on such standards at European and international levels.</P>

Will the Minister of State urgently examine this matter particularly since anybody purchasing a plastic oil storage tank at present is not furnished with any instructions on its proper siting and maintenance?

      <P>Last Thursday on the Order of Business I raised with the Tánaiste the possibility of providing time for a debate on Northern Ireland this week.  I think he was favourable to the allocation of time for such a debate.  Given that the Taoiseach's summit meeting with Mr. Major will take place next Monday, would it be possible to have a short debate on the North either tomorrow or Thursday?</P>

      <P>I would like to participate in such a debate if possible.  Questions on Northern Ireland have been tabled for reply tomorrow but there are considerable difficulties in providing time for a debate in view of my many EU-related commitments.  For example, tomorrow morning I have a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel while on Thursday and Friday I have meetings with a number of European leaders. There are not enough hours in the week to allow me to participate in such a debate this week.  I think there have been some discussions between the Whips on the matter.  I would like to facilitate the House and perhaps Deputies can raise matters during Question Time tomorrow.</P>

      <P>No, but I am not averse to the idea.  The problem is that it would be virtually impossible for me to participate in such a debate either this week or next week because of the EU summit.  Every day is taken up with European-related business arising directly from the Presidency and the meeting which I will chair.  It is not possible for me to give a commitment in respect of such a debate next week but the matter might be discussed by the Whips.  I will make my diary available to the Government Whip so that he can see if any time slots are available for this purpose.  The House would expect me to participate in such a debate but there is a practical problem in my doing so in the circumstances of these two exceptional weeks.</P>

      <P>Before calling the Taoiseach I wish to say that there is a certain level of expectation that an unknown person or persons may be named under the privilege of the House and I would like to make a brief comment on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Chair is cognisant, as are Members, of the right to free speech in this privileged Assembly, which is the cornerstone of our parliamentary democracy, I would remind Members that there is an onus on them to avoid if at all possible referring to persons outside this House in such a manner as could in any way be construed as being prejudicial to any subsequent investigations which may be deemed necessary by appropriate authorities.  I must remind Members, therefore, that the Dáil is not a court of law and the adjudication of aspects of this controversy <Col N="462" /> and any individuals associated therewith under fair and proper procedures rests elsewhere in accordance with the law and not in this House.  I ask Members, therefore, to bear my remarks in mind when making their contributions to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to announce for the information of the Dáil that the President, acting on my advice, has accepted the resignation of Deputy Michael Lowry as a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Alan Dukes for appointment by the Commission, constituted as provided in Section 2 of Article 14 of the Constitution, to be a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes has already served the country with distinction as Minister for Finance, Minister for Agriculture and Minister for Justice.  Prior to that he built up significant experience in EU affairs in Brussels as an economist with the IFA and as a member of Commissioner Burke's Cabinet.  I am confident that the skills and determination which he showed in these posts and as leader of the Opposition will equally be applied as a member of the Government.  He is well positioned to continue the reforming work begun by Deputy Lowry in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline my beliefs on the matters that have led to this motion.  Nobody is above the law; every citizen must abide by it and be amenable to it.  There is a higher responsibility on citizens who become public representatives.  As well as abiding by the law, public representatives must act as such in a way that is impartial and fair and is seen to be uninfluenced by considerations of private interest.</P>
      <P>There is a higher responsibility still on Ministers.  Unlike other public representatives, Ministers make executive decisions.  They administer the law as well as making it.  They act in collective responsibility with other Ministers and are jointly responsible for their collective decisions.  Because of their extra responsibilities and powers, Ministers, while they are Ministers, have constraints imposed on them by the law that are more exacting than those imposed either on other public representatives or on ordinary private citizens.  Ministers must give up any involvement in private business while they are Ministers.  They must make disclosures under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, that are much fuller than those required of other public representatives.  These constraints do not apply to other Members of the Oireachtas.  These distinctions between Ministers and other public representatives are real and they were well understood by every Member of the House when I referred to them recently, whatever some of them might have pretended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> No one, be he or she a Minister, a public representative or a private citizen, is above the law.  Each is open to investigation and subject to the law, but each is also entitled to the protection of the law, to due process, in any investigation of any alleged transgression.  The legal authorities, particularly the tax authorities, are well equipped with the skill, powers, resources and independence to investigate any matter that needs to be investigated.  They are obliged to conduct such investigations in a competent and fair way under law.</P>
    <P>There is not, and never will be, a system of conviction by denunciation.  Independent authorities, not rivals nor those with an axe to grind, make judgments as to culpability.  That is the way it should be and I ask Members on all sides who contribute to the debate to bear that in mind.  I also ask them to be mindful of the privilege of this House and not to make accusations, under privilege, against people outside the House.  Such allegations or accusations should be referred to the relevant authorities who will deal with them by due process.</P>
    <P>I now come to the background to the resignation of Deputy Lowry.  It relates to his relationship and that of his company, Streamline Enterprises, with Dunnes Stores and with Mr. Ben Dunne prior to his becoming a Minister. Arising from a media report it is appropriate at this point to refer to one further matter.  The Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, informed me on 30 November that he had acted as counsel for Mr. Ben Dunne in the litigation between Mr. Dunne and other members of the Dunne family.  This fact was already public knowledge.  No conflict has arisen in respect of any matter upon which the Attorney General has been asked to advise.  He is, of course, aware that a conflict could arise if his advice were sought by Government on any issues which arose in the litigation previously referred to.  If this should happen, there are procedures in place in the Attorney General's office to ensure the advice required by Government could be provided without the Attorney General becoming involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry has been a hard working Minister and has showed both commitment and vigour in carrying out his duties.  In particular, he was responsible for two major achievements in the reform and development of State enterprises. He created an acute sense of awareness of the need &mdash; against the background of EU-led liberalisation &mdash; to take action to improve competitiveness in the relevant enterprises.  He brought to companies providing services to the public a renewed commitment to putting the customer first.  He brought to his ministry a reforming zeal and an innovative approach.  I appreciate his contribution to the formation and achievements of this Government and his <Col N="464" /> achievements as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>In regard to his business and other interests, Deputy Lowry has exactly the same responsibilities as everyone else.  His obligations are covered by the law of the land.  In addition, arising from the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, he has obligations as a TD and they continue following his resignation as a Minister.</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibilities, as a matter of law, fall into a different category.  Ministers are collectively responsible for their official actions and are answerable to the Dáil for their actions as Ministers. Under the Ethics in Public Office Act, they have disclosure obligations more exacting than those of other public representatives, and are required to give up their direct involvement in business during their term of office as Ministers.  None of the allegations made against Deputy Lowry concerns his actions as a Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry, in his statement on 30 November, has given four reasons for his decision to resign.  He said the Department which he headed and the Government of which he was a member required his full and undivided attention and that it was simply not possible to fulfil those obligations and at the same time deal with sustained attack from certain quarters which was distracting public attention from the important work being done by the Government.  He pointed out that to fully and satisfactorily answer in the public arena all the questions which had been raised would involve the disclosure to competitors of information which would place his company at a serious disadvantage in what is a very competitive market.  Nor did he wish to embroil Dunnes Stores in what is becoming a political rather than a legal issue.  He emphasised he had a responsibility and an obligation to protect the business interests of Streamline Enterprises and the employees whose livelihoods depend on it.  Finally, he said the pressures of public life impact not only on the office holder, but also on his family and close friends.  He did not wish to prolong the distress to which they had been subjected, especially in recent times.</P>
    <P>Those were the reasons Deputy Lowry gave for his resignation, and I accepted his resignation. The allegations made relate to matters which arose before his ministerial appointment.  He has resigned ministerial office so that he can have the necessary time and space to deal with these allegations.  He deserves the time and space for which he has asked.  It would not be appropriate for me or, I suggest, for anyone in this House to deny him that time and space and I hope that, during this debate, Deputies will refrain from demanding the answers that Deputy Lowry has already said he is not yet in a position to give.</P>
    <P>For my part, I knew nothing about the matters alleged in the <i>Irish Independent</i> story of 29 November until a few hours before its publication.  It is important to stress that the full facts about these disclosures have not yet been <Col N="465" /> established or placed on public record.  It is not appropriate or possible for me, as Taoiseach, to form a judgment on matters on which all the facts have yet to be established by the competent authorities.  It is not possible for me to act as an investigator in matters which are for inquiry and action, if any, by those properly constituted legal authorities.  In this country we live under a system of law which gives all of us the same rights and responsibilities.  Deputy Lowry has exactly the same rights &mdash; no more or no less &mdash; as any other person who lives in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are the appropriate authorities for dealing with tax matters and with alleged infringements of the tax laws.  They do not need any prompting from me or from anyone else in Government to carry out their duties.  Such prompting would be inappropriate and would infringe on the independence given to them by this House under legislation.</P>
    <P>Media reports have suggested that some of the allegations now made have their origins in a Price Waterhouse report commissioned by the board of Dunnes Stores.  I do not know, and have no way of knowing, if this is correct.  I have not seen any such Price Waterhouse report, nor do I have access to possible sources of information relating to the allegations.  The Revenue Commissioners have wide powers to obtain any document or information they might need for the purposes of an investigation into tax irregularities.  Companies and individuals have obligations under the law to provide information to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners have obligations to keep certain matters confidential, but they also have an obligation to make public certain outcomes of their investigations.  The Revenue Commissioners act independently in making these decisions.  Deputy Lowry has told me he will co-operate fully with any investigation being conducted by the Revenue Commissioners or indeed by any other relevant body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry and his company, Streamline Enterprises, have for many years had a successful business relationship with Dunnes Stores.  He resigned from his office because he needed more time than was politically available to him to deal with questions posed in connection with that relationship.  It is important that he is allowed sufficient time, freed from ministerial office, to establish the facts for the relevant authorities and satisfy the questions that will be in people's minds about the issue.  Deputy Lowry, like all public representatives, knows that dealing fully and comprehensively with public concerns about any issue of financial probity is vital to our system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his appointment as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and on his return to Cabinet.  He is one of the most experienced Fine Gael Ministers.  His period as leader of the Opposition was characterised by a willingness to <Col N="466" /> put country before party, for which he subsequently had to pay a heavy political price. He set an example of a more considered and constructive style of Opposition which included a willingness to back the Government when it was vital to the national interest.  Deputy Dukes, who has the respect of this side of the House, despite strongly expressed differences, will do a great public service to all of us.  He will deal competently with the challenges and difficulties that face him.  When we vote tonight on the motion, we will not be voting against Deputy Dukes on a personal basis.  As he proved in the past, he will be a fine Minister.</P>
      <P>As Minister, he will have a great deal to tend to in his Department.  His most immediate task will be to prevent the threatened public transport strike over the board's threat to not pay the standard <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> increase on 1 January.  His predecessor encouraged the board to take an untenable position.  Only the most exceptional circumstances justify the non-payment of a basic cost of living increase.</P>
      <P>If the deficit in public transport operations was a justification, CIE workers would not have had a pay increase for many years.  While negotiations on structural reform, company streamlining and productivity are required, this is not the way to proceed.  An unreal dispute will do nothing for a new national programme.  We have raised the issue of tunnelling for Luas in this House many times.  It will be interesting to learn what the cost analysis will be in that regard and I welcome the fact that the new Minister will consider the issue.</P>
      <P>The resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, in the absence of any proper explanations about personal payments received from Dunnes Stores for work done on his home, was correct and inevitable.  It was also a personal tragedy.  I can understand the upset to his family, supporters and constituents.  His greatest achievement, outside politics, for which I admire him, was to clear the debt on Semple Stadium in Thurles.  He was also associated with the development of a third level college in Thurles, which was sanctioned by him and announced by Fianna Fáil. That work will be brought to fruition under the next Fianna Fáil-led Government.</P>

      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, was in charge of important semi-State companies.  Many controversies during his period in office were ethical issues.  The phrase &ldquo;cosy cartels&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweetheart deals&rdquo; must have come to many people's minds in the past few days.  He assailed the reputation of a former chairman of CIE, on an absolutely nominal salary, on the basis of expenses alleged to be of dubious justification. A highly capable chief executive of Bord na Móna was forced to resign because his paperwork on expenses was not in order.  No one boasted louder about the high standards he was <Col N="467" /> demanding from State companies.  He did not hesitate to claim that all his predecessors had fallen down on the job, a dangerous boast for a new Minister.  The reality is that he carried forward their work, with the aid of EU funding negotiated by them.  Apart from the controversies, his period in office was unremarkable.</P>
      <P>I raised concerns in this House on 23 April last about the controversial awarding of the second mobile telephone licence.  I asked the Taoiseach for a comprehensive statement in the light of the &ldquo;many allegations, accusations and much innuendo&rdquo; outside the House.  Inevitably, concern, especially among competitors who were not awarded the licence and who were unhappy about the decision, will be heightened by the latest revelations.  In that context, I ask the Taoiseach to confirm whether Mr. Ben Dunne has any beneficial ownership, direct or indirect with any consortium which is a named or as yet undisclosed investor in ESAT Digifone?  The Telecom deal should also be reviewed by the new Minister.</P>
      <P>We do not have an adequate explanation of the payment of £208,000 by Dunnes Stores on work at Deputy Lowry's home prior to his becoming a Minister.  For a Government that made openness, transparency and accountability its motto, the absence of information is totally indefensible. The distinction drawn by the Taoiseach between ministerial accountability and responsibility for prior actions as a Deputy is neither valid nor relevant.  Most people found it shocking.  In general terms, the concern would be that a large personal payment to a Deputy might influence his or her subsequent decisions as a Minister.  Since the former Minister will not provide an explanation, I propose to analyse the possibilities on the basis of the information provided.</P>
      <P>Allegations have been made in respect of the source of payment of home improvements to the home of Deputy Lowry amounting to £207,820. Up to 1994, he was director of Streamline Enterprises Limited which services refrigeration units for Dunnes Stores.  The documents unearthed by Mr. Sam Smyth in the <i>Irish Independent</i> consist of a cheque to the builders, Faxhill Homes Limited, for £76,674 drawn on the bank account of Dunnes Stores Ireland dated 24 February 1993 and signed by Ben Dunne, an invoice from Faxhill Homes Limited indicating the work was at the Ilac Shopping Centre in Dublin, an architect's certificate requesting payment from Dunnes Stores for work done at the Ilac centre to a sum of £76,674 and a covering architect's letter which indicates the work being certified was for alterations and additions to Deputy Lowry's house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payments made by Dunnes Stores were either directly for Deputy Lowry's personal benefit or some form of advance payment or credit for services rendered by his company to Dunnes Stores.  There appear to be three ways of <Col N="468" /> looking at these payments.  First, they could be viewed as a personal gift from Dunnes Stores to Deputy Lowry.  There is nothing illegal about receiving a gift, but it must be declared to the Revenue Commissioners and capital acquisitions tax paid on it.  The rate of capital acquisitions tax is nil on the threshold amount, 20 per cent on the next £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000 and 40 per cent on the balance.  The tax threshold applicable would at the time have been £11,450, assuming Deputy Lowry received no previous gifts.  Stiff interest and penalties apply on underpayment.  Second, the payments could be viewed as payment or part payment of services rendered by Deputy Lowry to Dunnes Stores. This would be taxable as personal income.  If not declared, unpaid tax, interest and penalties arise under the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Third, the payments could be viewed as payment or part payment for services rendered by Deputy Lowry's company Streamline Enterprises.  If this is not declared, then unpaid tax, interest and penalties arise under the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  Additionally, Deputy Lowry could be liable to return the money to his company.  This is obviously very important if the company becomes in any way insolvent.  If the company recorded approval of the payment due to Deputy Lowry, then this is either a gift, a director's loan, which should be declared in the company accounts, or payment for services rendered to the company, which are taxable as income.  It is also difficult to understand why the former Minister would personally benefit in return for services rendered by his company.</P>
    <P>Other possible lines of defence are being put forward by way, I suspect, of <i>ex post facto</i> justification.  It has been suggested that the payments were a personal loan or credit facility. There would have to be incontrovertible written evidence of that at the time and of arrangements having been made for its repayment.  It suggests a possible loophole in the ethics in Government legislation.  Why was the original section of the legislation covering this dropped by the Government?  The making of such a large personal loan on more favourable conditions than would be available from any lending institution would clearly represent a personal favour that ought to be declared.  If it represented advance payments in kind for services rendered, then that would constitute income that would have to be declared for tax at the time they were received. One cannot wait to define as income only the final total payment when everything has been settled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry could not have availed of the tax amnesties, as suggested in some articles, as the payments were made and his benefit received after 5 April 1991.  If the payments to him are not in order from a tax point of view, then between tax, interest and penalties, having regard to the 24 per cent surcharge, total liability to the State could amount to as much as £300,000 or £400,000.</P>
    <P>There are other features of the case.  The <Col N="469" /> extension to the former Minister's home did not receive planning permission from the local authority, of which he was then a member.  The payments to the Deputy were put under false headings as straightforward payments, which contained no suggestion that they were an advance loan or credit facility.  Why?  Who was the beneficiary of this concealment in the accounts?  Dunnes Stores, the Deputy or both? The Deputy must at least have known whether the payments to him would show up clearly in Dunnes' accounts.  The Revenue Commissioners have good reason to be suspicious of false entry accounting.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the Minister to explain simply, quickly and publicly how major works to his home were paid for, and on what basis.  The Minister talks about his responsibility to his employees and the need not to involve Dunnes Stores in political controversy.  That may be fair but the first duty of any Minister is to the public whom he has been appointed to serve.  The public are entitled to an explanation for the unusual character of these arrangements, which, as the Minister for Social Welfare said look awful.  If he wants to serve in public office again, he should provide those explanations in full sooner rather than later.  A Minister's obligations do not cease just because he has resigned.  Resignation is not an excuse for going to ground and hoping that the public lose interest.  That would be a travesty of accountability.  The public are entitled to know the full reasons for his resignation, and why the facts of the case were incompatible with his remaining in office.  It is not a question, as the Taoiseach has suggested, of privately satisfying other authorities.  Deputy Lowry has a duty to satisfy Dáil Éireann, the supreme authority in the land and the one to which he remains answerable.</P>
    <P>There have been references to other payments by Dunnes Stores.  The character of these payments might well throw light on and put into perspective the payments made to Deputy Lowry. There may have been a pattern, which it would be relevant to examine.  It is in the public interest that the full Price Waterhouse report be made available.  We cannot have a dark cloud hanging over our public life.  The management of Dunnes Stores should, in the public interest, publish the report, so that all the individuals concerned can provide the required explanations.  I would hope there would be unanimity in the Dáil in that matter.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that a former prominent member of my party who served in Government may have received, directly or indirectly, financial payments from Dunnes Stores.  If that has any substance, the same approach is required.  Financial gifts have to be declared for capital acquisitions tax purposes, if they exceed the threshold.  In principle, apart from token presentations in respect of functions <Col N="470" /> performed at home and abroad, neither politicians nor officials should accept personal gifts of value from outside their family.  However, as I have said over the past few days, campaign contributions or contributions for political expenses are of course in a different category. Any other situation is open to misinterpretation.</P>
      <P>We should accept that we have all been much too lax about this in the past, and my party, along with other parties, shares some blame for not doing more about it sooner.  Some journalists have campaigned for a long time on this, which I acknowledge.  They too have an obligation to display greater transparency and to observe the same high ethical standards that they demand of others.</P>
      <P>There is no valid comparison between this affair and other controversies of the past few years.  The beef tribunal found no evidence of any political favouritism or lack of integrity on the part of any Government member.  The files on the passport for sale scheme involving the Masri family contained no evidence of impropriety. Fine Gael demanded a committee of inquiry on that occasion.  Perhaps they will agree to set up one now.  The Arcon controversy was about ministerial oversight of a small shareholding worth a few hundred pounds, with no evidence of improper influences.  We must be extremely careful in this House about demanding resignations the moment any controversy arises, otherwise it would be a simple matter to orchestrate or to manipulate the resignation of any Minister.</P>
      <P>At the same time, under the rules of natural justice, Ministers and Deputies must be given an adequate opportunity of putting forward their defences and of vindicating their reputations.  We cannot allow political lynchings or mob justice, or to have Ministers sink beneath the waves of media hysteria and feeding frenzy.  This is why I have always been slow to call for ministerial resignations before Ministers have had any chance to defend themselves.  None of my colleagues called for resignations until Deputy Lowry had the opportunity to which he was entitled to gather his affairs and make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political contributions are perfectly legitimate. The law was to have been tightened up with a threshold for declarations by political parties.  My party was not responsible for delaying that legislation but we will all have to deal with it now. Gifts of any substantial character have to be declared under the ethics in Government legislation because of a legitimate concern that substantial undeclared gifts could have a hidden influence on political or other types of decision-making. It is well accepted that public officials, whether elected or otherwise, with responsibility for planning matters should not accept gifts that could be, or could be construed as, bribes.  During the year I raised with the Taoiseach and Tánaiste the fact that every Member should understand current legislation in this matter.  Many Members <Col N="471" /> on all sides of the House still do not understand what is already in law.  People do not understand their obligations.  One would need an accountant and lawyer to understand the booklet on this subject but there must be a way to explain the law clearly.</P>
    <P>We cannot apply new legislation retrospectively, but the authorities have a right to insist that all laws in force at the time have been respected, and, where this has not been the case, the appropriate tax or other penalties applied. Where payments have on both sides been legitimately given and received, in the legal and tax sense, it would still be important that they be put in their overall context, allowing people to be satisfied that they were purely <i>ex gratia</i> and not connected, either before or after, to any particular decisions.  It is precisely because that may not always be easy to do that we are in the process of establishing a much tighter regime.</P>
    <P>Politics and participation in public life is a career of public service.  It is not an avenue of enrichment or lifestyle enhancement from private donors, even where they only want to help people perform in a particular manner.  My party and my Front Bench are determined that financial scrupulousness will be strictly observed by all our elected members without fear or favour.  Anyone who abuses their position or knowingly flouts the rules will go.  The political fabric of our democracy is precious.  The public are entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, their officials, and above all of Ministers.  They need to know that they are under financial obligations to nobody, other than public lending institutions, except to the extent that they are publicly declared.  New strict standards must apply.  We must draw a line under bad habits that may have grown up over the last 30 years, and return to the ethos and public spirit that prevailed under the founders of this State, Eamon de Valera and W.T. Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity for a broader reshuffle, given the less than adequate performance of some of his Ministers.  This Government has been shaken by controversy.  Their competence has been open to question.  Two Ministers and a Minister of State have had to resign.  Question marks remain over at least one other member of the Government, who is due to be in court again over matters that have to be cleared up.  As some commentators have suggested, a general election should be brought forward.  What we need is not a new Minister but a new Government.</P>

      <P>This debate is nominally about the appointment of Deputy Alan Dukes to the post of Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I wish him well.  He is one of the most able and experienced Deputies in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reality this debate is on the remarkable <Col N="472" /> resignation of Deputy Michael Lowry as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  It is remarkable because it is the first time a Minister has resigned and we do not as yet know why. Yesterday and today the Taoiseach put forward the reason of time pressure.  Deputy Lowry had not had enough time to come up with an explanation.  What do we know?  Last Friday, 29 November, the <i>Irish Independent</i> published details of the dealings with Deputy Lowry and Dunnes Stores.  It was not idle speculation. Comprehensive details were published.  Most people inside and outside this House who read the article were shocked.</P>
    <P>What was even more shocking to most people was the manner in which the Taoiseach sought to deal with the issue, not just last Friday but today. There has been no expression of concern or regret.  Not an eyebrow was raised about what happened.  Last Friday the Taoiseach said it only merits a cursory glance.  If the leader of any party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Five or six hours after the newspaper was published all the Taoiseach could tell us at lunchtime &mdash; I am sure he had been made aware of it early that day &mdash; was that he had only an opportunity to take a cursory glance at the article.  This speaks volumes for the concern he expressed.  He went on to say that he had only a brief conversation with the former Minister.  I imagine that the leader of any party on seeing such an article would read it carefully, speak to his or her advisers and close allies about it and have a thorough conversation with the Minister concerned before lunchtime.  I accept, however, that the Taoiseach was caught on the doorstep but he may have known this would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is more disturbing is that the Taoiseach then said: &ldquo;I have no doubt that Michael will be studying the matter and if any comments or explanations are necessary, he will be providing those&rdquo;.  He did not believe that an explanation might be necessary and went on to draw a distinction &mdash; not a legal one &mdash; between what happens before and after somebody assumes ministerial office.  Ministers have greater <Col N="473" /> responsibilities but suitability for ministerial office depends on his or her behaviour, not just as a Deputy in Opposition but before election to this House.  That is the reason different standards cannot be applied to Deputies and Ministers.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about the law.  If somebody was to offer me £100,000 tomorrow, it would not be illegal for me to accept it provided I paid the right taxes but would it be right for me to accept it?</P>
    <P>Five days after the article was published and brought to our attention there has been no explanation and nobody has said anything about wrongdoing.  On the contrary, the former Minister told us that he did nothing wrong, that he acted properly and with integrity.  He said that he resigned in the interests of his company, his family and the company with which he did business.  He said nothing about the public interest, the public's right to know, and the interests of his colleagues in politics.  He made the extraordinary comment: &ldquo;To fully and satisfactorily answer in the public arena all the questions which have been raised would involve the disclosure to competitors of information which would place my company at a serious disadvantage in what is a very competitive market&rdquo;.  I do not accept that.  Neither do I accept, as the Taoiseach said, that we have no right to ask Deputy Lowry questions and that we should give him time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say we have no right to ask him questions, I said he is entitled to time. Again, the Deputy is distorting what I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Taoiseach who said: &ldquo;Deputies will refrain from demanding the answers that Deputy Lowry has already said he is not yet in a position to give&rdquo;.  I do not accept that; we have a right to ask questions.</P>
      <P>As we cannot ask Deputy Lowry questions, as he is no longer a Minister, will the Taoiseach answer the following questions?  Did Dunnes Stores pay over £208,000 towards the cost of renovating Deputy Lowry's house?  The answer is either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Were the details of this transaction fully reported to the Revenue Commissioners?  Again, the answer is either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that Mr. Ben Dunne did not make representations to influence any of the decisions made by Deputy Lowry as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that Mr. Dunne did not derive any financial benefit from any of the decisions made by Deputy Lowry in his capacity as Minister?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that Mr. Dunne was and is not a shareholder of any company, either onshore or offshore, which benefited from any of the decisions made by Deputy Lowry and the Department?  Did Price Waterhouse contact Deputy Lowry when conducting its investigations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> On 17 October 1995 when I asked the Taoiseach if he believed it was appropriate that a Minister should appoint to a State board somebody with whom his company had serious commercial dealings &mdash; I had in mind the appointment of a close associate of Mr. Dunne to the board of the ESB by Deputy Lowry &mdash; he said in response: &ldquo;On my appointment as Taoiseach I took the unprecedented step of requesting all Ministers, Ministers of State and the Attorney General upon their assuming office to furnish me with declarations of their financial interests.  I obtained information on a scale unheard of before and I have kept a record of what I was told&rdquo;.  In view of this, did the incoming Minister make him aware of all aspects of his relationship with Dunnes Stores?  Was he aware that Deputy Lowry continued to hold a loan from Dunnes Stores after his appointment?</P>
    <P>It is important, in the public interest, that all these questions are answered fully.  I agree equally that the Taoiseach should publish the record he kept of what Deputy Lowry told him on assuming office.</P>
    <P>When questioned yesterday about why the former Minister resigned the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;In fairness to himself, in fairness to those who work in his business and in fairness to those who work with his business he is entitled to take time to provide explanations&rdquo;.  In fairness to those involved in politics he should provide an explanation given that there has been a crisis of confidence in the political system for a considerable length of time.  In my experience, the vast majority who serve the public either in this House or at local authority level are honourable people.  We will do their contribution a disservice and diminish our role if we fail to seek explanations and answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>Recently we got what was described as accountability without responsibility, there was no resignation.  In this instance, we got a resignation without accountability.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Government has suggested that an inquiry should be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners but their findings cannot be made public.  On taking office they swear an oath that they will deal with taxpayers on a confidential basis.  The only information that can be published is the name of a defaulter.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, the Government should seek the permission of the High Court to appoint an inspector to Dunnes Stores and Streamline Trading.  It is not just in the interest of the public but of all those involved in politics that no stone is left unturned in discovering the facts of this case.  It is not good enough to buy time in the hope the matter will fade from public memory.  It is not good enough for a Minister to resign without giving a reason. If nothing wrong was done, nobody should resign. One should not resign because of embarrassment or a perception.  The Taoiseach can sigh but that is a fact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> It is not good enough to say that Deputy Lowry will co-operate with the Revenue Commissioners. If the Government wants to ensure that the public is not denied its right to know, it should seek the appointment of an inspector under the Companies Act.  This would not cost the taxpayer anything as the companies in question would be required under section 13 of that Act to foot the cost.</P>
    <P>Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 August 1994 Garret FitzGerald said: &ldquo;If the electorate comes to lose faith in all politicians because they attribute to all the deficiencies of a few, the maintenance of standards in politics will quickly become impossible&rdquo;.  I agree.  On 30 October the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;The credibility of politics is far more important than the fate of any Government&rdquo;.  What we are talking about is confidence in our political institutions.</P>
    <P>I wish that our defamation laws were such that the Price Waterhouse report could be published because there is now rumour and innuendo about other public persons.  For as long as they exist everybody in politics will be tarnished by them. On bar stools throughout the country people are saying: &ldquo;they are all the same&rdquo;.  They are not.  The vast majority of Members earn no more than their income.  We will do politicians and their profession a great disservice if, for whatever reason, we do not go out of our way to ensure the truth comes out in this matter.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the human or personal tragedy.  I do not wish anyone any harm. Contrary to what has been suggested, we did not ask for anybody's resignation.  Before we made a statement our spokesperson, Deputy Molloy, made contact with Deputy Lowry.  All we are asking for is answers to questions.  All we seek are simple explanations.  There are clear answers to the questions I posed earlier and if we do not get them, the Government may yet be involved in this matter because decisions were made by Deputy Lowry on its behalf.  That is why it is important the Government ensures all the questions I raised are answered.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that on the day of Deputy Dukes's appointment we must raise such questions. However, it is not enough just to have a resignation or for the Taoiseach to quote the law. This is about much more than the law &mdash; it is about standards in public, the integrity of the political system and ethics in public office. Legislation does not make dishonest people honest.  For as long as we can, we must use every measure at our disposal to ensure the truth comes out.  That is how we will best serve politics.</P>
    <P>I hope whoever responds on behalf of the Government will be in a position to respond positively to the questions I raised and, in particular, to say whether the Government is prepared to appoint an inspector to Dunnes Stores and Streamline Enterprises under the 1990 Companies Act to ensure everything was above board.  For somebody to have had £208,000 to <Col N="476" /> spend on their house, it would have involved a company with a turnover of approximately £750,000 after tax, VAT and, presumably, costs associated with making a profit.  It is a because of that it matters.  Even if it were a smaller sum of money, the principle is the same.</P>
    <P>We must ask questions.  If it was a legitimate deal, why was it falsified in the accounts of Dunnes Stores?  We will not get the answer to these questions from a secret Revenue inquiry. The public is entitled to more, in particular from a Taoiseach who promised that his Government would be open, transparent and accountable and would be run as if behind a pane of glass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Occasions like this are always difficult for both Government and Opposition.  Our purpose today is to nominate a new member of Government and to mark the departure of a colleague.  In many ways, it is also an occasion in which the Opposition must be free to criticise and to challenge confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>I would like to think, however, that at least as far as the two people at the heart of this debate are concerned, it will be free of personal rancour or political opportunism.  It is appropriate that the Opposition should seek a full accounting for the way in which the Government has handled a difficult situation and that the Government should be held to such account.  The elevation of one person at the cost of the downfall of another is never an occasion of unalloyed celebration.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have no hesitation in adding my support for the words spoken by the Taoiseach in respect of Deputy Dukes.  He is a person of immense ability and experience in politics who will once again make an outstanding Minister, as he did in the past.  Over many years I worked with him in different capacities.  We have even crossed political swords once or twice in the course of our different roles but I never lost my respect for his commitment, ability and dedication to excellence.  In recent times I worked closely with him in his role as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and valued his insights and always telling contributions to that committee.  I congratulate him on his appointment and look forward to working closely with him for the next year and, indeed, after next November's general election when the Government will be returned to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is evident from the debate so far, this is also an occasion of personal sadness.  Deputy Lowry was an excellent colleague in Government.  I do not believe any Member can take pleasure in his resignation.  He was a dedicated and energetic Minister and the reforms he sought to introduce were to the benefit of the State companies under his authority.  What we can take pleasure in is the fact that Deputy Lowry behaved impeccably when questions were raised about his business dealings.  Because he needed time and opportunity to answer the questions and because <Col N="477" /> he knew his position would undermine the Government he helped to establish, he offered his resignation without equivocation or bluster.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry owes it to himself &mdash; I believe he knows this &mdash; to offer answers in a way that people can fully understand and appreciate.  I welcome his public commitment to co-operate fully with the Revenue Commissioners and any other relevant public authorities which have inquiries to make about the transactions involved. I urge him also to recognise, as I am sure he does, that the people who elected him to Dáil Éireann will feel entitled to answers.  I have no difficulty in accepting Deputy Lowry's assertion of integrity and propriety &mdash; indeed, I believe he has established a high level of personal integrity by the way he reacted last weekend.  However, I know he will feel that a cloud will hang over the his head until this matter is cleared up.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the shrill demands of some on the Opposition benches, and some commentators, that Deputy Lowry should in some way have a sanction imposed on him by the Government until he satisfies all their vengeful instincts.  Even if such a thing was possible, I would say to the House that if a Minister honourably and voluntarily resigns and asks for time to get his affairs in order, then it should accept that he has already paid a heavy price.</P>
    <P>Of course, these transactions need to satisfy the law and be seen to do so.  Deputy Lowry is not above the law any more than any other citizen. People are entitled to ask questions about transactions which are highly unusual to most of us.  In the absence of information, people will not be able to resist drawing conclusions although I hope such conclusions would avoid damning the character of any individual without evidence.</P>
    <P>It is not, and cannot be, the political responsibility of the Government to force Deputy Lowry to lay bare all his private dealings for the delectation of some on the Opposition benches, and some commentators.  Now that he is no longer a member of Government, those transactions are in the first place a matter between him and the relevant State authorities. Ultimately, he will face the judgment of his electors, as we all must.  I believe, as I already said, he knows they are entitled to answers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the way in which the Taoiseach handled this matter.  It has been a personally difficult few days for him, but I strongly believe that any fair-minded observer accepts the Taoiseach has behaved appropriately and with the interests of the community first and foremost at heart.  There will be those who will be hoping that this incident will weaken the Government in some way but I assure the House, it will not.  This Government will go on until its due time.  The honourable and open way in which this matter has been dealt with will make the Government stronger, not weaker, more cohesive, not less.  We will continue to apply the highest standards we can and we will not be <Col N="478" /> found wanting when difficult decisions have to be taken.</P>
    <P>This has been a Government which has combined the best analysis of the three parties in it to tackle a range of challenges.  Anyone who wishes to compare the social and economic trends of the 1989-92 period with those of the past four years will realise that we have turned the direction of the country around.  We intend to continue to shape the direction of the country for a long time yet.</P>
    <P>When we face the people, it is my hope that this Government takes on the mé féiners in the Progressive Democrats and the lads in Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have created nearly 500 remedial and career guidance posts because we know that educational disadvantage can happen in any family, irrespective of income.</P>

    <P>There are now, for the first time in our history, <Col N="479" /> 1,800 children in State-run pre-schools helping to break through the cycle of disadvantage and neglect.

In the biggest psychological breakthrough of all, it is possible for every family to consider, in some cases for the first time in their family's history, the possibility of third level education without the stress of thousands of pounds in fees.</P>
    <P>Next week, when the Book of Estimates is published, it will be clear that once again this Government has been able to produce the type of performance on public spending which the Progressive Democrats, with their short and miserable track record, can only dream about. Side by side with that, we have been able to make further progress across a wide range of areas, from legal aid to foreign aid, from county roads to more investment in education at every level. Through prudent management, we have been able to ensure that next year's budget will represent further significant progress for taxpayers, especially those on modest incomes. There will be scope too to ensure that all those who depend on the State for protection and quality of life will not be let down.  Side by side with the work of economic management and social development and investment, we will continue to work night and day to seek to restore peace and stability to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Mr. Tully dealt with the Deputy on the issues a long time ago.  It is often said that the man who never made anything never made a mistake.  It is inevitable that in a Government that is meeting, and overcoming, huge challenges and that is carrying a huge burden of work, there will be mistakes from time to time.  The difference is, of course, that when mistakes are made, they are admitted and we set about rectifying them.  That <Col N="480" /> is an approach that makes at least some of those on the Opposition benches deeply uncomfortable, but they will have to get used to it.  This Government has made a very good start. We have a huge amount of work to do and we intend to get on with it.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Dukes on his return to Government.  I hope my congratulations to him bring him better luck than on the last occasion I congratulated him in this House, early in his term of office as leader of the Fine Gael Party.  I said then that he was doing a service to the people and that, despite what the pundits were saying about him, he would be rewarded.  A few years later, however, he was turfed out.  I am glad Deputy Dukes is returning to the Government. As the Tánaiste said, an occasion such as this is difficult for Members on all sides of the House. There is always the danger in politics that people will go overboard, but the issue is never so serious as when someone has to resign or is turfed out of Government.</P>
      <P>A number of issues of recent days deserve to be raised and my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, raised some of them.  Government scriptwriters will have to change some of the words in the word processor because, as is evident from the Tánaiste's speech, he found it difficult to read some terms such as &ldquo;the chancers in Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  Such terms have created much of the difficulty of the past ten years or so.  A culture has developed over a long period of time whereby parties, politicians and a large segment of the media get away from analysing issues and policies and at election time the trend has been to hurl insults at Fianna Fáil.  Perhaps by actions of mine some years ago I contributed to that, and I readily admit it, but the raising of such issues in the past &mdash; I am not the only Member on this side of the House who contributed to that trend &mdash; has done us all a disservice and diminished politics.  The practice of politicians commenting about each other, with media people feeding on innuendo and rumour, has demeaned the profession of politics in the past ten or 15 years.  It would be much better to concentrate on the issues that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that the first Minister who has had to resign on an issue such as this is a member of the Fine Gael Party.  The attitude of the Taoiseach last Friday when he was confronted on this issue did not help the body politic.  He should not have said what he said.  I give him the benefit of the doubt and accept that he meant to do the right thing &mdash; I have no hesitation in saying that &mdash; but it would have been much better if he had admitted that he made a mistake in his comments <Col N="481" /> of last Friday rather than try to justify them. There can be no difference between what a politician does before elevation to ministerial office and after his appointment as Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern raised many tax issues that must be addressed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Deputy Lowry has asked for some time to deal with these matters and he is entitled to that time.  As the Tánaiste said, the people of Tipperary North will be the judges in that regard.  There have been many people in this House in the past 70 years or so who, if all their affairs had been examined, would never have been allowed inside the front gates, let alone to sit in the Chamber.  If any person in the House can hold up his or her hand and say that he or she has never done the slightest incorrect thing, I will be the first to walk out because I do not believe there is such a person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry, as a backbencher, is entitled to time to decide what he wants to do regarding his financial affairs.  If he was a Minister today, I would be the first person to ask questions about company law and tax law and the House would be entitled to an explanation from the Minister. Perhaps a parliamentary inquiry would be set up to inquire into the matter.  However, now that Deputy Lowry has retired to the backbenches he is entitled to time to answer the questions and if at the end of the day he decides not to answer them in public, that is his decision.  If we were to follow any other line, every Member would have to come before the House and lay out his or her financial affairs.</P>
    <P>There is an Ethics in Public Office Act under which Members must declare their interests and the gifts they receive.  Severe sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with the Act.  My colleagues who sat through Committee Stage of that legislation said that many questions were raised with which they were uncomfortable.  The Act which has been in force since early this year relates to activities from 1995.  The Dáil decided that Members should put on the record information relating to their financial affairs and that is open to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I may be accused of referring to the political content of the Front Bench, but the present Fianna Fáil Front Bench is the poorest in the history of the party.  None of its members are wealthy and 99 per cent of the Members of Dáil Éireann live on their salaries and have no other income.  Knowing the financial background of some current and former Deputies, I can say that most of them are considerably less well off having entered this House.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interests of everybody if the relevant sections of the report commissioned by Dunnes Stores, as they pertain to public figures, were made available because there is a cloud hanging over all political parties in this House. Some mechanism will have to be found whereby people's names can be cleared and they can give adequate explanations as to the reason their names appear in the report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> The country is awash with rumours and nobody will be left unscathed unless some mechanism is put in place to clear up this matter.  I ask those who might be in a position to make public this report to do so as a matter of urgency because people are engaging in speculation and counter speculation which is bad for all of us.  The political system has been damaged by the events of the past few days and a number of matters must be addressed in the context of those events.</P>
    <P>The people now in Government supported the idea of reducing the salaries of politicians, contrary to the recommendation of an independent commission.  An ethics Bill has been introduced and we will soon debate legislation on funding political parties, but if we continue to denigrate ourselves in the eyes of the public, people will be entitled to say politicians should not be paid anything.</P>
    <P>Politicians and members of the Government should be paid a realistic salary and the Government should not ignore the recommendation of an independent commission. If members of the Government do not think they are worth those salaries, they can hardly expect the public to think they are entitled to them. Every time a salary increase is proposed we feel obliged to play up to people in the media and denigrate ourselves, even though everybody knows, including the public, that 95 per cent of politicians are skint.</P>
    <P>The result of an inquiry will be that business people will not put themselves forward for election.  Without any disrespect intended, Members will be made up of lawyers, teachers and others in PAYE employment.  There will not be any farmers, shopkeepers or entrepreneurs. Many people in the media may stand for election also but we will not have anybody in this House who has created employment.  I say this with some sadness but business people would be daft to leave themselves open to innuendo and accusations.</P>
    <P>This House has been done a disservice by the events of the past week.  It will take some time for the Irish body politic to recover but we should try to resolve this matter and get on with our business.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  In the recent debate on the motion of confidence in the Government I referred to a certain Labour adviser as the ventriloquist leader of the Labour Party.  It is obvious the puppet was not working properly today because in the Tánaiste's script, to which my colleague Deputy Power took offence, and tore up, there was a reference to a word, chancers, which he saw fit not to read out, perhaps because he thought it unparliamentary.</P>

      <P>Members on this side of the House resent that, regardless of whether it came from the Tánaiste or Mr. Finlay.  It is fortunate that I did not tear up the Tánaiste's &mdash; or Mr. Finlay's &mdash; speech because a portion of it states: &ldquo;Now that he is no longer a member of the Government, those transactions are in the first place a matter between him and the relevant State authorities&rdquo;.  I do not accept that.  The logical extension of that argument is as the Taoiseach said last Friday, that a different standard applies to Ministers than applies to ordinary Deputies.  We on this side of the House do not accept that and the Tánaiste knows that.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach surprised us all when he said these matters were in a different category.  Those of us on this side of the House did not misinterpret the Taoiseach's words because on the 6 o'clock news later that day, Deputy Lowry referred three times to the fact that these matters arose before he became a Minister.  We do not accept that because the highest possible standards must apply regardless of whether the person is a Minister or an ordinary Member of the House.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the disclosure of this report, it is ironic &mdash; and I say this in some defence of Deputy Lowry &mdash; that the full facts of the matters in which he was involved are in the public domain whereas there is a great deal of innuendo and supposition in relation to other people both inside and outside this House.  That is wrong. Whatever powers the Taoiseach has in relation to the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance, they should be used to find out who is implicated in this matter and if there is any proof. We should start by dealing with the hearsay, innuendo and character assassination that is taking place in the corridors of this House and outside it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his appointment but it must be said that it is not long ago since he voted against the Taoiseach.  Deputy Dukes's tenure will be interesting &mdash; although we wish him well &mdash; and some of us would like to be a fly on the wall in the Cabinet room when he has to deal with the Labour Party and Democratic Left, particularly in view of his comments about those parties over the years.</P>
      <P>It astounded us on this side of the House that the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity to reshuffle some of the Ministers who have given a substandard performance in their ministries.  It would have been far better if the Taoiseach had appointed Deputy Owen as Minister for Health and given Deputy Noonan the Justice portfolio. That might have introduced a new light into those two Departments but the way things are going Fine Gael will not have many more people to nominate as Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most able and best performing &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo; Minister is the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has constantly defended the Taoiseach in recent days.  On today's 1 o'clock news, the one and a half Democratic Left representatives on the Cabinet were much more <Col N="484" /> effusive in their comments &mdash; at least to the cameras &mdash; about the Taoiseach than some of his own Ministers.</P>
    <P>While we have some sympathy, from a personal point of view, for Deputy Lowry, he was the person who referred to cosy cartels and sweetheart deals.  He is the one who said he would go through the semi-State bodies like a dose of salts.  It should be remembered that people who push up bars higher and higher eventually have to jump over them.</P>

      <P>A number of excuses were given for the Minister's resignation, and Deputy Harney referred to this also.  A number of Fine Gael backbenchers said Deputy Lowry fell on his sword because he wanted to protect the cohesion of the Government.  Deputy O'Rourke made a good point when she said it was all very well having trust and cohesion but what were people saying?</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry also said he wanted to save Dunnes Stores and his company from the impact revelations might have on his company's competitiveness.  This is not on.  His first obligation, as a Minister or TD, is to Dáil Éireann and the people he represents.</P>
      <P>The issue of drip-drip allegations is putting a cloud over the body politic.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Revenue Commissioners to ensure the full facts are revealed.  The Tánaiste, in his speech earlier, seemed to imply that the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, does not have to come forward at this stage.  The Tánaiste said on Saturday that these issues were unorthodox.  Does he not accept that they are still unorthodox and that we must have the full facts?  It is not just a matter of falling on your sword and saying &ldquo;I did nothing wrong but I am still falling on my sword&rdquo;. We must have all the facts on everyone implicated.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, also said on Saturday that these were extremely serious matters, which they are, and must be brought out into the open.</P>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach about some of the remarks he made not long ago about the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  He said we needed to know not only what happened but when and why it happened and that only a completed inquiry would enable us to achieve that.  He went on to emphasise the commitment of the Government to make information available.  This House wants the information made available.  I refer not only to Deputy Lowry but to all the issues relating to the Price Waterhouse report.  We have the mechanism which was well tested in regard to the sub-committee investigating the breakdown of the previous Government.  It worked well but we need a compellability of witnesses Bill.  I appeal to the Taoiseach in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, someone referred to this Government as boring but they could hardly be called that <Col N="485" /> after the last number of months.  We have had many special debates.  It reminds me of what Deputy De Rossa said in 1994, that we needed a Government which did not go from crisis to crisis and scandal to scandal.  If ever a Government did so this is it.</P>

      <P>I support the motion that Deputy Dukes be nominated for appointment as a member of the Government.  Deputy Dukes is an exceptionally experienced Member of the Dáil, having been a Member since 1981 and having held ministerial office in three demanding Government Departments: Agriculture, Finance and Justice.  The experience he has built up will be invaluable to him in tackling the issues he will face as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and this experience will be a considerable asset around the Cabinet table in the collective approach of the Government to the various issues which must be dealt with over the next year.</P>
      <P>Transport, Energy and Communications is a demanding portfolio.  Deputy Dukes will have responsibility not just for key policy decisions in regard to transport, energy and communications but will also oversee ten commercial semi-State companies which, between them, employ almost 60,000 people and which have a turnover of around £4 billion.  These include some of the largest and most important enterprises in the country &mdash; like the ESB, Bord na Móna and Aer Lingus &mdash; which contributed so much to making modern Ireland.  Public enterprise has made an immeasurable contribution to the social and economic development of this country over six decades, and will have an equally important role to play in the decades to come.</P>
      <P>The importance of these companies was recognised in the programme, A Government of Renewal which committed this Administration to revitalising public enterprise and which guaranteed that State assets will not be sold except where it protects employment and is in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its shareholders.  However, as the programme for Government noted, &ldquo;...the twin drivers of technological change and EU competition rules ...&rdquo;, are radically altering the environment in which these companies operate and, to survive and prosper, they must change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much change has been effected in this area under the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, with major restructuring agreed for vital companies such as the ESB, Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus.  Much more remains to be done and in <Col N="486" /> this Deputy Dukes faces a formidable challenge. He can be certain of my full co-operation and that of my Democratic Left colleagues in implementing the commitments in the programme for Government in the area for which he now has responsibility.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy Dukes well in his new ministerial appointment but I share the sentiment he expressed when he wished the appointment had come about in different circumstances.  In all my dealings with Deputy Lowry as a member of the Government over the past two years, I have always found him to be an honourable and efficient Minister committed to the work of his Department and to the implementation of the programme of the three party Government.  His contributions at the Cabinet table were valued by us all and he still has much to contribute to politics and to public life.  The developments of the past few days must have been traumatic for him, his family and his party and constituency colleagues but, in his response to these developments, Deputy Lowry acted with propriety and dignity and in the interests of good government.  That is not in any way to minimise the issues raised in the <i>Irish Independent</i> article or to ignore the questions which remain to be answered.</P>
    <P>In his statement of resignation on Saturday night, Deputy Lowry said categorically that there was no impropriety on his part in respect of any payments for work carried out on his house.  He made two further important points: that it was not possible to fulfil his commitments to the Department and to the Government and, at the same time deal adequately with the issues which had been raised, and that to fully and satisfactorily answer in the public arena all the questions which have been raised would involve the disclosure to competitors of information which would place his company at a serious disadvantage in a competitive market.  I have no doubt that Deputy Lowry will take the time and find the mechanism, consistent with the need to protect the interests of his company, to answer all the questions which have been raised as fully and promptly as is humanly possible.  I want to see Deputy Lowry clear his good name.  His interests and the interests of politics generally will be greatly served by his doing so.</P>
    <P>The public controversy created by the <i>Irish Independent</i> article has once again focused attention on the relationship between business and politics.  It has also focused attention on the relationship between Dunnes Stores and those in various walks of public life.  Further media claims are now being made which, if true, will raise further doubts in the public mind about the interaction of business, politics and the media. The Price Waterhouse report, which was apparently commissioned privately as part of the internal struggle within the Dunne family for control of its company, seems vital in this regard. According to newspaper reports at the weekend, the report lists payments from Dunnes Stores to <Col N="487" /> up to 100 people from various walks of public life, including politics and the media.  At a minimum, this report must be made available to the Revenue Commissioners to assess not just whether Deputy Lowry and the other figures named complied with all tax requirements but also to assess whether Dunnes Stores complied with all its obligations.</P>
    <P>It may also be in the public interest that the report is published in full.  We have claims by people who are reported to have seen the document that other prominent persons have been identified as receiving money from Dunnes Stores.  It has been suggested that a prominent RTÉ broadcaster also received substantial sums from Dunnes Stores.  What is RTÉ doing to investigate this allegation?  It has been claimed that a prominent former Fianna Fáil Minister and his wife received a substantial sum of money.  It is claimed that sums of more than £1 million were paid into bank accounts in Britain, using cover names, during the early 1990s.  It is of critical importance to know if these allegations are true and if the person concerned was a serving Minister at the time.  If so, it has the most serious ramifications.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores is an enormously powerful company, which has often seemed to consider it itself free to ignore the norms of industrial relations and business practice, set its own rules and dictate its own terms.  Many people, not just those on the left or in the trade union movement but also responsible commercial people and independent commentators, have been critical of the business practices of Dunnes Stores.  It is an enormously powerful institution and one of the biggest supermarket and clothing chains in the State with 73 outlets and the ability to make and break supplier companies.  It is tightly controlled by a small group of the Dunne family.  It does not publish accounts but it is estimated that it has a turnover of around £900 million each year generating profits of around £45 million.  Dunnes Stores has faced two major industrial disputes over the past two years arising from its abysmal treatment of its workers.  Its insistence on the recruitment primarily of part-time staff, the use of zero hour contracts, compelling personnel to undertake Sunday work, and the rock bottom wage rates and conditions offered reflect no credit on the company.  Until recently it has refused to recognise or accept the standard industrial relations structures established by the Oireachtas to help prevent, and where necessary, settle industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>On the basis of such information as we have to date it seems probable that Dunnes Stores has as much to learn about good business practice as it has to learn about good industrial relations practice.  Let me illustrate the point.  In June 1995 there was an industrial dispute between Dunnes and its employees.  The issues in dispute were Sunday trading and zero hour contracts.  The core of the dispute, however, was an unwillingness on <Col N="488" /> the part of the company to consult its employees in a reasonable manner about significant changes in work practices.</P>
    <P>This is not just my view.  The judgment of the independent Social Welfare Adjudication Tribunal which considered the case was that &ldquo;the dominant feature of this dispute was the failure of the company to engage reasonably and consistently in discussions or negotiations or to have adequate consultation with the union on the issues&rdquo;.  The tribunal concluded that the employees in question were &ldquo;unreasonably put in a position where, by normal standards of industrial relations practice, they had no reasonable alternative to taking strike action&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputies Mary Harney and Michael McDowell would say &ldquo;So what?  Any employer has the right to play hardball with their employees&rdquo;.  The point is that the unreasonable behaviour of Dunnes cost the taxpayer approximately £600,000 in unemployment payments to the 5,800 persons who found themselves in an industrial dispute through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>The question of possible tax fraud needs to be tackled with the same urgency, commitment and sense of fairness applied to social welfare fraud. I am confident that there are the powers to do this.  Under the provisions of the tax Acts and related fiscal legislation, the Revenue Commissioners can access the salient details in the Price Waterhouse report.  We must ensure that it is done.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners, in their statement of Strategy 1997-99, state that they &ldquo;will pursue non-compliance, be it for failure to furnish returns, failure to furnish correct returns, failure to comply with statutory obligations or outright evasion&rdquo;.  They further add that they &ldquo;aim to maintain public confidence in the equity of Revenue administration by adopting a tough stance on tax evasion and avoidance, the black economy and other illegal activity&rdquo;.  They conclude by stating that they will &ldquo;initiate the prosecution of offenders in cases of serious evasion or fraud&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that there will be links between business, politics and the media, especially since a considerable number of Members of the Oireachtas have a business background.  It is inevitable that business people would want to contribute to political parties or to individual politicians, and there is nothing wrong in principle with that.  The media will want to protect their advertising income from business. However, it is essential that any relationship between business and politics and the media be entirely above board and open to full public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In the political area, some progress has been made in recent years, largely as a result of public concerns generated by a sequence of controversial events during the lifetime of the last two Fianna Fáil-led Governments &mdash; the Greencore affair, the Ballsbridge site story, <Col N="489" /> Carysfort, the Masri/passports for sale episode. Public concern resulted in the introduction of the Ethics in Public Office Act which now obliges ministerial officeholders, Members of the Dáil, senior civil servants, directors and senior executives of semi-State companies, as well as senior political appointees working to Government Ministers to make extensive disclosures in regard to any business or property interests they hold and any gifts, services or loans they receive.  In addition, in the case of officeholders certain disclosures are required in regard to spouses and children.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act is intended to be one part of a twin-track strategy to ensure greater openness and accountability about the financial interests of politicians and political parties.  The second track was to be the 1994 electoral Bill which was to provide for payments from public funds to political parties, to require the disclosure of substantial donations received by political parties and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and impose limits on election expenditure by political parties and candidates during election campaigns.</P>
    <P>When the Bill completed its Second Stage, problems arose regarding the formula set out for providing funds for political parties as a result of the McKenna judgment in the Supreme Court last November.  The issues raised are difficult and complex and the Government has been working to overcome them.  However, this second track needs to be quickly enacted as soon as possible. Exchequer funding for political parties would be acceptable to the public in return for disclosure of private donations to political parties and the sources of their funds.  Most people would prefer that political parties receive open, accountable funding from the State than that they become subject to pressures by powerful boards or media interests contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>The other important dimension to events leading to Deputy Michael Lowry's resignation is that of tax and compliance with all requirements of the tax regime.  I note Deputy Lowry has said that the deal involving Dunnes Stores was legitimate in regard to tax, that this is the professional advice available to him, that he is confident that it will be upheld by the Revenue Commissioners and that he will co-operate in any investigation undertaken by the tax authorities.  I hope Dunnes Stores will adopt a similar approach to co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and that the matter will be clarified beyond doubt as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>However, it does focus attention once again on the whole question of tax evasion and avoidance. Tax evasion is illegal, while tax avoidance is legal, but often ethically questionable, especially as the devices used to legally avoid tax are not normally available to the majority of taxpayers &mdash; the PAYE sector.  In recent months much public and media attention has been focused on the question of abuse of the social welfare system, and especially social welfare fraud.  As a result of <Col N="490" /> improved control measures introduced by my Department, 20,000 people have signed off the live register and a further 11,000 have had their payments suspended pending further investigation.  This has led to projected savings in 1996 and 1997 of £84 million to the taxpayer.  A major advertising campaign is now under way using television, radio and press, stressing that social welfare fraud is an antisocial offence which will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Now is an appropriate time for a similar offensive in regard to tax fraud.  I fully acknowledge the trojan work done by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in recent years in tackling evasion, closing off loopholes and generally ensuring greater compliance.  However, it often seems like a vicious circle.  No sooner does the Government close one loophole than the professional wise boys find another.  There is a need to tackle the social culture which results in some people in the business and professional sectors seeming to regard tax evasion as a sort of national sport.  If it is conceded as illegal at all, it is often viewed with about the same seriousness as parking on double yellow lines.</P>
    <P>If those who abuse the social welfare system are generally on lower income levels, the majority of those who abuse the tax system are wealthy businesses and individuals.  One only needs to look at the most recent report of the Revenue Commissioners to read the list of the pillars of society who were forced to make settlements and pay financial penalties as a result of irregularities in their tax affairs.  More than 500 individuals and companies made payments of more than £10 million.  They include farmers, publicans, wholesalers, retailers, builders, company directors, engineers, property developers and many others.</P>
    <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General comes out each year showing astronomical sums outstanding in uncollected taxes &mdash; almost £2,000 million at the end of May 1996, according to the most recent report.  While it is accepted that much of this is a notional figure based on sums assessed which were never realistically expected to be paid, there are still huge sums that are genuinely owed and that can and must be collected &mdash; more than £552 million according to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>We must build on the work done by the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and a number of his predecessors, including Deputy Ahern, to totally end equivocation in regard to public attitudes to compliance with tax law, to close off remaining loopholes, to bring in all arrears and to ensure the highest possible level of compliance from now on.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have questioned whether this issue will affect the cohesion of the Government.  The answer is no.  This Government will hold together because there is confidence in all three parties that when an issue arises, <Col N="491" /> especially in relation to ethical questions, it will be dealt with promptly, efficiently and without equivocation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, has shown exceptional qualities of leadership, courage and judgment.  He has overseen the successful resolution of various and inevitable political controversies that Governments face, as well as dealing with the ongoing Northern Ireland peace process and fulfilling his duties as President of the European Council.  The EU Presidency has placed an enormous additional burden on him in terms of the time required and travel commitments involved.  The leadership the Taoiseach has shown is widely acknowledged throughout Europe and will be reflected no doubt in a very successful summit in Dublin in ten days' time.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy Dukes well as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and reassure the Opposition parties they will remain in opposition for at least another year and after the next general election for another four to five years.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach delivered a lacklustre and uncertain speech.  Clearly he is deeply wounded and concerned for his Government and seems to be holding his breath in the hope there will not be further repercussions from Deputy Lowry's actions as Minister.  The Taoiseach went out of his way to say the Revenue Commissioners needed no prompting from him to look into the matters surrounding this issue. He referred to the Revenue Commissioners no less than seven times.  This says much for his concern about the issues surrounding Deputy Lowry.  I smiled inwardly when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country there is not now, and never will be, a system of conviction by denunciation. Independent authorities, not rivals, nor those <Col N="492" /> with an axe to grind, make judgments as to culpability.</P>
    <P>I looked at the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs when those words issued and they rang hollow in view of his record on a number of issues in recent years.  It was interesting to contrast the Tanaiste's speech with that of the Taoiseach.  The Tánaiste clearly defined the rainbow Government as the halo that surrounds his own head.  The Taoiseach and the other Members seem to have little to do with the actions of this Government. Everything that has happened here for the past ten years seems to come down to the ingenuity and ability of the Tánaiste.  He balked only at delivering the now familiar poisonous words of his guru, Mr. Finlay, when he could not get the words out of his mouth to refer to my colleagues and my party as chancers.  I reject what the Tánaiste said.  If any Member has been responsible in recent years for denigrating politicians and creating the now familiar odour that surrounds all of us, the Tánaiste can take a bow and move centre stage.  Many of the allegations he has made failed to stand up when scrutinised.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Taoiseach when he referred to Deputy Lowry's stewardship in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  I disagree with his assertion that Deputy Lowry achieved much.  In almost ten years in the Oireachtas I have never come across a Minister who has been so personal and even evangelical in his attacks on individuals in semi-State companies.  He demeaned the opportunities that occurred within his office to lead the State sector in a new direction by his vilification of individuals and the grounds on which he laid his attacks have become his own circumstances.  I take no pleasure in saying such things and I wish him and his family no ill but I reject the Taoiseach's notion of that Minister's stewardship. He was wrong and ill judged on the way he led the Department.  In that context the appointment of Deputy Dukes is a bonus, albeit in sad circumstances for Deputy Lowry, and it will give a new breath of life to the semi-State sector.  I hope it will lift morale which had been low during Deputy Lowry's stewardship.  His vision and style will restore much needed confidence in those companies.</P>
    <P>Within the State sector he referred to the cosy cartels which failed to be proved.  How hollow those words were.  As vice chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies I have been in argument, debate and discussion with Deputy Lowry on many occasions during his tenure of office over the past two years.  If he had concentrated on a future vision for the semi-State sector and had led by example, rather than by vilification of individuals, the semi-State sector would be in a stronger and more robust position.  He liked to use the correct buzz words such as &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;break down of markets&rdquo;, &ldquo;end to monopolies&rdquo; and so on, but there was little evidence in his stewardship that <Col N="493" /> they were at the core of the new philosophy he wanted to bring to bear.  With his colleagues he was a master of leaks and innuendo to bolster his cases.  He used the media in a way that no other Minister had done in recent years.  All of those matters have coloured his tenure in office and his stay as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I welcome the appointment of Deputy Dukes and I hope it will bring a new vision to the leadership that is so badly required within the State sector.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Taoiseach referred to the position of the Attorney General and this raises some questions.  That the Taoiseach has put it on the record indicates he has some concerns about the position of the Attorney General with regard to a conflict of interest in this matter.  Will the Taoiseach outline what arrangements he has made in the event of the matter becoming so serious as to give rise to a conflict of interest for the Attorney General?  Steps should be taken in the short term to ensure there is a smooth transition to whatever individual may have to deal with the matters on behalf of the Government.  It is not enough for the Taoiseach to refer to the matter and to assure the House there is no difficulty &ldquo;to date&rdquo;.  The Government should be ready and the Taoiseach should outline the alternative arrangements.</P>
    <P>The issues that have caused serious consternation to the Government in recent weeks, months and indeed in the past year show the Taoiseach's failure to deal with Ministers who clearly are not capable of dealing with some of the portfolios assigned to them.  I am disappointed he has not availed of the opportunity, with the appointment of Deputy Dukes, to have a wide ranging reshuffle of Members within the Cabinet.  He would have done more justice to the present position and to the recent controversies had he the courage to move the Minister for Justice and to deal with the other matters that have arisen during the past six or seven months.</P>
    <P>I reject and resent very much the tone of the Tánaiste's contribution.  It was typical of him and his now infamous script writer, Mr. Finlay, that he would try to malign the Fianna Fáil Party in defence of his position.  If anybody came close to giving an impression as to how long the Government might last it was the Tánaiste in setting out what can only be described as the closest thing to an election platform when he ignored the issues surrounding Deputy Lowry's resignation and the appointment of Deputy Dukes in his place.</P>

      <P>Despite his appalling record as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I sympathise on a personal level with Deputy Lowry.  He represents a neighbouring consitituency to my own and I am aware of the trauma he and his family must be going through.  However, this country will not be the poorer for his leaving office.  I congratulate <Col N="494" /> Deputy Dukes on his appointment.  Why he chose to join this ramshackle collection of blunderers I will never know but such are the mysteries of politics.  He has apparently accepted the poisoned chalice and I wish him well.  He can only improve the Government in view of the performance of some of the personnel who have remained in office.</P>
      <P>I deplore the shabby and self-serving manner in which the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, has dealt with this matter.  His first reaction when he appeared on television last Friday night was to say he had only cursorily glanced at the story and therefore was not in a position to say much about it.  The lie was given to that by the Taoiseach himself when he said today: &ldquo;For my own part, I knew nothing about the matters alleged in the <i>Irish Independent</i> story of 29 November until a few hours before its publication&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach, who did not wish to voice a detailed reaction on Friday afternoon because he had only cursorily glanced at the <i>Irish Independent</i>, has admitted that he knew the facts of the case hours before that newspaper hit the streets.</P>

      <P>I also resent the attempt by the Taoiseach last Friday to imply that the consequences of this unusual deal, to put it at its mildest, would be different if these events had occurred after Deputy Lowry became a Minister. In other words, the Taoiseach expects us to accept the following principle: if somebody, whether he be a private citizen or backbencher, does something today that would make it untenable for him to occupy office as a Minister, and if he gets away with it, and if he is appointed a Minister in six months' time and the matter is discovered, it is all right because he did not do it while he was a Minister.</P>

      <P>I heard him and he was his usual convincing self.</P>
      <P>In a democracy ministerial resignations are usually accompanied by a personal statement by the Minister explaining why he resigned.  The Tánaiste told the House today that the Government cannot force Deputy Lowry to lay out his personal affairs for the delectation of Members of the Opposition.  I do not have the slightest interest in Deputy Lowry's personal affairs but rarely has a ministerial resignation in the history of the State taken place in more serious circumstances.  In order to restore the integrity of the political process it is important that Deputy Lowry makes as full a statement as possible at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry said the deal in question was &ldquo;an entirely legitimate and normal commercial agreement that would satisfy any accountant&rdquo;.  If that is the position, Deputy Lowry has the unique distinction of being the first Minister in the history of the State to resign for no reason.  If the transaction was legitimate, why resign?  He said he did not want to embroil Dunnes Stores in a political issue. How does explaining a legitimate arrangement between supplier and customer and the handling of its tax implications embroil Dunnes Stores in a political issue?  The Minister also wishes to protect the employees of Streamline Enterprises Limited.  I accept that. However, surely by resigning Deputy Lowry is giving the impression of guilt.  At a minimum, he is saying he cannot give a reasonable explanation within a reasonable time.  How does that help the employees of his company?  Would it not be better for the employees if he gave an answer now and showed there was nothing to hide?</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss this legitimate deal that would &ldquo;satisfy any accountant&rdquo;.  We have heard various versions of what was involved in the deal.  Last Friday, Deputy Lowry's spin doctors told us it was a contra deal.  On Saturday we were told it was not a contra deal in the normal sense of the word but a particular type of contra deal.  It was a contra deal in which goods and services were supplied by Streamline Enterprises to Dunnes Stores as a result of which the latter owed the former money and the transaction in question was a loan which would be repaid when the money was ultimately paid out.  This gave rise to an obvious question.  If Dunnes Stores owed money to Streamline Enterprises Limited, how did the loan that was given against the debt find its way into Deputy Lowry's pocket?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that question was asked a new twist was given to the story yesterday by &ldquo;sources close to&rdquo; Deputy Lowry.  We were told it would be argued that the money was a loan against money owed directly to Deputy Lowry, not his company, for <Col N="496" /> his services as a consultant.  The story changes with each day to accommodate the latest questions about it.  That is why Deputy Lowry should, at the earliest opportunity, lay out the facts before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry could answer a number of obvious questions which do not require six months in conclave with his accountants.  In addition to the questions Deputy Harney asked with regard to income tax and corporation tax, I wish to ask Deputy Lowry a number of questions. First, if this was a loan against moneys owed to Streamline Enterprises Limited, why did it go directly to Deputy Lowry or for his benefit? Second, how is the loan treated in the accounts of Streamline Enterprises Limited?  Third, if the money was paid initially to Streamline Enterprises Limited and then lent to Deputy Lowry, was section 31 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990 complied with?  If this money was lent to Deputy Lowry by his company, was section 98 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 complied with and advance corporation tax paid?  Streamline Enterprises Limited is a close company under the relevant definition in the Corporation Tax Act.</P>
    <P>If the money was earned by Streamline Enterprises Limited, would it not be <i>ultra vires</i> and contrary to company law to allow Deputy Lowry to get the benefit of that money for himself?  With regard to the latest explanation offered, and the one most likely to be used if and when Deputy Lowry brings the matter into the public domain, if the money which was lent to personally for services provided by him as a consultant, did he declare it as a benefit in kind? An interest free loan is taxable as a benefit in kind.  If this happened, by what process of logic can Deputy Lowry claim that this was a loan rather than part payment?  After all, the work had been done, the service or goods had been supplied several years ago and this was a payment to Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners would not accept that this money would constitute a loan.  If they did there would be the unusual situation where anybody supplying goods or services to a firm in respect of which they got paid could adopt a transparent and simple tax avoidance mechanism. They could simply leave a nominal amount of what they are owed, let us say £1 out of £1 million, and say the £999,999 is a loan and the matter can be cleared up and tax paid when the last £1 is paid back. That would be a transparent tax avoidance mechanism.  As somebody who has advised people on tax matters from time to time, I doubt that it would be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Did Deputy Lowry draw this to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners and did he get written clearance for it?  Did he declare the interest free loan as a benefit in kind?  If it was in respect of work done by him personally, did he pay tax on that benefit in kind and has he a <Col N="497" /> receipt for it?  The work in respect of which the money was paid was carried out many years ago. Why has it taken so long to bring matters to finality and settle a final payment?  I do not have the time or opportunity to go into the VAT implications in respect of which Deputy Lowry has many questions to answer.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning, will Deputy Lowry state &mdash; which does not require a great deal of research or consultation with his financial advisers &mdash; whether his architect consulted the planning section of North Tipperary County Council to ascertain whether his interpretation of the Planning Acts, which I view as rather peculiar, is correct and that, therefore, he did not need planning permission?  According to reports from North Tipperary County Council, it heard nothing about it.  Therefore, the answer to that question obviously is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Deputy Lowry's total reliance on his architect in relation to the building of this Taj Mahal extension is inexplicable.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with Deputy Lowry on a personal level I do not regret his departure from Government.  In so far as anything favourable can be said about it, the Government will be the better for his departure and the inclusion of Deputy Dukes.</P>
    <P>The average life of a Dáil is approximately three years.  This Government does not have a mandate from the people.  It came to power in unusual circumstances and has continued in power, without a mandate from the people, over two years.  When contributing to the motion of confidence in the Government the Taoiseach said that the Government had the confidence of the people.  Since he will be afforded no better opportunity, I invite him to put that to the test now.</P>

      <P>On the one hand this is a happy occasion and, on the other, a sad one.  First I congratulate my former constituency colleague, Deputy Dukes, on his elevation to ministerial office.  We have served in the same constituency for 15 years during which we have had many very interesting Derbys in all of which, with the exception of one, we were both successful.  I was unsuccessful on one occasion but recovered reasonably well to participate thereafter.  It was <Col N="498" /> always a pleasure to work with him in the Kildare constituency.  Deputy Dukes always showed a willingness to co-operate, to listen, to put up a good performance in the face of any, and there were many, very imposing oppositions.  Alas, on the occasion of the next General Election we shall be seeking seats in different constituencies. I wish him well on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that my elation at his elevation does not arise entirely from the fact that we shall be contesting different constituencies because one always should congratulate and wish colleagues well on improving their position.  I wish him every success and know he will be a very successful Minister.  I am quite certain that his contribution to Government will be strong, reliable and worthwhile.  I am sure that members of the Government and of the Opposition alike readily recognise and accept his contribution and value in the past which no doubt will continue in the future.</P>
      <P>It is always a sad occasion when one speaks following the resignation of a Government Minister and a colleague in Fine Gael.  We can all understand the personal trauma and hurt suffered by anybody in that position.  Indeed, with the exception of the individual concerned, it is impossible for anybody to appreciate the full extent of the hurt felt following on such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I emphasise, as the Taoiseach and other speakers on this side of the House did, that whenever something untoward occurs, in circumstances as set out &mdash; and I emphasise &ldquo;as set out&rdquo;&mdash; without speculating, it must always be followed by a procedure whereby everybody is reassured that all the regulations laid down by law are followed and adhered to.  Deputy Lowry has already indicated quite clearly and unequivocally that it is his intention to ensure that all matters surrounding these circumstances and the issues relating to them are fully clarified and a clear explanation given, which is in Deputy Lowry's interests and those of the House.  He has also rightly indicated that he requires time to prepare to answer the questions raised.</P>
      <P>It is not helpful that anybody should automatically condemn another before an accused person is clearly shown to be in the wrong, a sentiment already expressed by Members on both sides of the House, although they have tended to adopt a peculiar attitude in the manner in which they deal with such events or circumstances.  Whenever somebody is accused of wrongdoing by the media or other commentator until such time as an explanation is furnished or proof obtained, surely that person should be deemed to be innocent or at least entitled to furnish an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the comments I heard and read recently appear to be based on less than a full and fair hearing.  While calls for changes in our libel laws are fine &mdash; and the present position readily accommodates some comments I have heard &mdash; I should hate to anticipate what will <Col N="499" /> happen if and when those laws are changed to provide such accommodation.  That is not to suggest that any excuse should be advanced for a Member of the House or of Government in the event of an impropriety of any kind but particularly in relation to the administration of his or her office, whether as a Deputy or Minister. At the same time we should recognise that, in the heat of the moment, in the nature of debate in this arena, Members may tend to use language not resorted to on another occasion.  Within my period of membership of this House, inside and outside it, I have always endeavoured not to imply something that is not true.  Such imputations seriously damage the credibility of Members, regardless of their party allegiance.</P>
    <P>I have been appalled at the extent to which public speculation can undermine credibility in the entire body politic or democratic system, very often in a manner that irreparably damages or tarnishes the reputation of its target and the organs through which such allegations are channelled.</P>
    <P>Over the period I have worked with the former Minister for Energy, Transport and Communications, Deputy Lowry, I always found him to be direct, hard-hitting, totally honest and <i>au fait</i> with his portfolio.  Therefore, I shall be very surprised if what he has already indicated to us is not accurate.  Why then should there be so much speculation, such an extended painting of a picture much worse than should be the case until the contrary is proven?</P>
    <P>In our own interests Members must look to the future and ask to what extent we should allow ourselves be governed by the opportunity of making a quick kill.  I also emphasise &mdash; already mentioned by a Member of the Opposition &mdash; that whenever allegations of a wrongdoing are levelled at any Minister, regardless of whether they are right or wrong or accompanied by proof, any such Minister has no option but to resign. That is the most serious repercussion I perceive of the events of the past few days.</P>
    <P>People have suggested that nobody from the Opposition benches resigned when in Government.  That may or may not be something about which to boast, dependent on one view but, unless instant answers can be furnished in the event of the kind of allegations levelled over the past few days &mdash; not possible on every occasion &mdash; it is impossible for any Minister implicated to remain in office.  Deputy Lowry took this courageous decision even though it would have been easier to batten down the hatches and brazen it out.  This House is like a goldfish bowl and I hope that those in the vast public arena outside who look at us critically, as they have a right to do, will recognise the sacrifices he has made.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to the Taoiseach's statement about the different obligations on Ministers and Deputies.  As the Deputies opposite know, a Member of Cabinet cannot be directly <Col N="500" /> involved in a company while in office.  This point has been debated in the House on numerous occasions in recent years &mdash; I am sure the Deputies opposite remember one particular occasion with clarity.  The Taoiseach correctly pointed out that it would be a much more serious matter if a Minister was directly involved in a company.  The rules governing this area were introduced long before the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  It was necessary for the Taoiseach to clarify the position.  A Member of the House is subject to the law and it is disingenuous of the Opposition to suggest that the Taoiseach was inferring anything else.  They know the regulations by which we must all abide.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if debates in the House are driven by speculation outside rather than by the collective wisdom of Members on all sides.  With the notable exception of the Ceann Comhairle and some other Deputies, I have been a Member of the House longer than most Deputies.  In recent years I have noticed a change in debates in the House.  It is now common to use the privilege of the House to make allegations which can be used in the courts.  Many court cases take place at the same time as debates in the House, and I am not sure this is a good development.  We are blessed with having Deputies who are also eminent members of the legal profession.  I am not a member of this profession and I often wonder to what extent they believe they are doing a service to themselves and their profession by bringing the business of the courts into the House.  The courts and this House are different arenas and should not be intermingled.  Deputies should not use this House as a platform for enhancing their private professions.</P>
    <P>If an issue is of public importance then the details should be published.  I have no difficulty with the publication of accurate details but I am concerned about the tendency to publish details regardless of whether they are correct or whether someone will be hurt by them.  I do not say this in an acrimonious way but I am concerned about some developments in recent years.  It is very easy in the heat of the moment to make comments about Deputies on the other side of the House which we might regret later.  However, I find it difficult to understand how any of us could write comments which could damage a person's integrity or character.</P>
    <P>Some of the printed comments I have seen recently give rise to concern about the direction in which we are going.  If we go down this road people inside and outside the House will find it difficult to go about their daily business.  It is all very well to have a situation where everything goes &mdash; this will ensure the jollification of the multitudes &mdash; but I am not sure what contribution it will make to society in the long-term.  I sincerely hope that during my time as a public representative I have not maligned anybody's character by remarks made inside or outside the House.  It is with revulsion that I note some of the <Col N="501" /> comments made recently, many of which were made on the airwaves.</P>
    <P>We must look at this issue seriously.  If we decide to go down this road with no holds barred and say what we like, then we should all be involved.  In this way we will all know where we stand.  I am not making allegations about any group or person but this point needs to be made in case we lose the run of ourselves in the mad rush to obtain supposed facts which with the benefit of hindsight may merely turn out to be expedients.  This is something we should avoid.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that a number of Ministers in this Administration had to resign.  They did not have to resign but they did so because issues needed to be dealt with and they had to pay the price.  It is readily agreed and recognised that these issues were minor ones and it is not fair for Members of the Opposition to suggest that these Ministers had to resign.  One could equally suggest that members of other Administrations should also have resigned.  It is to their credit that those Ministers resigned and we should not minimise their sacrifice because that might suggest their character is less than it should be.  It was because of their integrity and character that they took those decisions and they will reap the rewards in the future.  I have no hesitation in saying Deputy Lowry will give a full explanation in time.  He could not do that as Minister of a Department and I am sure Members opposite, who have experience of Government office, accept that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleague from south Kildare, Deputy Dukes, on his appointment.  I look forward to following his progress in Government and reaping the rewards of his ability and thinking.  I also express regret at the loss of another colleague, Deputy Lowry, but I have no doubt he will be back in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>As the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on transport matters, I wish the new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications well, but if I have anything to do with it he will not have too much success.  I subscribe to the view that he is a man of great competence and I will put that to the test in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, must explain the payment issue.  On the &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; programme on Sunday night I pointed out that if there is proven impropriety, the matter must be dealt with firmly and that applies to all parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join my party leader and others in calling for the publication in full of the report by Dunnes Stores.  There is no other way to deal with this matter.  If it is not published now, various stories <Col N="502" /> will be told about the matter for many years to come and the amount of money involved will increase exponentially.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of the House for 15 years and have always taken the view that every Member is entitled to be regarded as honest and honourable until proven otherwise.  There is no other way to proceed.  As many people outside the House regard us with suspicion, it is incumbent on us, when such an opportunity arises, to remind ourselves of the basic rule that there is a presumption of honesty across the board.  However, when a problem arises, it must be dealt with by the House and the Government, if necessary.  Such matters should not be swept under the carpet.</P>
    <P>For the past two years I have had the opportunity to be Deputy Lowry's opposite number and I criticised him trenchantly on policy matters.  Now that he has resigned I do not propose to change my policy in those areas.  I remind the Government of which he was a member of the betrayal of the taxpayer on the Telecom Éireann issue and the scandalous sell off for £183 million of 20 per cent of that company. Despite a recent article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> which took me to task, I reiterate that that 20 per cent is worth at least £400 million and when I have more time I will explain that.</P>
    <P>The Swedes and the Dutch will make a windfall profit.  They will make millions when they sell the 20 per cent this Government gave them.  Deputy Lowry and the Government allowed this to happen even though the taxpayer put approximately £2 billion into that company, which includes Eirecell and Cablelink, over a long period.  The original ten bidders were whittled down to one and the 20 per cent was sold on the cheap and in a panic.  I invite the new Minister, Deputy Dukes, to cancel the deal. While I accept an initial contract has been signed, the sale is not closed.  If he does not examine this deal critically and cancel it, he will rue the day. An objective assessment would show that it is nothing other than a rotten deal for the Irish taxpayer and Telecom Éireann.  I invite the new Minister to take that step.  A total of £5 million was spent on consultancy fees to select a winner in a one horse race.  We are told there will be technological benefits from the two regional players.  I do not know how they could benefit Telecom Éireann from a technology point of view.</P>
    <P>The deal was negotiated in secret and not discussed in the House.  I call again for the contract document selling 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann to be made available to the House.  The House was not given details of the vetoes held by the people coming into the arrangement.  As my time is short I will not dwell on the matter, but I ask the incoming Minister to examine the deal critically.  As it is one of the most scandalous political and financial decisions ever taken, the new Minister would be well advised to cancel it forthwith.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> It is interesting to note the soundings in the past 24 hours from Deputy Dukes that he might consider the underground option in the light rail system.  The Minister opposite, Deputy Howlin, stated earlier that he would await proposals from the Minister and the Cabinet would then make a decision.  I thought the Cabinet had decided to build the city centre part of the light rail system over ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been advising the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, for a long time to carry out an independent assessment, not a CIE handout, of what it would cost to build the light rail system under ground in the city centre.  I am please to note the stirrings of a U-turn from the Government in that regard.  Given the current traffic problems, it would be lunacy to consider giving up half of Stephen's Green and most of Dawson Street and Nassau Street to the light rail system.  The Minister stated earlier that present traffic levels are at the rate projected for five years' time.  The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, told me month after month that he would not consider carrying out an independent study of what it would cost to put the city centre part of the system under ground.</P>
      <P>The former Minister showed a reprehensible attitude to semi-State companies.  I advise the new Minister to take a different tack when dealing with such companies.</P>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, talked about a does of salts, cosy cartels, sweetheart deals and told the companies to stick to their knitting.  He regaled the Dáil with images of semi-State companies rife with corruption.  He ordered consultants' reports.  He upset and annoyed thousands of semi-State workers and their families.  What did those consultants' reports turn up?  Nothing, except a suggestion about the Horgan's Quay site in Cork.  Due to the former Minister's intervention, the only people who have lost as a result of that deal are the people of Cork. That site is now idle, but it might not have been. He drew attention to that one example where he thought there was corruption because he thought tenders should have been issued for the sale of that site.  It is interesting that tenders were not issued for the sale of 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann, which occurred through a process of negotiation.  Tenders were not to be issued for the sale of 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann, but the former Minister held up the country because he wanted tenders issued for the sale of a site in Cork, which represented a fraction of the value of the sale of part of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date there has not been an apology, an expression of regret, a clearing of individuals' names or a withdrawal of the impression left by the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, as a result of that semi-State saga.  He will be remembered most as a Minister who took on the semi-State <Col N="504" /> bodies and accused them in different words of some type of misbehaviour.  That did not wash and he will be remembered long and hard for that.</P>
    <P>There are other issues I wanted to deal with, including Esat Digifone consultancy fees, the ESB, Bord na Móna, Moneypoint and other examples where the policy of the departing Minister was wrong.  The new Minister should read those files and change the policies in those areas.  If he does that, he will do a good day's work for his Government and country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I wish Deputy Dukes every success in his new portfolio.  He is a decent and honourable man who has a distinguished record of public service as a former Minister and as a regular contributor to Dáil debates.</P>
      <P>His appointment has been brought about by the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, which is a personal tragedy and trauma for him.  The manner in which the Government handled the issue has been unsatisfactory.  There has been a lack of accountability to the House and to our people.  There has been a lack of desire on the part of the Government to put the public interest first.  The Taoiseach's contribution today was somewhat disturbing from that point of view. He asked people to refrain from asking questions, from raising this issue and to give all concerned appropriate time to deal with it.</P>
      <P>We must be extremely blunt about this matter. The perception of public life has been undermined by this issue, irrespective of what the explanations may be.  Arising from it, there is an urgent need to improve the perception of public life.  Regardless of where we meet people, we hear that this issue has undermined public confidence in the political system and in Dáil Éireann.  That is the main reason this House and the public are entitled to a full and comprehensive explanation as to the nature of the transaction between the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, and Dunnes Stores, but that has not been forthcoming today.  It is disturbing that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Leader of Democratic Left are not too anxious that it should be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found the performance of the Tánaiste, in terms of the content of his speech, breathtaking. We have witnessed an attempt by the Government side to politically whitewash this issue.  There are political double standards at work here.  The political culture of Irish society tends to apply double standards to Fianna Fáil when it is in office and other standards to other parties when they are in office.  John Waters devoted considerable space in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 19 November 1996 to articulating that issue, that clear different standards applied to Fianna Fáil as opposed to any other party in this State.  He concluded by saying that, in short, there is no protecting Fianna Fáil from anything that the political culture <Col N="505" /> throws at it and no indicting any other party for actions or inactions whose consequences fall short of rocking the State to its foundations.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for only six years and have spent most of that time as a Government backbencher.  I have witnessed all the traumas of Fianna Fáil Ministers resigning from Deputy McDaid to the late Deputy Brian Lenihan to Deputy Reynolds.  I can recall the language used by Members of the Opposition, in editorials and by media personalities.  If that language is compared to that used in regard to this issue, the Judge Dominic Lynch débâcle or the other debacles that have befallen the Government since it came to office, there is a difference in terms of the extreme language used. There is no shadow of doubt in my mind that different standards apply to the Fianna Fáil Party as opposed to any other party.  We have witnessed an example of that today.</P>
    <P>I noted the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, in his contribution debated the issue of political funding and the source of funding of political parties.  If we want to inquire into the source of party political funding, such a study should be all embracing and comprehensive. Articles have been written by reputable journalists in the past ten years concerning dubious methods of fund-raising by people connected to the then Workers' Party.  We have heard of the infamous counterfeit operation of a massive forgery of £5 notes.  There is a Garda file on that operation which took place close to the rear of the headquarters of the then Workers' Party.  I am disturbed there was never any attempt by the State or by the political system to investigate that issue because very serious allegations were made at the time by reputable journalists who are still around.  No effort was ever made to pursue that issue in great depth.</P>
    <P>Allegations were made by that party and personnel in it about the infiltration of the trade union movement with a view to achieving political aims.  Allegations were also made by that party about the infiltration of the State's broadcasting agency with a defined political objective to serve its political interests above those of other political parties in this House and to undermine proactively some political parties.  Those allegations were made in public by reputable journalists and the political system did not bother responding or attempt to investigate those issues of fundamental concern to a democracy.  If those allegations were borne out, they would rock the State to its foundations and have major repercussions.  It is disturbing that little attempt was made by those in the various agencies of power or authority in the State, be it the media, the political system or the Judiciary to investigate those issues which should be investigated further.</P>
    <P>I disagree fundamentally with the assertion made by the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, that once allegations are made someone should resign.  People should not resign on the basis of <Col N="506" /> allegations made against them.  One should only resign if allegations are proven, if one has done something wrong or if one has been negligent in one's duty as Minister.  The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, did not give the type of comprehensive or adequate explanation for resigning that he should have given.  The public interest is the number one interest that should have informed his decision.  It should not have been a matter of convenience for a private firm or of political convenience for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party leader asked us not to judge without evidence.  With respect, the Labour Party leader has judged very quickly &mdash; without evidence &mdash; in his contributions in Opposition and in Government.  We witnessed considerable hypocrisy today.  What is disturbing about the last five major débâcles in this Government is the refusal to be accountable to Dáil Éireann.  Is it not extraordinary that the Taoiseach has not answered one question on the Judge Dominic Lynch issue in the House?  That issue is four weeks old and he has not answered a single question on it.  He promised reform of Question Time yet Ministers, including the Minister for Education, refuse to answer questions, offering to do so on a confidential basis about certain issues. The Tánaiste then says we need a Freedom of Information Bill.  It is a joke.  Language from the Labour Party has become very cheap.  One sensed in contributions today a smugness, complacency and cynicism that has become the hallmark of that party in recent times.  They have lost touch with reality and the people as evidenced by the contributions of all Government parties.  They should take the time to walk the streets of our cities and go into the countryside to listen to people.  Then the degree of public cynicism in regard to the public system and particularly the Government parties may be understood.</P>

      <P>Deputy Martin accused my party of smugness.  There was never an utterance more smug in this House than that he is somehow exclusively in touch with the views of the people. Every member of my party in the House and in Government is well attuned to the wishes, moods and aspirations of the people.  That aspiration has been served very well for the four years Labour Ministers have been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to a radio report on the beginning of this debate.  The reporter characterised the debate as sombre and that all sides of the House reflected on the seriousness of the issue being debated.  Part of the seriousness is the regret I and many Members have about the circumstances necessitating this debate: the resignation of <Col N="507" /> Deputy Lowry from his position as Minister in the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry was elected to the Dáil the same day as I was.  I did not know him very well for the seven years he was here up to the negotiations on the formation of the current Government, when he and I were in the negotiating teams.  Over a short and intense period I learned to know him. I learned quickly about his qualities of incisiveness and comprehension of difficult and complex policies.  He brought these qualities to bear later in a Department with huge responsibilities when appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  That Department was and is pivotal to the changing nature of the semi-State companies.  As Minister, Deputy Lowry managed change in a way that is acknowledged across the social partnership because the challenges that faced the semi-State sector could be addressed in two ways.  One is the slash and sell approach and the other is the manage and develop approach.  We all know the party or parties in the House who would adopt the slash and sell approach, those who have no understanding of the contribution of the semi-States to the development of the nation.  The Progressive Democrats would happily sell them off, sacrificing the workers involved.  Regrettably, Fianna Fáil in recent policy statements seem very ready to sell off the semi-States in their courtship of the Progressive Democrats, regardless of the effect it would have on the thousands of people who work in vital sections of our economy. Deputy Lowry did a difficult job in a good and fair way.  He managed change and enhanced the semi-States in a radical and dramatic time.  I pay tribute to him on my behalf and on behalf of my party.</P>
    <P>The issues raised in a newspaper last Friday were reflected upon by Deputy Lowry and after he consulted the Taoiseach, he did the honourable and good thing.  Rather than get into a protracted explanation of very detailed issues which he knew would put great pressure on the Government at an important time, with the EU Presidency and the approaching summit, crucial ongoing peace talks, finalising budget details and other current matters, he chose to stand aside from Government to give himself time to prepare answers to the legitimate queries posed.  I respect him for that decision.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House asks Members to endorse the nomination of Deputy Alan Dukes to be a member of the Government.  Virtually every Member who has spoken on both sides of the House paid tribute to the character and ability of Deputy Dukes.  He is one of the most able and experienced Members of Dáil Éireann, he will bring a new incisiveness and talent to the difficult task he now faces in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and bring wise counsel to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Several issues have occupied time in the House in recent weeks, each responding to the right of <Col N="508" /> the Opposition and the Oireachtas to have full accountability from those who hold office here. This process is healthy and positive and vital to our democracy.  It ensures the Executive is always subject to the scrutiny of the Dáil, as it should be. Every person who runs for public office opens his or her every action and utterance to public audit. In recent times, the yardstick of probity has been finely measured and precisely applied.  Each action and utterance is measured and judged.  The consequence of that measuring can be swift and cruel, as we see in the case before us.  We have ourselves enacted standards and put the Ethics in Public Office Act into law.  We negotiated this with Fianna Fáil and our current partnership.  It is vital those standards are set in law and complied with by all.  While this process was ongoing here, other things were happening and being managed by this Government.  In nominating a member of the Government, it is important that the total work of Government be mentioned.  The healthy state of the economy is acknowledged at home and abroad.  As a Government we have achieved historic milestones.  More people now come home to Ireland than emigrate from it.  Is that not a tremendous achievement after the anguish of decades of emigration?  There is a buoyant, vibrant and confident cultural community and identity for all the people and unprecedented levels of real employment.  These issues are fundamental to people's lives and well-being.  It is important they are mentioned in this debate.</P>
    <P>In my own area of responsibility, I am proud of the Government's record on housing.  Ten thousand families will be housed under the social housing programme this year.  This is in contrast to the position in the early part of the decade when virtually nobody was being housed.</P>
    <P>The rate of road development is unprecedented.  I will have the privilege on Friday of this week of opening the northern cross route. The unprecedented level of investment in the non-national road system has been recognised and applauded by rural communities in particular.  By understanding their dilemma and providing a system which will allow them to flourish and thrive, they have been given a new sense of identity and purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time to mention all of the environmental initiatives which have been taken. They include the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, the introduction of the Waste Management Bill, measures to control litter, the promotion of recycling and many others.  There will be other opportunities to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Government of which I am a member has been and remains a good one.  As the Tánaiste said, the vote that will take place at 9.30 p.m. will give it a new impetus and bond it closer together. It will give it an opportunity to reflect on its most important job, securing a better future for all the people who send us here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the motion for the appointment of Deputy Alan Dukes as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  His appointment will contribute significantly to the continued effectiveness of the coalition Government and his contribution to the running of Government during the next 12 months will be widely welcomed.  There can be no Deputy on any side of the House who has doubts about his ability, capacity for hard work or the range and breadth of his experience.  There are few more formidable and talented Members of the House.</P>
      <P>The contribution of the outgoing Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to the work of the Government has been significant.  Irrespective of the merits or otherwise of the issues surrounding his resignation, nothing can detract from the importance of his contribution to the work of the Government and the ministerial office he held.</P>
      <P>The Government has given good, effective and coherent government for the past two years.  The economy has never been so strong.  There has never been such well-balanced growth which is being reflected in higher employment.  We have never had a situation where inflation has remained as moderate over such a long period of time and we have not in recent years maintained the budgetary discipline which has been maintained under this Government.</P>
      <P>All of these facts are due, to a great extent, to the unity and cohesiveness of the coalition Government.  We have achieved a great deal in the past two years but there is still much to be done.  There is undoubtedly plenty of life left in the Government.</P>
      <P>During the past ten years the rate of growth in the economy has been twice as fast as the EU average.  In recent years employment growth has also been faster than the EU average.  The national accounts data confirm that Ireland continues to have one of the best economic performances in the industrialised world.  It shows that we continue to combine strong output and employment growth, low inflation, moderate Government borrowing and a satisfactory balance of payments position.  Was this country ever in better economic shape?  I doubt it and I doubt if the Opposition parties can genuinely find fault with Government policies on the economic front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important element of the strong Government performance in the past two years has been its success in creating new jobs. Manufacturing employment grew by 6.1 per cent on average last year while the corresponding increase in the building and construction sector was 4.5 per cent.  These figures clearly show that strong output growth is being translated into impressive rates of employment growth.  This strong economic performance continues to be maintained.  The volume of retail sales in the first <Col N="510" /> quarter of this year was up by 6.75 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1995.</P>
    <P>Our remarkable economic performance in recent years did not occur by accident.  Our success is largely attributable to the constant adherence by the Government to consistent budgetary, monetary and other policies aimed at improving our competitiveness, providing stable exchange rates and low inflation.  Confidence in the economy is running at an all time high.  Our international credibility has been given an enormous boost by the achievements of recent years and this is reflected in the willingness of investors to put their funds into Irish pounds.</P>
    <P>In relation to my own Department's responsibilities, we have made and are continuing to make considerable progress.  Recently President Robinson signed into law the Family Law (Divorce) Bill.  This was an historic occasion for Ireland and the Irish people.  We have now provided a civil right which is taken for granted in every modern democracy.</P>
    <P>The Government, through my Department, continues to take measures to protect and support the family and the institution of marriage. Among the measures we have taken so far are the following: the Maintenance Act, which came into effect in November last year, enabled Ireland to ratify the United Nations convention on the recovery abroad of maintenance payments.  The convention provides for a central authority system under which the person seeking maintenance in another country can be helped in taking an action in that country.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Act, 1995, which came into operation on 1 August last, strengthens the law in relation to orders of the court in financial support of spouses and children following breakdown of a marriage.  It allows for financial protection following foreign divorce or separation.  It improves the law on applying for declarations as to marital status and gives the Circuit Court jurisdiction in nullity cases.</P>
    <P>The Domestic Violence Act came into force in March this year.  This legislation strengthens the power of the courts to make orders for the protection of people in the home whose safety or welfare requires it.  It strengthens the powers of arrest of the Garda to intervene in domestic violence cases and significantly improves the protections for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>The Civil Legal Aid Act provides a statutory framework for the system of civil legal aid and advice.  I recently signed regulations giving effect to that Act.</P>
    <P>My Department continues continues to support organisations which assist families in difficulty. We have been successful in maintaining unprecedented levels of grants-in-aid to marriage counselling services, the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service.  The allocation to marriage counselling services this year is an unprecedented £900,000.  This money is used to assist marriage counselling organisations in their work and to encourage them to develop and <Col N="511" /> expand their services.  It also provides assistance to organisations providing counselling services to children whose parents have separated.  My Department provided £6.5 million this year to the Legal Aid Board, an increase of 5 per cent over the allocation of the previous year.  The Family Mediation Service was provided with £300,000 this year, more than double the amount allocated to the service three years ago.</P>
    <P>The House is considering the Employment Equality Bill which prohibits discrimination in employment on a wide range of grounds.  This Bill passed Committee Stage in the House last week. Work is proceeding on the preparation of the Equal Status Bill which deals with discrimination in the provision of goods and services.  This is complex and wide-ranging legislation and extensive consultations have been taking place with interested parties in preparation for it.</P>
    <P>The net result of all this legislative activity is that many people who heretofore did not have protection under the law which they need and which is their right will now have such protection. The legislative work of the Department of Equality and Law Reform will have a profound and beneficial effect on society for many years to come.</P>
    <P>What has been achieved by the Government in the past two years on the economic and social fronts has been remarkable.  It could not have been accomplished without the commitment and dedication of each member of the Government and of the Deputies and Senators of the three parties comprising the coalition.</P>
    <P>The Opposition parties have been desperately and fruitlessly seeking in recent months a chink in the armour of the Government.  They are, as most Opposition parties are, hungry for an election.  They are anxious for any sign of divisions or dissension.  I am sorry to have to disappoint them but this Government is more united than many a previous Government.  I have no doubt that we will carry on to complete the considerable amount of work we still have to do in 1997.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes, who has been nominated by the Taoiseach as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, will be a welcome member of the Government team.  He has had a distinguished career as a Minister, as a Deputy and as an economist before his election to the House.  His ability is beyond question.  All of us know the constructive contribution he can and will make to this Government.  I warmly welcome his nomination as Minister.</P>

      <P>I, too congratulate Deputy Dukes on his nomination as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  The Minister for <Col N="512" /> the Environment, Deputy Howlin said Deputy Lowry did the honourable thing, that he needed time to explain, so he resigned.  It seems he needed Thursday, Friday and Saturday to explain matters at which point the Government decided he had had as much time as it would allow.  Let us be honest and not say he did the honourable thing and that he needed time to explain.  It is hard to explain how this transaction took place. Deputy Lowry, a colleague of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and other Ministers who have spoken, chose to resign and to explain later.  Apparently it was not possible to explain in the time available which would have been preferable from the viewpoint of Members of this House.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach immediately said there were two standards &mdash; one for Ministers and one for backbenchers.  We all know that is not right.  The Taoiseach has been trying to row back from this statement since he made it.  It calls into question his judgement in this affair.  There can only be one standard for all Members of the House in a matter of this magnitude and one way to proceed. As the Minister for Equality and Law Reform said, it is all about cohesiveness and that as long as the Government sticks together it is all right. The Government has been badly shaken and was in danger of collapse having faced weekly crises. However, it is afraid to face the electorate.  It is not all right to stick together and it cannot cover over the cracks by saying it will be cohesive.</P>
      <P>I refer to a meeting that took place last Saturday which was reported in the newspapers. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste's representative, Mr. Greg Sparks, who is his programme manager, the Attorney General, Mr. Sean Donlon, an adviser to the Taoiseach and his programme manager, and Mr. Shane Kenny, the Government Press Secretary, met before Deputy Lowry arrived.  I believe they decided the Minister had to resign.  I suspect they also decided on a damage limitation exercise to divert attention from the Deputy and his resignation.  Hence names on a list of which they were aware were spread about to create as much confusion as possible.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General was at that meeting.  We now know, from what the Taoiseach said today, that he had a client relationship with Mr. Ben Dunne.  We also know he only declared an interest on 30 November.  The question is, did he have the list?  Was he aware of the information pertaining to Members or former Members of the House or members of the public service?  The Taoiseach should answer those questions.  Did the Attorney General tell the Taoiseach who was on the list or did he choose not to do so?  The Taoiseach said he was not aware of this matter before 29 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On his appointment as Minister, Deputy Lowry had an obligation to tell the Taoiseach about any previous happening which would affect his position.  That is an issue which Deputy Harney raised today and of which any former Minister will be fully aware.  At that first meeting with the <Col N="513" /> Taoiseach, each Minister is asked to declare anything which might have implications for him and to ensure the Taoiseach is made aware of it. Deputy Lowry either told the Taoiseach at that time or he did not.  If we are to believe the Taoiseach, he did not tell him but should have done so.</P>
    <P>Did the Attorney General warn the Taoiseach that a time bomb of which he must have been aware was ticking in the Cabinet?  Did he believe he had a client relationship which he could not disclose and, therefore, had to stay quiet?  If that was the case, why did he attend the meeting last Saturday?  Why did he not stand aside while the Taoiseach made this important decision?  The Taoiseach must clear up this issue and let us know if the Attorney General knew about the list in the Price Waterhouse report, if he informed him after 29 November or if he left this time bomb ticking in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The allegations and innuendoes surrounding this affair should be cleared up by the publication of relevant facts available in the Price Waterhouse report.  Not only does every political party in Dáil Éireann have an interest in clearing up this matter, but every citizen has a right to know their affairs and those of the country are being managed in a way which is untouched by a whiff of corruption and which is not under the shadow of special interest. Nobody must be allowed to buy with millions of pounds any special privileges with members of any Government.  Members of this House or Government must not allow themselves to be beholden to wealthy special interests or to any improper special interest regardless of which party they belong.  No citizen should have grounds to believe those who are wealthier than they are can buy special privilege or preferred position with public men or women of whatever party.  It is crucial that this affair is publicly examined.  It requires the fullest and most detailed investigation possible and those involved must be treated with the same presumption of innocence to which even the meanest criminal is entitled.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Woods for giving me the opportunity to speak.  I congratulate Deputy Dukes and express my commiserations to the former Minister, Deputy Lowry.  I did not intend to speak on this matter but decided to do so when I listened to the contribution of the Tánaiste, which I found sickening.  Overall this has been an honourable debate, but a colleague of mine, Deputy Power, who sat beside me during the Tánaiste's speech, tore up the prepared script and walked out, and I do not blame him.  The Tánaiste's parliamentary performance today was a disgrace.  I am sick and tired of the holier than thou approach of that politician.  He had some difficulty in describing our party as chancers &mdash; the script did not quite fit.  Is the Tánaiste somehow different from and better than the rest of us in claiming this special high moral ground <Col N="514" /> position for himself and his party?  He talks a lot about his integrity, and that is fine, but he should lay off our party, a party of hard working, decent people.  The old style of name-calling is something on which he is an expert, but he is impressing nobody, least of all the public.</P>
      <P>There is an innate decency in the people and they can see through this tactic.  The Tánaiste's speech today was empty and hollow, a shell.  We would like to hear what he really believes in.  Will he make a credible statement or will he continue to throw dirt at Fianna Fáil?  He tried that in Opposition and presented himself as a knight in shining armour, but it is a tired tale.  It will be a long day before he can stand up here and take credit for the achievements we brought about such as bringing peace to Northern Ireland, initiating and building social partnership, creating jobs, bringing investment to the country and providing education, housing and social welfare for our people, achievements made under Fianna Fáil from de Valera's time up to the present.  The only principle under which the Tánaiste works is one of survival.  Northern Ireland and the economy take second place to self-preservation. The Tánaiste has some neck to come into the House today, a day when he should keep his head down, and repeat his well tried trick of throwing shovels of muck in this direction.  He will fool nobody with that tactic because it does not work. It proves that the man behind the pen has not learned a lot.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for giving me time to make that point in an important debate on integrity, about which we are all concerned.</P>

      <P>Neither the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste nor the Leader of Democratic Left distinguished themselves in this debate.  The three wise men of the rainbow coalition had little or nothing to say about the substance of the allegations made in the press concerning their former ministerial colleague, Deputy Lowry.  The Taoiseach failed completely to address the issues involved.  Instead he confined himself to platitudes, hiding behind generalities and legal jargon.  His was one of the poorest and least convincing performances of any Taoiseach in a major set piece debate in this House for a very long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, on the other hand, sought to trivialise the issue.  He criticised the Opposition as mé féiners and chancers, even though his nerve deserted him when it came to uttering that term of abuse.  The Democratic Left leader used his contribution to go off on a tangent about employment practices in Dunnes Stores, all very interesting but hardly of immediate interest in the current debate.  He talked of the need for a major crackdown on tax evasion without accepting that Deputy Lowry's transactions amounted to that. The three senior members of the Government made no effort to answer the important questions arising from the Lowry affair.  The two most basic of these questions are very simple: did Dunnes <Col N="515" /> Stores pay for the renovation of Deputy Lowry's house and were the full details of this transaction reported to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that Deputy Lowry must be given time and space to answer these simple questions, but how much does he need?  It is five days since the first reports of this affair appeared in the press.  If ordinary PAYE taxpayers were asked how they paid for their house, they would not need five days or even five minutes to reply. They would be able to say straight away from where they got the money.  Why is Deputy Lowry unable to provide a simple, straightforward answer to such a simple, straightforward question?  Are we expected to wait indefinitely for him to come forward with an explanation for this whole affair on his own terms in his own time?  That is not good enough.  There must be a full and proper investigation of these matters.</P>
    <P>There is a major crisis of public confidence in politicians and politics.  We urgently need to restore public confidence in our democratic institutions, otherwise the reputation of all upright, honourable Members of this House will be tarnished by innuendo, rumour and bar stool gossip.  The Taoiseach must realise that a full investigation of all these matters is required, not only in regard to payments to Deputy Lowry but those reportedly made to an unnamed Fianna Fáil politician and to any other politician named in the Price Waterhouse report.  The Taoiseach has made no commitment that any such investigation will be undertaken.  He is leaving it up to the Revenue Commissioners who conduct their business in private.  There is no obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to make public any of their findings.  A line in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in three years time may be all the public will ever hear about the results of a Revenue investigation, but that will not be sufficient to restore public confidence in the political system.</P>
    <P>The basic question here is a straightforward one, does the public have a right to see the Price Waterhouse report and the evidence it contains of unorthodox payments by Dunnes Stores to politicians?  The answer is a resounding yes.  It only remains for the Government to find a suitable mechanism to bring that report into the public arena as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>In the debate earlier today my party leader, Deputy Harney, outlined one course of action which is open to the Government if it really wants to get to the bottom of this affair.  She called for the appointment of inspectors under the Companies Act, 1990, to investigate fully the affairs of Dunnes Stores and Streamline Enterprises.  It will be necessary to appoint independent inspectors with full power to summon witnesses and subpoena documents to discover the full facts and put them before the public.  I have yet to hear a formal response from the Government to Deputy Harney's proposal. The three men who lead the Government were great disciples of openness, accountability and <Col N="516" /> transparency when they were on this side of the House at various times in recent years.  They were never slow to call for investigations for disclosure of facts for full and fair accounting, and they were right, but they abandoned their previous principles simply because they are in Government.  I call on the Taoiseach to make a formal response tonight to Deputy Harney's request.  Is he willing to appoint inspectors to investigate this matter fully and, if not, why not? Surely the public has a right to know.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his elevation to the Cabinet and look forward with interest to the attitude he adopts to the future of the semi-State companies.  In the past four years the Labour Party ensured that the subject of privatisation was taken off the political agenda. Fine Gael supporters of privatisation in Opposition have meekly gone along with the Labour view in Government.  Will the new Minister, Deputy Dukes, go along with this policy of appeasement?  One of his first duties in office should be to bring forward a comprehensive policy statement on the Government's attitude to the semi-State sector.  He would also do us a service by publishing the contract document for the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann.  Telecom Éireann is the most valuable of all the State's commercial assets and it is unthinkable that the Government should dispose of a 20 per cent stake in it by way of a secret deal.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of the second mobile phone licence awarded to Esat Digifone earlier this year.  Even though the official response from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications states that 20 per cent of the winning consortium was owned by Investment International Underwriting Nominees Limited, a company which it states is wholly and exclusively owned by Dermot Desmond, the investors in that company have not been disclosed.</P>
    <P>That there were other investors in Dermot Desmond's company was referred to in a departmental press conference on 20 April reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>Asked about the 20 pc stake Esat Digifone had reserved for institutional investors (which is underwritten by Dermot Desmond's International Investors Underwriters), Mr. Loughrey said the Department was given a list with the identity of potential investors.</P>
    <P>The shareholders in the remaining 20 pc stake would be drawn from this list, he said, adding that the quality of the &ldquo;shopping list was perfectly acceptable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the incoming Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to state clearly for the public record the names of the beneficial owners of all the shares in Esat Digifone, particularly the investors in Investments International Underwriting Nominees Limited.  I hope the new Minister will see fit to disclose this information which was withheld by his predecessor. <Col N="517" /> These are extraordinary events but more surprising and extraordinary is the fact that even though they have resulted in Minister Lowry resigning from his Ministry, we have had no explanation from him of the reason for the house payments or the manner in which the payments were made.  We have had no explanation from the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste in their contributions about what these dealings represented.  They were both reticent in these matters and are displaying a dangerous tolerance of low standards in high places.  No censure was issued.  Instead, these extraordinary events are allowed to hang as a dark cloud of suspicion over all politicians in this House giving the impression that these matters do not warrant immediate, vigorous investigation at the highest level.</P>
    <P>If no wrongdoing was involved, Deputy Lowry is entitled to have his name cleared at the earliest opportunity.  Every other Member of this House is no less entitled to have any shadow of suspicion removed from him at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if an Opposition Deputy had been at the centre of this affair, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste would immediately set up a judicial review to inquire into all matters relating to these events.  Because it is a member of the rainbow Coalition, however, different standards are being applied.  No investigating committee is to be established, a judicial review will not be set up and there will not be an inspector appointed under the Companies Act. What happens if the Revenue Commissioners decide not to investigate?  We already know that North Tipperary County Council decided not to bother investigating the illegal extension to Deputy Lowry's house.</P>
    <P>The Government's tactics seem to be to let time pass.  It hopes that public interest will wane and that the matter will be forgotten.  In time people will not even remember what the Lowry-Dunne affair was all about.  In the meantime, politics and politicians will remain under a cloud of suspicion.  That is not good enough.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Dukes, on his promotion to Cabinet and on accepting the important responsibilities' that have been given to him.  A primary criterion for appointment to Government should be the competence and ability of those appointed to carry on the business of Government.  Deputy Dukes has in the past ably demonstrated that he has both that competence and ability, and his becoming part of the Government will strengthen it.  I have no doubt he will have important contributions to make both within his Ministry and within the collegiate group of the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> None of us in this House get any delight out of the events that have resulted in tonight's debate. They are events we would all wish had not happened.  Revelations have now come into the public domain.  If there was wrongdoing it is right that these revelations be in the public domain.  It is unfortunate, however, that, in the context of these events, we are only getting bits of the story. I agree with other Members of the House who said that the Price Waterhouse report or document should be made public.  It is unfortunate that, in the context of the Fianna Fáil Party, there is an allegation that someone has been in receipt of moneys in circumstances that give rise to suspicion without the detail of that being known and without the person to whom the rumours relate stating his or her position or being in a position to explain the background to the matter.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the debate has been a little different from the debate I anticipated when I first came into the House this afternoon.  I feared we would have some of the usual party political slapstick that on occasions masquerades as serious debate in this House.  Apart from a couple of contributions we have managed not to engage in that type of debate.</P>
    <P>Serious issues have been discussed and questions legitimately raised on different sides of the House.  It is important to emphasise a particular sentence in the Taoiseach's contribution where he states: &ldquo;It is very important to stress that the full facts about these disclosures have not yet been established or placed on public record&rdquo;.  Just as I believe the Price Waterhouse report or document should now be put into the public domain to end rumours and speculation, my colleague, Deputy Lowry, has a public duty also to state clearly the background to this matter.</P>
    <P>All of us as public representatives, be it members of Cabinet or backbenchers, are in a privileged position.  It is a privilege to be a Member of this House.  As Members we have a public duty to be open in our dealings and to deal in matters relating to our business affairs in a way that is above suspicion.  Very frequently in this House, and on occasions rightly so, Members draw attention to wrongdoing or misbehaviour by others outside this House, and if we are to do that from a position of credibility, if we are to pass legislation to ensure the people who are alleged to be engaged in wrongdoing are dealt with properly according to our laws, we must do so from a position of strength.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate that this particular matter is left without an explanation being put on the record of this House by the Minister who has had to resign.  That is unfortunate.  All of us have a duty to ensure that if an issue arises in which it is alleged there could be a conflict of interest as between our private lives and our public duty, we have a duty to those who elect us to set out the position clearly.  I hope that will happen in the <Col N="519" /> coming days.  It is of some importance that it does.</P>
    <P>The sadness of this debate and the events surrounding it is that it may help to fuel public cynicism about politicians generally, their commitments and motives.  The events of recent days are good in so far as they will explain something if it needs to be explained but they are bad in so far as they are further undermining our parliamentary democracy; they are adding to people's cynicism.</P>
    <P>There is a view outside this House with which Deputies on both sides are familiar, that we are all the same and there is no difference between us.  If there is a suspicion that someone on any side of this House has done something wrong, the man having his pint of beer in the public house on the corner of the street in various constituencies throughout the country will say that we are all alike.  There is a need for the record to be put right and for the full story to be known.  There is a need also to ensure that the probity of Members of this House is above suspicion.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that there have been many good achievements on the part of this Government in a variety of areas, be it in its general dealings or in the enactment of a wide variety of legislation across a broad spectrum of issues which have been gathering dust on ministerial shelves for many years.  There is a danger that the achievements of this Government will be overshadowed by difficulties caused by or to individual Ministers, on occasion through no fault of their own, and that is sad.  If this Government is going through an accident-prone phase, it is in the interests of the country and of the parties in Government that phase passes.  That will not happen, however, unless the full background to the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, is put on the public record.  That should be done.  I agree with Members that he is entitled to time to explain the events which have occurred.  Outside that, the public is entitled to know the detail of these events and to be given explanations.  I hope that will happen so that this issue will be resolved and we can move on to further business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy McGinley.  As one who voted for Deputy Dukes in 1987 and who would have voted for him had the occasion arisen subsequently, I wish to express my pleasure and appreciation that he is back in the Cabinet.  Everyone in this House accepts the undoubted ability of Deputy Dukes. His absence from the Cabinet was a loss to the Irish people.  Most people in the House appreciate his ability and welcome and endorse my words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On what is a sad day for the Irish body politic, I have no pleasure in saying that Deputy Lowry had no option but to resign.  I say that, not out of any sympathy for him, but in the belief that he could not have had a fair trial.  He certainly could <Col N="520" /> not get one in these days of media trial and hype. In recent years, we witnessed this during the beef controversy and the passports for sale scandal.</P>
    <P>No Deputy gets any pleasure out of the suggestion that an unnamed former Minister has been the beneficiary of in excess of £1 million because it reflects on us and adds, as Deputy Shatter, to the perception that politicians are all receiving similar payments.  I have never even got a discount for buying a shirt in Dunnes Stores.  I wonder where the potential lies for this?</P>
    <P>I always found Deputy Lowry a straightforward young man.  He was a successful businessman before he came into Dáil Éireann and had established definite links with Dunnes Stores.  I do not accept his position was compromised.  Given the nature of Dunnes Stores' methods of doing business which is fairly well-known &mdash; on occasions, it has forced small companies over the brink by keeping them waiting for payments for a long time and were the cause of the operations of small suppliers being no longer viable &mdash; it is possible that Deputy Lowry's company could be owed money by Dunnes Stores and he has already hinted at that.</P>
    <P>He had no option but to resign in the precipitate manner he did because he was not in a position to come in here today and give an explanation.  That is a reasonable assumption.  He owes it, not only to the Irish people but to his colleagues in this House, to give a rational explanation in the future.  The Fianna Fáil contributions today were fairly measured and did not fulfil the expectations of the newspapers of a terrible battle ensuing.  It is reasonable to wait until the resumption of the Dáil in the new year for an explanation by Deputy Lowry of his business dealings, possibly accompanied by some comment from the Revenue Commissioners. Deputy Lowry has said he has no problem with them.  That has yet to be clarified.  The Revenue Commissioners should, as Deputy Shatter said, make public the payments relating to all of the 100 or more people named in the Price Waterhouse report.  They should be named.  The internal business of the Dunne family need not necessarily be made public but the beneficiaries should be named in the interests of the future of politics in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If some type of media trial is enacted it will prevent any businessperson seeking entry to Dáil Éireann.  We would be left with a proliferation of farmers, lawyers and teachers.  That would be regrettable because business people are needed in this House.  A witchunt against the business community would not be appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGahon that we have had a reasonable and responsible debate this evening and not the battle and bloodshed the media expected.  We are all concerned about what has been reported in these last few days.  We want the truth to come out so <Col N="521" /> that no one is under undue suspicion because we are all, as politicians, in it together.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy McGahon, I have known Deputy Lowry since he was elected in 1987 and especially during his time as a Minister.  I always found him a good and co-operative colleague and a responsive and sympathetic Minister since he took over the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  I remember leading a deputation of turf producers from west Donegal to Dublin last year.  The local turf burning power station was being closed down and these people did not know what the future held for them.  They were small families from a poor rural part of Ireland whose livelihoods were on the line.  We arranged a meeting with the Minister who received them sympathetically.  As a result, they were looked after very generously when the station closed down.  They did not belong to a union and no body or organisation represented them but the Minister looked after them well nonetheless.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry's statement last Saturday was courageous and magnanimous.  Allegations were made and he decided he would answer them outside of Government. That was the right decision for him to take.  Deputy Lowry has been vilified and accused before.  I remember allegations being made on television such that one would have sworn that the Government was about to fall, but the Minister was vindicated because there was a question of forgery &mdash; I do not wish to dwell on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister's resignation has brought greater cohesiveness to the Government.  It is great to see the trust between the three party leaders, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputy Lowry's resignation shows that there are standards in Government. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s there were controversies, allegations etc., but no Minister resigned.  During the past two years three Ministers have resigned.  The fact that Ministers can go but the Government keeps on governing is an indication that we have standards.  The resignation of Ministers is something we associate with the British.  Many years ago when Harry West, a Minister in Northern Ireland resigned because of a controversy over a land deal, it was said that was something that would never happen here.  I do not know whether anything was ever proven but Mr. West acted according to a code of honour which is beginning to operate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that we have a replacement in Deputy Alan Dukes, a man who will bring wide and deep experience to the Ministry in question having acted as Minister for Finance, Minister for Agriculture and Minister for Justice.  During the past two years he has been a very effective chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and is held in high esteem not alone nationally but internationally.  If I am not mistaken, he is the chairman of all the committees of foreign affairs throughout the <Col N="522" /> European Union.  He will bring much experience to Government for the remainder of its term.</P>
    <P>The Government is doing very well.  The only criticism commentators can make about the Government is that it is dull and unexciting.  They have not much to criticise because all the economic indicators are positive.  There is high growth rate and low inflation and next year, for the first time ever, the <i>per capita</i> income of the people here will surpass that of our great and strong neighbour, the United Kingdom.  That will be an historic economic landmark in the history of the country.  We have a good Government and it is a sign of its health that Ministers can be replaced and the Government can continue to pursue the progressive and excellent economic policies it has pursued for the past number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Let me begin by referring to the motion before us tonight, the appointment of Deputy Dukes as a Minister of the Government.  I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his appointment, belated as it is.  He is a man who will enhance this Administration and be a good Minister on behalf of the people.  I have worked with Deputy Dukes for the past two years as his vice-chairman on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I found him to be competent and fair.  He does not suffer fools gladly.  He has a good grasp of his brief and worked hard as chairman of the committee.  He will be a loss to that committee.  On a personal basis I wish him well.</P>
      <P>His appointment has come about as a result of the resignation or firing of Deputy Lowry from his position as Minister for Transport and Communications.  I do not intend to go into the details surrounding his resignation except to say that I was taken with the last three speakers from Fine Gael who all called for a full explanation from the Deputy of the reasons for his resignation.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer also to the comments of Deputy McGahon who complimented this side of the House on the constructive and serious manner in which it has handled the debate. Deputy McGahon is a long-time Member of this House, as I am &mdash; I have been here almost 24 years.  This is a serious matter not just for one side of the House or the other but for the House as a whole.  It is only right and proper that it be dealt with in an appropriate manner.  That is why I find it difficult not to respond to the comments of the Tánaiste who, in his usual role as arbiter of the morals of this country, referred to colleagues on this side and to the million people that support and work for us, as Fianna Fáil chancers.  I reject that description.  It does little to enhance the reputation of the Tánaiste that he should reduce this debate to the level of personal abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard much in the past few days about the reason for Deputy Lowry's resignation. <Col N="523" /> We have heard much in the media about the fact that other people will be in some way be &ldquo;outed&rdquo; by the Price Waterhouse report.  I call here and now for the full publication of that report.  It is a fiction to suggest that this is a private report for a private company.  Dunnes is a massive organisation doing business in every county and in most of the major cities and county towns.  It is a fiction to suggest that it is such a private organisation that a report which is being leaked in the manner in which it is, to do the maximum amount of damage to the body politic, should be held back from the public arena.  I call for the publication of that report, not just as it relates to elected political figures but as it relates to whoever is named in it.  Let the cards fall where they may; the institutions of this State deserve and require nothing less.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the myth that this is a good Government.  I am glad Deputy Rabbitte is here.  I watched his performance on television last night with growing amazement.  Even the audience responded with a certain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not the word that immediately comes to mind.  We are told the Government is cohesive and therefore it is good. It reminds me of the good old days of Ceaucescu. I am even reminded of the people now parading in Belgrade because the election result was one the Government did not like.  It says it is a strong Government, it is in control of the country, it is cohesive.  It has the cohesiveness of Evostik.  It is bound together in an embrace of death because it is afraid to face the public.  That is what we should be discussing this evening rather than the promotion of Deputy Dukes, deserved as it is.  It is appalling that he was treated in such a manner for so long and kept out of Government for petty reasons.</P>

      <P>What have we had from this Government?  We had the incident concerning the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, with the long gun from Enniscorthy to the VIP lounge in my constituency, the disgraceful comments in this House by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, about the lady who died of HIV, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who cannot figure out how the postal service works, the Attorney General who is so lax in the performance of his duties as adviser to the Government and elsewhere that he does not even advise the Minister about the Special Criminal Court, and the resignations as Ministers of Deputies Phil Hogan and Hugh Coveney.  At the same time we hear of cohesiveness.  Let us test the cohesiveness outside and give the public the <Col N="524" /> opportunity to make a judgment as to its effectiveness.  The Government sticks together in this dance of death but it is afraid to face the public.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Lowry did not have to resign for personal reasons he should have resigned over the sale of Telecom and the fact that it was being privatised in Holland while the citizens of this country were debarred from an opportunity, under their pension funds, to have a share of Telecom.  The workers of this country, through their pension funds, could invest in the Stock Exchange in The Hague but they could not do it at home.  This was fiction from the Government. On that issue alone Deputy Lowry should have resigned.</P>
      <P>It is essential for the body politic that the Price Waterhouse report is published in full at the earliest possible date.  As mature politicians from all sides, let us handle the outcome and the fall out from that report.  It is wrong and damaging that it is being leaked, talked about behind hands and that names are being tossed about.  That is unfair to all concerned.  Let us have it in the public arena.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús is é an rún atá os comhair an Tí ná go nglacaimid leis an moladh Alan Dukes a ainmniú mar Aire sa Rialtas seo. Ba mhaith liom mo chomhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Dukes.  Credim go dtuigeann an pobal agus go dtuigeann muintir an Tí seo gur fear cumasach é, go bhfuil sé fíorchliste agus go bhfuil taithí thar cuimse aige ins na hAireachtaí ar fad ina raibh sé.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh, aireoidh mise uaim é go speisialta mar is é mo chomhleachaí chraoltóireachta é le mí nó dhó anois.  Ba mhaith liom chuile adh a ghuí air i Roinn Stáit in a bhfuil go leor faoin a chúram agus go leor le déanamh.  Tá mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé é sin mar a rinne sé a chuid ghnó roimhe seo.</P>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of Deputy Alan Dukes, a long awaited appointment.  Many of us felt he should have been in the original Cabinet nominated by the Taoiseach.  He is an intelligent man of tremendous experience in many Departments.  He was vilified for putting the country before his party in the Tallaght strategy. Even though I am losing a broadcasting partner, the Cabinet is gaining a person of immense stature.  I wish him well in his position.</P>
      <P>One of the things we all have is our integrity. Deputy McGahon, Deputy Burke and all who contributed spoke of it.  While the Price Waterhouse report is being speculated about in the media, in every public house and in every kitchen, there will be a cloud of suspicion over every Member, male or female.  We have come in here with our integrity and as upright citizens and are proud of that.  One of my colleagues said today that most politicians leave this House much poorer than when they entered it.  It is interesting to note the comments of Deputy De Rossa on 15 November 1994 when he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> Democratic Left want a Government in which the public can have confidence.  We want a clean Government from which sleaze will be eliminated, which will not stumble from scandal to scandal or crisis to crisis.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look back on what has happened during the past two years or so.  We had the Lowry crisis; the cosy cartel allegations; the allegations of Fianna Fáil surveillance, all of the unproven allegations made at that time and this from a Minister who came in riding on a white charger to clean out semi-State companies which he alleged were polluted in some way; we had the hepatitis C scandal and the fact that the Government and the Minister for Health refused to treat all those victims, men, women and children, with any sense of dignity.  We then had a Minister who did not know whether Enniscorthy was based at Dublin Airport or whether he was sitting in Kavanagh's pub in Enniscorthy or at the Dublin Airport signing a document with the Russians.  There was the scandal in that Department where a very important document relating to antibiotic residues in pigmeat was suppressed in the Department by that same Minister.  This was followed by the greatest crisis of all time relating to the delisting of Judge Lynch.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, is present.  Unfortunately I was not here when he made various allegations about wheelbarrows on two previous occasions.  It is interesting that in 1994 he had evidence as an Opposition Deputy to suggest there was a document in the Attorney General's Office which was going to shake the foundations of the State.  I have not missed an opportunity since he became a Minister of State at the Cabinet table to ask him whether he has found this document which was going to shake the foundations of the State.  Instead, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has returned &mdash; it was proved last night beyond a shadow of a doubt &mdash; to his roots and he is now the best Fine Gael Minister in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The resignation of a Minister is not a source of joy for any Member.  In this case it has cast a cloud of suspicion over all Members.  The lifting of this cloud is in the hands of the Government. As my colleague, Deputy Burke, said, no Price Waterhouse report into any company, public or private, can afford to be kept out of the public domain.  It is important that that document be made public as soon as possible.  The Government will agree it is important that if politicians, members of the media or public officials up and down the country are named in a document we owe it to all the upright Members, the media and public officialdom to publish that list.  If Members of this or the other House have been compromised in any way, they owe it to their party leader to come forward and make it known. In Fianna Fáil they will be dealt with in an appropriate and fast manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss the ultimate insult to all <Col N="526" /> Members which was offered by the holder of the second highest position in the Government and the keeper of the moral high ground in political life, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.  He spoke about the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; in Fianna Fáil.  I resent, on behalf of my party, that a Member of this House or anybody outside it feel they could refer to my party and its members as chancers.  Not only did the Tánaiste insult my party, he also insulted the people who elect its members to this House.  As a constitutional officer of the State the Tánaiste has demeaned the integrity of the membership of its democratically elected Parliament.  The unbridled hypocrisy and double standards of this man know no bounds.</P>

I told the House in December 1994, following the fall of the Government, that the moral high ground was the one place on this planet I had no wish to occupy.  Space on that ground is rather limited and when one occupies it there is only one direction to go and that is down.  The slippery slide in this context began in the last two years and I wonder where it will end.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has had altitude sickness for a long time.  The Tánaiste owes it to the House to apologise for the insulting remarks he made against my party.  We will certainly raise it with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On a previous occasion when a Member of the Fine Gael Party used a word which I, as a Minister in the Government at the time, considered offensive, the word was banned from the parliamentary lexicon of the House by the Ceann Comhairle.  I hope he will ensure that the Tánaiste offers an apology to our party for his remark today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the role of the Attorney General in this matter?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Attorney General was contacted by Mr. Ben Dunne since this matter became public and what did the Attorney General say to Mr. Dunne?  Did he inform the Taoiseach of this fact prior to the date on which the Taoiseach said he was informed by the Attorney General of his legal relationship with Mr. Dunne?  Have the Revenue Commissioners sought the Price Waterhouse report and will the Taoiseach insist through the Minister for Finance that they do so?  This is a very serious matter for the Government and questions must be answered.  The Taoiseach owes it to the House to explain what was so serious in the Price Waterhouse report that a Minister has to resign or be fired.  These questions must be <Col N="527" /> answered and I am not sure that the Government is prepared to face up to that fact and to answer them.</P>
    <P>While the report remains unpublished, all Members of the Oireachtas are under suspicion and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, must agree.</P>

      <P>This debate is, on the face of it, a discussion on the nomination of Deputy Dukes as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I welcome his appointment.  I have known Deputy Dukes for a number of years.  He is patriotic, sometimes patronising, able, efficient and political.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister for Education he was the Leader of the Opposition and the Fine Gael Party.  The stance he took then in the context of the Tallaght Strategy, as acknowledged by Deputy Bertie Ahern, was patriotic and led to his downfall as leader of Fine Gael.  It is amazing how the scales have dropped from the eyes of its members and that they have welcomed him back to the fold.  He will bring a sense of realism to the party.  I wish him well in his position.</P>
      <P>However, I wonder how the temperature around the Cabinet table will be maintained now that Deputy Dukes has been welcomed from the cold into the fold.  I recall the descriptions of the hospital bed meeting when Deputy Dukes, as Minister for Finance, sought to impress his views on the spendthrift Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a personal level, I offer my regrets to Deputy Lowry, Mrs. Lowry and their family in this personal difficulty.  That is separate from what is forcefully said in the Dáil.  At the end of the day, all a politician has to buttress him or her against the ill winds and misfortunes of political life is the family.  There is nobody on whom one can rely except one's partner and family, if one is <Col N="529" /> lucky enough to have them, or a close relationship or home to which one can return and in which one can talk about one's difficulties. Politics is a rough business and politicians know that vicissitudes are daily occurrences.  The extent to which they cope with and fight them is funded from the resources of their spirit.  That can be difficult at times and all Members are aware of what they must do on such occasions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach differentiated between the role of Deputy Lowry as Minister and his previous role in Opposition as a Front Bench spokesperson and a person of renown in local and national politics when the alleged incidents took place.  Therefore, the dichotomy drawn by the Taoiseach does not withstand scrutiny. Admirable though it may sound, neither do I hold truck with Deputy Lowry's comment yesterday to Marian Finucane on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; that he must now devote his time and attention to his family and his family business and to securing their economic and financial future.  Equally he must remember he is a public representative, that it is for him to decide whether he is prepared publicly to explain exactly what he did, how he did it and what happened in the case of the incident about which we have read so much in recent days.  He cannot say he will tell only as much as he wants and when and how he wants.  He must furnish a full, comprehensive public explanation.</P>
    <P>I echo the comments of Deputies Shatter and McGahon.  This debate is proving to be very interesting, with different wings of Fine Gael emerging.  Those who supported Deputy Dukes in earlier days are very outspoken, none more so than Deputies Shatter and McGahon, both of whom called publicly for Deputy Lowry to state his case comprehensively in this House.  I hope the Taoiseach will so ensure because it requires to be done.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters to which I want to refer, the first being the more serious.  It is the besmirching of all politicians resulting from what has occurred and the manner of its disclosure.  Whenever a politician appears on a television programme in a publichouse the comments to be heard are riveting, but not to politicians' ears.  The Ceann Comhairle, who seeks to maintain decorum and the good name of this House, knows only too well that the manner in which events of the past few days have been dealt with by the Government, along with a series of other incidents, has the electorate reeling in disbelief and shock and wanting to know precisely what happened.</P>
    <P>I speak for all politicians in this House regardless of party allegiance because we have all been besmirched and sullied by what has occurred and the lack of adequate explanation.  It is not sufficient for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who comes from a family with a renowned lineage in Irish politics, to toss across the floor of this Chamber the appellation he attributed to our party.  The member of Government who used the word &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; in the <Col N="530" /> course of his contribution is not fit to grace this House.  How dare he contribute in that fashion? How dare he call anybody by that name?  I feel very strongly about it since my late father and brother also served in this House, as did the Tánaiste's father, with great renown and to a very high standard.  The comments of some elected representatives this afternoon represent a besmirching of us all.</P>
    <P>When we approach the doors of our electorate, our badge of honour is our good name.  When that is taken from those of us whose sole income is derived from participation in political life, we are left with no livelihood.  Once one's good name is taken away, one is left with nothing with which to approach the electorate.  This means one can no longer say one has done one's best and endeavoured to represent the interests of constituents to the best of one's ability in the political forum.  That sole badge of honour has been sullied in the House this afternoon and all Members must deprecate it.</P>
    <P>I want to echo the call by the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Mary Harney, who repeated the earlier call by our party leader for the full publication of the Price Waterhouse report.  Only then can its precise contents be revealed and examined.  I refer to the full revelation of the names of politicians and of public administrators in local and national government.  Members of this House should be afforded an opportunity to probe its contents because it becomes ever clearer they have much wider implications than those we debate now as we deal with the many rumours and innuendoes circulating.  Sufficient information has emerged in the public domain to indicate that it contains many pertinent facts concerning life at local and national level which must be publicly explained. I echo Deputy Harney's comment when she called for the deployment of the mechanism used in the case of the Glacken report of 1990 and to have an inspector sent into Dunnes Stores to obtain the Price Waterhouse report and report publicly to the House thereon.  Any conduit or channel to enable the contents of that report to be made public should be used.  I cannot see any other way since clearly Price Waterhouse has a contractual arrangement with the person who commissioned the report and cannot publish it. Clearly, the Revenue Commissioners will not do so but perhaps there is some other mechanism of which I am unaware.  Bearing in mind that we on this side of the House have called consistently for its publication, if the imposition of any inspector under the relevant legislation constitutes a mechanism by which that can be achieved it is the duty of Government to do so.</P>
    <P>With the exception of that one shameful example, to which I have already referred, I am glad this very serious debate has not descended into a haranguing match or name calling.  If all Members do not get our house in order, if we do not cease to treat as trivia the Special Criminal Court, agriculture, our largest industry, the health <Col N="531" /> and lives of women and business dealings warranting explanation &mdash; they were described as trivia last evening &mdash; democracy is in very serious danger.  What occurs in this House never should be regarded as trivia.  Our Legislature deals with and passes legislation affecting all our citizens. Anything that impedes its progress, as has been the case in recent weeks with mishap after mishap, must be eliminated so that we assert the primacy of this House and the vulnerability of its Members unless there are very full explanations forthcoming of all that has happened.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the publication of the report would appear to me to be the logical outcome of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>First let me congratulate Deputy Dukes on his entirely deserving elevation to the Government.  He has been quite outstanding as a Member of the House and in public life generally. During the period 1987-89 he helped in the restoration of order in the national finances and the economy.  I wish him well in office.</P>
      <P>The reason Deputy Dukes is being nominated as the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is that Deputy Lowry was asked to resign.  When the Government came to office it made a virtue of being open, transparent and accountable.  However, it has so butchered these virtues that those words are in danger of losing all their meaning.  The Government has elevated obfuscation to a prime level on the ladder.</P>
      <P>On 15 November 1994 the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, stated &ldquo;... it is a denial of the prerogative not just of this House but of the public who are entitled to scrutinise the activities of any important officer of the State&rdquo;.  The House is entitled to an explanation of the unorthodox events surrounding the payment of £208,000 to Deputy Lowry.  We are entitled to know the tax implications of the payment and the reason the extension was built to the Deputy's house without planning permission.  It is not good enough for the Deputy to say, &ldquo;I will give the information when it suits me and I will give the amount of information I deem suitable, having regard to my biggest customer.&rdquo;</P>

Anyone who has reached the use of reason knows very well that one needs planning permission for an extension over 23 square metres.  The arrogance and disregard shown for the law by this member of a planning authority is mind-boggling.  I use the term &ldquo;mind-boggling&rdquo; because the Deputy lectured us, and others who no longer hold the positions they once held about the high standards he demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all require people in public office to have the highest standards but there must be consistent <Col N="532" /> standards across the board.  I resent people in this House and elsewhere setting standards for other people which they are not prepared, or are too arrogant to follow themselves.  I find it difficult to accept that kind of arrogance.  Those who do not adhere to the highest standards or obey the law should be accountable to the House.</P>
    <P>On 16 November 1994 the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>We need a new Government which will reform the institutions of the State to make every Member of the House who holds office truly accountable.</P>
    <P>I support that statement.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We need reform to ensure that when the answers to questions asked in the House are not adequate the Ceann Comhairle can demand that a further answer be given.</P>
    <P>We want answers to our reasonable questions and for people to be accountable.  On 16 November 1994 the Tánaiste said:</P>
    <P>This is the correct and appropriate place for those who hold public office and are responsible for decisions of public concern to account for their actions and omissions.</P>
    <P>I also support that statement.  It is amazing that the same Tánaiste lowered the tone of this debate and could do no better than throw insults across the floor of the House.  There is some dispute about whether the insult was thrown across the floor of the House but there is no doubt that his special adviser wrote it into the script which was circulated.  I resent this deeply.  It is shocking that the Tánaiste would try to excuse something which is inexplicable.  All we are demanding is an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the reason a Minister was asked to resign.  The only explanation we have been given is that &ldquo;there was not enough time&rdquo;.  The Minister said he would not be bounced into making a decision.  However, if we cannot get a reasonable explanation after a reasonable length of time then the Government has no option but to face the music.</P>

      <P>I am happy to support the nomination of Deputy Alan Dukes as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  He has a distinguished record of service, having served at different times as Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Finance and Minister for Justice.  He is also known throughout Europe for his ability to grasp complex European issues and to make them relevant to the public.</P>
      <P>In January 1973 he was appointed head of the IFA Brussels office and remained there until 1977 when he joined the then Commissioner Dick Burke's Cabinet.  His experience in Brussels gave him a unique insight into the workings of the Common Agricultural Policy on which he is a recognised expert.  More recently, he has made a major contribution to the European ideal through his chairmanships of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and of the Irish Council of the European Movement.  Only last weekend at a conference in Malahide he defended the principles of the European Union against the British Tory Euro sceptic, Bill Cash. Those present at the conference rated his performance as first class.</P>
      <P>Few governments in Europe can call in a reserve of the calibre of Deputy Alan Dukes.  The public can rest assured that under his stewardship the difficult and challenging tasks in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications will be in safe hands.  This Ministry involves detailed and complex interaction with a large number of semi-State bodies.  Deputy Dukes will continue the work begun by Deputy Lowry.  The House can be assured that when the 1997 general election takes place he will have made a significant contribution to his Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much regret the departure of Deputy Michael Lowry from Cabinet.  I have known him for many years both as a member of Fine Gael and as a Government colleague and he is a man of the highest integrity and honour.  As a Minister in a large Department for the first time, he displayed energy and commitment in dealing with the many complex issues in a broad range of semi-State bodies.  From the first day of his appointment he pledged to reform State enterprise in a manner not seen heretofore and to make it keen and competitive.  Under his stewardship, semi-State bodies like Telecom Éireann, the ESB and Aer Lingus were being <Col N="534" /> harnessed and prepared for the challenges of the new Europe which will emerge when the Intergovernmental Conference concludes and we have a new treaty.  When necessary he did not hesitate to challenge outmoded practices and systems of operation which were no longer suitable to the demands of a modern European State.  His suggestions and ideas often hurt and he was regularly criticised by those, including members of the Opposition, who would maintain the <i>status quo</i> rather than risk innovation or modernisation.</P>
    <P>The seeds sown by Deputy Lowry during his short time as Minister will bear fruit in the future, when his efforts will be widely appreciated.  He was always open to new ideas.  His experience as a successful businessman gave him a unique insight into tackling problems and to progressing what for many others seemed intractable problems and best left to one side for a future Minister to tackle.</P>
    <P>While the weight of such a ministry would tax the energy of many people, Deputy Lowry was a diligent and hardworking Deputy for his North Tipperary constituency.  His endless efforts for the people of Tipperary as a whole were the envy of many politicians.  His clinics received national fame and members of the public from as far away as Cork and Kerry were frequent visitors to his home in Thurles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people of Deputy Lowry's native county are shocked at his resignation and the genuine welcome afforded him in Thurles speaks of their relationship with them.</P>
      <P>Throughout the difficult days last weekend, Deputy Lowry behaved with dignity even in the face of a hostile media.  When difficult questions were put to him he demanded the right to have time to reply.  We should give him that right. When he is ready he will give a complete explanation about the activities mentioned.  He will answer all the questions when he has had proper time to reflect on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we had the farcical position of the Fianna Fáil leader asking members of his Front Bench &mdash; who are supposed to be the shadow Cabinet &mdash; if they had been naughty or carried out any misdeed.  They replied in choral unity, &ldquo;No, sir, I have been a very good boy, please can I retain my job?&rdquo; I am sure the same will happen tomorrow when the intrepid political investigator <Col N="535" /> will ask members of the parliamentary party to examine their hearts and souls and say whether they carried out misdeeds worthy of resignation and, again, there will be a choral unison of &ldquo;nos&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the events of the past few days cast a shadow over the body politic and give rise to serious concern for members of the public and the House.  However, they should not be allowed to divert attention from the excellent job the Government is doing.  Our economy is the envy of Europe.  While it is not the strongest economy in Europe, it is the fastest growing one. We are achieving yearly growth rates of 6 per cent and more while others struggle to achieve 2 per cent and 3 per cent rates.  We are on target for entry to economic and monetary union, the single greatest change facing the country since we joined the EEC.  We are coming towards the end of a successful Presidency of the European Union, with a draft treaty almost ready for agreement at the Dublin summit, when Ireland will again be the focus of European and world attention.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade, I am proud that the total value of our exports for the first half of this year was almost £15 billion, an increase of 13 per cent on 1995.  Our trade surplus increased from £3.4 billion for the first half of 1995 to £3.9 billion this year, an increase of 14 per cent.  As a result of Government initiatives, Ireland is well positioned to exploit the current global trade expansion and to capture an increased share of the growth in international demand for goods and services.</P>
    <P>Tourism is also achieving record levels of growth, seven times the European average.  In 1995, 4.25 million visitors came here, more than 15 per cent more than in 1994.  Visitors from Great Britain were up by 13 per cent.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his appointment to Government.  This is a significant day in its life, which I expect will continue for another 12 months.  The appointment of Deputy Dukes will bring great experience and knowledge to the Cabinet table. That the Taoiseach and his Ministers could agree and finalise the Estimates in the midst of today's difficulties is an indication of how the Government continues to do its work.  We should recall the comments of Bill Clinton during his initial efforts to reach the White House.  When asked what issues he though were important, he replied &ldquo;it's the economy, stupid&rdquo;.  Good Government means an effective economy.  The opinion polls as late as last weekend show steady satisfaction with the Government and increased support for its main party.  The parties in Government are getting on with the business of Government.  Difficulties will continue to arise, but unlike the way they were swept under the carpet in the 1970s, 1980s and the early 1990s, they are now being dealt with openly and fairly. The consequences can sometimes be disappointing, as in the case of Deputy Lowry. The backbenchers of the three Government parties are proud of the way the Government is working and we look forward to continuing to support it in the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>I commiserate with Deputy Lowry who brought a fresh approach to his ministry.  From the first day he dealt head-on with the difficulties he faced.  It is easy to forget that almost 12 months ago well known people in the media in an RTÉ studio spoke of the demise of the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and the then Government and made wild and weird allegations.  Within hours those allegations were proven untrue, but those people did not apologise and say they were wrong.  Everyone should examine his or her conscience when making allegations about others. When the facts of this case are made clear Deputy Lowry will again be vindicated and I look forward to him serving as a Minister under Deputy Bruton in the next coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Lowry had to end his career as a Minister for the time being.  He showed tremendous effort as a Minister, and previously, by helping many <Col N="537" /> organisations to get out of difficulties.  I am sure the record will show his effort in dealing with problems he inherited from previous Ministers who did very little in the areas of energy and transport.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Dukes, who has been a long-term friend through my involvement in the Irish Farmers Association, will be appointed Minister later tonight.  I am sure he will sit easily at the Cabinet table.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on his choice in this difficult situation.  It augurs well for the future of the Government that Deputy Dukes will be part of the Cabinet for another year.  The record of Deputy Dukes in the portfolios of Agriculture, Finance and Justice leaves him well placed for appointment to this job.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has not only discussed the Lowry affair, as it has become known, but has welcomed the appointment of Deputy Dukes.  I am delighted there have been congratulations to him from all sides of the House.  However, it is only a few weeks since the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, was derided in this House.  What plans have Deputy Cowen and some of the farm leaders to compensate farmers for the income they lost as a result of the débâcle in this House and media and other discussions that downgraded the efforts of the Government to maintain cattle prices in difficult circumstances?  From listening to Deputy O'Donoghue, one would be forgiven for believing the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, invented crime.  She has shown in recent weeks that she is the first Minister in a long time to try to get to grips with that problem.  Under the Taoiseach the Government will move ahead to create jobs, control crime and to take many necessary measures in the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>I echo the congratulations and well wishes expressed by previous speakers on the Government side to Deputy Dukes on his appointment to Cabinet.  He has served the country well in the past in the portfolios of Agriculture, Justice and Finance and I have no doubt he will make a sterling contribution to the workings of the Government.  In offering my congratulations, I know I speak for the Fine Gael organisation in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When offering bouquets of congratulations, there is another that should be offered to the journalist, Sam Smyth, because he got his man. He hunted, hounded and harried the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, for 12 months in a vindictive fashion and he delivered on his objective to do down a decent man.  I want to unceremoniously rip the dressage of investigative journalism from him because this was nothing more than a personal vendetta.  Not 12 months ago, the journalist in question and others in an <Col N="538" /> RTÉ studio were gleeful on the imminent demise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, I admonished Deputies earlier to be careful of what they say in respect of persons outside the House.  We are a privileged Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House are fair game for comment by everybody else, but it is rather difficult to express one's opinion on the activities of other people.  Two journalists in particular were gleeful about the imminent demise of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, and he proved them wrong in regard to the infamous Tuffy affair.  If this issue was pursued under the guise of investigative journalism, why were not all the details of the Price Waterhouse report published by the said journalist?  The House is humming with allegations of impropriety by others and the public interest would be well served if those people were named. There is no doubt this was a vindictive, political assassination and it cannot be dressed up in any other fashion.  It was gombeen journalism.</P>
      <P>I see the Chamber puppet of the Independent Group nodding his head.  I am surprised Deputy McDowell, an eminent member of the legal profession, would expect Deputy Lowry to come in here into a Star Chamber to plead his innocence.  Deputy McDowell should be familiar with the concept of due process.  I have no doubt when Deputy Lowry gets an opportunity to present his case to the relevant authorities, which in these circumstances are the Revenue Commissioners, he will be vindicated.  What Deputy McDowell and the Independent Group of journalists are peddling is innuendo and half truths.  They have destroyed a decent man and a good Minister.  The behaviour of Deputy McDowell and others acting as puppets for the Independent Group is nothing short of appalling.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lowry certainly owes an explanation and, given due time to present his case, I have no doubt he will and will be vindicated.  What we are seeing dressed up as investigative journalism and presented to their mouthpieces in this Chamber through Deputy McDowell and others is nothing short of gombeen journalism.  It is an appalling vista that this should happen to somebody of Deputy Lowry's capacity who executed his functions as a Minister in an impeccable fashion, despite the half truths and innuendo peddled by the Opposition in this House.  I have no doubt Deputy Lowry will return to grace the Front Bench of this side of the House in the very near future.  When the truth of this affair comes out there will be egg on the chins of Members on the Opposition Benches as there was in respect of other issues including agricultural to which Deputy Crawford referred, justice, health and every other issue on which the Opposition takes issue with the Government.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his nomination as a member of the Government. In the short ministerial career available to him &mdash; a few months at the most &mdash; I am sure he will enjoy himself thoroughly as he displays his undoubted talent.  However, I am equally sure that some of his colleagues at the Cabinet table will not be quite so happy.  I refer especially to the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.  The reason I isolate him in my short contribution to the debate is that I take great umbrage at that part of his speech where he referred to the Fianna Fáil Party as the chancers in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad he refrained from using that part of his script but it goes to show the mindset of the mandarins behind the politician. His speech was circulated to the media and I thought it unbecoming that a Member who holds the penultimate position of honour in this House should label fellow Members in such a manner and it should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>When the names of Deputy Dukes, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, are mentioned in the same breath, I am reminded of a few events during the latter half of 1982.  During the summer of that year the then Fianna Fáil Minister, Ray MacSharry, set about the task of administering a course of harsh treatment with a view to improving the financial health of this nation. Unfortunately, because of the untimely death of one Deputy and the hospitalisation of another the Government lost its majority in the House and fell in a confidence motion.  The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition headed by Dr. Garret FitzGerald came to power and Deputy Dukes was appointed Minister for Finance.  Almost immediately that intelligent man decided to continue where Ray MacSharry left off.  He gave notice of his intentions by announcing a reduced borrowing requirement.  Just as quickly there came a shot across his bows from the sick bed of the new Tánaiste, none other than Deputy Spring.  The message was simple, Deputy Dukes would cut borrowing over his dead body.  The then Taoiseach abandoned his Finance Minister and the rest is history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four years of gross mismanagement more than doubled the national debt and when Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987 the bailiffs were about to move in.  Ray MacSharry was back in Merrion Street, this time adopting his famous role of &ldquo;Mac the Knife&rdquo;.  The new leader of Fine Gael was Deputy Alan Dukes.  Ironically, he was in a position to exert a more beneficial influence in Opposition than had been allowed to him by Dr. FitzGerald.  The then Minister, Ray MacSharry, had the full support of all Cabinet colleagues and <Col N="540" /> Deputy Dukes ensured that the Government majority of minus two would not endanger its economic programme by adopting the celebrated Tallaght strategy.  Some cynics suggested he was making a virtue out of necessity.  I do not subscribe to that.  Deputy Dukes supported the action he believed in but was prevented from carrying out by Deputy Spring in winter 1982.</P>
    <P>Let us hope the restraining influence of the new Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will be brought to bear with great success.  I wish the Deputy a brief but fruitful spell in Cabinet.  He deserves no less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are universal good wishes for Deputy Dukes in his new appointment.  He enters a Department with three important arms that reach into every corner of the State.  It is a complex and difficult task and everyone wishes him every success in his position.  On a personal level, it is a tragedy for Deputy Lowry, his family, friends and those who have actively supported him and who now feel disappointed at what has happened.  Unfortunately, in reality this was of his own making.  The words of wisdom spoken by the Chair at the commencement of this debate were ignored by Deputy Lowry when he became Minister.  I cannot judge the merits of the case but people's names were bandied about without being given the courtesy the Chair requested Deputies to show in today's debate.  During his time in office, decisions have been made about Telecom Éireann, GSM and other matters of national importance in such a way as to leave a trail of concern, doubt and unanswered queries.  I hope Minister Dukes, when reflecting on the work he is about to undertake, will address the unfinished business.</P>
      <P>While Minister, Deputy Lowry stated that he would put a report in the Library of the House.  It is not the Price Waterhouse report but the Craig Gardner report on the semi-State bodies.  It was never put in the Dáil Library to clarify the issues examined at the time.  It is unfortunate that in Deputy Lowry's short spell as Minister this trail of destruction should have been left.  I have received representations from constituents of mine who are staff members of CIÉ.  The demoralisation of that State company is horrific. Those put in responsible positions by Deputy Lowry have failed to comply with the Government's agreements on wages.  The workers have had to go to the courts to have a mandate given to the company to honour its commitments to its staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach when replying should address the kernel of the issue.  There appears to be a time lapse to allow retrospective accountancy procedures to enable Deputy Lowry to give full answers.  Surely a company should already have tabled its accounts, all the records, liabilities and taxation matters for 1993 in the Companies Office.  The delay being allowed seems unusual. It is disingenuous of the Taoiseach to expect that it should be acceptable to this House and the <Col N="541" /> people.  There are questions to be answered and, in principle, those answers should already be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sad night for the House because the Government has failed in its primary duty to be accountable to the people.  It is unacceptable that someone should relinquish office under a cloud and not tender to the people an explanation as to how that came about.  It is unacceptable that someone should say: &ldquo;You have my head.  You will not have my explanation&rdquo;.  It is unacceptable for the Taoiseach to say he hopes Deputies will refrain from demanding answers Deputy Lowry has already said he is not in a position to give.</P>
      <P>Some of us live in the real world where the Revenue auditor can knock on our door.  That auditor cannot be brushed aside and told to come back in a week or fortnight for an explanation. One must be able to say where a transaction is accounted for.  If one cannot answer, one is in trouble.  Any Minister, especially one with business experience, should know that if he or she is conducting a business and keeping proper books of account then those books of account can be presented to their Taoiseach should they be asked for and the Minister can be acquitted.</P>
      <P>I reject with sadness the attitude of the Government in this debate.  They have said Deputy Lowry should have been given time in which to put a defence together.  If there were a defence, Deputy Lowry has been aware of the existence of this report for years.  If he had a defence he could have put it together within the 48 hours he was given between the time he was asked questions and when the Taoiseach called him to book last Saturday in Dublin.  If there was a plausible defence it could have been made.  In sincerity, if there was a defence the Taoiseach should not have asked Deputy Lowry to resign. If the Taoiseach really thought he could have put a defence together, he should have given Deputy Lowry the honour and decency of holding on to his job.  The Taoiseach cannot have it both ways. Nobody in Opposition demanded a resignation. Explanations were demanded.  There is no reason anyone conducting a business in this country cannot account for himself and show he has complied with the law if that is the case.</P>
      <P>If there was a good reason to allow the Deputy time, there was every good reason to allow him to keep his job.  The excuse given for what the Taoiseach has done to the Deputy &mdash; that he needed time to devote himself exclusively to building up his defence &mdash; does not wash.  The Taoiseach may think it a clever debating tactic in the House but the people have drawn their own conclusions and made their judgments.  They know they have been given a large dollop of whitewash.</P>

    <P>This occasion has brought Deputy Dukes back into Cabinet, which is a good thing.  This Government badly needs a competent, intelligent person to pursue this portfolio with vigour.  For <Col N="542" /> all his endearing and less endearing qualities, Deputy Dukes is a man of competence and vigour.  That is what this ramshackle coalition needs to see it out.  They need one member of the Cabinet to be remotely competent.</P>

      <P>In seriousness and humour, if there was a reason to give Deputy Lowry time to defend himself he should have been given that time.  Nobody on this side of the House denied him that, but if there was no possible defence he should have been willing to come to the House to say so.  The Taoiseach has said we should not ask questions which cannot be answered at this point.  The Revenue Commissioners will never answer those questions because every inspector and commissioner is sworn to secrecy in relation to this matter.  If given the Price Waterhouse report, they will be required to keep it confidential and the Taoiseach knows this.  I reiterate, therefore, my party's request to him to send inspectors to the two companies concerned so that all the records relevant to this controversy can be made public and the public can have an explanation, if not from the Government which owes it to them, from the inspectors who could deliver it to them.</P>

Not only has he had a distinguished ministerial career, he showed, as Deputy McDaid stated, exceptional statesmanship when Leader of the Opposition between 1987-9 when he enabled the then Government to put through an extremely rigorous programme in the national interest.  This was constructive and helpful.  It is good that this has been appreciated by the other side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the contributions made by a number of Deputies. Deputy Bertie Ahern raised the issue of whether Mr. Ben Dunne has an interest in Esat Digifone. I understand the company has issued a statement. There is no information available to us which would suggest that Mr. Ben Dunne has any involvement in the company.  I hope I can reassure the Deputy that the concerns he expressed are without foundation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern also raised the question of personal loans being given on favourable terms and suggested that it should possibly be looked at in the context of ethics legislation.  We will look at the matter to see if there is a loophole in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a need to reform the system of party political fundraising. Political parties and candidates obtain funds from private sources.  The Deputy drew a distinction, with which I agree, between contributions raised in a legitimate way to meet legitimate electoral expenses and any suggestion that people are being given money to do things in office for the benefit of those giving the money.  To my knowledge, it is a rare occurrence.  I do not know <Col N="544" /> of any instance where it happened in Irish political life but if it does or did happen, it is corrupt and distinct from normal legitimate party fundraising.  That is not to say there is not a case for reforming the system.  This is a matter which has been engaging the attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>Legitimate concern has been expressed by all sides about a suggestion that there is a pall of suspicion hanging over all Deputies and parties. The main Opposition party feels, because of an allegation about an unnamed former Minister of that party, that it has been unfairly put in a position where it is considered suspect.  This is not satisfactory or fair, either to the party concerned or to the individual or individuals whose names are being bandied about.  It is not right.  It is important that the matter is brought into the open and that those to whom no guilt can be attached are allowed to clear their names.  If guilt can be attached, the people concerned should be punished in the appropriate way.  A legitimate distinction should be made between normal party political fundraising which is conducted by all parties to one degree or another and anything which has the colour of corruption.</P>
    <P>There have been references to what has become known, probably by constant repetition, as &ldquo;the Price Waterhouse report&rdquo;.  I am not aware if there is such a report.  I have no information about it.  I have received no indication as to its contents or that it is of the dangerous character suggested in some of the contributions.  I agree with Deputies on all sides who feel, when there is a suggestion that such a report or document exists and that it contains information damaging to people in politics, that the non-availability of that information is damaging to politics, democracy and the political system.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the problem of what one can legally do to obtain a report about transactions which, allegedly, took place in the past in a private company.  We are talking about legislation that has retrospective effect.  If there is a report, it is the property of the people who commissioned it.  One has to have specific legal powers to obtain it and one can only obtain it for specified purposes.  We cannot introduce legislation tomorrow or next week which will have retrospective effect.  That would be contrary to constitutional norms.  We have to work in this matter with existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to those in possession of the report to make it available publicly.  That should be agreed by all sides.  I hope a private company would feel, where all parties make such an appeal, that it should be heeded.  That would be a much easier way of dealing with the matter for all concerned than having recourse to legislation which has not been designed for this purpose.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made suggestions as to which powers might be used if there is not voluntary disclosure of the relevant information, perhaps to a third party who would maintain confidentiality but investigate the matter.  I am <Col N="545" /> not in a position to make specific suggestions; it is a matter for negotiation, if there is voluntary disclosure, as to what the terms should be.  If there is not voluntary disclosure, Deputy Harney raised the possibility of using section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990.  One could also consider using section 19 (1).</P>
    <P>I have taken advice on the matter which I have discussed with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister of State at that Department who has specific responsibility for company law.  The advice I have received is that an application to use either of those powers would have to be grounded on specific allegations contained in an affidavit which would have to be substantiated before the court would make a decision.  Before deciding to take such a course of action, we need to do a lot more study than the time available has allowed.  I am not in a position to say if we will ever be able to use these powers for this purpose.  I do not wish the House to be under a misapprehension that we are about to make a decision to do this &mdash; we are not, because I do not know if it is legally possible.  There is no point engaging public funds in a legal wild-goose chase which leads nowhere in court because the legal basis for taking the action is insufficient. Any Deputy who is concerned about the standards of this House and the reputation of politicians of all parties, the overwhelming majority of whom are honourable people, should be concerned that such a matter should hang in the public record.  I hope the best way forward will be found by voluntary disclosure.  If that is not possible, we will have to look at other ways to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>A number of serious allegations were made in the House with which I would like to deal.  I do not want things which have been said, particularly by Deputy Woods, to remain on the record unchallenged.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lowry is entitled to the time necessary to assemble the information he needs to deal with any tax or other liability it might be suggested he has and, subsequently, to make a disclosure of the nature he needs to make to allay any public concerns.

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you have been kind enough to grant me a moment or two to make a brief personal statement.  I thank the Deputies on all sides of the House who have spoken of me in such warm terms this evening.  I am quite sure that level of warmth will continue, certainly with my colleagues on this side of the House.  It would be a little sanguine of me to expect the same level of cordiality to continue with Deputies on the other side.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe.  It is an act of terrible discourtesy to him that the Minister has not appeared.</P>
      <P>My question relates to a recently published AFRI report outlining Ireland's involvement in the arms industry.  Is the Minister aware this country is specifically exporting military goods to countries with appalling human rights records? What action does he intend taking on the matter?</P>
      <P>Given that Ireland currently holds the EU Presidency the Government should be highly embarrassed by the Action from Ireland report on military export licences.  As a neutral country Ireland should lead by example and comply with European guidelines.  Even though current procedures provide for applications for military licences to be referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs, AFRI reports that licences continue to be issued in Ireland for military exports to countries with poor human rights records.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the current procedures need to be tightened and that an interdepartmental committee involving his Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach should be established to vet the applications for military licences.  Our country should immediately be brought into line with EU guidelines for the export of military goods.</P>
      <P>I presume the AFRI report is highly embarrassing for the Government in relation to the whole question of the obscenities of the arms trade not only in Ireland but internationally and, more particularly, within the EU.  In its report AFRI states the export of military goods from Ireland is not subject to European controls. Under the Control of Exports Acts all military goods require a licence, regardless of destinations, and all applications are automatically referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report finds that destinations for which licences were issued this year include countries with very dubious human rights records, some of which are plainly undemocratic.  They include Argentina, Brazil, Jordan, Malaysia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.  AFRI states the Government is flouting four of the eight EU guidelines on the export of military goods.  Those covering respect for human rights in the country of final destination, the internal situation in that country, the preservation of regional peace and the risk that the equipment will be diverted or re-exported under undesirable conditions.  I want to highlight Singapore in that regard.  We export, freely in some cases and under licence in others, to Singapore.  The Singapore regime then exports the goods to countries with doubtful human rights <Col N="552" /> records.  This should be tightened up as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Andrews for raising this matter and AFRI for producing this interesting report.  As acknowledged in the report, my Department fully co-operated with AFRI in supplying factual information on our export control system.  It is worth stressing that there is nothing secretive about this system.  A booklet, Export Controls Made Easy, which outlines how Irish export controls are applied, has been produced by my Department and is available to the public.</P>
      <P>For reasons which reflect positively on our country, our direct experience of controlling strategic exports is less extensive and more recent than that of any of our EU partners, not excluding the smallest.  We were not a member of COCOM and our economy underwent its industrial development at a much later date.  Our focus on high-tech industries has also been more recent.  For the past two years, the Departments concerned, notably my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, have worked closely together to modernise our export control system in a manner which meets our obligations arising for membership of recently established international export control fora and is consistent with Irish foreign policy.  I have made the necessary ministerial orders bringing the new system into effect.</P>
      <P>In layman's terms, Ireland is not a producer of arms.  For at least two decades the IDA has had a deliberate policy of not considering any proposals from any company to establish in Ireland a business based on military goods.  However, it is inevitable that in an economy such as ours with its high technology base, goods will be manufactured and exported which have both military and civilian applications and even a small number which have purely military application.</P>
      <P>Any company wishing to export purely military goods from Ireland must obtain an export licence. An end-use certificate must be produced in all cases before the licence application can be processed.  The certificate details the end-use to which the goods will be put as well as the end-user of the goods.  A number of checks are then carried out, involving consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and other relevant Departments, before a final decision is taken.  Similar procedures apply when applications for licences to export dual-use goods, which are controlled in accordance with an EU regulation, are received.  Such applications constitute the bulk of export licence applications received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the specific points made in the AFRI report.  AFRI has stated that at least four of the eight EU common criteria have been flouted by the Irish authorities in licensing exports to the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Jordan, Malaysia, Singapore, <Col N="553" /> Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.  It appears that this statement is based on a misunderstanding.  The EU criteria cited by AFRI are factors which must be taken into account in assessing individual licence applications.  There is no implication that the presence of even the slightest concern on foot of any of these factors requires an EU member state to deny all licences to that country, regardless of the item in question. The nature and potential strategic use of the item for which a licence is being sought is of utmost significance when an application is being considered.</P>
    <P>The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is at the heart of Irish foreign policy and, as such, is an important factor in the input of the Department of Foreign Affairs to decisions on export licence applications.  With reference to the specific allegations made by AFRI in relation to the criterion on the respect of human rights, I am aware that NGOs such as Amnesty International may have expressed concerns about human rights in some of these countries mentioned in the report.  Such concerns form part of the broad consideration of licence applications.  We must bear in mind, however, that the annual report of Amnesty International routinely cites deficiencies in human rights performance in as many as 100 countries, not excluding Ireland.  It is also relevant that neither the UN Commission of Human Rights, UN General Assembly, High Commissioner for Europe have concluded that any of the countries named by AFRI is guilty of serious and systematic violations of human rights.</P>
    <P>In the context of a case by case examination of applications, the relevance of the good to be exported to a destination is important.  When the Control of Exports Order, 1996, was drafted, a requirement to obtain a licence to export security and paramilitary equipment such as electric shock batons, leg irons, shackles, gangchains, water cannons and riot control vehicles was included in the order.  This requirement did not derive from our participation in any of the export control regimes.  It is an unequivocal sign of our determination to ensure that these goods are not exported to repressive regimes.  The effect of each licence application on the preservation of regional peace, security and stability is taken into account as is the internal situation in the country of final destination, as an indication of the existence of tensions or internal armed conflicts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the existence of a risk that the equipment will be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions, we rely to a large extent on information we receive from media sources or from other countries, either through bilateral information or through the exchange of information within the export control regimes of which we are a member, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Missile Technology Control <Col N="554" /> Regime, the Australia Group and the Nuclear Suppliers Group.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Andrews will appreciate the importance of the electronics industry in Ireland, not least in employment terms.  I fully accept that some of the high-tech material produced in this country could, if it fell into the wrong hands, be used for the purpose of the development of weapons of mass destruction.  It is vital, therefore, that adequate export controls are in place when such technology is leaving our shores.  It is also important, however, that our controls serve their purpose and do not place an undue burden on our exporters as they strive to compete in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>Our recent membership of the international export control regimes is invaluable in enabling us to gradually acquire the expertise to operate an effective export control system, a system which not only ensures that we keep control of the exports of goods originating in this country but also ensures that Ireland is not used to circumvent the export controls of other EU member states which have had direct involvement over decades in the manufacture and export of military-related goods and technologies. Any assistance which organisations such as AFRI can provide in ensuring our system operates effectively is very welcome.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Dan Wallace.  Cork University Hospital accident and emergency department became totally overloaded last week with the result that the section could not accept any more patients. The situation was replicated today when it became almost impossible to cater for the demand placed on the hospital's service.  This is not surprising when the inadequacy of the department's layout and the lack of staff to provide the necessary lifesaving service is considered.  The situation is no better at the Mercy Hospital or the South Victoria Hospital. There is too great a demand on the services in those hospitals as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accident and emergency is a high risk area in terms of litigation and demands that the quality of the care and the clinical decision-making be of the highest standards to meet patient expectations and minimise the potential risk of legal action.  Staffing is a key component.  Staffing must have acceptable levels of seniority and experience to deliver a quality service at minimum cost and in the most efficient manner. It is stated in a report presented to the Minister for Health that the involvement of GPs at Cork University Hospital could save £1 million in the throughput of 100,000 people in the emergency services.  It is also recommended in that report and by nursing unions generally that staffing levels should be one per 1,500 patients. Examination of the situation in any of the three accident and emergency departments in Cork will <Col N="555" /> show that the staffing levels do not attain anywhere near that level.</P>
    <P>The Accident and Emergency Department in Cork University Hospital is underfunded and understaffed and there is a glaring lack of facilities, which is unacceptable.  It is not that the Minister has not been forewarned about the difficulties.  I raised this at the Southern Health Board over 12 months ago and on an Adjournment debate in the House.  Since then a review group was set up and reported in August 1995, but no action has been taken to alleviate the situation.  The lack of space, the lack of staff and the appalling facilities for children in the accident and emergency department are appalling.  A corner is set aside for children with a few toys and no privacy for assessment.  The Minister had no difficulty in providing £30 million for Limerick Regional Hospital, but the accident and emergency services in Cork are a forgotten entity.</P>
    <P>A letter which I received from an eminent emergency consultant physician stated that &ldquo;emergency health services at Cork University Hospital have been sadly neglected and are the poorest I have seen for an equivalent development country&rdquo;.  I call on the Minister to rectify this situation immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for allowing me to make a brief contribution.  I support what he said.  The situation at Cork University Hospital is unacceptable.  It is a service that people use at a time of trauma for both patient and families.  There is genuine concern that things will get so bad that the accident and emergency department will not be able to cope.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe outlined the major concern last week because there were not enough facilities to treat the large numbers of people needing to avail of the facility.  The facilities in the accident and emergency department at the hospital in Cork have been long documented, but there has been a poor response. At a time when huge resources are being spent in health care, we are the bottom of the ladder in relation to facilities.</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern at the fact that treatment is not available.  The medical and ambulance staff are overworked and understaffed, and the demands on medical services are great at this time of the year.  This is not helped by the present situation at Cork University Hospital.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary resources to remedy the unsatisfactory situation which cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In the recent past the accident and emergency department at Cork University Hospital has experienced severe pressures due to increased attendance at the department.  As a result, there was a temporary change in policy and GP referrals and inter-hospital transfers were <Col N="556" /> rerouted to other hospitals in the city.  However, during this period the hospital remained open and continued to operate under normal procedures for other admissions.  The hospital has now reverted to normal functions for all admissions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a working group on the reorganisation of accident and emergency services in Cork was established by the Southern Health Board in May 1995 to review the organisation of accident and emergency services in Cork.  The group met on a number of occasions under the chairmanship of Mr. Stephen Cusack, accident and emergency consultant at Cork University Hospital.  The group completed its report in March 1996 and I understand that its recommendations have been endorsed by the Southern Health Board, subject to a small number of modifications.  In recent days the board has forwarded a copy of the report for consideration within my Department.</P>
      <P>On preliminary examination of this report I note that it addresses key staffing, facilities and equipping needs of accident and emergency units in Cork.  I will consider the measures required to implement the report's recommendations in the light of considerable expertise gained in dealing with this problem in other hospitals in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Major medical advances and improvements in nutrition, housing, sanitary and water facilities have meant that people are living on average almost ten years longer than at the beginning of this century.  This has meant that we have a growing ageing population, and the need to continue to improve the services for these people is of paramount importance to all of us in public life and to those providing that care.</P>
      <P>Those who are old belong to a generation that did not enjoy for the greater part of their life anything like the kind of facilities which are available now.  In my constituency we are fortunate to have a standard of nursing and medical care of excellent quality in the Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles and in a range of nursing homes.</P>
      <P>I want to refer this evening to two cases that have been brought to my attention.  I am not asking the Minister to investigate the cases individually but to see how subventions to nursing homes could be reviewed in such cases. One is the case of a very old gentleman, all of whose family of five have now retired and on pensions.  These five individuals, dedicated to their father have, for the past year, raised from their own meagre pensions £20 a week to keep their father in a nursing home.  Their case was examined recently and they were advised that they would receive a subvention of about £23 a week.  Notwithstanding financial constraints and demands on the health services, this is something that should be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> The second example relates to members of families who should, in the normal way, contribute towards the maintenance of their parents and relations from whom they received the benefits we all receive from good parents, including, in some cases, inheritances of one kind or another but who, because they have left the area, or for other reasons, refuse to be involved in contributing to the maintenance of their parents.  In such circumstances the members of the family who remain at home may find themselves stretched to the limit to try to cope with the full cost.  There are more and more examples like this.  I am advocating a lack of responsibility on the part of those who should share the responsibility, but when one family has to carry a burden that is excessive, a way should be found to lighten the burden.</P>
    <P>The midwest region has made a major contribution to improving the services in the hospitals and community care areas.  I accept it is not possible to meet all the demands but if we cannot find a way in good economic times to look after the aged perhaps some of the other issues we tackle should be set in priorities.  I make that appeal to see what can be done to improve the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Deputy for his remarks and for drawing my attention to two categories of cases which perhaps the nursing home scheme does not fully take into account.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into operation on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives, first, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act and, second, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care have access to it.  The Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons will be well cared for and provides the health boards with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly locally and in a flexible manner.</P>
      <P>A person applying for subvention is assessed on his or her level of dependency and means to determine whether he or she qualifies for a subvention.  The maximum subvention rates payable under the new scheme are £70, £95 or £120 per week depending on the level of dependency of the person applying for subvention.  These rates represent a substantial contribution towards the costs of care in a nursing home and are a major improvement on the situation which existed prior to the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act when most persons in nursing homes did not receive any subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 just over £15 million was made available to the health boards to fund the subvention scheme.  This sum was repeated in 1996.  Earlier this year some health boards informed my Department that they were <Col N="558" /> experiencing difficulties in meeting their obligations under the Act.  Additional funding was allocated to these boards and the total funding available now stands at just under £17 million.  It should be noted that since the introduction of the Act to date, over £48 million has been made available to the health boards to fund subventions.  By 30 September 1996, 17,775 applications for nursing home subventions had been received and 9,515 had been approved.  My Department continues to monitor the financing of the subvention scheme closely to ensure that the funding made available will support the level of subventions approved.  As the Deputy may be aware, changes have been made to the subvention scheme under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, by amending regulations which came into effect on 31 July 1996.</P>
    <P>The first change increases the threshold above which the circumstances of a son or daughter are assessed by a health board to establish if he or she is in a position to contribute towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a parent who has qualified for a nursing home subvention.  This amendment will have the effect of reducing the amount of time spent by health boards in assessing the circumstances of sons or daughters who are clearly not in a position to contribute towards the nursing home costs of a parent.  Sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so and the State recognises this contribution in the tax relief it gives on such payments.</P>
    <P>The second change is to permit health boards to contract beds in nursing homes above the number contracted on 1 September 1993 and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention payable in such cases.  This amendment is to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet their need.</P>
    <P>I am aware that differences of interpretation have arisen in relation to the obligation on health boards to disregard a sum equivalent to one-fifth of the old age pension in calculating the amount of subvention to be paid.  My Department will shortly clarify the situation to ensure that each applicant retains such a sum for his or her personal use.</P>
    <P>A nursing home subvention is not intended to cover the full cost of a nursing home fee but to provide assistance towards the cost of nursing home care for those who cannot do so from their own resources.  I am aware that certain difficulties are being encountered by some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  I will continue to endeavour to address these problems, and the issue of increasing the subvention rates, within the resources available to me.</P>
    <P>The provision of subvention under the Act must be consistent with the current health policy that the elderly should be maintained in dignity <Col N="559" /> and independence in their homes.  The scheme, therefore, must be based on medical advice about the most appropriate care setting in individual care cases.  I assure the Deputy I will continue to honour the commitments set out in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, for the development of services for the elderly both in the community and residential care.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has particular cases in mind where he believes anomalies exist perhaps he would write to me to bring them to my attention and I will have them dealt with as favourably as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue to complain about the lack of progress in relation to sanctioning the extension to Ballintemple national school.  Two years ago during the Cork by-elections the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, visited the school and gave a commitment to build an extension.  In early 1995 parents and the board of management were led to believe that work would commence if planning permission was obtained from Cork Corporation.  In September 1995 Cork Corporation granted planning permission for the extension and refurbishment of the school, yet the Minister has refused to give the go-ahead and has treated the parents, pupils and staff with disregard and indifference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 160 children attend the school.  It is the only co-educational primary school on the south side of the city.  Because of the high demand for places there is a real danger that children from the parish will be refused a place in the school next September.  There were over 65 applicants in 1996 and the school has class sizes of up to 38, which is much too high, because of the shortage of accommodation.  The school was built in 1904. Parents have complained angrily about the overcrowded conditions and they are particularly concerned about the health implications.  The conditions are appalling and totally unacceptable in the modern era.  Another consequence of the overcrowding is that from now on brothers and sisters from the parish may not be accommodated in the school and may have to attend schools outside the parish.  The most alarming development has been the recent notification received by the principal that public liability insurance will no longer be available to the school in January because of the conditions and <Col N="560" /> overcrowded nature of the school complex.  This is an urgent matter that demands an immediate response from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I tabled Dáil questions on 5 December 1995 and 25 July 1996 requesting funding for this project but the Minister refused on both occasions.  I am disappointed the Minister is not present to respond.  I attended the meeting with the parents, the board of management and the Minister in 1995 when we received a clear indication from her that if planning permission was received from Cork Corporation the go-ahead would be given almost immediately afterwards.  At that meeting the Minister used the excuse of the planning permission issue as the basis for the difficulties in proceeding.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funds to enable this badly needed extension to proceed, to treat the parents, teachers and pupils with the respect they deserve and to please honour previous electoral commitments.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department's current position on the proposed extension to Ballintemple national school.  The Minister for Education is aware the school has a current staffing of a principal, four assistants, a shared remedial assistant and an enrolment of 161 pupils.</P>
      <P>She is aware that the accommodation at the school is in need of improvement and, for this reason has included the school in the 1996 capital programme.  It is intended that a two classroom extension will be provided.  The inclusion of the project in the programme enables the project to progress through the architectural planning process.</P>
      <P>The current position on the project is that the planning work is now complete and the contract documentation is ready.  A decision on the timing of the tender and contract processes must be taken in the light of existing contractual commitments and the funds which will be available in 1997.  Both of these matters are under consideration at present and I expect the process will be completed shortly.  At that stage, the Minister will be in a position to make a decision on the tender process for the school.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure the project is progressed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 December 1996.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, made at the EU Research Council during Ireland's Presidency of the EU; the further priorities, if any, he has during the Presidency in respect of research; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be able to report solid progress if not outright success on all the items on the Irish Presidency agenda including the specific Presidency initiatives we undertook.</P>
      <P>Two research councils were scheduled in the Presidency calendar, the first on 7 October and the second one on Thursday of this week, 5 December.</P>
      <P>All of the items on the agenda for the December council have important implications and I would list them as follows:</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency has been very very conscious of the BSE/CJD concerns all over Europe.  The Presidency has drawn up council conclusions which call for an enhanced research effort.  I am pleased to inform the House that the council later this week will approve these conclusions, which include funding for a major research action plan on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, including BSE and human related diseases.  The conclusions take on board the report of a high-level scientific group chaired by the Austrian scientist Dr. Weissman, which recommended targeted research in specific areas. I have no doubt that news of new funding for research on this important topic will be welcomed by consumer, agricultural and health interests and will also act to restore consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>I inherited from the last Presidency a proposal from the Commission to provide 700 MECU additional funding for the EU's current Fourth Framework Programme, as part of a review process agreed by research Ministers in 1994.  This was rendered redundant by the ECOFIN council's decision not to breach the Community's financial perspectives.  Nevertheless the Irish Presidency has managed to salvage some of the proposal and what seemed like a non-starter back in July has regained centre stage.  I am confident that the Irish Presidency will secure agreement at council this week which will deliver additional funding for research under the fourth framework programme of up to 100 MECUs for the period 1997/98.  This will provide funding for TSE to which I have referred and for other worthwhile projects.  In this context, I have submitted a Presidency initiative which I believe will allow agreement to be reached on Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The launch of discussions on the European Union's Fifth Framework Programme of Research and Technological Development and <Col N="562" /> Demonstration covering 1998/2002 during the Irish Presidency was a major achievement.  The Fourth Framework Programme embraces all Community research and technology development programmes with funding of 13.1 BECU. We are now engaged in a major debate to decide the guidelines which will serve as the basis for a detailed Commission proposal for the fifth framework programme due next Spring.</P>
    <P>Early in our term, and with the encouragement of the Presidency, the EU Commission published its strategy paper for the fifth framework programme, &ldquo;Inventing Tomorrow: Europe's Research at the service of its people&rdquo;.  An orientation debate took place at the October council and following further encourgement from the Presidency, the EU Commission has just published a Working Document on the fifth framework programme.  I have presented a Presidency paper to focus matters and this will move the debate forward next Thursday.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that my continued efforts to have the EU Action Plan on Innovation completed during the Irish Presidency have paid dividends.  This follows the Green Paper on Innovation which was published earlier this year. The plan has now been cleared by the EU Commission and will be presented to the December research council and the following week to the European Summit in Dublin.  The plan is a comprehensive response to the need to put innovation in all its diversity and complexity at the heart of industrial and economic policy and mirrors in many ways the approach in our own White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation which I recently published.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing items, I have also taken two Presidency initiatives to coincide with national Presidency objectives &mdash; drugs and SMEs.  The drugs issue is a major priority for this Government and my Presidency initiative on drugs in the research area complements this wider process.  The initiative relates to the contribution which the European scientific community can make to the fight against drug abuse and detection.</P>
    <P>On 12 November, a very successful high level workshop on <i>Research on the Medical Socio Economic and Detection Issues of Drug Abuse</i> was held in Brussels as part of the Irish Presidency initiative.  All 15 member states made valuable inputs to the recommendations in the report of the workshop.  These recommendations have been reflected in the council conclusions which, I am confident, will be agreed by research Ministers this week and will in turn feed into the Dublin Summit on 13-14 December.</P>
    <P>On SMEs, Thursday's council is set to approve a set of Presidency-initiated conclusions which aim at making it easier for SMEs to participate in framework programme activities.  This is an important achievement which recognises the significant contribution that SMEs can make to economic growth, and the fact that technology is vital if SMEs are to make that contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> Turning briefly to other matters the council will adopt Conclusions on the progress by the JRC, Joint Research Centre, implementing the 1994 council decision on the fourth framework programme which required the JRC to adopt a more market orientated approach.  These conclusions will require the JRC to submit its future strategy plans during 1997.</P>
    <P>Ireland will chair an important meeting later in December dealing with S &amp; T co-operation between EU member states and third countries in the Mediterranean region.  This euro med monitoring committee meeting will establish terms of reference for future co-operation, a research work programme and so on.  The meeting is a breakthrough in that it puts these arrangements on a permanent footing.  Up to now we have had to rely largely on the goodwill of the last three Presidencies &mdash; Spain, France, Italy, coincidentally, all Mediterranean countries.</P>
    <P>Finally, negotiations on a bilateral S &amp; T co-operation agreement between the EU and South Africa have been successfully concluded and I, as President-in-Office on behalf of the council, will jointly sign the agreement <i>en marge</i> of Thursday's council, together with Commissioner Edith Cresson and the South African Ambassador to the European Union.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, and as will be self-evident, I believe that our Presidency will be seen as an unqualified success &mdash; producing key strategy Papers and moving the debate on; breaking deadlock in others and achieving real progress; promoting essential research themes such as BSE and getting full support for key measures on drugs and SMEs.</P>
    <P>The foundations for this success were laid last year through a process of meticulous and detailed planning and negotiations undertaken by my officials, and the excellent relations and undertaking they developed with key officials in the Commission, the Council Secretariat, and the member states.  I would like to pay a special tribute to all of them and to the general public service backup we got for our Presidency efforts. It is nice to be able from time to time to acknowledge the sterling work done by our public servants.</P>
    <P>I also visited capitals of member states and had frequent and detailed discussions with Commissioner Cresson which provided the basis for the excellent working relationship as characterised by our dealings over the past six months and indeed beyond.</P>

      <P>FÁS craft courses are those involving an apprenticeship leading to a specific craft certificate and the rules governing such courses are jointly overseen by FÁS and the craft subcommittees for appropriate trades.  The rates of payment for participants on these courses are craft related and are agreed with the various subcommittees which are representative of employer and trade union interests.  Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me to interfere with these rates to incorporate adult dependant allowances.</P>
      <P>The rate of payment to participants on non-craft training courses is based on a person's social welfare status prior to commencement of such courses.  Examples of non craft courses include specific skills training, skills foundation and enterprise training.  The level of remuneration is based on the long-term rate of unemployment assistance plus allowance in respect of dependants as certified by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided on 14 February 1995 to accept the central <Col N="565" /> recommendation in the Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment that a local employment service be put in place to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed.  It was decided that the service should be established in the 12 original partnership areas and two non-partnership areas, namely Clare and Kildare.</P>
      <P>A key objective for the successful implementations of the LES was to ensure that each area's plan was tailored to meet local needs and to ensure involvement from key local, interested organisations.  While this process may have delayed the initial stage of the LES, it will ensure that the operation of the service is likely to be more successful, given the level of prior local agreement reached.</P>
      <P>A substantial amount of groundwork was needed to get the service up and running.  The preparation of individual area plans for the LES involved a co-ordinated and concentrated approach from many organisations working at local level to help the unemployed.  During 1995 and early in 1996 the main work for each of the LES areas involved agreeing an LES plan, setting up a structure locally to deliver the service, securing office accommodation, identifying and training staff and liaising with my Department on implementation matters.</P>
      <P>Throughout 1996, the service has come on stream progressively in the different selected areas.  To date in 1996 in excess of 7,800 clients have availed of the service and many are actively engaged in guidance, training and placement activities under the auspices of the LES.  By the end of the year, all 14 first phase areas will be open and providing a service to clients.  I hope to extend the service to four new areas in 1997, following an evaluation which will be completed later this month and which will identify the lessons to be learned to date from the first phase.</P>
      <P>I would anticipate that from a total budget of £6 million for the LES in 1996 there will be a saving of approximately £2 million.  This is to be expected in view of the time involved in setting up the service, as I have just mentioned.</P>

      <P>The decision by ISME, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, to stay out of the talks on a follow-up agreement to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has been raised on a number of occasions both at ministerial and official level with the <Col N="566" /> organisation.  I believe that ISME ought to be party to the talks, making a constructive contribution from within the process; I said as much to them at the recent opening of their new offices, and again at their conference in Killarney last week.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that they have not been disposed to participate.  Active participation in the process, rather than remaining critically aloof, must surely be a more positive approach. Ultimately, however, the choice as to whether or not to participate is one for ISME themselves to make, and that choice must be respected.</P>

      <P>The location of industry in particular areas of the country is a matter for the day-to-day administration of the agencies under my remit and not one in which I have any direct function.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to the areas mentioned, however, as I indicated in reply to a question from Deputy O'Keeffe on 22 October last, Cork city and its environs are increasingly well placed as a highly marketable location, as evidenced by 5,579 overseas jobs in County Cork over the last five years compared to a figure of 14,106 for County Dublin.  I indicated in that reply that IDA Ireland is acutely aware of its responsibility to each region and is achieving a reasonable spread of investment across the country.  I am satisfied that Forbairt and Shannon Development have a similar approach, and it goes without saying that the relevant county enterprise boards will be doing their utmost for their respective areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the designation of industrial zones, County Clare already has one of the most significant in Ireland in the Shannon free zone. And Cork has three zones designated under the enterprise areas scheme.  My view on designation is that this is a valuable way to target incentives at specific areas of need, but only retains its usefulness in the context of targeting and selectivity.  Without this, the benefits are dissipated, with the potential for losses to the Exchequer without corresponding gains.</P>
      <P>Last October, I announced plans in relation to industrial land sales under which (i) existing properties will be offered for sale, using commercial criteria, to sitting tenants and (ii) the private sector will have the lead role in the provision of industrial holdings.  I am arranging to forward a copy of the relevant press release to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 35 and 37 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Jobstart is a recruitment subsidy scheme aimed at enticing employers to take on those who are three years or more unemployed and is being introduced against a background where such persons are often by-passed when it comes to filling vacancies.  Accordingly the programme is not applicable to those who become self employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Jobstart employers can be paid a recruitment subsidy of £80 per week for one year when filling new or existing vacancies with an eligible unemployed person.  In order to prevent abuse of the scheme, a written declaration is made by all employers when applying for approval to recruit under Jobstart that the proposed rate of pay and conditions of employment are in line with prevailing pay and conditions for other comparable employees in the company; the company/organisation has had no redundancies within the previous 26 weeks, that they will not dismiss/make redundant an existing employee in order to recruit an employee under Jobstart and that they will undertake to notify FÁS immediately of any redundancies arising in the company/organisation during the Jobstart <Col N="569" /> period; where applicable, trade union agreement within the company/employment location has been given, in respect of jobs which are the subject of the application; they will permit such inspection as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment or FÁS may consider necessary for the effective administration of the programme.</P>
    <P>As Jobstart has only been in existence for a short time, it is too early to make any pronouncement on its success or otherwise.  Past experience has shown that recruitment incentives require a lead-in time before becoming established.</P>
    <P>However, the take-up rate to date has been disappointing and steps have been taken to raise the profile of the programme and improve its promotion on the ground by actions such as arranging high profile regional launches and advertising on local radio, local magazines and newspapers and local cable television.  In addition presentations have been organised for regional/local employer bodies and brochures mailed to companies.</P>
    <P>All of these activities are being arranged by FÁS as part of its operational responsibilities for the delivery of Jobstart.  A saving of £800,000 is anticipated due to the slow take up rate of the programme.</P>
    <P>Also in an effort to boost participation in the programme, I recently met the various employer organisations, including IBEC, ISME and the SFA, and ICTU and the INOU, to discuss how best they could assist in promoting this programme.  All of these organisations reaffirmed to me their full support for the programme and agreed on a range of further measures to promote it.</P>
    <P>The promotion and administration of Jobstart is an operational matter for FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act 1987, as is any costs associated with these activities.</P>
    <P>Data on the marital status of employees engaged under Jobstart are not available as such information is not required to determine eligibility of potential employees or payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>The total number of participants on Jobstart as of 27 November 1996 was 455.  The most up to date breakdown by age and sex of those employed under Jobstart is that of 15 November 1996, the details of which I am giving in the table which I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Enterprise and Employment my priority in relation to any new national economic and social programme is the maintenance and improvement of the competitiveness of Irish-based enterprise, the creation of an environment for business which creates jobs, increases employment and reduces unemployment.</P>
      <P>A thriving, vibrant and competitive enterprise sector is essential in terms of improving living standards, progressing social cohesion and the creation of the maximum number of self-sustaining jobs.  The Government has acknowledged that the NESC, and NESF, have identified the issues for a new programme and indeed have provided very useful recommendations.</P>
      <P>To date the talks are centered on five key strategic areas; macro-economic policy, comprising public expenditure, pay, tax and PRSI; action to promote enterprise and jobs; action to modernise enterprise and further develop workplace partnership; action to modernise the public sector; action for greater social inclusion and a focus on equality.</P>
      <P>My Department is playing a full role in terms of its contribution to the current negotiations on a new national programme.  As the negotiations are ongoing, it would not be helpful at this stage to elaborate on particular inputs.</P>

      <P>As part of ongoing contact, the pharmaceutical industry here has brought to my attention in recent months a number of issues which could have an impact on employment in the future.  These issues, which are being examined in my Department and elsewhere, include the future tax environment for industry, environmental concerns such as waste disposal facilities, and trade-pricing of pharmaceutical products in the context of the European Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, investment by overseas firms in pharmaceutical green field projects and expansions has been substantial and is estimated at over £900 million since 1990.  The pharmaceutical industry employs about 10,000 people i.e. over 50 per cent above the 1990 level, and exports £4 billion per annum, the bulk of <Col N="571" /> production, and contributed over £150 million in corporation tax last year.  The industrial development agencies continue to promote actively the development of the pharmaceutical sector which provides high quality sustainable employment.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year, I approved 132 projects under the EU employment initiative &mdash; which encompasses three strands, NOW (New Opportunities for Women), Horizon (Disabled and Disadvantaged) and Youthstart &mdash; to run up to the end of 1997.  The total European Social <Col N="572" /> Fund allocation amounted to £26 million approximately and details of each project promoter and the amount allocated to each project are outlined in the following tables.  It is expected that all projects will utilise fully their allocations.</P>
      <P>A provision of £415,000 was included in my Department's 1996 Estimates to provide matching funds for projects, sponsored by my Department's agencies under this initiative, to operate up to the end of 1997.  Following a review in the context of my Department's recent Supplementary Estimate for 1996, it is expected that an amount of £207,000 will not be required in 1996.  Accordingly, I am seeking the provision for this expenditure in 1997.</P>
      <P>Early in 1997, there will be a further call for proposals under the employment initiative.  The amount of European Social Fund moneys available will be approximately £32 million and the projects to be selected will operate in the period 1998-99.  I anticipate equally that all the ESF moneys available for this second phase will be absorbed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>In 1994, 175 new jobs were created in counties Cavan and Monaghan, with 120 new jobs being created for the same area in 1995.  In respect of companies assisted by IDA Ireland, Information on employment and new jobs is obtained from the Forfás annual employment survey.  As the 1996 survey is not yet completed, this information is not available for 1996.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of IDA Ireland, the Border counties, with the exception of County Louth, have not attracted new IDA assisted investment in recent years.  Any recent new jobs created in overseas companies in counties Cavan and Monaghan are as a result of developments in existing companies which have increased employment levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland will continue to promote Ireland including counties Cavan and Monaghan for overseas mobile investment while encouraging the expansion of existing overseas companies <Col N="577" /> located there.  In the final analysis, however, it is the incoming investment that decides where to locate by reference to the particular needs of the enterprise in question.</P>

      <P>I understand that private rental accommodation, particularly in Dublin, has increased dramatically over the past two years and the difficulties being experienced in obtaining insurance cover for house contents reflect the increased demand for cover in this high risk sector of the insurance market.</P>
      <P>The Irish Insurance Federation has indicated that renting of private accommodation gives rise to security problems arising from shared access to flats and apartments and the high turnover of tenants which leaves flats and apartments very susceptible to burglary.  Because of the excessive level of risk involved particular insurers specialising in this market may limit contents cover to only a limited number of flats or apartments within a building or apartment complex.  Tenants may also be able to obtain insurance cover from their landlords' insurers.</P>

      <P>There is no funding available to my Department under the special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation to support the development of industrial infrastructure.  There are two measures under the programme which can be used to support the development of industrial infrastructure, sub-programme 2 (c) Measure 2 &mdash; (community-led development) and sub-programme 5 measure 2 &mdash; new industrial development services.

    <P>The Deputy may appreciate that investment in industrial infrastructure requires to be underpinned by investment in roads, water and sanitary services, electricity and telecommunications.

      <P>In 1995 there were critical shortages of land in key towns such as Sligo, Letterkenny, Cavan and Drogheda, and there were no advance factories available in the Border counties.  Since IDA took over responsibility for industrial property in January 1996, progress has been made in the Border counties which includes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> Cavan</P>
    <P>&mdash; IDA Ireland has concluded negotiations with Cavan County Council on a joint initiative to provide an appropriate land bank in Cavan town.  Subject to final approval by both bodies, consultants will be appointed to plan the overall development of this site prior to seeking the provision of an advance factory by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Monaghan</P>
    <P>&mdash; IDA has recently upgraded its Knockaconny Industrial Park near Monaghan town.  IDA will arrange for the private sector to construct an advance factory on this site.  The advance factory in Monaghan will be provided following the provision of an advance factory in Cavan town, and will also be dependent on the general availability of factory space in the area at that time.</P>
    <P>Sligo</P>
    <P>&mdash; Approximately 27 acres of land has been acquired in Finisklin, Sligo for industrial development purposes.  IDA has concluded a deal with a private developer for the provision of an advance building there. Planning permission has been obtained and construction will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>Louth</P>
    <P>&mdash; An additional four acres was acquired in Dundalk to provide proper access to the IDA land bank and planning permission had been obtained by a local property developer to construct an advance factory. This is due for completion in June 1997.</P>
    <P>A range of options are being considered in conjunction with the Louth County Council to provide a 50 acre land bank in the Drogheda area.  To date the combined efforts of the local authority and IDA Ireland have not resulted in the identification of property which can be purchased at realistic and competitive prices.  This task is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Donegal</P>
    <P>&mdash; IDA had concluded an agreement with Donegal County Council to acquire 28 acres of land in Letterkenny to develop a business park.  IDA is currently working on the planning and development of this park.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have facilitated the provision of these lands in the Border counties largely through the mechanism of land swaps and, given the state of the transactions involved together with the fact that they are in the final stages of negotiations, it is not possible to specify the amount of expenditure by the IDA.  However, the provision of advance factories in Dundalk, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Donegal by the private sector will involve moneys in excess of £4 million.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland property policy for the Border counties seeks to ensure that a balance exists <Col N="581" /> between the demand for industrial land and buildings and the supply of suitable projects.  IDA endeavours to influence companies to locate in specific areas but, ultimately, the choice of location is made by the particular company itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The electronics sector is undoubtedly the predominant force for new industrial investment in Ireland at the present time.</P>
      <P>This sector is all-pervasive through life and business encompassing as it does computers, telecommunications, consumer goods, financial services, healthcare, security automative and industrial automation.  Given this broad spectrum of segments supporting activity in the electronics sector, I am confident that the current focus on electronics is a positive one.</P>
      <P>The electronics sector has experienced rapid growth world-wide over the past twenty years and Ireland has benefited substantially from its remarkable growth.  Overall, the electronics sector continues to outperform others both as regards payback to the economy and durability of companies established.  In recent years many key players have chosen Ireland as a base and we now have world class examples of success and achievement in the sector.  These companies are engaged in a range of sectors, from wafer design and fabrication, systems, components and peripherals to communications, network products and software and are proving to be ideal role models to attract others to follow.</P>
      <P>The electronics sector matches well with our competitive strengths.  For growing companies our tax structure is attractive, while the demographics of people with skills and a strong work ethic, puts us in a competitive position.  In 1995 over a third of the total employment in IDA assisted companies was in the electronics sector. Ireland wins nearly a quarter of greenfield electronic manufacturing investment in Europe. In software, we are clearly the prime location in Europe for new investment.</P>
      <P>Ireland's policy for the development of the sector is driven primarily by value for money objectives and we continue to insist on strong payback to the economy for the investment of taxpayer funds.  We seek to secure a mix of young, aggressive, fast growth companies such as Gateway 2000 and Dell, and the long established companies such as Intel, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sector generates expenditures of approximately £2.00 billion per annum in the Irish economy of which purchases of Irish made components and supplies are currently worth <Col N="582" /> nearly £600 million per annum.  Up to 10,000 jobs in indigenous supplier companies have been generated out of the Irish linkages within electronics.</P>
    <P>Given the rapidly changing nature of the electronics sector and its increasing importance to industrial development and employment creation in Ireland, all segments of the sector are kept under review both by my Department and the Industrial Development Agencies.  In addition, IDA regularly overviews progress in individual companies established in Ireland.</P>
    <P>These reviews indicate that the electronics sector is generally buoyant and confirm the overall strength of the sector in this country. Essentially, we have built strategic strength in this sector with quality suppliers and we now have more stronger companies with integrated functions based in Ireland than heretofore.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some companies in the sector whose operations have been identified as being at risk.  This is not unique to the electronics sector.  However, the IDA endeavour to persuade companies to add a range of business functions here to supplement their manufacturing operations.  It is IDA's aim that more and more overseas companies should deepen their roots in Ireland so that they can survive and grow.  Nearly half of the IDA'a resources are dedicated to such development work in the current organisation structure.</P>
    <P>In essence, the IDA's strategy for the sector is built around a number of core criteria so as to maximise the benefit of the sector to Ireland, but minimise the risk of decline.  We compete for investments across a broad range of segments in the sector to achieve a balance.  The objective is to ensure that we have in Ireland the long-term winners, while accepting the inevitability that some companies will face difficulties from time to time and may be forced to downsize or even close.</P>
    <P>As in the past, Government policy will aim to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive location for enterprises in the electronics sector through ensuring the continued availability of a well educated workforce and a competitive operating environment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that our focus on the electronics sector is the correct one and that the sector in Ireland will continue its impressive growth record notwithstanding occasional fluctuations in individual company fortunes, and specific segments, over time.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on this topic which I answered on 22 October 1996.  The detailed information report on the activities of the CEBs from 1993 to end 1995, which is not an evaluation as such and to which I referred in my reply on 22 October, is close to being finalised and will be published as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The external evaluator appointed under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99, is continuing her review of the local enterprise subprogramme under which county enterprise boards are funded. The review is expected to be completed by the end of this year and presented to the monitoring committee of the operational programme at its spring 1997 meeting.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply on 22 October, this is the first year in which a system has been introduced for allocating resources to county enterprise boards taking account of factors such as population levels, area capacity and the quality of the enterprise plan prepared by each city and county enterprise board.  Funding will be allocated to each board in 1997 on a similar basis taking into account the performance of CEBs and their expenditure patterns in 1996.  Future allocation decisions will of course take into account relevant conclusions from the reviews.</P>

      <P>In my statement at the publication of the Report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry on 30 July 1996, I said that the indigenous industry was a vital one.  I agreed with the commission when it pointed out in its report:</P>
      <P>The social, political and cultural role of the indigenous newspaper industry which distinguishes it from other industries consists primarily in its duty and in its ability to reflect a sense of national identity in an informative, integrative but also critical fashion.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, I also indicated my support in principal for the commission's recommendations that came within my Department's remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 November 1996, I reported to Government in regard to my role in co-ordinating the work of the various Departments on the commission's recommendations.  The Government has approved my intention to revert to them concerning legislation in relation to my own area of responsibility.  Specifically this legislation concerns below cost selling, merger control, <Col N="584" /> regulation of ownership and concentration of media ownership.</P>
    <P>On foot of the Government's recent decision, I am preparing legislative proposals on these issues and I expect to bring them to Government in early 1997.  There are very complex legal and economic issues involved in this work.  I am taking appropriate advice on these matters before I bring forward specific proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>The recommendations relating to FÁS and the Labour Relations Commission do not require legislation.  I am ensuring that those bodies will provide all the necessary assistance to the industry.  Other Ministers will be pursuing matters appropriate to their own Departments.</P>
    <P>I have to say, in addition, that legislation or other Government action alone will not secure the future of a vibrant indigenous newspaper industry.  Charting a thriving industry for the future is of course primarily in the hands of the industry itself.  They have the significant task of making newspapers more relevant to the needs of the modern marketplace for news and views, and also to the changing lifestyles and habits of our society.  Equally, the commission identified the task of improving competitiveness as a key one.</P>
    <P>The competitiveness agenda is not just confined to labour costs and numbers, important as these are, but must embrace issues such as work practices, printing, technology and distribution.  The Irish newspaper industry must be prepared to confront these problems themselves.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland actively pursues prospects for new inward investment, as well as encouraging existing investors to expand their operations and locate additional functions in Ireland.</P>
      <P>When promoting sites in Ireland to potential overseas investors, IDA provides information on availability of relevant skills, education and infrastructure.  In this regard IDA highlights the availability of third level institutions and FÁS training centres in its marketing of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The availability and quality of skills in Ireland is one of the key competitive advantages we have in attracting inward investment to Ireland.  This has been, and continues to be, attested to by the overseas companies located here and it is imperative that we maintain this competitive advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Steps have been taken by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Education to <Col N="585" /> ensure that the future needs of industry, both indigenous and overseas, for specialist software and electronic skills can be met through universities and regional technical colleges and additional places have already been made available.</P>
    <P>With further substantial growth anticipated in the telemarketing business over the next few years, it is also important that language skills continue to be available to meet projected requirements.  Accordingly, my Department and IDA Ireland have been working with FÁS to ensure that sufficient foreign language skills are available in the short term and with the Department of Education in regard to this issue for the long term.  As a result, a number of specialised courses have been made available during the year and this effort will continue.</P>
    <P>The decision on where an inward investing company locates is based on a wide range of factors such as availability of buildings, transportation facilities and costs, support services locally and availability of skills.  In the final analysis, it is the incoming investor who decides where to locate by reference to the particular needs of the enterprise in question, including the availability of vocational skills.  In that way the correlation between the location of inward investment projects and skills availability is maximised.</P>

      <P>As part of the early warning system, an interagency group was set up by my Department whose role is to ensure that mechanisms are in place in the relevant State agencies, to enable the early identification of companies at risk.  This will allow these agencies to arrange the appropriate interventions in order to facilitate companies in dealing with their difficulties.  In line with this objective, IDA (Ireland) which is a member of the group, is keeping the situation at Fruit of the Loom under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Fruit of the Loom has placed virtually all of its production staff on a three day working week, with effect from 1 July 1996.  Initially, it was envisaged that this arrangement would continue until year end. However, on 8 November 1996, the company announced that it was extending short-time working into the first quarter of 1997.  The company has stated that the continuing softness in European consumer products markets, which has led to a decline in demand for its products is the main reason for this extended period of short-time <Col N="586" /> working.  I am naturally very disappointed that Fruit of the Loom has been forced to take this decision.  It must be recognised however, that this decision was dictated by current market forces.</P>
    <P>I should add that, following the company's announcement of short-time working, last June, I met the chief executive of the Fruit of the Loom Inc. in the US and outlined my concerns regarding the overall situation at the company.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy, that in conjunction with IDA Ireland, both I and my Department are keeping the situation at Fruit of the Loom under active review.  I have asked the IDA to continue its close contact with the management of the company and to give it every possible support in its efforts to restore full-time working at Fruit of the Loom at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from developments which have taken place in recent years, I am satisfied that FÁS is addressing the problem of equal access for men and women to training courses and employment schemes in a satisfactory manner.</P>
      <P>Participation by women in FÁS training and employment courses has increased steadily in recent years.  In 1995, approximately 35,000 women, or 39.4 per cent of total throughput, completed either a training course or employment programme.  This figure represents an increase of 3.4 per cent in the ratio of women to men, over the previous year.  In terms of actual numbers of women participants, the year-on-year increase was almost 30 per cent.  Through its action programme, FÁS has continually sought more and better ways of meeting women's training and employment needs and I am satisfied that the increase in the numbers of women availing of FÁS services provides ample evidence to suggest that its efforts in this regard are bearing fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While training programmes are open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking employment, priority of access is given to persons on the live register, regardless of gender.  In 1995, 42.2 per cent of those completing a FÁS training programme and 37.4 per cent of those completing a Community Employment (CE) Programme, the largest temporary employment initiative, were women.  A major and innovative decision was taken in April of this year, which now enables adult dependants of persons on the live register, who are eligible to participate on the CE <Col N="587" /> programme, to adopt their partner's eligibility and participate in the programme in their place.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, FÁS has operated an Action Programme for Women to maximise the participation of women in all its programmes. FÁS has also been providing return to work and enterprise training courses which have a high proportion of female participation particularly among home makers.  In a further response to the need for flexibility in this area, FÁS has advised me that they are currently undertaking a pilot initiative aimed at developing and testing new ways of delivering training for women.  This initiative, which is being piloted under the NOW or (New Opportunities for Women) programme, aims to provide locally-based training in partnership with community groups.  This training is delivered in a flexible manner to suit the needs and circumstances of participants</P>
    <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for childcare facilities for women returning to work, and contributes over £5 million per annum to community based child care provision by way of support for CE projects.  Over 130 CE projects have such a child care dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community based child care for women undertaking training or education and for participants on community employment.</P>

      <P>Using the powers available under the Insurance Act, 1989, the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology has appointed two authorised officers to carry out an investigation into the closure of the firm referred to by the Deputy.  Until such time as he has received the report of the authorised officers, it would be inappropriate comment on the circumstances surrounding the closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last annual return together with accounts for the firm concerned, filed with the Companies Office, was for the year 1993.  The annual returns for the years 1994 and 1995 are outstanding.  In cases where a company has failed to file annual returns for two consecutive years, the company may be struck off the Companies Office' register under section 12 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982.  In 1995, almost 13,000 companies were struck off the register and for 1996 the estimated figure is 11,000.  The process of selecting <Col N="588" /> companies for strike off is done at random by means of a computer programme.  The particular company referred to by the Deputy was not extracted by this programme.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated to the House by the Minister concerned, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the regulation of investment intermediaries.  This review is, by definition, concerned with the regulation of investment intermediaries and does not directly concern the regulation of insurance brokers, which is covered by separate legislative provisions and procedures.</P>
    <P>It is always necessary to establish priorities. Because of this, the Minister, as a first priority, set up a review of the investment intermediary area because, <i>inter alia,</i> of the amount of money that can be involved in this area, as evidenced, for example, in the Taylor case, and the need to maintain confidence in the Irish investment area.</P>
    <P>I know that Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is very conscious that a long hard look needs also to be taken at the regulation of insurance brokers.  It is his intention, once any improvements have been put in place in the investment area, to have departmental officials review the regulatory provisions concerning the operations of insurance brokers.  The results of the investigation of the authorised officers into the events surrounding the closure of the company referred to my the Deputy should provide an important input into this review.</P>

      <P>Article 18 (1) (b) (i) of the Organisation of Working Time Directive 93/104/EC states that a member state shall have the option not to apply Article 6 of the directive (which limits the working week to an average of 48 hours) provided it takes the necessary measures to ensure that the employer has obtained the worker's agreement to work more than 48 hours in a week, that a worker who is not willing to so work for more than 48 hours suffers no detriment by his employer and that records are kept and other administrative requirements are observed.  This is the only &ldquo;opt-out clause&rdquo; permitted by the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received representations from both sides of industry regarding the inclusion of the option permitted by Article 18 (1) (b) (i) in our legislation to implement the directive.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is opposed to the inclusion of this option while the Irish Business and Employer's Confederation supports its inclusion.  A number of individual employers and <Col N="589" /> employees and public representatives have also made representations on the issue.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the Article 18 (1) (b) (i) option in the Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996, would effectively permit employers and employees to opt out of the maximum working time limit required by the directive on the basis of individual agreements.  Such an approach would be undesirable both from a health and safety perspective and from the point of view of sharing available work.  Indeed, it would be unprecedented to allow an individual employee to opt out of a statutory health and safety requirement.  In addition, the replacement of collective bargaining and social partnership which has served this country well by individual negotiation or individualised contracts in this vital area would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1996, is a flexible instrument permitting wide averaging periods, maximum use of the permitted derogations, and a sensible definition of working time.  In this context, I am satisfied that the legislation as proposed will operate to the benefit of workers and their health and safety while affording sufficient flexibility to employers to regulate working time so as to adequately meet competitive demands.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>There are a number of schemes in operation at the moment which are geared towards establishing partnerships between Irish and US companies.  In some cases, the programmes apply to Irish firms nationwide whereas others are restricted to Irish companies in the North and the Border counties only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North American Partnership Programme (NAPP), for example, is promoted by Forbairt in conjunction with the International Fund for Ireland.  Companies selected to participate under this programme are principally drawn from the services sector, with a particular focus on export-oriented services including software development, data processing, telemarketing and technical, consulting and media recording <Col N="590" /> services.  Participants are required to have strong technological capability.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 of this programme was launched in February, 1995 at a seminar in County Cavan which was attended by representatives of firms from all the Border counties.  This phase resulted in nine partnerships being created for six of the 15 participating companies.  Phase 2 was launched in May of this year.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that two companies from Cavan and Monaghan have been selected to participate in this phase.  I understand one of these companies proposes to undertake a week long visit to the US this month to meet potential partners and the other is expected to undertake a visit next March for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Another scheme, the American Management and Business Internship Training Programme (AMBIT) was launched at the White House conference in May, 1995.  The focus of this Programme is to provide Irish managers and key personnel with US management training and access to technology/new products/services, with the further possibility of the formation of strategic alliances between the Irish and US organisations.  Under the programme, Irish participants are placed in US &ldquo;host&rdquo; companies for periods of up to six months.  To date, some 33 Irish businesses have availed of the programme including Lakeland Dairies in County Cavan and IJM Timber Engineering Ltd. in County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>In addition, four companies from Cavan/Monaghan have participated under the Forbairt Small Business Administration Business Partnership initiative.  Active negotiations are ongoing in three of these cases.  Forbairt, which is actively supporting these companies, has indicated that, while negotiations may be protracted, any partnership arrangements that result therefrom will be significant undertakings by the Irish firms and should lead to significant business development for the Irish companies in the medium term.</P>
    <P>However, whereas the above schemes have made progress, and the Washington White House Conference had a positive role in this respect, no jobs had been provided in Cavan or Monaghan arising directly from the conference or from the Matchmaker Programme.  What has emerged from all the programmes I have mentioned is that, in deciding whether or not to form a partnership with an Irish company, US companies look for competitive advantage.  At local level, the one clear factor which will most influence the winning of international projects is, without doubt, the level of industrial competitiveness a location can offer by way of infrastructure and a positive business environment.  I acknowledge that this is not something which Irish companies can achieve in isolation.  Rather, Government policy at all levels and the work of the industrial development agencies must be geared towards the maximisation of competitive advantage if Irish firms are to attract multinational interest.  I <Col N="591" /> am satisfied that this is the case at the moment and will continue to be in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of years, and particularly since the publication of the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group, the Culliton report, in 1992, attention has focused on a number of key interrelated economic factors that combine to provide an environment that supports a vibrant and competitive economy.  These factors include, among others, the macroeconomic environment, the physical infrastructure, the level of innovation and the adequacy of capital markets, including the supply of venture capital.</P>
      <P>Given that the supply of venture capital was thus recognised as a necessary element in the attainment of a vibrant and competitive economy, any shortcomings in the venture capital had to be recognised and addressed.  The Culliton report spoke of its analysis of the financing deficiencies of Irish industry and enterprise consistently pointing to an undersupply of equity capital at the small scale and for seed capital.  This finding was also echoed in a 1992 equity capital survey of indigenous industry undertaken by my Department which found that 58 per cent of all survey respondents had either a current or medium-term equity requirement, 78 per cent of respondents requiring enquity considered that raising the equity would be difficult and 57 per cent of respondents considered that the then climate of raising equity had deteriorated in the previous two years.</P>
      <P>Among the historical reasons for the difficulties in sourcing venture capital was a risk aversion of the established venture capital providers which resulted in them concentrating their activities on larger investments with lower risk characteristics and an almost total absence of venture capital investment by large financial institutions such as pension funds.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to say that in recent years the recognition of the key developmental role played by venture capital and the recognition of the shortcomings in the Irish venture capital market has led to the emergence of a number of important initiatives which have significantly improved the environment for Irish companies seeking venture capital.  Amongst the more prominent of these initiatives are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>under the current Operational Programme for Industrial Development, funding of approximately £66 million for early stage <Col N="592" /> equity is available through approved seed-venture funds.  It is intended that 50 per cent of the funding will be provided by the European Regional Development Fund and the balance by the private sector,</P>
    <P>the business expansion scheme continues to channel much-needed equity into unquoted businesses in Ireland that would not otherwise have had access to such capital,</P>
    <P>a number of private sector organisations have been established whose focus has primarily been on the supply of seed and early stage venture capital to smaller companies,</P>
    <P>Irish pension funds have committed themselves to investing £50 million in venture capital over the period 1994 to 1999.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the supply of venture capital from initiatives such as those mentioned above can be gauged from the results of my Department's 1995 equity capital survey which found that 48 per cent of all companies had an equity requirement either now or in the next three years.  The corresponding figure is 1992 was 58 per cent.  Sixty per cent of firms in the current survey considered that raising the required equity would be difficult.  This contrasts with 78 per cent in 1992.  Five per cent of firms in the current survey considered that the climate for raising equity had deteriorated in the previous two years. This compares with 57 per cent in the 1992 survey.</P>
    <P>It is apparent therefore that there has been a significant improvement in the supply of venture capital to Irish owned companies and in the overall venture capital environment over the past few years.  Further improvements are continually needed to ensure that the optimum number of growth orientated companies can gain access to outside investment.  I can assure the Deputy that I and my Department will continue to both monitor developments in the venture capital market and seek improvements in the way the market operates <i>vis-à-vis</i> the equity capital requirements of developing Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I believe that the continuing development of initiatives such as those outlined above will ensure that many more Irish businesses will have access to venture capital or development funding, which might not have been the case had such initiatives not been established in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that Ireland has failed to attract any of the large mobile electronics investment projects in the past 18 months.  On the contrary, Ireland has been extremely successful in attracting new overseas projects in this sector and has benefited substantially from its remarkable growth over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>In 1995 over a third of the total employment in IDA assisted companies was in the electronics sector.  We win nearly a quarter of greenfield electronic manufacturing investment in Europe and in software, we are clearly the prime location in Europe for new investment.  The dynamic growth of the sector in Ireland, both in terms of new projects secured and the expansion of existing operations is continuing.  From January to November 1996, a total of 49 electronic/software companies announced their intention to establish or expand operations in Ireland and create approximately 10,300 jobs over the next five years.  I am confident that further significant projects will be secured in the very near future.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised, of course, that the attraction of inward investment is a very competitive business and while Ireland has proved itself a winning location particularly for electronic projects, the IDA must have regard to the balance between the cost of securing a project and the benefits that will accrue from it for the country.  We are competitive in very many cases but we do not expect and indeed should not be expected to win them all.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, decisions as to where to locate overseas manufacturing operations rest with the owners of companies themselves and are beyond the control of IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>Today, electronics companies in Ireland employ over 41,000 people in more than 300 companies.  We have built strategic strength in the electronics sector and we now have world class examples of success and achievement in the sector.  These companies develop, market and manufacture a wide range of leading edge products generating around IR£11 billion in exports.  They are involved in areas like PC and semiconductor manufacturing, component, network products and subassembly production, software design and development, research and development and technical support.</P>
      <P>The number of new arrivals who have chosen Ireland over the past number of years such as Intel, Seagate Technology, and Microsoft is a strong endorsement of the strength, depth and maturity of the technological sector in the country.  The rapid development of the electronics industry has continued in 1996 with major expansions announced by companies such as 3COM, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Gateway 2000 and Dell and new investments by Hertz, Sanmina and DSC Communications among others.  These companies are proving to be ideal role models to attract others to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> Ireland's policy for the development of the sector is driven primarily by value for money objectives and we continue to insist on strong payback to the economy for the investment of taxpayer funds.  The overall aim is ensure that we have in Ireland long-time winners, while accepting the inevitability that some companies will face difficulties from time to time and may be forced to downsize or even close.  Essentially, IDA compete for investments across a broad range of segments of the sector so as to achieve a balance and to secure a mix of young, aggressive, fast growth companies, and long-established companies.</P>
    <P>More and more companies operating in the sector are adding additional responsibilities and greater value added functions to their Irish manufacturing operations.  Some 40 per cent of all electronic companies now have added functions such as software development, customer support, marketing, distribution and product development.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of our competitive cost base and infrastructure, combined with the availability of a skilled labour force and the range of financial incentives we have on offer are, of course, critical to the continued success of our electronics sector. Government policy is aimed at ensuring that the main elements of a competitive cost structure are maintained in Ireland.  In this regard, support will continue to be focused on the provision of funds towards the wide range of training programmes and research and development measures available to the industry.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, we have had extraordinary success in developing our electronics sector.  We have successfully built critical mass in the sector, we have built skills around it and brought in key players.  I am confident that we can continue to build on the success and strength of the sector, to secure further prestigious projects and, to deliver a high level of job creation in the future.</P>

      <P>While there have, of course, been a number of new manufacturing jobs created in the Border counties through inward investment since May 1995, I am assuming that the Deputy's question refers to those arising directly from the Washington White House Conference and subsequent Irish/US contacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No new jobs have, as yet, been created in the six Border counties as a direct result of the Washington conference.  The purpose of this <Col N="595" /> conference last year, and indeed the Pittsburgh conference this year, was primarily to put the focus on the Border area as a potential location for new US inward investment and to exploit the possibility of strategic alliances between companies from the region and suitable US companies.  While we may have to wait some time for tangible results in terms of actual jobs created, I think, in general, this overall objective was achieved.  A number of schemes, geared towards establishing partnerships between Irish and US companies were put in place and are continuing at the moment.  Some of these apply to Irish firms nationwide while others are confined specifically to Irish companies in the North and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>Even prior to the US conferences, Forbairt had, for example, inaugurated a number of partnership programmes such as the North Atlantic Partnership Programme (NAPP) which is operated in conjunction with the International Fund for Ireland.  This is aimed primarily at information technology based companies, particularly in export-oriented services such as software development, data processing and telemarketing.  Phase one of this programme has seen some nine companies from the Border counties currently in negotiations with potential US partners.  This success prompted the launch of a further phase in April of this year, this being focused on technology-based manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>Another scheme, the American Management and Business Internship Training Programme (AMBIT) was launched at the White House conference in May 1995.  The aim of this programme is to provide Irish managers and key personnel with US management training and access to new technology, products and services. Under the scheme, Irish participants are placed in US &ldquo;host&rdquo; companies for periods of up to six months.  To date, six companies from the Border region have participated in this programme.</P>
    <P>The foregoing programmes are just a small sample of what is currently happening in terms of Irish/US partnerships.  By their very nature, the business of building partnerships is a lengthy process, the ultimate success of which depends on identifying suitable partners in the US and negotiating agreements which benefit both sides. The industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department are committed to the concept of pan-Atlantic partnerships as an effective means of helping Irish companies with the necessary potential to access new technology skills, products and markets.  The agencies have found that the key factor in promoting successful overseas investment to the Border counties, as well as the rest of the country, is the availability of the type of infrastructural environment consistent with the needs of modern industrial and service undertakings.  The Government, through its various industrial development policy measures, is committed to creating such an <Col N="596" /> environment and the agencies, for their part, are working hard to assist Irish firms improve their competitiveness and so increase their attractiveness to overseas clients.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that a number of significant advances in consumers' entitlements, protection and rights have been secured during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union (EU).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Consumer Council of 25 November, chaired by the Minister of State for Commerce, Science and Technology, Deputy Rabbitt, political agreement was reached on (i) a new and amending consumer credit directive which provides that a common formula for the calculation of the cost of credit (&ldquo;APR&rdquo;) will be applied throughout the EU, thereby enabling consumers to compare more readily the various credit products on offer and seek the best bargain available, with greater certainty and confidence; and (ii) the speedy introduction, on a pilot basis, by the Commission of a voluntary out-of-courts system for the resolution of individual consumer cross border disputes; initially the new system, which is informal, inexpensive and simple, shall assist in the settlement of disputes in a non-adversarial and unintimidating manner and thereby represent a major milestone in the provision of access to justice for consumers, <Col N="597" /> without detracting from or diminishing their statutory rights.</P>
    <P>Minister Rabbitte was also anxious that fellow consumer Ministers would be afforded the opportunity to contribute to and make an input, into other wider policy areas, which until now have largely been off-limits, but yet impact considerably on the health, safety and economic interests of consumers.  To this end, the Minister tabled two discussion documents on the consumer in the information society, which comprehended issues such as affordable and universal access, consumer data protection rights, the need for adequate and appropriate education and training for consumers to derive full advantage from the new information age; the results of consumer Ministers' deliberation shall form an important and integral part of the comprehensive debate on this subject at the proposed European Council in Dublin on 14 December, and the position of the vulnerable consumer and in particular those who may be disadvantaged because of their age, education or economic circumstances, and thereby are deprived from participating fully in the European Single Market.</P>
    <P>In addition, agreement was also reached at the council on some important elements of a proposed directive on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interest, the purpose which is to enable member states to take swift and effective action against unlawful practices which harm consumers and in many instances emanate from other member states.</P>
    <P>The Commission, also outlined their recently published proposals for a directive on guarantees and after sales services, the aims of which are to harmonise legal guarantees throughout the Community, and to stipulate that commercial guarantees offered by the supplier must supplement consumers' statutory rights and meet certain transparency requirements.</P>
    <P>Other topics on which Ministers held an exchange of views were the proposed introduction of the new European currency and its implications for consumers; the labelling of genetically modified foods and food ingredients; the Commission's Green Papers on Financial Services, and Commercial Communications in order to ensure that the consumer interest is afforded due priority in any follow-up action; and BSE.</P>
    <P>In addition to the progress achieved by the Consumer council, there has been a most sigificant breakthrough in the meantime on another important consumer dossier.  Agreement was reached on 27 November last between the Council of EU Consumer Ministers and the European Parliament on a common text for a directive on the protection of consumers in respect of distance sales contracts.</P>
    <P>Distance sales contracts comprehend transactions where there is no direct or face-to-face contact between the supplier of the goods or services and the consumer, and the supplier elicits <Col N="598" /> business by means of either printed matter such as brochures or mail-order catalogues, or electronic media such as telephone, fax or Internet.</P>
    <P>The directive provides that (i) the consumer shall be given complete information before the contract is concluded and in particular detail on the identity of the supplier, the characteristics of the goods or services, the price, including delivery charges, method of payment, and the duration in which the sales offer is valid; (ii) in order to allow adequate time and due consideration of the commitment being undertaken, consumers must be given a seven day &ldquo;cooling off&rdquo; period, in which they may withdraw from the contract and be entitled automatically to refund; (iii) the contract must be performed within thirty days of receipt of the customer's order and if the original goods requested are not available the customer must be supplied with goods of equivalent quality and price; (iv) the customer is protected fully against unsolicited goods or services and is not obliged to pay for them or the expense of their return; (v) consumers shall be protected against the fraudulent use of their credit card; and (vi) free samples must be clearly indicated and if customers do not respond to an offer, their silence cannot be taken as consent; thus inertia selling is being outlawed.</P>
    <P>When transposed into Irish legislation, the directive shall be enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs who will be empowered to seek a High Court judgment prohibiting practices which are contrary to its provisions.</P>

      <P>I was concerned that comments in the statement issued in the name of the Association of Higher Civil Servants of 8 November 1996 raised issues about the political impartiality of civil servants. Accordingly I directed the secretary in my Department with responsibility for public service management and development to take the matter up with the association.  I also directed that the issue be placed on the agenda for the 27 November meeting of the general council, a forum which brings together management and staff interests under the civil service conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>The general council unanimously reaffirmed the long-standing position that civil servants should be politically neutral.  My Department has been in touch with the Department of Justice and other Departments following that reaffirmation of the traditional position at general council.  The Deputy will be aware of the statement issued by the Association of Higher Civil Servants on 15 November 1996 in which they repudiated the statement made in the association's name on 8 November and apologised to the Government and Opposition parties for the intrusion into the political arena.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services.  New regulations, which will give effect to the provisions of Part VII, will come into operation at the end of this year.  These regulations will apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, creches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.  The purpose of the regulations is to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>A working group was established earlier this year within my Department to prepare draft guidelines on standards for pre-school services. These guidelines will form the basis of the regulations to be made under Part VII of the Act. The group is representative of my Department, the Department of Education, the health boards, the DHSS in Northern Ireland and a number of voluntary organisations which are involved in pre-school provision.</P>
      <P>A draft set of regulations was recently made available to the public for consultation purposes. Submissions from the public will be given full consideration in the context of finalising the new regulations.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify the costs that may arise for some service providers in complying with the new regulations.  Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged.  This function is in keeping with the board's overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services. The policy of supporting certain pre-school services will continue in the future and may include financial assistance to upgrade premises associated with such services.</P>

    <P>A total of £305,000 in national lottery funding was provided by my Department for the development of the hydrotherapy pool and <Col N="604" /> recreation facilities at Cregg House.  The facility was completed in late 1994 at which time Cregg House approached my Department about the running costs associated with the facility.</P>
    <P>The health boards priority in 1995 and 1996 has been to provide additional residential, day and respite services and Cregg House has benefited from the additional funds for such services.  The provision of revenue funding for the hydrotherapy pool-recreation facilities, including the possibility of a phased opening of the facilities, has been discussed with representatives from Cregg House.  My Department will review the situation again in 1997 in the light of resources which are available to it and the priorities which have been identified for the North-Western Health Board region in relation to services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>

On 28 November the community group submitted a proposal for such a service and the board met with the group to discuss the proposal and the nature of the services to be provided.  The premises identified by the group for such a service is now being investigated by the board in consultation with local and community groups.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  Most health boards now have a consultant in place and are consolidating and extending their orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected and or handicapped. Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity and or handicap.  In some areas there are large numbers of children on the waiting lists and there can be long waiting periods for orthodontic treatment.  I accept that such waiting periods are undesirable.</P>
      <P>Where health boards have been successful in recruiting consultant orthodontists the services provided by these boards have been considerably improved.  This demonstrates very clearly the success of my Department's strategy of consultant led teams for the provision of orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>I will, in conjunction with the health boards, continue to develop the consultant led orthodontic services over the course of the Dental Health Action Plan.  The ultimate objective is to bring the level of service provision in line with the level of treatment need.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The question of funding for the North West Hospice is a matter for the North-Western Health Board in the first instance.  With regard to national lottery funding, each of the health boards receives a portion of the overall national lottery funds available to the health services as a block allocation.  These allocations are then distributed by the boards to local voluntary bodies operating in their areas.  In 1996 the North-Western Health Board paid £20,000 of it's national lottery allocation to the North West Hospice.  All lottery funding has been allocated for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that since taking office I have identified cancer as one of my major priorities and in this regard on Tuesday, 5 November 1996 I announced a set of initiatives for the future reorganisation of cancer services throughout the country.  These initiatives include proposals for the development of specialist palliative care so that the development of this service will best meet the needs and personal preferences of patients with cancer or long-term conditions.  A national cancer forum will also be established to co-ordinate services and to provide <Col N="607" /> detailed advice on the development of palliative care services nationally.  This forum will have consumer representation.</P>
    <P>All health boards will now draw up a set of priorities for the development of palliative care services in their areas.  I understand that the planning process is already well under way in the North-Western Health Board and that a report on hospice services in the board's area, in the context of the recommendations in the national cancer strategy, is being prepared for consideration by the health boards' standing committees at their meetings in December 1996. The North-Western Health Board has advised me that the board's priorities will address the role, function and funding for the voluntary organisations, the North West Hospice and the Donegal/Foyle Hospice, in the proposed future organisation of the services in the board's area.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): While recreation and community facilities are provided as part of the care programme for clients in various areas of the health services, there is no specific funding allocated for these purposes.  Funding is allocated for such purposes by health boards according to needs and priorities identified as part of the overall management of services.</P>
      <P>Recreation and community facilities are provided as an integral part of care programmes. Examples include gymnasia, swimming pools which are provided for hydrotherapy purposes, respite care/holiday breaks and recreational activities for children in care.  In addition, health boards also fund pre-schools, day care centres and family resource centres which act as both community facilities and centres where therapeutic and medical care is provided.  It is not possible to separately quantify the amount of funding allocated towards such services which have a recreational or community facility aspect.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EC regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis <Col N="609" /> of the circumstances of each individual case. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.  A student is assessed for a medical card by the health board in whose area he or she is attending college.  I should also point out that when assessing the medical card entitlement of a family, the income guidelines include an allowance for each dependant and where that dependant is in full-time third level education and is not grant-aided, this allowance is doubled.</P>
      <P>I would, of course, be anxious that every student who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one.  I believe, however, that it is best to rely on the careful consideration of individual cases by the health boards rather than to introduce a provision on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

As a result the board has not been in a position to approve as many routine and full denture treatments as planned.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Eastern Health Board that to date in 1996 the board has approved full dentures for 810 persons over 65 years and routine treatment for 1,110 person over 65 years.</P>
    <P>Due to the high demand on the emergency element of the scheme the movement of the waiting list for persons over 65 years is not significant.  However, the waiting time is currently under one year.  I understand from the board that the position in relation to the entire waiting list with particular emphasis on the emergency scheme is currently under review.</P>
    <P>My Department is also in discussions with the Irish Dental Association with a view to implementing revised arrangements nationally for emergency treatment and so ensuring that the routine element of the scheme operates in a more satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has advised me that it is examining the position of the individual in Dublin 11 referred to in the question and will communicate with her directly.  In the meantime, if the individual requires emergency treatment for the relief of pain she should contact the Eastern Health Board on freephone 1800 250 250 for a list of participating private dentists.</P>

      <P>The national committee to promote breastfeeding was established in 1992 to develop a national policy to promote breastfeeding.  The national committee produced a comprehensive report with detailed recommendations.  This report, A National Breastfeeding Policy for Ireland, was published by my Department in 1994 and was widely disseminated on publication.  An internal working group was then established within the Department of Health to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the recommendations made in the report.  It is liaising with health boards and other organisations in the context of the implementation of the policy.  Each <Col N="613" /> health board has indicated that it has resource persons in place.  The question of the provision of assessors for the baby friendly hospital initiative is under consideration.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The report is a unique and historic document which has seen, for the first time, people with a disability speak with one voice and clearly articulate the steps required to ensure that they will be treated as equal citizens.  I see the findings of this report as the cornerstone of future Government policies in relation to the treatment of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The report impacts on a wide range of policy issues which are the responsibility of many Government Departments and agencies.  The Government has decided to prepare a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report and I have been authorised to establish an inter-departmental task force, under the chairmanship of my Department, to begin work on the preparation of that plan.  The Government has also authorised me to establish a monitoring committee, comprising organisations representing people with disabilities, their families and carers and service providers, as well as social partners and Government Departments, to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  The monitoring committee will assist in prioritising the changes necessary and in bringing those proposals back to Government.</P>
      <P>I would envisage that the implementation of the report's recommendations, along with any bugetary implications following thereon, will be considered in the context of the work of these two groups.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the practice of beagling normally carried out on foot with a pack of beagles or harriers.  A licence is not required to hunt hares with beagles or harriers during the open season. The open season for the hunting, including beagling, of hares is between 26 September and 28 February of the following year, both dates inclusive.</P>
      <P>A licence under section 26 (2) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, is required to hunt hares with beagles or harriers outside the open season.  Applications from clubs wishing to hunt outside the season are made to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of my Department.  Each application is considered on its merits.  Licences exclude the hunting of hares which have been handled or held in captivity and provide that on expiry of the licence a return giving the dates and the number of hares hunted and killed on each of the days specified shall be made to the NPWS.</P>

      <P>No natural heritage areas have been designated to date and I do not intend to designate any such areas until after the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been amended by the Oireachtas. I expect to be in a position to introduce the relevant Bill in the Oireachtas early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The proposed NHAs are places which contain the best remaining examples of our native wildlife species and habitats.  It is EU and Government policy that any developments in receipt of grant-aid should have no adverse impact on the environment.  Developments in areas under consideration for NHA status that comply with planning law and meet any necessary grant regulations are not affected by the proposed NHAs.  However, where it is considered that development proposals will damage the environment, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department will object to those proposals.  The final decision in respect of such developments lies with the planning authorities.</P>
      <P>The EU Habitats Directives, which will be transposed into Irish law soon, will require the establishment of special areas of conservation, SACs, in ecologically important areas of the country.  Sand dunes are listed in the directive as a priority habitat under threat in Europe.  SACs are to impact on some golf courses, therefore, but it will not be possible to identify these until consultations in respect of SAC sites commence in February 1997.  Restrictions, if any, are expected to generally apply to particular parts of the courses only and are likely to relate to fertiliser usage and drainage for the purpose, in the rain, and protecting wild flora.  The boundaries established for such sites will be drawn up to take account of the particular needs of the habitat or species requiring conservation and of good management practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of designating SACs will involve consultations with the land owners and will afford land owners and land users an opportunity to appeal, on scientific grounds, against the inclusion of lands in these sites.  It will also <Col N="618" /> provide an opportunity to seek modifications or removal of particular restrictions.</P>

      <P>The regulations at present applying to driver licensing require that, in order to obtain a full driving licence in any category of vehicle, a person must hold a provisional licence and pass a driving test.  The Second EU Directive on Driver Licensing requires the introduction of a detailed theoretical test and the making of other changes in the driving test.  Draft regulations to give effect to these requirements are at present the subject of consultation with the European Commission <Col N="625" /> and, subject to this, it is my intention that the new regulations will be brought into force as early as possible in 1997.</P>
      <P>I do not, at this stage, envisage further changes in the driver licensing system, such as those referred to in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, but I will keep the position under review in the light of experience of the operation of the revised arrangements to be introduced next year and of an evaluation of the system referred to in the report.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1996, the costs incurred by licensing authorities in the administration of the motor taxation system, including driver licensing, vehicle testing, etc., were recouped to each authority by my Department.  Under new arrangements introduced with effect from 1 January 1996 these costs are met by the authorities by deduction from the gross proceeds of the tax.</P>
      <P>Details of the costs recouped in respect of the years 1990 to 1993 are contained in the reply to Question No. 141 of 16 May 1995.  Details in respect of the years 1986 to 1989 and 1994 to 1995 are set out in the following table.  The figures for 1995 include costs incurred in respect of the period October to December 1995 which licensing authorities have been authorised to deduct from motor taxation proceeds this year.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department met representatives of the Teachers' Union of Ireland on Wednesday, 27 November 1996 and explained the matter in full to them.

      <P>Pending the outcome of this review, it has not been possible to sanction the creation of permanent posts in this case.  I also emphasise that Government policy on the limitation of numbers employed in the public service imposes severe constraints on the creation of new posts.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative which seeks to target a programme of special supports on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>This initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage undertaken by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  Among the findings of these studies was a recommendation that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The studies also concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>The criteria under which schools were selected for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself were devised and carried out by the Education Research Centre following detailed consideration of a range of indicators of educational disadvantage.  Unfortunately, the school in question did not rank high enough on the priority list to be included in the initiative.</P>

      <P>School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of the scheme, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists due to unemployment; prolonged illness of parent; large family with inadequate means; single parent; more than one child doing the certificate examinations, and other circumstances which would denote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> In addition to the above provision, my Department also operates a scheme under which the fees of candidates repeating the leaving certificate are waived or reduced.  A candidate who remains at school to repeat the leaving certificate is normally charged both a course fee &mdash; £100 in 1997 &mdash; and an increased examination entry fee &mdash; £125 in 1997.  Where, however, the parent or guardian of the candidate is the holder of a current medical card, the course fee is waived and the examination entry fee is reduced to, at a maximum, the ordinary leaving certificate fee payable by first-time candidates &mdash; £46 in 1997.</P>
    <P>Candidates who are not attending school may enter personally for the leaving certificate examination under the provisions for admission of external candidates.  The ordinary fees payable by external candidates are reduced where the candidate is the holder of a current medical card or is dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card as follows: one subject: £20, reduced from £46; two subjects: £35, reduced from £91 and three or more subjects: £46, reduced from £134.  It is my intention to improve provision in this area on an ongoing, well targeted basis and as resources become available to me.</P>

      <P>An application for the establishment of a secondary school in Newport, County Mayo, was initially submitted to my Department by the Newport &amp; District Development Company in 1995.  This application was rejected on the basis that there were insufficient pupils in the area to justify the establishment of a school.  It was felt that the wide range of subject provision generally demanded could best be met by the existing schools in the region.</P>
      <P>A renewed application for a post-primary education facility in this area, under the aegis of County Mayo vocational education committee, was submitted to my Department some months ago.  However, because of the time constraints involved, it was not possible to have the proposal examined and a decision given for the commencement of the 1996-97 school year.</P>
      <P>An in-depth examination of the proposal is under way and an official from the planning section of my Department will visit the area in the near future to meet members of the Newport &amp; District Development Company and County Mayo vocational education committee.

This enrolment of 82 pupils <Col N="638" /> warranted a staffing of a principal and two assistants teachers in the current school year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main criteria to be met for granting recognition to any category of new primary school are that there is a need for the proposed school, having regard to existing provision in the general area concerned, and that prospective pupils will be available in sufficient numbers to establish and maintain a viable school.  In more recent years, the majority of new primary schools recognised by my Department have been either gaelscoileanna or multi-denominational schools.</P>
      <P>Consideration is given to the establishment of special schools having regard to the level of assessed need and of existing special provision in the relevant area.  In addition, the appropriateness of making segregated provision, as distinct from integrated provision in an existing mainstream school, would need to be carefully considered in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to all new schools, there is also a requirement to have a suitable patron body and board of management to administer the school in <Col N="640" /> accordance with my Department's rules for national schools.</P>
    <P>In the light of demographic decline, which is already very evident at primary level, my concern to ensure the viability of all applicant schools has increased considerably.  This was a major factor in my decision to establish the commission on school accommodation needs, whose task it will be to draw up detailed criteria for the recognition of new primary schools.  I will consider if new or revised conditions are required with regard to the recognition of new schools in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>Grants under this scheme have recently been allocated and all available funds are now committed to these existing projects.  In view of the relatively limited funds available for <Col N="641" /> allocation and the very large number of applications received, I regret it was not possible to include this project for grant assistance on this occasion.

Following a review, it was determined that there was scope for the rearrangement of the school's remedial service to provide for the needs of a school nearby.  The level of remedial service in the school in question was reduced from two full-time posts to one full-time post and one post on a shared basis to cater for the remedial needs of the pupils attending the nearby school.  I am satisfied that the revised service caters adequately for the remedial needs of pupils attending the school in question.</P>

      <P>Under the present arrangements, the home-school community liaison scheme is focused on schools in designated areas of disadvantage. Schools are invited to participate in the scheme on the basis of priority of need as assessed by my Department's inspectorate.  In selecting schools for inclusion in the scheme, particular regard is had to the prevailing levels of pupil participation in the education process and the level of parental involvement in the affairs of their local school.</P>
      <P>The home-school community liaison scheme at primary level was last expanded in the 1995-96 school year by the inclusion of an additional 49 schools.  This brings the total number of schools at primary level to 181 with the service of 105 local co-ordinators.</P>

The question of further development of the scheme will be considered in the light of the review of the pilot phase of the initiative and having regard to resource availability.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment of St. Maelruain's senior national school on 30 September 1995 had declined to 448 pupils from 465 pupils in September 1994.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and 14 assistant teachers in the current school year. The school needed a minimum enrolment of 456 pupils in order to retain the post of 15th assistant. In the circumstances, the 15th assistant's post was suppressed in June 1996.  In addition to the staffing mentioned above, the school has the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>I understand the special circumstances of the school mentioned by the Deputy relate to the catchment area which this school serves.  It has been stated that the school operates on the margins of an extensive area of disadvantage, but is not included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Regretfully, I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged areas status to additional primary schools.</P>

      <P>As part of the ongoing discussions with the teacher unions under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> it was recently agreed to process a limited number of applications for early retirement by primary teachers before the end of 1996.  Good management practice involves the most effective use of staffing resources, having regard to the cycle nature of certain work loads within the Department.  In accordance with practice a small number of staff have been temporarily redeployed from an area within the examinations branch, which is traditionally in a valley period at this time, to assist the existing staff within the primary pensions area to complete this task within the tight deadline.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170, 171, 172 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools. Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools referred to by the Deputies will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department, through its guidelines on school discipline, lays considerable stress on the use of suspensions and explusions only as a last resort. Where parents are dissatisfied with disciplinary rulings by schools, it is open to them to appeal the decision to the appropriate management authority.  In the case of primary and second level schools, boards of management, where established, are the appropriate authority.  In the cases of voluntary secondary schools and schools controlled by vocational education committees, where boards of management are not in place, the manager of the school and the vocational education committee in whose administrative area the school is situated, respectively, are the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P>In situations where difficulties continue to exist after the appeal process has been pursued, my Department gives assistance towards the resolution of the difficulties with a view to ensuring that the pupil concerned is retained in full time education.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education <i>Charting our Education Future</i> outlines Government policy on the establishment of education boards.  These boards will be given a clear role in relation to appeals arising from decisions of schools affecting students, including decisions concerning suspension and expulsion.  The Government has approved the drafting of the Education Bill which will give effect to these proposals.  I propose to publish this Bill shortly.</P>

      <P>Primary schools with adequate resources, both teaching and accomodation, generally admit all pupils who seek entry.  Accordingly, most parents are able to have their children enrolled in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The managerial authorities of schools not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry normally implement an enrolment policy and it is their responsibility to devise and implement such a policy.  Local circumstances may be such that, from time to time, the board of management of a particular school may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or to a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  My Department will carry out an investigation where it is claimed that a board is operating its enrolment policy in a manner which discriminates against a particular child.</P>
      <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second level schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school.  Following discussions between my Department and school managerial authorities in 1993, it was agreed that selection on the basis of academic ability should not form the basis of enrolment decisions.  The agreement provides for the disclosure of selection criteria and the establishment of a non-statutory monitoring mechanism to ensure that the terms of the agreement are implemented in full.  The agreement was set out in a circular letter from the Department in December 1993.</P>
      <P>Subject to the requirements of my Department about intake numbers and academic and medical requirements for entry, the enrolment of students in colleges of education for primary and home economics teachers is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual college.  Since 1992, the admission of students to these colleges is through the CAO, Central Applications Office, on the basis of the normal points system.  Mature and postgraduate students are admitted to preservice primary teacher training through separate competitions outside the CAO system.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Regional Technical College Acts, 1992 and 1994, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Acts, 1992 and 1994, the enrolment policy for regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology is a matter for the governing body of the college or institute concerned.</P>
      <P>Regulations regarding admission to the university institutions and NCAD are determined by these institutions.  Applications for places are made in respect of undergraduate courses by means of the central applications system.  For postgraduate courses application is made direct to the institutions.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.  The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>This initiative is based on the outcome of detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the education research centre.  Among the findings of these studies was a recommendation that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The studies also concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the disadvantaged area scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>Under the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative, a targeted programme of special supports is being made available to selected urban and rural schools.  In the case of urban schools, the focus was on schools which already had disadvantaged area status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The second element of the initiative focused on schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers and particularly schools in rural areas which serve dispersed populations and which have concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the school system.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, based on staffing and enrolment, the school referred to by the Deputy was not eligible to apply for inclusion under the new initiative.  The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this school was 148 pupils on 30 September 1995.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and four assistants for the 1996-97 school year.  In addition, the school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher. Currently, there is no basis for the allocation of additional teaching resources to the school.</P>

      <P>I approved the allocation of an additional 56 resource posts to second level schools for the 1995-96 school year.  These posts were allocated on the basis of information provided by schools in a specially designed application form.  Because of the limited number of posts available, it was not possible to allocate posts to all schools which applied.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of ex-quota remedial posts allocated to second level schools on a county by county basis are given in the following table.  Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I approved the allocation of an additional 98 ex-quota remedial posts to second level schools.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need and having regard to the existing teaching provision in schools.  Given this fact and the limited number of posts available, I was not in a position to allocate a remedial post to Ashbourne community school.</P>
      <P>Of the six ex-quota remedial posts currently allocated to County Meath, two have been allocated to County Meath vocational education committee.  It is a matter for the chief executive officer to allocate this resource to the schools within the vocational education committee scheme as he sees fit.  The following secondary and community schools in County Meath have not been allocated an ex-quota remedial post: St. Patrick's Classical School, Navan; Loreto Convent, St. Michael's Navan; Scoil Naomh Ioseph, Clochar na Trócaire, Athboy; Franciscan College, Gormanstown; St. Michael's Dioscesan, Trim and Ashbourne community school.  The position of these schools will be considered again when next it is possible to allocate additional remedial posts.</P>

There is <Col N="663" /> a psychologist available from my Department to second level schools in County Meath.  Parents may access this service through the second level school attended by an individual pupil. Psychologists serving second level schools carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  There is no fee charged.</P>
      <P>There is a psychological service from my Department available to primary schools in a very limited number of areas with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  The service to primary schools has not been extended to the Meath area as yet.</P>
      <P>In general, responsibility for arranging for the psychological assessment of children in national schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards through the appropriate director of community care.  Parents may access this service through the school medical service or the family doctor.</P>
      <P>Parents may, of course, make arrangements privately for psychological assessments, if that is their wish.  The fee charged is not a matter within my control.</P>

      <P>In the period in question, a total of 28 persons were naturalised on foot of their investments in the State.  Included in that figure are ten persons whose cases had been approved in early 1994 by my predecessor before the then Government decided that all investment based naturalisation applications should be assessed by an interdepartmental advisory group operating within terms of reference.  The remaining 18 cases were assessed in accordance with that procedure and were subsequently naturalised by me following a recommendation to that effect by the advisory group.</P>
      <P>The names of all persons who are granted naturalisation are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in accordance with law and where this has not been done to date, relevant details will be submitted for publication without avoidable delay.</P>

      <Col N="667" /> On 25 September last in answer to parliamentary Question No. 475, I indicated that 38 persons had been naturalised on foot of their investments in the State.  That was an error for which I apologise &mdash; the correct figures are as stated above.  The error occurred as a result of double counting the ten persons referred to at the start of this answer, i.e. 18 cases during 1995-96 and ten cases which had been previously approved in 1994 and finalised in 1995-96.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the report of the inquiry which I established to investigate the failure to inform Judge Lynch of the Government decision of 1 August 1996 to remove him from the Special Criminal Court.  This report outlines the sequence of events surrounding this failure.  It deals with the receipt of the Attorney General's letters dated 2 October 1996 and dated 1 November 1996 on pages 4 and 7 and I refer the Deputy particularly to those pages of the report.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that letters from Departments of State, including the office of the Attorney General, arrive in the Department of Justice mostly hand delivered but sometimes through the post.</P>

      <Quest>the number of visits to the casualty department of the Mater Hospital which were made by inmates of Mountjoy Prison in the past 12 months; the security arrangements, if any, surrounding such visits; and if any plans can be brought forward to set up a medical centre in the prison to reduce or eliminate visits to hospitals in view of the fact that concern has been expressed to Deputy Mr. N. Ahern on a number of occasions regarding problems with prisoners in the casualty department which affect other patients, as happened on Sunday, 10 November 1996.</Quest>

      <P>Records are not maintained at the prison in such a format as to facilitate the provision, in the timescale involved, of the precise information required.  I can, however, inform the Deputy that over the last six weeks the total number of visits under escort by prisoners from Mountjoy Prison to the Mater Hospital was approximately 157.  It should be noted that only a certain proportion of these visits were to the casualty department.  The balance would have been on foot of routine <Col N="671" /> appointments in other parts of the hospital, including the out-patients department.</P>
      <P>The security arrangements surrounding these visits are reviewed on a regular basis, having particular regard to incidents such as the one referred to by the Deputy.  New handcuffing procedures for hospital and other escorted outings with prisoners have, as it happens, been promulgated at every closed prison since this incident.  New handcuffs and batons have been procured for use on such escorts and there has been a series of meetings between Department and prison officials as part of a tightening up of procedures generally in this area.</P>
      <P>The provision of a comprehensive accident and emergency treatment service within prisons to meet all possible medical emergencies is not feasible on practical grounds.  To do so would require enormous expenditure to ensure the presence of a fully qualified accident and emergency treatment team at all times in the prisons.  The physical plant and facilities associated with accident and emergency treatment is very extensive.</P>
      <P>I am, however, in conjunction with the Mater Hospital authorities, providing a secure area in the hospital grounds where prisoners and their escorts can be accommodated while awaiting appointments in the main hospital.  I am confident this will go a long way towards reducing the problems arising from prisoners visiting the hospital under escort.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to extend the provision to other categories of social welfare recipients whereby lone parents are permitted to earn up to a stated amount without affecting their social welfare entitlements.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the principle of consistency across all social welfare schemes is desirable, it should also be noted that different categories of social welfare recipients have differing needs.  The social welfare system must, therefore, be flexible enough to respond adequately to these needs. The different methods of assessing earnings as between the various social assistance payment schemes reflects specific policies being pursued by my Department, which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, research has clearly shown that unemployed lone parent families are particularly at risk of poverty.  Accordingly, the new one parent family payment scheme, which will be introduced from January next, will continue with the policy of encouraging and facilitating lone parents to enter the workforce.  Under the new scheme, the amount which lone parents can earn without affecting their entitlement to payment is <Col N="672" /> being increased to £6,000 a year.  This measure is designed to encourage such people to gain a foothold in the labour market, thereby reducing their dependence on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The earnings disregards applying to other social assistance schemes are designed to achieve different objectives.  In the case of unemployment assistance, UA, for instance, the system sometimes offers greater security to unemployed people to remain unemployed rather than risk taking up any employment opportunities which may arise, particularly if those opportunities are temporary or insecure.  The method of assessing earnings for UA purposes has, therefore, recently been revised.</P>
    <P>Under the improved arrangements, where a person works for up to three days a week, earnings are now assessed at 60 per cent.  In addition, persons without children are allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings are assessed at 60 per cent. These changes simplify the system of assessment of earnings from employment and thereby improve the incentive for unemployed people to take up casual and part-time work opportunities. The improved measures are designed to ensure that claimants have an incentive to work at all levels of earnings, even where the level of pay is less than the rate of UA.</P>
    <P>Last year I increased to £150 a week the amount of income which the spouse of a recipient of carer's allowance may have, without affecting the carer's entitlement.  This was in recognition of the special contribution which carers make to our society.  I am not satisfied, therefore, that the extension of a measure which is specifically geared towards tackling the particular needs of one group of recipients, to cover all others would be in the best interests of social welfare recipients generally, particularly as this would be likely to reduce the flexibility of the system to respond effectively to the differing needs of those who depend on it.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent payments to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> In order to be eligible for such a payment the claimant must satisfy the general conditions of entitlement to SWA set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and the conditions of entitlement to a rent supplement set out in the regulations.  Those generally excluded from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme include people in full-time employment, people in full-time education and people involved in trade disputes.</P>
    <P>The payment of rent supplements to tenants evicted from local authority housing as a result of anti social behaviour is under review as the withdrawal of social welfare payments has legal and social implications.</P>
    <P>Legislation to address the problem of antisocial behaviour in local authority housing estates is being drafted as a matter of urgency by the Department of Environment and will be presented to the Dáil as soon as possible.  It is intended in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, that the term &ldquo;antisocial behaviour&rdquo; will be defined so as to focus on drug pushing and related activity.</P>
    <P>The new Bill is aimed primarily at providing necessary legislative support to strengthen the capacity of housing authorities to deal with antisocial behaviour as one element in the management of housing estates.  It is envisaged that the legislation will provide discretion, in certain circumstances, for health boards to refuse or withdraw assistance under the SWA scheme in respect of rent or mortgage supplementation of private housing in the case of tenants evicted by a housing authority on the grounds of drug pushing or related antisocial behaviour.</P>

      <P>The pre-retirement allowance, which was introduced in 1990 as an optional scheme, relieves older unemployed people of the necessity of signing on each week at their social welfare local office and provides them with alternative arrangements for receiving their payments. Payment is made by way of payable orders encashable at post offices.  The allowance was initially introduced for long-term unemployed persons aged 60 years or over, but was reduced to 58 years of age in 1991 and to 55 years of age in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who had an entitlement to a fuel allowance or butter vouchers prior to transferring to the pre-retirement allowance, retains those entitlements provided their circumstances remain unchanged.  Similarly, a person who had an entitlement to credited social insurance contributions while in receipt of unemployment assistance retains that entitlement on transferring to the pre-retirement allowance.  In that way, <Col N="674" /> entitlements to social insurance benefits and pensions are safeguarded for the future.</P>

      <P>Recipients of widow's and survivor's pensions from my Department already have access to a range of ancillary or additional benefits.  In common with all other people resident in the State, recipients of such pensions automatically qualify for free travel on reaching 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes administered by my Department, such as free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance, are available to recipients of widow's and suvivor's pensions aged 66 or over who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition. In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes, retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.  A fuel allowance, under the national fuel scheme, is available to widows and widowers who are dependent on a long-term payment from my Department and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department may also be eligible for rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  They may also be eligible for assistance under the back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme which also comes under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The question of further extending the range of additional benefits currently available to recipients of various social welfare payments is a matter for consideration in the light of available resources and the best use of those resources.</P>

      <P>Any unemployed person, whether male or female, who is capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work is entitled to make a claim for unemployment benefit or assistance.  To qualify for payment the person must also satisfy contribution conditions in the case of unemployment benefit or a means test in the case of unemployment assistance.  Each claim has to be fully investigated to see if the conditions are satisfied and my Department seeks to carry out this function in an efficient, speedy and courteous manner.  People may also maintain a record of social insurance contributions by signing on for credited contributions provided they have had a fairly recent record of contributions.  The live register includes people claiming unemployment benefit or assistance and people entitled to sign for credits.</P>
      <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services. It remains a priority within my Department to ensure people are fully aware of their rights and advised and assisted when the need arises to avail of benefits or allowances to which they are entitled.  Information leaflets and booklets relating to each scheme are available from any of the social welfare offices throughout the country. Each office is in a position to provide detailed information on the full range of services.</P>
      <P>Apart from social welfare payment schemes there is a range of training-education-employment opportunities which are directed at people on the live register.  My Department does not place any barriers in the way of people signing on the live register where they are entitled to do so, in order to qualify for such schemes.  I share the Deputy's concern that some people may not be aware of all the opportunities available to them.  In this context, I am planning to undertake a public information programme in the new year aimed at raising awareness for unemployed persons.</P>

      <P>Disability allowance is a payment made to people between the age of 16 and 66 years who, by reason of a specified disability are substantially handicapped in undertaking employment which would otherwise be suitable to their age, experience and qualifications.</P>
      <P>A person in receipt of disability allowance may undertake a course of training and continue to receive their full payment if such training is of a rehabilitative nature.  This depends on the nature of the incapacity and the content and duration of the training course.  In many cases such courses of training are organised through the National Rehabilitation Board who evaluate the person's suitability to undertake the course.</P>
      <P>A top-up payment is made by the health boards to persons who are engaged in full-time rehabilitation training approved by the board and in consultation with the National Rehabilitation Board.  The purpose of this is to provide an additional income to people who have to live away from home while training.  There are approximately 3,500 recipients of disability allowance currently engaged in courses of rehabilitative training.  Participation in courses of occupational therapy or courses of education would not <i>per se</i> affect eligibility for the disability allowance where the other conditions for receipt of the allowance are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>Initial contact was made with the ESRI on this report in February 1995 and the general outline and data requirements were discussed.</P>
      <P>The Department then consulted with other interested bodies on the review including the Combat Poverty Agency, the National Economic and Social Forum and the Department of Finance.  There was ongoing contact with the ESRI over this period and work was in hand within the institute.  The final terms of reference for the study were then agreed and a formal contract between the Department and the ESRI was signed in March 1996.  It is expected that the report will be published by the ESRI before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Together with the national anti-poverty strategy this study and other key reports, such as that of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare, will contribute to informing public debate on the issue of poverty, while also providing a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current rates of social welfare entitlements and the standard of living of social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>Equal treatment arrears due to married women were paid in a number of instalments. Payments on account were initially made to all claimants in July-August 1995 and were calculated by reference to computer-based data in relation to payments made under the 1992 equal treatment provisions.  Subsequent payments were made following a detailed review of individual claims.  The overpayments came to light during the course of that review.  The amount of the overpayments is now estimated at £1.64 million, of which £0.32 million related to cases involving legal proceedings and some £1.32 million relates to other claims.  The overall amount overpaid is not expected to increase by any significant extent as the task of reviewing claims is now almost complete.</P>
      <P>While every effort was made to avoid overpayments arising, nonetheless those which have occurred must be seen in the context of the formidable task of paying arrears to some 76,000 married women on claims made as far back as 1984.  At that time schemes administered by the Department were not fully computerised with the result that comprehensive details of claims were not available in all cases.  This presented difficulties when calculating arrears.  Following advice received from the Attorney General on the matter, the recovery of overpayments in relation to claims not involved in legal proceedings is being dealt with by my Department under the provisions of the new code of practice on the recovery of overpayments which became effective from September 1996. The code allows, <i>inter alia</i>, for the repayment of an overpayment to be deferred, suspended, reduced or cancelled having regard to the particular circumstances of each case.  The question of recovery of overpayments in cases involving legal proceedings is still under consideration.</P>

      <P>I have noted with interest the various issues set out in the Society of St. Vincent De Paul's annual report.  I have made tackling poverty a priority in my term as Minister for Social Welfare.  I note its belief that &ldquo;catering for more and better opportunities for employment calls for a more imaginative approach by all concerned&rdquo;.  This concept in many ways embodies what it is that the Government is attempting to achieve through the development of the national anti-poverty strategy.  Issues such as access to education and targeting the long-term unemployed for special attention, referred to by the society, have been identified as key themes under the strategy.  In addition, a framework for more effective liaison between the voluntary and statutory sectors, something which the society describes as being urgently required, is currently being developed.  I have already informed the House in this regard that it is intended to publish a Green Paper on voluntary activity very soon.</P>

      <P>The proposed directive on the type approval of certain components and systems of two or three wheel motor vehicles forms part of the EC motor vehicle type approval system, the aim of which is to achieve harmonisation of manufacturing-saftey standard requirements for two or three wheel vehicles throughout the Community.  These vehicles are not manufactured in Ireland nor are the components or systems referred to in the proposed directive. Accordingly, it does not have industrial implications for Ireland.  However, motorcycle users here will be affected to the extent that new motorcycles will have to comply with the provisions of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After lengthy and complex debate at Council Working Group level in Brussels, a common <Col N="681" /> position on the proposed directive was reached at a Council meeting in November 1995.  The European Parliament has tabled amendments to the proposed directive and these were discussed at Council Working Group level during the Irish Presidency.  However, not all the amendments were acceptable to member states and, accordingly, the proposal will be examined under the conciliation procedure involving Council and Parliament.  I am keen to see that the process begins at the earliest date convenient to all the other parties involved &mdash; the Parliament, the EU Commission and the Council Secretariat.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for actions to be taken to help Irish companies, especially smaller companies with limited resources, prepare for economic and monetary union.  In this regard I announced my intention during September of this year to develop an economic and monetary union business preparation awareness campaign.  The concept behind this initiative which is supported by the Ministers for Finance and Tourism and Trade, is to help ensure that businesses have all the available information to assist them to prepare appropriately for the challenge which economic and monetary union presents.  It is important that such preparation is carried out in an informed way so that they can avoid disruption to their businesses when the changeover to single currency becomes effective and are sufficiently informed so as to enable them to take advantage of the trading opportunities which will undoubtedly arise within the economic and monetary union environment.  In launching this initiative I have asked Forfás to co-ordinate an information campaign for enterprise, especially small and medium scale enterprise, on the implications of economic and monetary union for business operations.  Forfás is currently in the process of developing this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context a management committee has been established to manage the overall campaign and its direction in the run up to economic and monetary union.  Representatives from the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Finance, Tourism and Trade, the Central Bank and private sector business interests participate on this committee.  Additionally a consultative committee has been formed which is representative of a wide spectrum of business and professional representative bodies.  This committee will help guide the passage of the campaign and will facilitate a dynamic exchange <Col N="682" /> of information and ideas between the representative bodies and their members on the one hand and the public sector-Government interests on the other.  It is planned to launch this initiative early in December.</P>
    <P>The Adapt Programme is a European Union human resources initiative supported by the European Social Fund which has the objective of helping European employers and workers anticipate industrial change and respond to its effects.  It is not focused specifically on preparing companies for economic and monetary union. Under the Adapt Programme projects are supported by pilot innovative approaches to human resource development on a trans-national basis.  Two phases of projects will operate under the programme.  The first round of 44 approved projects will run until the end of 1997.  My Department will advertise in January 1997 for applications to form the second round of projects which will operate from late 1997 to the end of 1999.  The first round of Adapt projects were supported through a project development phase in the latter part of 1995.  They began to implement their project proposals in March and April 1996.  They are therefore at an early stage of their implementation and it is too early to comment on their success or otherwise.  However, I am conscious that interesting issues in the area of human resource development responses to industrial change are being explored by the projects.  A preliminary evaluation of Adapt and of its sister initiative Employment which deals with socially excluded target groups, is currently under way and will be available in the new year. This will give a clearer view of the likely success of the programme.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Tallaght task force, established by the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology and approved by Government, are currently being implemented.  These were wide ranging in content and included the attraction of replacement industry for the Packard factory, training, education and enterprise support for the former Packard workforce, the establishment of two enterprise centres and the provision of assistance for existing small and medium sized enterprises and local suppliers and sub-contractors in the Tallaght area.  With regard to the Packard factory, the IDA and Forbairt are actively pursuing a replacement industry.  Promotion of the factory has led to site visits by a number of major companies.  However, no commitment to a replacement project has yet been negotiated and in the normal way there would customarily be a timelag between the premises becoming vacant and the securing of alternative industry.</P>
      <P>Consultants undertook a survey of the skills of the workforce to ascertain career and other options which fitted the requirements of the people concerned.  Arising from this process, participants were given access to the various local educational, training and job placement agencies, including FÁS, CERT, the vocational education committee, Tallaght regional technical college and Get Tallaght Working.  A number of courses aimed specifically at former Packard workers have been organised and further courses are planned.  These include computer, electronic and jobskilling courses together with the provision of additional places on the vocational training opportunities scheme.  Workshops have also been organised for those interested in enterprise development.  I would like to record my appreciation for the work of all the agencies concerned and the Tallaght regional technical college and particularly to the members of the task force.</P>

    <P>With regard to the provision of enterprise centres, South Dublin County Council is presently in the process of developing it's own site at Brookfield in Tallaght.

The task force had identified the Supervalu property as an enterprise centre which <Col N="685" /> was due for completion by end 1996.  However, as you are aware the owners of the premises decided at a late stage not to proceed with the sale.  In this regard the council is actively pursuing the identification of an alternative site for the development of a second enterprise centre in the Tallaght area.  Finally a number of local small and medium sized enterprises with significant growth potential have been identified with a view to providing assistance to facilitate their development and expansion.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the interdepartmental committee, which was established by the Government on 1 August 1996, were to examine all options with regard to the disposal of slaughterhouse animal waste material, in particular categories of material which cannot be incorporated in animal feed.  The committee forwarded an interim report to the Government in October.  Further analysis of the various options is in progress and it is expected that an updated report will be submitted to the Government in the near future.  It is not anticipated that that report will be published.</P>

      <P>The dairy hygiene scheme is one of the on farm investment submeasures of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99.  The scheme was launched in September 1994 by my predecessor and was open to all dairy farmers with a permanent milk quota below 40,000 gallons.  The scheme was suspended with immediate effect on 4 October 1996 and a press release issued at that time.  By that date, more <Col N="687" /> than two years after the scheme was launched, some 7,600 applications had been received, of which 5,000 had been fully processed and approvals issued in respect of 4,700.  The balance of applications on hand will result in all the available funds being fully committed.  Should additional funds become available as a result of the mid-term review of Structural Funds, it is my intention to reintroduce the scheme in a modified form.</P>

      <P>Every case of BSE is examined thoroughly by my Department to seek to ascertain the likely cause.  In most of the cases, consumption of feeding stuffs has been shown. Prior to 1990 this would have invariably involved feed containing meat and bonemeal.  Following the imposition of the ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to cattle in August, 1990, it is probable that a certain amount of feed containing meat and bonemeal remained on farms and some of this would have been fed to cattle.  Additionally, testing of cattle feedingstuffs revealed the presence of meat and bonemeal, most likely caused by cross-contamination.  In view of the foregoing and of the fact that there had been a significant number of cases of BSE in cattle which were born after the ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to cattle, I introduced regulations effective from 17 October last which are designed to strengthen controls on the manufacture, possession etc. of meat and bonemeal and to minimise the possibility of cross-contamination of cattle feed.</P>

      <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of the negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage &mdash; 62 per cent of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the operational programme.  The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with many recommendations.  Following consultation with the farm bodies on the consultant's report, I have made a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes in 1997 and following years.  No decision has yet been made by the Commission. I will announce the details as soon as Commission agreement has been obtained.</P>

      <P>Good progress has been made in providing computer facilities in relation to identification and tracing of bovine animals.  The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched a new computer facility which has been made available to my control staff at meat plants and export points throughout the country to enable them validate the identity of male animals being presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, arrangements are well advanced for establishing a single computer file which will bring together relevant information on all cattle from data which is already available on various Departmental computer systems or which is amenable to being readily input to a computer. This new system, which will be known as the animal location file will be available to the Department's control staff throughout the country around the end of the year.  It will include data from the following sources: database of headage premium schemes; animals recorded in ERAD special category herds; animals registered under the new calf registration system; animal slaughterings at meat plants and local abattoirs and animals exported live.  These measures will provide significant additional reassurance as regards the origin and status of cattle and beef. The provision of a fully comprehensive and <Col N="693" /> computerised system of traceability for cattle, incorporating data on all individual animal movements, will take some time.  A Departmental group will shortly complete its consideration of all aspects of the requirements of such a computerised system.  I will give priority to putting that system in place at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The ESB estimates that losses from theft of electricity are of the order of £2 million per annum.  The company treats the matter seriously.  Considerable resources are committed to the detection of theft and a new task force has recently been set up to enhance detection capability.  The detection of theft is a serious matter from two viewpoints.  First, the danger that arises as a result of interference with the electrical system, which exposes the perpetrators and innocent bystanders to the risk of serious injury or death.  Second, the loss of significant revenue arising from unlawful activity which imposes costs on the company and its customers.  Trained detection squads are operating throughout the country.  Cases are being continuously detected which result in criminal prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The theft of electricity is a criminal offence and is punishable by fines of up to £50,000 and-or imprisonment of up to three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The French concerns regarding certain elements of the EU proposals for the reform of the postal service are well known.  The Telecommunications Council of 28 November failed to secure agreement on the proposals contained in the draft directive, which would, in any event, have led to the strengthening rather than the weakening of the universal service.  The proposals contained, <i>inter alia,</i> a virtual legal guarantee of door to door delivery five days each week and a provision for the maintenance of adequate means of contact with the public by means of post offices, pillar boxes etc.  If the failure to agree on a directive persists, it may be more threatening to operators because it creates <Col N="694" /> uncertainty about the future operating environment, given the existing powers of the Commission under the Treaty.</P>

      <P>The person in question is in receipt of a special allowance under the Army Pensions Acts as a veteran of the War of Independence.  Pensions and allowances payable by the Department of Defence to veterans and the spouses of deceased veterans were last increased from 1 August 1994, when a special increase of 15 per cent was implemented. Cumulatively, these payments have been increased by about 50 per cent since October 1990.  Over the same period, the personal rate of special allowance payable to the person referred to was increased by 94 per cent.  By way of comparison, the cost of living has risen by about 15 per cent since August 1990 while the average increase in social welfare payments generally since 1990 has been about 33 per cent.  The question of a further increase in the veteran's and related payments is currently under review in my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission, established in 1952 under parallel legislation introduced in both jurisdictions, is responsible for the conservation, protection and improvement of salmon and inland fisheries of the Foyle area.  The Foyle area is defined in section 3 of the 1952 Act as meaning the Londonderry district originally created by order in 1855.  The northern boundary of Lough Foyle is represented by an imaginary line drawn between the Martello Tower at Magilligan Point and Greencastle Fort.  The Foyle Basin, or water <Col N="696" /> catchment area, comprises eastern County Donegal from Inishowen Head to Lough Derg, Western County Derry from Binevenagh through the county border to Fintona in West County Tyrone and oceanwards through Lough Foyle to the tidewater channel which cuts between Greencastle and Magilligan Point.  The sea area outside Lough Foyle is generally taken to emcompass the area from the northernmost limit of Lough Foyle out to 12 miles from baselines.</P>
    <P>Legislation is currently in preparation in both jurisdictions which is designed <i>inter alia</i> to extend the statutory functions of the Foyle Fisheries Commission to include the development of salmon and inland fisheries, the promotion of angling and the regulation of aquaculture and sea fisheries.  The proposed legislation is designed in the main to give effect to the recommendations of the review of the operations, funding structure and staffing of the Foyle Fisheries Commission undertaken by KPMG management consultants on behalf of the Department of the Marine and Department of Agriculture Northern Ireland. KPMG did consult local interests in the course of their review and a complete list of those consulted is being drawn up which will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</P>

      <P>The increase in rental to £500 per annum was advised by the Valuation Office and is considered to be a fair and reasonable rental for the area of one acre of foreshore involved.  It is public policy that market value rentals should be considered at every rent review date.  However, if the club submits its best offer to me giving convincing reasons it should be accepted the matter will be considered.</P>
