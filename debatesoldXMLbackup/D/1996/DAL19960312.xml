      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Government delegation, comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Social Welfare, had a very useful meeting yesterday with a UUP delegation led <Col N="2014" /> by the party leader, Mr. David Trimble, MP.</P>
      <P>The discussions were open and frank and while conclusions were not reached, the meeting provided a better mutual understanding of our respective positions on the most effective way forward.</P>
      <P>The exchanges focused on the relevant key issues to be addressed in the substantive phase of the all-party negotiations commencing on 10 June, including the arrangements for them.  Yesterday's meeting between the Government and the UUP has helped to build on the progress already achieved in the intensive consultations with the Northern Ireland parties.</P>

      <P>It is bizarre that the person who attended the meeting is sitting in silence while the person answering the question did not attend the meeting.  Perhaps that is the way the Government is working these days. Why was there such emphasis on legislation about arms decommissioning?</P>

      <P>While the communiqué is interesting.  I am talking about the meeting held yesterday in Government Buildings.  Irrespective of the Government's housekeeping <Col N="2015" /> arrangements, it is odd that the Tánaiste, who attended the meeting, is sitting in silence while the person speaking on the Government's behalf did not attend the meeting.  That is out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy is addressed in paragraph 12 of the communiqué.  It states that both Governments recognise that confidence building measures will be necessary and all participants would need to make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and nonviolence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not delaying on the question but this matter is of primary importance.  There is not another matter that is as important as the peace <Col N="2016" /> process to the people, and yesterday's meeting was crucial.  In the briefing given after the meeting the Taoiseach placed great emphasis on the question of forthcoming legislation.  Will the Minister of State emphasise what is involved?  Is legislation being introduced? Is this another precondition for Sinn Féin's participation in the talks?  Is the electoral process the only way to the table or will further preconditions be set?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Many matters were discussed at yesterday's meeting but no decision was taken on legislation.  The question of such legislation and other matters relating to decommissioning are under consideration.  As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have done everything in their power not to set preconditions and to bring all parties to the talks.  Yesterday's discussions were, in themselves, a major step forward in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Did discussions take place on whether the Official Unionist Party would take part in the 10 June talks?  In the event of this party not participating in the talks and of a ceasefire not being called until after 10 June, is it possible for the parties to resume talks at a later date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for Mr. Trimble or any of the UUP delegation but the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have stated on numerous occasions &mdash; this is also set out in the communiqué of 28 February &mdash; that the date of 10 June is fixed and firm.  No one can be unclear about the Government's position on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The elective process was not discussed but the issues which were discussed drew attention to the three requirements in regard to the elective process set out in the Mitchell report: first, it would need to be broadly acceptable; second, it would need to have an appropriate mandate and, third, it would have to be within the three strand structure.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have set out the Government's position on these matters.  The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council is awaiting two reports in phase two of its work on output and employment, &ldquo;Employment and Enterprise in the Irish Economy&rdquo;. These reports are on: (i) Ireland's investment performance and (ii) competitive advantage on clusters in the Irish economy: a study of selected manufacturing and service activities. Consultants' reports on these subjects are expected in May 1996 and June 1996, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach outlined in his response to a question by Deputy Ivor <Col N="2020" /> Callely last Wednesday, the Government has requested the NESC to look at three matters as follows: (i) it is proposed that the council should examine and take into account in its work on employment and enterprise in the Irish economy the recommendations of the OECD jobs study published in June 1994 and those of the EU White Papers, Growth, Competitiveness, Employment and Social Policy, taking account of the relevant components of the Government's new approach to industrial policy set out in response to the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Culliton report and indicate to what extent, and how, they should be implemented in Ireland so as to have maximum effect on employment and growth.</P>
    <P>(ii) It is proposed that as part of the programme of preparation for the millennium, the council should prepare, by end of 1996, a series of reports outlining the economic, social and demographic profile of Ireland in the year 2000 and beyond.  This forms part of its work on Ireland in the 21st century.  The council is asked to explore the possibility that the Northern Ireland Economic Council would join in this analysis on either an integrated or complementary basis.</P>
    <P>(iii) When the Taoiseach visited the council in January he requested it to prepare a strategy document as an input to the negotiation of a new national programme to cover the years 1997, 1998 and 1999.  In this context the Taoiseach asked the NESC to examine the role partnership at the firm level had to play in creating the basis for the constructive and flexible response necessary from the Irish economy to European Monetary Union and the effect of currency movements outside the European Monetary Union on particular sectors and firms within the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the NESC will be busy.  I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply but will he say what progress has been made in the talks on another programme or <Col N="2021" /> whether firm talks must await the outcome of these momentous and monumental studies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance indicated that the Government favours the continuation of these talks.  I am not aware that a date has been set for firm talks but ongoing meetings have taken place between the social partners and the Government at various levels.  It is the Government's hope that such talks will take place and that a further agreement can be negotiated provided the terms can be agreed by all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there is no longer a necessity for reports given that the Government has not implemented any of the recommendations made in previous reports?  The OECD report gave examples of the difficulties caused in the economy by over expenditure and too high personal tax rates.  Will the Minister agree that if those issues were tackled by the Government there would be no need for these elaborate reports and some serious work could be done?</P>

      <P>Implementation of the Strategic Management Initiative is well under way, both at the level of the individual Departments and offices and, centrally, through Government consideration of an overall programme of change in the public service.  Preliminary statements of strategy are now being revised and finalised.  Statements will be published for all Departments and offices during this year.  The SMI will be extended to the wider public service during 1996.  I understand that my <Col N="2023" /> colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is launching the SMI to local authorities later this month.</P>
      <P>The second report to Government of the co-ordinating group of secretaries, established under the Strategic Management Initiative, setting out a comprehensive framework for change, has now been completed.  The Government will announce in the near future a comprehensive programme for reform of the public service.  This programme comprises a number of initiatives within an overall framework setting out a strategic direction for the future.  The initiatives will address a number of matters such as greater delegation and devolution and improved accountability within the Civil Service, improvements in service quality and delivery, regulatory reform, better co-ordination across Departments and improved personnel and financial management systems.</P>

      <P>Is it the Government's intention to publish the individual strategic management initiatives for particular Departments and, if so, when will they be published?  In some Departments the initiatives have been implemented since the end of 1994.  Is it not important to inform the House and the public of these initiatives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any <Col N="2024" /> objection in principle.  If there are any difficulties in practice I will have to reserve the Government's position on this.  When the Government's public service reform proposals are put forward, which will probably be in May, all these matters will be for public debate.  There will be a great deal of initiatives and worthwhile reform resulting from the process.</P>

The initiative for the Department of Social Welfare is completed and I have a copy.  When will the Government publish them so that the public can see where Departments are going?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The two existing functions transferred in respect of the Department since the Taoiseach came into office are community employment in designated partnership areas, responsibility for which was transferred to the Department of Enterprise and Employment under a transfer of functions order on 6 February 1996, and access to the offshore islands which is now the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  Arrangements are being put in place to transfer functions under the Aran Islands Transport Act, 1946, from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has acquired responsibility for the following new functions: the Devolution Commission for Local Government Reform, established in July 1995; the development of a national anti-poverty strategy, in association with the Department of Social Welfare, in line with the commitment given at the UN Social Summit in Copenhagen; a review of the administration of development programmes in the Border counties, with a view to maximising their effectiveness; and responsibility for co-funding those parts of the EU programme for peace and reconciliation for which ADM has been designated as the intermediary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying I have responsibility for the partnership areas.  The community employment scheme was, by and large, administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment but the element of its budget which was applied in partnership areas was implemented by the Department of the Taoiseach under my supervision.  It was considered more efficient and effective to have the community employment scheme administered by one Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On several occasions, in newspapers and in the Dáil, the Minister went through the whole matter of community employment in partnership areas.  He has done well for his own constituency in this matter.  Is he no longer responsible for community employment in the partnership area boards?  If this is the case, there is an enormous mix up of responsibilities with regard to community employment.  I would like a reasonable explanation of the purpose of this shifting forwards and backwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the administration of discretionary funds.  Since there is such a lack of knowledge about the local development scheme I promised in the House I would hold a seminar on local development. I have since set a date for that seminar. I invited Members of the House, and I hope Deputy McDowell will take time to attend because it is clear he does not <Col N="2028" /> understand the difference between community employment, local partnership schemes and discretionary funds.  Community employment is administered by FÁS.  I have never had any hand, act or part in administering individual grants in mine or in anybody else's constituency. If the Deputy comes to the seminar he may learn something about local development, although I do not think the Deputy will spend too much time in the deprived parts of Dublin helping to administer the plan.</P>

      <P>As a representative of areas of high disadvantage on the south side of the city of Cork, it is with some relief that I hear that the Minister of State has been stripped of some of his powers, given that under the urban renewal programme he deprived the south side of Cork which had originally been eligible under that programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has undertaken one initiative under subhead D2 &mdash; special co-operation initiatives &mdash; in 1995.  This initiative is the Irish Genealogical Project which is an all-Ireland, tourism project arising from the work of the Task Force on Roots, Genealogy and Tourism.</P>
      <P>The Irish Genealogical Project has brought together all those, North and South of the island of Ireland, involved in genealogy and provides the means by which those concerned can contribute to developing genealogy in its own right but also in its capacity as a tourism attraction.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of the project is the generation of visitor traffic to Ireland which has been motivated by the appeal in tracing roots, and as a consequence of this, the creation of jobs and employment opportunities in the tourism and travel sectors.  The project is designed to improve dramatically genealogical research facilities to the point where they can be marketed to tourists of Irish descent all over the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> This is to be achieved through the creation of a family history research service, based on locally created and controlled databases.  There are some 35 genealogical centres now spread throughout the Thirty-two Counties where computerisation of records from parish records and other sources is almost complete.</P>
    <P>The project has both national and local economic benefits, through the development of community based initiatives and training and skills development.  The employment potential, both direct and indirect, of the project, when successfully developed and marketed, will be considerable.</P>
    <P>In addition to the economic benefits the project has proven that it can foster several worthwhile social benefits, including all-Ireland cross-community relations, local community awareness and pride in local heritage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The proposal to establish a third banking force was included in the programme of the previous Government, published in January 1993, and in the programme of the present Government.</P>
      <P>The options for restructuring the State banks continue to be examined by myself and a number of Government colleagues with a view to identifying the most effective solution having regard to the nature of the individual institutions, their particular customer markets, the needs of the whole community in its broadest sense and developments in the EU.</P>
      <P>The issue of how the State banks might be restructured in order to achieve our objective of a vibrant and competitive banking market is such a complex and difficult one that I refuse to be rushed into recommending to the Government a particular solution to it. We will only have one chance to get it right, and getting it right must, therefore, be given priority.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer is extremely disappointing.  He must have difficulty in repeating what he has been saying in the House for the past 12 months.

In a debate on the Adjournment some time ago the Minister spoke about the position of An Post and of the credit unions.  He has said nothing of those today.

      <P>The estimated cost in 1996 of Exchequer-funded occupational public service pensions is £563 million. The projected cost for 2006 is £678 million. As regards pre-funding these liabilities, the Government has established a commission to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements for public servants.  The question of funding is one of the issues to be considered by the commission whose report is scheduled to be submitted to Government in 1998.</P>

      <P>In view of the decrease in the birth rate from a high of 74,000 in 1980 to 47,000 last year does the Minister accept there is an increasing elderly population?  It is estimated that the cost of public sector pensions will increase from £1.2 billion to £2.4 <Col N="2034" /> billion in the next 25 years.  Is he satisfied that the present method of funding such pensions will be sufficient to cover them and, if not, what plans has he to deal with the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the rapidly declining birth rate I am happy to say I contributed towards redressing that trend in the last 16 months.  The figures given by the Deputy are incorrect.  In the year 2010 the figure will be £772 million; in 2020 it will be £1,224 million and in the year 2030 it will be £1,427 million.  That gives cause for considerable alarm.  As and from 6 April last year all public servants, including civil servants, are Class A PRSI contributors. It is not unreasonable to presume that there will be an increase in PRSI contributions over the next 30 years but that will not be sufficient to fund the pensions. That is why the commission, which will make a comprehensive report, in 1998 was established.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked about public sector pensions and the information I have given relates to the following categories.  The breakdown is £105 million for Civil Service pensioners; £69 million for Garda pensioners; £56 million for Defence Forces pensioners; £138 million for retired educationalists; £100 million for retired health workers; £62 million for retired local authority officials and approximately £10 million for other categories. The total for 1995 is £540 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 26, 30, 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>This matter is primarily one for the Garda and is, I understand, the subject of ongoing investigations by them.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Customs was not involved in any landing of prohibited drugs at Castletownbere at any time and was not informed by anybody of a proposal to land such drugs at Castletownbere. It is the case that the possibility of a major smuggling operation at an unspecified future date was advised to Customs by the Garda at some time beforehand, but no details of any such operations were made available to Customs at any time.</P>
      <P>By prior arrangement with the Garda, Customs was present at the scene in Urlingford, County Kilkenny, on 8 November 1995, where a large seizure of cannabis resin was made.  On that occasion, the seizure had been made by the gardaí prior to the arrival of Customs. I have no information about the circumstances surrounding the actual importation of the drugs seized.  I should point out that while Customs is, in the normal course, the agency with primary responsibility for intercepting and seizing drugs illegally imported, the Garda also has full seizure powers.</P>
      <P>As I said already, this matter is primarily one for the Garda and is, I understand, the subject of ongoing investigations by them.  I fully support the comments made in the House last week by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, about the need for great care in dealing with what is obviously a very sensitive matter.  The Government is determined to do everything in its power to deal effectively with the problem of trafficking in illegal drugs.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that no information was leaked by the Customs which compromised this operation?  Will he further confirm that the briefing given to certain persons in the media to the effect that Customs officials had compromised the operation <Col N="2037" /> by leaking information to it was a malicious falsehood?</P>

      <P>Last week the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners indicated to the Committee of Public Accounts that he checked the allegation made in the media that Customs officers leaked information and, therefore, compromised the operation and was advised by the Secretary of the Department of Justice that the Garda no longer contended that was the case. Will the Minister agree that any indication that his officers leaked information to the media and thereby compromised the so-called seizure of drugs at Urlingford was a malicious falsehood?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 15, 27, 37 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Madrid last December unequivocally confirmed 1 January 1999, the latest date envisaged by the Treaty on European Union, as the commencement date for Economic and Monetary Union.  The European Council also named the single currency the Euro and set out a reference scenario for the transition to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference scenario sets out the following timetable; as early as possible in 1998, the European Council will decide which member states meet the criteria for entry to Economic and Monetary Union.  On 1 January 1999, Economic and Monetary Union will begin. The exchange rates of the participating currencies will be irrevocably locked, the Euro will come into being as a currency in its own right and the European Central Bank will begin to operate the single monetary policy attaching to it. By 1 January 2002 at the latest, Euro notes and coins will be introduced into <Col N="2041" /> circulation and by 1 July 2002 at the latest, national currencies will have been withdrawn from circulation in the area where the Euro is operating.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any plans to delay the commencement date of 1 January 1999 so recently confirmed by the European Council.  I am however aware that preparations at EU and national level are intensifying on the basis of the timescale set out in the reference scenario.</P>
    <P>The convergence criteria which member states must meet to join Economic and Monetary Union relate to <i>inter alia</i> the general Government deficit position. In this context, I have seen a summary of the Report from the German Institute for Economic Research referred to by Deputy Byrne.  The Report apparently argues that it would be better to relax criteria than to delay the start of Economic and Monetary Union.  In particular, the report seems to argue that, provided a member state met the other criteria, it should not be excluded from qualifying for Economic and Monetary Union on the basis simply that its deficit is over 3 per cent of GDP: account should be taken of the Treaty text which would allow a deficit above 3 per cent if the excess were exceptional, temporary and small.  The report recommends that this approach be adopted rather than deferral of the 1 January 1999 commencement date for Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>From the summary available to me, the Report seems merely to argue for application of text which is already in the Treaty.  It will be a matter for the European Council, in the composition of Heads of State and Government, to decide which member states qualify for Economic and Monetary Union having taken due account of the reports of the EU Commission and the EMI and the opinion of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>As regards the survey referred to by Deputy Aylward, I understand that this survey was carried out by consultants who interviewed ten Irish executives as part of a survey of 169 top company executives in 13 EU countries.  I welcome the recognition in the survey of <Col N="2042" /> the benefits Economic and Monetary Union will bring for Irish business.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to establish a single forum to discuss all the implications of Economic and Monetary Union.  Work on preparation for Economic and Monetary Union at national level here is structured to dovetail with the approach and timetable agreed by the European Council in December, the key dates of which I set out earlier.</P>
    <P>The national level work is as follows: I commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out a study on the likely economic, employment and sectoral implications of Economic and Monetary Union for Ireland in order to deepen our understanding of the opportunities and challenges which Economic and Monetary Union will present for the economy.  Persons and groups with material to contribute to that end were invited to submit it to the ESRI consultants.  The ESRI study is to be completed by 30 June 1996 and its findings will be made public.  In the meantime, the National Economic and Social Council, on which the social partners are represented, will consider the question of Economic and Monetary Union among others in the context of the follow-on report to the council's Strategy for Growth, Competitiveness and Employment intended to precede the negotiations on a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  I made a presentation last week to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs about Economic and Monetary Union.  My presentation was the first in a two-day debate which the Select Committee held on Economic and Monetary Union.  The Committee has indicated its intention to return to the issue later in the year.  I have made arrangements to set up an informal group representative of relevant interest groups in the private sector to advise my Department on technical issues, such as rounding, etc., which will be discussed at EU level in the course of this year and in the run-up to the 1998 Council decision on which member states qualify for Economic and Monetary Union. <Col N="2043" /> When the 1998 decision has been taken, I expect this informal group will form the nucleus of a more formal structure to oversee the practical arrangements needed to manage the transition to the single currency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  I agree with his interpretation of the report from the German Institute for Economic Research. That flexibility exists within the terms of the treaty.  Perhaps what is needed is a more liberal interpretation of what is already in the treaty.</P>
      <P>What weight does the Minister give to the recent comments of Mr. Issing, the chief economist with the Bundesbank?  I was quite taken aback that he would speak in such stark terms of the single currency being capable of destroying the EU.  Economic growth expectations were predicted to be at about 2.6 per cent.  They have now been sharply pegged back to less than 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>Those two factors would seem to impact on the start dates in 1999.  How does the Minister interpret both issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments attributed to the senior member of the Bundesbank were clearly made in his personal capacity.  I do not take them to represent official Bundesbank policy because the Bundesbank policy is quite clearly in favour of Economic and Monetary Union although it has consistently expressed concerns about the need for real and sustained convergence among the participating member states.  The President of the Bundesbank, who will be in this country later this week when the Deputy may have an opportunity to meet with him, will take that opportunity, once again, to put on record the official views of the Bundesbank in his capacity as its President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns were expressed by that individual and others about certain operational difficulties relating to the Single Market, the operation of Economic and Monetary Union and the question of the relationship between those currencies <Col N="2044" /> which participate at the outset and those that do not, either by choice or necessity. The issue is clearly a matter for ongoing study.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Minister correctly takes the view that the remarks expressed by Professor Issing's represented his own view.  Nonetheless, does he not consider it disturbing that a person in such a senior position in the Bundesbank should query the viability of the Economic and Monetary Union project?  Does it ring some alarm bells in his mind as to whether the ordinary people in the member states of the EU will support Economic and Monetary Union if contrary voices are expressed at such a senior level in institutions in which they have great trust?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The view expressed must be given considerable weight given the representational role that man possesses as a member of the largest central bank in Europe which is noted for its independence. The House will recall that serious reservations about German unification were expressed by the Bundesbank, particularly about the policy of the then German Government under <Col N="2045" /> Chancellor Kohl to offer an exchange rate of 1:1 between the Ostmark and the Deutsche Mark.  In the nature of open and democratic society different views will be expressed.  Serious issues surround the operation of Economic and Monetary Union, some of which have not been properly thrashed out.  It is not unreasonable for people to express concerns about the operational feasibility and application of Economic and Monetary Union.  That is the reason a study on cohabitation, or the ins and outs, as it is colloquially described, is being conducted. We must await the recommendations of that study and see if they are accepted in whole or in part by ECOFIN and the European Council.  The core point of Professor Issing's conclusion was that Economic and Monetary Union will put the entire market of the European Union at risk.  It will bring about a new currency relationship that will maximise stability among different currencies within a single market.  It must be understood that even when Economic and Monetary Union comes about, the most optimistic projection by President Santer is that eight or nine of the 15 EU member states will participate. We will continue to have more than one currency within the internal market and, therefore, it is essential that a currency arrangement is reached that will minimise probabilities of competitive devaluations or fluctuations.</P>

      <P>I apologise for not being as attentive as I should.  A report of the German Institute for Economic Research states that it would be better to relax the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union rather than delay the commencement of European economic <Col N="2046" /> and monetary union to give other nations more time to qualify under the existing terms.  Does the Minister consider that we should argue for relaxing the criteria in favour of bringing more countries on board rather than bringing it in on schedule?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be against relaxing the criteria.  As a young practising architect I was advised by a senior wise architect with whom I worked that people would never remember if a building project were completed on time, but they would never forget if it leaked.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that whatever proposal we put forward, particularly on Economic and Monetary Union which will be an historical first as no other group of nations have done what we are proposing to do, is right rather than try to meet a particular timetable.  That is my personal view. The criteria are designed to ensure maximum convergence among participating member States.  A relaxation of the criteria would be open to a good deal of misinterpretation by financial markets and, in my considered view, would not be helpful to the overall project.</P>

      <P>In its report the German Institute for Economic Research, which is a highly respected body, states that in trying to meet the Maastricht criteria by 1997 many potential members will be forced to implement restrictive economic measures which would weaken their economies and make meeting the criteria even more difficult. We know that the economic difficulties which caused the French Government to cut back on public spending, particularly social welfare spending, resulted in street riots recently.  The Germans argue that if unemployment continues to rise social and political tensions could threaten the process of European Union.  This Parliament should note the serious comments made by that respected body.  What are the Minister's views on the frightening scenario of a possible social backlash resulting from <Col N="2047" /> pressurising certain countries to meet a criterion for Economic and Monetary Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on a number of occasions, including at a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, that the Maastricht criteria are good housekeeping ones and are not a recipe for austerity or social upheaval. It would be a mistake to conclude that they are.  The imbalances in the national accounts of Austria, France or Belgium would have to be addressed if the prospect of Economic and Monetary Union did not exist.  In any case, the difficulties and diseconomies currently within the French social fund must be addressed by the French and it is a matter for those authorities as to how to address them.  If I may intrude on the domestic affairs of another country, it would be possible for France to meet the Maastricht criteria by reducing its Defence expenditure and not cause the type of austerity on social expenditure caused by the Gaullist centre-right government. Under its rules and accounting procedures, internal problems confront the social fund out of which French social welfare contributions are made.  Those problems must be addressed.  The problems are similar in Austria.  Problems have arisen for different reasons in Belgium.  I am concerned that Governments addressing financial problems of a domestic budgetary nature are blaming the imposition of unpopular measures which they have politically decided to introduce on the obligation to meet the Maastricht criteria.  In many countries that is not the case because they would have to address the issues concerned independent of whether the Maastricht criteria were in existence or the Economic and Monetary Union was a prospect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given our salutary experience during the currency crisis some years ago, and the attitude adopted by the Germans on that occasion, is the Minister concerned that, <Col N="2048" /> juxtaposing the comments of Professor Issing and Mr. Tietmeyer, who has also voiced some doubt on the issue, only if Germany is in support will it come about?  I accept the reality of that if Germany is not in.  How can we convey to other European Finance Ministers that this is not good enough, the Maastricht Treaty having been ratified, the decision in principle taken and all the relevant instruments put in place?  Does the Minister agree that if Germany's priorities within the context of Economic and Monetary Union are weighted in its national interests only, this is not acceptable to other member states and that Germany must acknowledge that the overall debate on the issue has moved considerably since Maastricht?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty contains an Article &mdash;I cannot recall its precise reference but I placed it on record in a Committee of the House last week at which Members present also participated &mdash; requiring member states to operate a monetary policy having regard to its impact on their neighbours but no sanction is attached to that Article, which is an aspirational rather than a legally binding one.  Nevertheless, recognition of the necessity for a member state to have regard to the implications of its economic policy on other member states is written into that treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting to the reference to the currency difficulties experienced in 1992-93, under the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany the Bundesbank must have regard to its obligations, a law I suspect that supersedes the Maastricht Treaty.  The Bundesbank adopted policy decisions in 1992 based on its interpretation of its legal obligations.  It is precisely because of the inherent difficulties experienced by different central banks implementing different legally enforceable policies that the Bundesbank believes it has a legal obligation to implement the Economic and Monetary Union proposal which contains <i>inter alia</i> the concept of a European central bank. <Col N="2049" /> This will mean that, rather than a dominant central bank setting policy and interest rates which other central banks are driven to replicate or follow through market forces, there would be a European central bank representing all the participating member states within the first round of Economic and Monetary Union forming policy within a council, at which we would also be represented, rather than being forced to respond to market forces following a decision of the largest central bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that that is precisely what we are endeavouring to achieve, that we do not want Germany to wreck the process of moving toward the establishment of a European central bank which would obviate many past problems?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a mistaken view to think Germany is trying to wreck the process.  I do not think that is the case.  Legitimate concerns are being expressed by central bankers in Germany who are, by definition, within any market economy naturally conservative. Given the history of German attachment to anti-inflationary pressures and monetary stability, that is not unreasonable. In addition, Chancellor Kohl's political commitment to a single currency and to bringing the Federal Republic of Germany firmly into a so-called European house, including its Deutsch Mark, is unquestioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Interim Index of Consumer Prices as an important step towards the goal of achieving fair comparison between inflation rates in member states across <Col N="2050" /> the EU.  That goal is especially important in the context of the Maastricht Treaty, given that a satisfactory inflation performance is one of the criteria for eligibility for Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>The new index is, of course, an interim one, pending agreement at EU level on a &ldquo;Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices&rdquo;, which is scheduled to begin in 1997.  Certain key purchase categories do not appear in the interim index, notably mortgage interest payments, health and education services, car insurance and foreign holidays.  I expect that the harmonised index of consumer prices, when ready, will be more comprehensive in scope, as is envisaged by Article 3 of the Council Regulation on the matter.</P>
      <P>The figures published on 29 February last showed that under the new Interim Index the latest inflation rate for Ireland was 2.3 per cent, comparing favourably with an EU average of 2.8 per cent.  I am confident that future inflation figures for Ireland under the Interim Index, and subsequently under the harmonised index, will continue to indicate an inflation performance which is satisfactory and which enables us to meet the inflation criterion for Economic and Monetary Union.  Discipline and vigilance on the part of the Government and the social partners will ensure that we meet this criterion.</P>

      <P>What will be the impact of the elements omitted from our calculation of inflation rates such as mortgage interest payments, health and education services, car insurance and foreign holidays?  What will be the effect of increased inflation rates in other member states on monetary control here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I have the precise numerical impact of the omission of mortgage interest rates, etc. within the Irish context but, given the large numbers of householders here &mdash; the highest in the Northern hemisphere <Col N="2051" />&mdash; I would suspect it would be significant but I do not want to give the Deputy an estimated figure.  I will communicate with him specifically in relation thereto.</P>
      <P>On the second question, higher inflation rates in other member states would lead to tighter monetary control here because as one of its primary responsibilities the Central Bank, an independent institution, must have regard to inflationary trends and has a commitment to price stability.  If it felt inflation was increasing it would use whatever instruments were available to it, principally interest rate policy, to ensure that did not occur.  Subject to confirmation &mdash; and I shall write to the Deputy on the matter &mdash; there is a difference here in that our consumer price index last year was 2.4 per cent whereas the interim index suggests 2.3 per cent, from which one would deduce that the answer to the Deputy's first question is approximately 0.1 per cent.  I will confirm that to him.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>whether he intends to impose VAT on green fees for golf clubs which have open membership and where equal status rules pertain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5596/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1 January 1996, the green fees of member-owned golf clubs have been subject to VAT, where such turnover exceeds or is likely to exceed the registration threshold of £20,000 per annum.  The fully commercial golf clubs have been taxable in respect of all their turnover since 1992.</P>
      <P>There is no basis in EU VAT law whereby the fully commercial clubs &mdash; which are usually open to all comers &mdash; could be made exempt.  Nor would there by any justification for doing so, as they are operating in the course of furtherance of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor is there any basis in EU VAT law <Col N="2052" /> whereby, because of open membership or equal status rules, the exemption afforded to the member-related activities could be extended to green fee turnover where such turnover is in direct competition with commercial enterprises.  Such treatment could give rise to a tax-based distortion of competition and accordingly, under EU VAT law, would be open to challenge on that basis.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps explain to the Deputy that the initiative in relation to the taxation of green fees of member-owned clubs was not taken as a revenue raising measure, but rather on grounds of equity following complaints and a threat of court action from the fully commercial clubs.  EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply, clearly provides that the exemption for nonprofit making clubs cannot apply if the purpose of the activity in question is to obtain additional income by providing services which are in direct competition with those provided by commercial enterprises which are liable to the tax.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the new measures were very carefully targeted at the area where a distortion of competition had been demonstrated &mdash; the green fee type turnover.  Membership subscriptions to member-owned clubs remain exempt and bar and restaurant receipts and other such turnover, which were already taxable, are not counted in calculating the £20,000 annual turnover threshold.  Deductibility on inputs, denied to member-owned clubs up to now, are available in respect of their taxable activities and this should assist them in the future development of their facilities.  Furthermore, all golf clubs in Ireland have the benefit of reduced rating of 12.5 per cent whereas the green fees of their counterparts in the UK, Spain and France attract VAT at the standard rates in those countries of 17.5 per cent, 16 per cent and 20.6 per cent respectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that that represents a retrograde step bearing in mind that golfing activities <Col N="2053" /> here, especially because of our varied weather conditions, are a tremendous attraction to tourists?  Would he agree that golf clubs have played a considerable role in attracting tourists and should be given incentives rather than having additional taxation imposed on them?  Taking all those factors into account, would the Minister reconsider his decision and abolish this punitive tax since many golf clubs already operate on a financial knife-edge and, with the huge explosion in their numbers over the past five or six years, many find it very difficult to make ends meet?  If their income is further reduced their viability will be in doubt.  On that basis will the Minister reconsider his decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern.  On no other issue since I became Minister for Finance have I received so many representations and so much correspondence as the question of VAT on green fees for member-owned clubs.  I repeat in substance the text of my reply in responding to the numerous letters from virtually every Member. This was not introduced by me or the Revenue Commissioners as a revenue generating measure but because of our obligations under EU VAT law.  It was brought in on foot of complaints made to the Revenue Commissioners that commercially developed clubs which were responding to the commercial and tourism potential &mdash; the point Deputy Deasy made &mdash; were finding themselves in direct competition with member-owned clubs which were generating additional revenue by allowing non-members to play on their courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat what I have said to other Members and to deputations from the golfing associations.  A golf club which typically would have a sports shop, a restaurant and a bar would have tax liabilities and if the member-owned golf club constitutes itself as a company for the purposes of VAT it is then in a position to offset the VAT on many of its inputs against its VAT liabilities.  It has <Col N="2054" /> been brought to my attention that in some cases the increase in green fees is far in excess of 12.5 per cent and members have been told that the reason for the increase in green fees is VAT. The actual VAT component is only 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by Deputies.  I repeat that this is not a revenue generating measure. We did not choose to introduce it but are obliged under law to do so to maintain equality and level competition.  The alternative was to face court action and in recent years we have seen the cost of such court actions.  We would have no prospect of winning such an action if it was to go to court because a case would be taken where the prospect of victory would be maximised &mdash; private member-owned clubs have very substantial green fee income, in some cases over £100,000 per annum.  This is the reality with which we have to deal.  I am very sympathetic to the golf clubs.  We have tried to accommodate their needs as best we can while meeting our obligations under law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there are only a handful of commercial golf clubs and very few are making a profit?  Most of the open membership clubs are in serious debt.  Will the Minister provide some hope that clubs which have a serious debt problem will be exempt from this imposition?</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Deasy's assertion.  Commercial clubs which are taking in £100,000 in green fees are losing money as this would not pay the cost of building, servicing and maintaining the course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I can set a zero rate of VAT but I do not have that freedom in the application of European Union VAT law or, because of the budgetary implications, the option of setting it at 5 per cent.  Because of the interim stage we are at with EU VAT legislation that option is not open to us. There are other options open to the clubs.  The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, as a professional accountant could suggest ways to minimise this cost by being properly incorporated for all their activities.  All their supplies which they buy in are subject to VAT and that could be offset against their VAT income so that there would be a gross and a net VAT income.  I indicated this repeatedly to the representatives of the golf clubs.  There is a sense that we are trying to squeeze some kind of miserable revenue from the golfing fraternity.  That is not the case.  We have no calculation as to what revenue will be generated from this.  It is an obligation under law to which we must adhere.  If we do not do it we will face a legal challenge, lose a court case and then be hit retrospectively for damages to commercial clubs going back to 1992. We all know the cost of retrospective damages.  Deputies Eric Byrne and Kathleen Lynch can give fair testimony to the cost of retrospective damages for a breach of European law.  We are not prepared to go down that road again.</P>

Any figure would be purely speculative.  We are talking about a 12.5 per cent yield on golf clubs with a turnover threshold in excess of £20,000.  Even if one were to make presumptions about all the golf clubs, the revenue generated would be very small in the context of the total revenue of £12.8 billion which the Revenue Commissioners gather.

Last year we took a view based on the calculations made by the economic forecasting sections in the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare that, given the outturn of the economy, the figure would be 266,000.  However, the average outturn for the year was 278,000, an increase of 12,000.  We have no reason at this early stage of the year to alter our forecast of 275,000.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to review our gaming and lotteries legislation with a view to increasing the £10,000 ceiling for charity lottery prize funds, providing for unclaimed prize moneys resulting from the national lottery to be placed in a reserve fund for specific charitable purposes and reviewing the general operation of the national lottery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The prize limits for <Col N="2058" /> private and charitable lotteries are set under the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  In accordance with the provisions of that legislation, any changes in those limits would be a matter not for me but for the Minister for Justice.  The impact of the national lottery, for which I have statutory responsibility, would be only one of many factors across the charities spectrum which would have to be taken into account by the Minister for Justice in any review of those limits.</P>
      <P>As regards unclaimed national lottery prizes, the rules of the lottery, as approved by me, state that prizes must be claimed within 90 days of a lotto draw or of the announcement of the termination of an instant game and that these unclaimed prizes stay within the pool for allocation to future prizes pools.  Accordingly, it would not be open to me to appropriate the unclaimed prizes which have accumulated to date.  Any attempt to do so could possibly be open to legal challenge. Nor do I propose to change the rules for future games as it is considered there could be strong negative reaction from players resulting in reduced sales, to the ultimate detriment of the lottery surplus and the good causes it supports.</P>
      <P>The overall operations of the national lottery, the purpose of which is to provide surplus revenue which can be allocated to the beneficiary fund, are kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  I am sure he, like every other Member of the House, is conscious of the constant uphill struggle by various charities to accumulate sufficient funds to sustain their operations. I understand the £10,000 ceiling was set under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Would the Minister not agree that raising the ceiling to £25,000 would not impinge on the viability or otherwise of the national lottery?  On occasions when prize money reaches £2.5 million, the national lottery adds an extra £1 million.  People feel uneasy that £1 million, which could be used to help <Col N="2059" /> struggling charities, is being wasted in this way.</P>

      <P>The question of raising the threshold from £10,000 to £25,000 is, as I said in my reply, a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I invite the Deputy to table a question to her on this matter. As regards the claims he made about the national lottery, that is a matter for it.  The national lottery, which is accountable to the Department of Finance, is a well run and successful company. As regards his query about large jackpots which are introduced from time to time, I am reliably told by the chairman and chief executive of the national lottery that because lotteries are jackpot driven there is a necessity to enhance the jackpot in order to maintain sales.</P>

It was estimated that between £20 million and £30 million additional funds would be generated by the lottery each year.  The real figure was close to £100 million.  The view taken by different Administrations, which I support, was that some of those proceeds should be used for essential services and to lower the burden of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The Government will announce in the near future a comprehensive programme for reform of the public service. This programme will comprise a number of initiatives within an overall framework setting out a strategic direction for the future.  The initiatives will address a number of matters such as greater delegation and devolution and improved accountability within the public service, an improved approach to service quality and delivery, regulatory reform, better co-ordination across Departments, and improved financial management and personnel management systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements will be aimed at enhancing and maintaining a high level <Col N="2062" /> of performance.  In this context, consideration will be given to incentive payments, for example, performance-related pay, as a means of rewarding good or excellent performance either by an individual or by groups of individuals. The Deputy will appreciate that the introduction of such a system will merit careful examination and consultation before a decision can be taken on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Government is open to the concept of performance related pay in the public service.  Has the Minister examined the model set by the New Zealand Government which established a state services commission which carries out effectively an evaluation role on behalf of the Government in New Zealand?  It effectively requires the administrative head of Government Departments to form a contract with the state services commission for the purposes of delivering certain quantities of service within certain performance criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been implementing performance related pay for some time in some semi-State companies.  There are performance related pay contracts in which a bonus, related to certain criteria and judgment, forms part of the salary package.  One contract currently under consideration will enhance considerably the bonus component of a salary in the semi-State sector.  With regard to the New Zealand experience, the Government has examined some of the examples to which the Deputy referred.  All bonus related pay programmes must, of necessity, have clear benchmarks against which performance can be measured.  There have to be criteria against which one can set a level and if targets beyond that are achieved they can be rewarded by way of bonus payments.  To do that, we have to set targets for different Departments. It will be open to the Strategic Management Initiative, in due course, to move in that direction.  The first essential <Col N="2063" /> requirement is to clearly define the targets to be set for any Department, and how achievement of them can be contrasted, one year against another, and to what extent their achievement would relate to overall salary reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that it will be necessary to have an independent referee to fix these amounts other than the Department of Finance, which would be under pressure at budget time?  Is not some kind of agency or referee body necessary to prevent performance related pay becoming an administrative burden because of the difficulties of calculation and the wrangling about it and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the issues that will have to be given careful consideration for the reasons outlined by the Deputy.  It is a complex area.  We are aware of the New Zealand experience and have examined it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues that have been discussed are how the benchmarks are to be set, who is to control them and who will adjudicate on what happens to those who might be entitled to performance related pay.  Do I take it that within the Strategic Management Initiative performance related pay is a substantial issue and the Government has every intention of trying to find a way to ensure it forms a major part of incentives within the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are open to the concept. There are sectors of the public service where it can be applied and where it is being applied in varying degrees. All of the issues to which the Deputy referred &mdash; and more of which he is aware &mdash; will have to be examined and negotiated with the relevant unions and personnel involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I noticed recently that the unions had grave concerns about performance related pay being introduced as a concept that <Col N="2064" /> would form a fairly substantial element of the potential to earn income.  Have the Minister's officials had discussions on that specific point with the unions involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any detailed discussions having taken place. Such discussions would be premature. As the Deputy will have heard in reply to earlier questions to the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, the formal Strategic Management Initiative will not be launched until some weeks from now.  There will then be the detailed Strategic Management Initiative application for individual Departments and the question of remuneration will form part of that in due course.  I am not in a position to give any more precise information.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I indicated to Deputies on a number of occasions in the recent past that the White Paper on Education was published by the Minister for Education following consideration and approval by the Government.  The process included consideration of costings prepared by my Department in so far as these could be assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to previous questions on this matter I also stated that these costings were, of necessity, very tentative.  The decision taken by the Government in regard to funding is clearly set out by <Col N="2065" /> the Minister for Education in her foreword to the White Paper &mdash; essentially that the amount of funding which can be made available in any year will be a matter for determination by the Government in the context of the budgetary position.</P>
    <P>There are two principal reasons the costs of proposals in the White Paper are tentative.  First, as already indicated by the Minister for Education and me in reply to previous questions, the cost of implementing the White Paper is contingent on a number of factors, including the timescale in which proposals in the White Paper are to be introduced. All the initiatives in the White Paper will have to be considered by the Government within the framework of the budgetary parameters and the Maastricht Treaty convergence conditions. Second, because of the various imponderables in the implementation of initiatives outlined in the White Paper, including aspects subject to negotiation with concerned interests, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to say with any certainty what the cost of implementing the White Paper will be. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to disclose the tentative costings arrived at by my Department as part of its function of providing observations for the Government's consideration of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House, my colleague, the Minister for Education in accordance with normal practice will provide costings as appropriate on proposals to implement specific aspects of the White Paper as and when they are submitted to Government for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest very strongly at the Minister's consistent attitude in this matter.  I have heard that argument trotted out on several occasions in this House.  That a costing is tentative does not mean it would not be of use to the public to know what it was.  There were many occasions on which the Minister has furnished costings and stressed that they were tentative. Will the Minister agree that the <Col N="2066" /> Department of Finance would render a public service if on this occasion it would indicate to this House &mdash; and through it to the public &mdash; the broad cost implications of the different segments of the White Paper on Education to enable the public to reach its own conclusions on its priorities and as to what should and should not be done? Will the Minister agree that it is not satisfactory that the only circumstance in which any aspect of the White Paper can be costed is if the Minister for Education makes an immediate move to implement it?  Surely, that strikes at the heart of parliamentary accountability.  Is there any good reason this House should not now know the full cost of each component in the best tentative estimate of the Minister's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the intention of the Minister for Education or the Government to attempt to have the proposals in the White Paper &mdash; which is a policy blueprint for the future &mdash; implemented in any one year or in a short period.  The White Paper, following a long consultative process, covered the entire spectrum of education.  If the Government of the day proceeded to give the best possible estimates of the costs of the White Paper and presumed them to be the entire costs of the White Paper, without breaking down those costs or giving a detailed analysis of them, which would further make them tentative, the presumptions could be misleading and distort debate rather than focus on the quality of the proposals in the White Paper.  However, I understand the Deputy's consistent concern in this regard and if he wishes to put down specific questions about particular components in it, I will attempt to have those questions answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions we discussed the form of accounting in its widest sense in the Department of Finance. Will the Minister agree there has been a practice for many years, of which <Col N="2067" /> we all have been guilty, of publishing plans without indicating the cost implications? It would be far better if the public understood there was no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and we might have more respect from them when we are seriously trying to improve matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the merit in what the Deputy and Deputy McDowell are saying.  I will review the position to see if we can give some indication of what the cost might be, but I remind the House of a previous occasion where people felt they had an accurate costing for a particular item which was subsequently found to be incorrect.  That would distort debate.  I am not prepared to give costings of a tentative nature if we find as a consequence that those figures are grossly inaccurate.  That would be a disservice to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2334" /> This Bill &mdash; the third Social Welfare Bill since I took up office 15 months ago &mdash; contains some of the most significant changes ever proposed to our social welfare system.  Last January, I described the budget as innovative in that, for the first time, an integrated approach was being taken to addressing our most pressing social and economic problem, long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>This Social Welfare Bill goes further than its primary purpose of giving legislative effect to the improvements in social welfare rates of payment announced in the budget last January.  I have said before in this House that the days of the piecemeal and <i>ad hoc</i> approach to the development of the social welfare system are over.  We need comprehensive, co-ordinated and integrated strategies which reflect the needs of people across the full spectrum of those in receipt of social welfare support.</P>
    <P>This Bill is doing just that.  Its 46 sections comprise a package of measures which will mark some of the most significant and far-reaching changes ever in the development of our social welfare system, simplify many aspects of an overly complex system, strengthen the rights of our citizens, consolidate the pro-work and pro-family policy direction commenced in last year's Bill, and provide for an improvement in the living standards of our citizens dependent on social welfare through increases in weekly rates of payment which are in excess of projected inflation for the year.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for a three per cent increase in weekly personal and adult dependant rates of payment from early to mid-June this year and for an increase of £2 in the monthly rates of child benefit from next September, the Bill also makes provision for such matters as the introduction of a new disability allowance to be administered by my Department as a replacement for the existing disabled person's allowance payable by the health boards, a new one-parent family payment which will amalgamate the existing, lone parent's <Col N="2335" /> allowance and deserted wife's benefit and remove once and for all the concept of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; from the social welfare system.  Recipients will no longer have to prove they have been &ldquo;deserted&rdquo; to qualify for payment; merely that, for whatever reason, they are raising a child or children alone and require income support.  The new scheme will also apply equally to men and women.</P>
    <P>It also provides for important reform of unemployment assistance with the aim of making it more attractive for people to take up part-time employment by enabling them to retain a higher proportion of their social welfare payment when they do so, an independent appeals system for people whose claims for supplementary welfare allowance have been turned down by enabling them to make a further appeal to the Social Welfare appeals office, and provision to allow unemployed people to have access to the social welfare tribunal at an earlier stage in trade disputes in line with a commitment I gave last year arising from the experience of the <i>Irish Press</i> dispute.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the provision of the Bill on a section by section basis, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a number of specific initiatives in this year's Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most fundamental and far-reaching initiative in this year's Bill is the introduction of a new one-parent family payment.  This new payment, which I envisage coming into effect from the beginning of 1997, will replace and enhance the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.</P>
    <P>It has two main objectives.  It will remove once and for all the requirement to prove &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; which has often been seen as difficult or degrading to women.  It will also ensure equality of treatment for men and women in the area of lone parenthood, the denial of which has been increasingly seen as unfair to men who nowadays more often raise children alone.  The necessary legislative changes required to facilitate <Col N="2336" /> the introduction of the one-parent family payment are contained in sections 17 to 21 of the Bill and I will outline those provisions in greater detail later.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new disability allowance is a major step forward in our provision for people who have disabilities or are unable to return to work due to long-term illness.  This new allowance will be administered by my Department as a replacement for the existing disabled person's maintenance allowance payable by the health boards.</P>
    <P>At present, the disabled person's maintenance allowance is administered by the health boards under regulations made by the Minister for Health under the Health Act, 1970.  The Bill provides for the inclusion of the disabled person's maintenance allowance as a social assistance payment under the social welfare Acts.  The new payment will be known as the disability allowance and existing recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance will transfer to the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The necessary legislative changes required to bring the new allowance into operation within the social welfare system are contained in sections 13 to 16 of the Bill.  These provide for some improvement in the eligibility criteria for the new allowance compared with conditions currently applying in the case of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  In line with a commitment I made last year following a High Court judgment on this issue, for the first time couples will receive two personal rates of disability allowance rather than the lower rate which currently applies to one spouse where both partners are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>Another far-reaching measure to which I want to draw particular attention concerns the reform of unemployment assistance which is provided for in section 22 of the Bill.  The intention is to simplify the existing arrangements which are extremely complex and to make it more attractive for people to take up part-time employment by ensuring that they retain a higher proportion <Col N="2337" /> of their social welfare payment than is currently the case.</P>
    <P>This type of reform is one I have favoured for some time and is also in line with a recommendation made to me in late 1995 by the Expert Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems.  The work of that group is now being finalised and I expect that its final report will be concluded shortly.  In the interim, the group submitted an interim report and a number of recommendations to me in the context of the 1996 budget.  I am pleased I was able to take several of their recommendations on board in drawing up my budget proposals.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the Bill provides for changes in the manner in which earnings from occasional or part-time employment are assessed for unemployment assistance purposes.  Under existing provisions, unemployment assistance is payable in respect of a day of unemployment provided the person is unemployed for at least three days in a period of six consecutive days.  As a result, someone who works for four or more days in a period of six consecutive days loses entitlement to unemployment assistance for the remaining days in that period.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, unemployment assistance paid for days of unemployment in the period of six consecutive days is reduced, where earnings from the days worked exceed a certain threshold or disregard.  This disregard amounts to one-sixth of the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to the person's family circumstances, plus £15 for each day worked.</P>
    <P>Any earnings in excess of the disregard are assessed as means and are deducted from the appropriate weekly rate of unemployment assistance.  The resulting amount &mdash; the weekly rate less means &mdash; is then divided by six to give the person's daily rate of unemployment assistance.  It is this daily rate which is then payable in respect of each day of unemployment in the six day period.  It is an extremely complicated system which cries out to be simplified and the <Col N="2338" /> provisions in this year's Bill set out to do just that.</P>
    <P>The new arrangement will provide that unemployment assistance will be payable in respect of a week of unemployment rather than in respect of a day of unemployment as at present; a week of unemployment will be defined as any three days of unemployment in a period of six consecutive days; unemployment assistance will be payable at the full weekly rate, in other words, it will be paid in respect of the days of unemployment as well as the days of employment in the relevent week; and 60 per cent of any earnings during that week will be deducted from the weekly rate of unemployment assistance for claimants with children.  For claimants without children, a daily disregard of £10 will be applied for each day worked and earnings in excess of this amount will be assessed at 60 per cent.  This daily disregard will protect people without dependent children from losses which they would otherwise suffer.  The combined effect of these changes is to ensure that everyone gains.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the effect of these changes, let us look at the position of a married recipient of unemployment assistance, with an adult dependant and three dependent children, who earns £90 for three days' work.  Under the new arrangements, he or she will be better off by £9.50 per week.  If that person earned £60 for the three days' work, he or she will be better off by more than £27 per week.  The change is of greatest benefit to people who manage to secure relatively low paid work; its purpose is to encourage people to take up job opportunities which may arise from time to time even if these are not always well paid or secure.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these changes will be beneficial to many unemployment assistance recipients as they make the option of taking up part-time or casual work much more attractive than at present.  This may give them the type of employment they are seeking or may provide them with valuable work experience that enables them to move <Col N="2339" /> into higher grade employment subsequently.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to make provision in this Bill for an independent appeals system, via the social welfare appeals office, for people whose claims for supplementary welfare allowance have been turned down by the health boards.  The existing supplementary welfare allowance appeals system has been the subject of criticism for some time past; the Ombudsman has expressed concern about the adequacy of the current arrangements.  I am satisfied that the approach I am adopting now will meet those concerns.</P>
    <P>It had been suggested to me that there might be an immediate right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office following an adverse decision on a claim for supplementary welfare allowance.  However, it is appropriate that the first avenue of appeal should remain with the health boards.  Given the immediate and urgent need associated with SWA claims generally, it is important that, as far as possible, claims for SWA are processed satisfactorily from the claimant's point of view within the health board.  It is my intention that the right of appeal to the Social Welfare appeals office will be provided initially in respect of claims for basic SWA payments and for the rent, mortgage and other supplements available under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that the administrative arrangements for appeals against adverse decisions in respect of the basic SWA payment and supplements are seen to be working efficiently and satisfactorily before I can consider extending it to the main remaining entitlement under the SWA scheme, the exceptional needs payment.  This payment differs greatly from other SWA payments because of its discretionary nature and, therefore, the right of appeal to the SWAO will not be provided, for the present, in respect of claims for it.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the specific provisions contained in the Bill.  Sections 1 <Col N="2340" /> and 2 contain the usual provisions relating to short title, construction and definitions.  The general increase of 3 per cent in the weekly personal and adult dependant rates of social insurance and social assistance payments, payable from early to mid-June next, is provided for in sections 3 and 4. The special increases of the carer's allowance and the lone parent's allowance are also provided for in section 4.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 5 for another significant increase in the monthly rate of child benefit.  With effect from 1 September next, child benefit will be increased by £2 per child per month.  This means that the monthly payment will amount to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  Over the last two years, we have provided increases of 45 per cent in respect of the first two children and 36 per cent in respect of other children, which is unprecedented and which reflects the Government's determination to improve support for families in a way that is not clawed back by tax or rent increases.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for the increase from £200 to £500 in the grant payable on the birth of twins.  It further provides for the introduction of a new grant of £500 payable in respect of twins on reaching ages four and 12.  This new grant will be effective from 1 January of this year for twins with birthdays on or after that date and is in recognition of the substantial extra costs which arise for parents of twins, both at birth and at the relevant ages.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an increase of £10 in the income limits which are applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement.  This will mean that from mid-June next most current recipients will get an increase of £6 a week.  The new weekly income thresholds will range from £195 for a one child family to £334 for a family with eight children or more.</P>
    <P>With a view to removing one of the greatest disincentives to taking up employment, section 7 provides for the continued payment of increases for <Col N="2341" /> dependent children for up to 13 weeks to people in receipt of such increases at the full rate who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks.  This will ease people's transition from social welfare to wage earning.  It is a concrete way in which we can help unemployed people back into work.</P>
    <P>The necessary legislative provisions required to give effect to the PRSI reforms announced in this year's budget are contained in sections 8 to 12.  These changes will come into effect on 6 April next.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a number of significant changes affecting employees and employers as follows: an increase of £30 in the PRSI free allowance for employees insured at Class A &mdash; under this change employees will not be liable for PRSI in respect of the first £80 of weekly earnings; an increase in the ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable by employees from £21,500 to £22,300 per annum; a reduction in the lower rate of employer's PRSI from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent; a reduction in the main rate of employer's PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent; an increase from £231 to £250 in the amount of weekly earnings below which the new reduced rate employer's contribution of 8.5 per cent will apply; and an increase of £1,000, from £25,800 per annum to £26,800 per annum in the ceiling up to which PRSI contribution are payable by employers.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the position of self-employed people.  First, it provides for the existing PRSI-free allowance to be increased from £10 to £20 per week, or £1,040 over a full year.  Second, it provides for a reduction in the minimum social insurance contribution payable by the self-employed from £230 to £215 per annum.  Third, it provides for an increase in the annual income ceiling, from £21,500 to £22,300, up to which PRSI contributions are payable by self-employed contributors.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for an increase from £520 to £1,040 per annum in the <Col N="2342" /> amount of reckonable income in respect of which optional contributions are not payable by share fishermen under the scheme of optional social insurance. Section 11 provides for a reduction from £230 to £215 in the annual rate of voluntary PRSI contribution payable by a person who ceases to be a self-employed contributor and subsequently becomes a voluntary contributor.</P>
    <P>The extension of class A insurance to community employment workers, currently insurable for the purposes of occupational injuries benefit only, is provided for in section 12.  The new rate will apply only to those who commence working on a community employment scheme on or after 6 April next.  The sponsors of community employment workers will be exempt from paying the increased employer contribution arising from this extension and will continue to be liable for their contribution of 0.5 per cent in respect of occupational injuries benefit.  I also intend to extend the class A insurance rate to people who take up employment on the present core schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also includes provision for regulatory powers to modify the social insurance status of employees of Telecomm Éireann.  This will enable the modified insurance of those employees to be maintained in the event of Telecom Éireann forming a strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the introduction of a new payment to be known as the disability allowance which will replace the disabled person's maintenance allowance which has up to now been administered by the health boards.  The relevant legislative provisions are included in section 13 to 16.  Section 13 sets out the eligibility criteria for receipt of disability allowance, outlines the basis on which means will be assessed and provides for the weekly rate of the allowance and for increases in respect of adult and child dependants.  Section 14 contains a number of transitional provisions required to effect the transfer of existing recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance to the new disability allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2343" /> Section 15 makes the necesssary amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, arising from the establishment of the new scheme.  It provides that all of the general provisions in the 1993 Act which relate to social assistance payments, such as claims and payments provisions, will automatically apply to the new disability allowance.  It also makes appropriate provision for the inclusion of disability allowance in the system of continuing payments for six weeks after the death of the recipient and provided for a number of other consequential technical amendments to legislation.  Section 16 is a standard measure which provides that the new allowance will be brought into force by way of a commencement order.</P>
    <P>I also referred earlier to the introduction of the new one-parent family payment which is provided for in sections 17 to 21.  Section 17 sets out the conditions of entitlement for the new payment. These are broadly similar to those which apply currently to the lone parent's allowance scheme.  It makes provision for improved earnings disregards for lone parents in employment or self-employment and for a change in the method of assessing the value of capital. It also provides for the transfer to the new scheme of persons who have applied for or are already in receipt of the lone parent's allowance and ensures that their entitlements will not be reduced by virtue of that transfer.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also provides regulatory powers to exempt a social welfare recipient from the obligation to transfer to the Department of Social Welfare or the health board any payments they receive from a liable relative.  These powers are being taken as a consequence of the new arrangements being introduced for lone parents whereby a proportion of maintenance payments can be retained towards their housing costs.</P>
    <P>The position of women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance or prisoner's wife's allowance is protected under section 18.  Similar <Col N="2344" /> protection is extended to women who have applied for any of those three schemes and whose applications have not been finalised prior to the introduction of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The present deserted wife's benefit scheme will be discontinued for new claimants once the new uniform payment for all lone parents is introduced. However, special transitional arrangements are being made for women who, by virtue of being under age 40, lose entitlement to deserted wife's benefit because they no longer have a child dependant and who would otherwise have requalified for benefit under the existing arrangements on reaching age 40.  Section 18 provides that the entitlements of women aged 38 to 40 on the introduction of the new arrangements, who would otherwise have requalified for deserted wife's benefit on reaching age 40, will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the appropriate amendments to the Social Welfare legislation consequent on the introduction of the new one-parent family payment while section 20 provides for the definition of a qualified parent for the purposes of the payment to include a parent who would otherwise be a qualified parent but for the fact that their marriage has been dissolved.  This is to ensure that no one loses out in the event of becoming divorced.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that the arrangements in respect of the introduction of the one-parent family payment will be brought into effect by way of a commencement order.</P>
    <P>I outlined earlier the purpose and effect of section 22 which provides for significant changes in the way earnings from employment are assessed for unemployment assistance purposes, leading to major improvements in the level of social welfare support provided to prople who take up occasional or part-time job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Section 22 also provides that unemployment assistance at the higher long-term rate will be payable to claimants who, immediately before claiming <Col N="2345" /> unemployment assistance, were in receipt of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 23 makes provision for two amendments to the rules governing the means test for unemployment assistance and the pre-retirement allowance.  First, it provides that allowances in respect of accommodation provided for a child, paid by a health board under the supported lodgings scheme, will be disregarded in the assessment of means. Second, it provides that a specified amount, which will be set initially at £2,000, received under the rural environment protection scheme will be disregarded in the assessment of means for the purposes of unemployment assistance. These changes are very logical ones designed to ensure that people are not penalised by one State scheme because they receive support from another.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 24 is to incorporate into primary legislation the provisions relating to homemakers, made under regulations in 1994, which enable contribution years spent working in the home on a full-time basis caring for a child or an incapacitated person to be disregarded when calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of the old age contributory pension.  This section also increases from six to 12 years the qualifying age for a child under this scheme &mdash; a very major improvement which will benefit thousands of women who work full-time in the home.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 24 will also remove an anomaly in the existing provisions whereby the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker cannot, in practice, be disregarded since the person involved is required to be a homemaker for the entire contribution year in order to benefit under this scheme.  The amendment provides for regulatory powers to award credited contributions in the contribution year in which a person first becomes, or ceases to be, a homemaker and to prescribe the time and manner of making application to be classed as a homemaker.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2346" /> The provisions of section 25 arise from the proposed discontinuance of the the deserted wife's benefit scheme, to the extent that it affects women without children, and the deserted wife's allowance scheme.  It provides for an extension of the pre-retirement allowance scheme to both separated men and women, aged 55 and over, who have not had an attachment to the labour force within a specified preceding period.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that a person who is entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory or reciprocal pension, an EU pension, or a pension under a reciprocal agreement, will be entitled to receive whichever is the higher.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for a technical amendment to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, arising from regulatory changes made in April 1995 providing for the extension of full social insurance to new entrants to the public service.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the survivor's pension to be renamed as widow's for widower's contributory pension.  This is a response to the many pensioners who, for a variety of reasons, disliked the term survivor and requested the right to be termed widow or widower.  This section also provides that a widow or widower who remarries will remain entitled to a pension at the rate which would otherwise have been payable had they not remarried.  At present, if a widow or widower remarries and where the second spouse dies, it is possible that the widow or widower may on reapplying for a pension, fail to satisfy the contribution conditions, or may qualify for a pension at a lower rate than that payable before remarriage.  The pension position of these people will now be protected under legislation and the change is designed to reduce what was seen as a disincentive to marriage by widowed persons.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, giving effect to the commitment that no spouse would lose out in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements on becoming divorced. A corresponding provision is made in <Col N="2347" /> Section 28 as a result of the renaming of the survivor's pension to the widow's or widower's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Section 29 simply provides that the provisions of sections 25 to 28 will be brought into force by way of commencement orders.</P>
    <P>Sections 30 to 32 provide for the new arrangements whereby claimants of supplementary welfare allowance who are dissatisfied with the outcome of an appeal to the health board against an adverse decision may make a further appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  Section 30 provides for regulatory powers to give effect to these arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the context of these new arrangements, section 31 provides for regulatory powers to specify the procedures to be followed on appeals decisions relating to claims both for social welfare payments generally and for supplementary welfare allowance.  Regulations to be made under these powers will provide that all such decisions and determinations will have to be given to claimants in writing and will have to set out the reason or reasons for an adverse decision.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the existing provisions relating to revised decisions by deciding officers, appeals officers and officers of the health board in the case of supplementary welfare allowance is contained in section 32.  This relates to cases where a new fact comes to light resulting in a revised decision being made which reduces a person's entitlement. The deciding officer will now have discretion to decide that the reduction in entitlement should only take effect from a current date where, for example, he or she concludes that the person concerned could not reasonably have been expected to know the relevance of the fact.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 33 is to provide an immediate avenue of appeal to the social welfare tribunal, without first having to appeal the deciding officer's decision to the chief appeals officers, to <Col N="2348" /> people who are disqualified from receiving unemployment payments by virtue of their participation in a trade dispute. This arises from a review of procedures in the Irish Press dispute last year which showed that the interim appeal stage in that case served no particular purpose other than to delay a final decision.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 to 36, inclusive, contain a number of miscellaneous provisions which are largely of a technical nature.</P>
    <P>Section 34, provides for an amendment to section 261 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, relating to the award of expenses to representatives of appellants at appeal hearings. The practice at present, by agreement with the Incorporated Law Society, is that expenses of £30 are awarded to solicitors and other professional witnesses in respect of attendance at an appeal hearing.  This practice has been the subject of a successful challenge in the High Court.  Accordingly, the current legislation is being amended by section 34 which provides that costs incurred by a person in relation to any matter referred to an appeals officer will not be awarded but that expenses will continue to be paid as at present.  This section is modelled on the legislative provisions applying to the employment appeals tribunal which similarly does not award costs.</P>
    <P>Section 35 sets out to resolve a specific problem facing people moving from short-term payments such as unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit to old age pension. Under the existing provisions, the short-term payments are only payable up to the date on which the person reaches age 66 whereas the payment of old age pensions does not commence until the next following Friday.  This means there can be a gap of up to six days payment between one and the other.  To ensure that there is no gap, section 35 provides regulatory powers under which the short-term payment may be continued until the pension commences.</P>
    <P>With a view to improving service delivery for claimants of short-term payments, my Department is currently <Col N="2349" /> implementing a new computer system known as the integrated short-term payment system.  This system will encompass the making of supplementary welfare allowance payments, a function which under existing legislation is vested in the health boards.  The regulatory powers required to enable supplementary welfare allowance payments to be made by my Department are provided for in section 36.  I should emphasise that entitlement to such payments will continue to be determined by the health boards as at present.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for a number of amendments to the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, in order to improve the provisions relating to the assessment of means for social assistance payments.  These include, for example, that a prescribed amount of earnings in respect of employment of a rehabilitative nature will be disregarded in the assessment of means for social assistance purposes; provision for the deduction of child minding earnings before the 50 per cent disregard of remaining earnings is applied in the case of lone parent and one parent families; and the disregard of allowances paid by a health board in respect of accommodation provided for children under the supported lodgings scheme in the assessment of means for social assistance payments other than unemployment assistance, which is being provided for separately in section 23 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Last year's Social Welfare Act provided for an extension of child depend-and allowances, where appropriate, up to age 22 where children were in full-time education.  This year, section 38 of the Bill provides for a further extension of that age to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This will benefit parents on social welfare who are seeking to support full-time students whose birthdays fall in the earlier part of the academic year.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislation, an increase of disablement pension, known as the constant attendance allowance, is <Col N="2350" /> payable where the degree of disablement is assessed at 100 per cent and the claimant is so incapacitated as to require someone to attend constantly to his or her personal needs.  Section 39 provides regulatory powers for the payment of the constant attendance allowance in cases where the degree of disablement is assessed at less than 100 per cent.  The amount of the increase payable in such circumstance will be less than the amount payable where the degree of disablement is assessed at 100 per cent and the rate may vary in relation to the degree of disablement.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that fees payable to the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of an audit of the accounts of the social insurance fund will be borne directly by the fund.  This amendment arises because the Comptroller and Auditor General is now legally entitled to charge an audit fee.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 41 of the Bill is to extend, from two to six years, the period within which legal proceedings may be brought against the estate of a deceased person for the recovery of overpayments of social assistance.</P>
    <P>Under the household budgeting scheme operated by my Department, certain social welfare recipients can opt to have deductions made from their payments and paid over to specified bodies such as the ESB and local authorities. Section 42 extends the scope of the scheme to include bodies not currently covered, in response to requests from existing participants.</P>
    <P>Section 43 is a technical amendment designed to update a reference in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, to section 9 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which has been replaced by section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 44 provides for an amendment to the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986, under which the period within the board or the agency is required to submit each three year strategic plan may be extended, by not <Col N="2351" /> more than six months, by the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 and 46 provide for an increase from £178 to £188 in the amount of weekly earnings below which employees are exempt from liability for the health contributions and the employment and training levy.  The corresponding annual income exemption level for self-employed people is being increased from £9,250 to £9,730.  These changes are being made at the request of the Departments of Health and Enterprise and Employment and will take effect from 6 April 1996.</P>
    <P>I emphasised at the outset the innovative nature of this year's Social Welfare Bill.  It is substantial legislation which will protect and improve the living standards of people who, for one reason or another, are outside the labour force, provide a clear pro work and worker focus in relation to incentives, simplify many aspects of a very complex social welfare system and continue the pro family policy direction I put in place last year.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and I look forward to a constructive and useful debate on its many provisions.  I thank the Deputies for allowing me the additional time to finish my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a reasonably comprehensive social welfare system which is designed to help the weakest and most disadvantaged in society.  As we approach the end of this century the time is right to make fundamental changes in the structure of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years we have put substantial resources into social welfare.  Currently one-third of Government expenditure, in excess of £4,000 million, is spent on social welfare.  Almost everybody is at some stage a recipient of social welfare payments and at present about 1.5 million people benefit. Approximately 1.33 million workers are employed under social welfare schemes and almost 0.5 million families receive <Col N="2352" /> child benefit for over one million children.</P>
    <P>In planning the social welfare system for the 21st century we have to look at the socio-economic challenges facing us. The structure, attitudes and mores of our society have changed dramatically. Recent disclosures have highlighted attitudes particularly of the 1940s and 1950s.  In modernising our society we have, I hope, modernised it in a mature way.</P>
    <P>We must look at the benefits of the European Union in particular and the transfers of funds over the last couple of decades to see how best we can restructure the social welfare system to ensure that those most in need are supported. From the economic point of view we have failed as a society to convert good and sometimes dramatic economic improvement into a better lifestyle for the less well off.  We have an opportunity now to make an impact by shifting expenditure from areas where an exorbitant amount is being spent towards the people who need it most. We need major policy changes to ensure that we have a fair and equitable system going into the next century.</P>
    <P>As well as the economic changes which, thankfully, have been for the better over the last decade or two, other profound changes are taking place in society.  There have been reports in recent times on our ageing population. It has been estimated that the population over the age of 65 will increase dramatically over the next 25 years.  This will lead to significant additional expenditure on old age pensions and services.</P>
    <P>Another change, especially in the last decade, relates to the role and status of women in Irish society which has changed profoundly in the last couple of decades.  It is not very long &mdash; only a generation ago &mdash; since women had to give up their jobs when they married.  It would be unthinkable today to do some of the things that were considered normal 25 years ago.  Married women are participating to a much greater extent in the paid labour force today, and the social welfare system needs to adapt and <Col N="2353" /> recognise this.  In a broader sense, the change in the status of women means that the social welfare system must recognise women's independence and move from the concept of dependency which currently forms a major part of the system.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there are positive changes in the Bill but that more must be done.  Women in the home are still regarded as dependants and that is not funny for someone who works hard rearing a large family.  A spouse will not be given half of the old age pension but an adult dependant's allowance.  They are still their husband's dependants. That is inequitable and should be altered as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system must meet the challenges that arise, the Social Welfare Bill should set out clear strategic objectives to develop the system and not simply be a form of administrative changes.  The three key priorities for 1996 should have been tackling unemployment, supporting the elderly and achieving equality.  Current excessive levels of unemployment mean every Department has a political and moral responsibility to do everything in its power to create employment. The cancer of long-term unemployment cannot be allowed to continue.  Despite the efforts of everyone concerned there is an increasing number of long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the Department of Social Welfare does not have an up-to-date record of the long-term unemployed. In reply to a parliamentary question I was told it would get the information from the Central Statistics Office but its figures are for last autumn. The Department does not know the educational status of the long-term unemployed.  Such basic information should be available to it if is to tackle this problem.  We know that the greater the level of education the better the chance of securing employment.</P>
    <P>Average life expectancy continues to increase and this is mainly as a result of improved health care facilities and enhanced nutrition.  Great credit is due <Col N="2354" /> to voluntary organisations who ensure people have a nutritious meal every day. Sometimes institutions and homes for the elderly are maligned but great improvements have been made.  For example, nutritionists and physiotherapists work in homes for the elderly and that is welcome.  Such facilities contribute to the quality of life for the elderly. It is satisfying that we have made that kind of progress since the 1950s.  There are greater pressures on the State to look after the elderly.  It is easy to be critical of voluntary bodies and the Church but there were many State institutions, which were not well run.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the extended family looked after its elderly out of love and affection.  However, smaller sized families have contributed to the demise of the extended family and extra pressure is put on the State to look after the elderly population.  The pattern of change which characterises Irish society has not been uniformly kind to the elderly.  Not too long ago, age bestowed almost total protection on the individual from personal assault and insulting behaviour. Now the elderly are subject to depraved behaviour and vicious assaults.  I do not understand why they beat people senseless and leave them dying or dead for less sake of a few pounds.  It is barbaric and inhuman behaviour.  There are too many examples of vicious attacks on the elderly and we are more shamed by them than by the events of 40 years ago. We should do more to provide a secure environment for the elderly and that must be a key objective of Government policy.  That we owe the elderly a great deal is a truism and we should show great respect for them.  However, we have a lot to be thankful for in our modern society.</P>
    <P>As regards the new alcoholic drinks, the packaging has been modernised and the logo changed.  Instead of calling it lemonade it now now called a &ldquo;lemon drink&rdquo;.  Some time ago one would be lucky to be given a bottle of lemonade if one were holding a donkey outside a pub on a fair day having walked seven or eight miles to the fair.  Our parents <Col N="2355" /> did not have milking parlours or modern machinery.  Indeed, some parlours are better than the old hovels in which some of the elderly live.  Our animals are often better cared for than the elderly. We have only to look at the coats of the horses at Cheltenham to know they are well fed and cared for.  We cannot say the same for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The most recent annual report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul pointed out that many of the elderly have one overcoat and one pair of shoes.  If they get wet they may not be able to spare the fuel to light a fire and dry them. There is a long way to go and there is much more to be done to show the respect which the elderly deserve from this generation.</P>
    <P>Ensuring equality for women, people with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups must also be a key policy objective.  The importance of equality was emphasised in last week's report of the National Economic and Social Forum which set out a range of sensible measures to ensure equality for women, people with disabilities, travellers and others.  With regard to one of those sections of society, the travellers, we have seen them pilloried, maligned in a fairly vicious way and singled out for all sorts of insults.  We must treat all sectors of society equally.</P>
    <P>How does this Bill measure up to these objectives?  It contains some provisions but I will introduce amendments to section 2 on Committee Stage.  There is little enough strategic coherence in the Bill, which is evident from an examination of the three areas which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>How does the Bill measure up to the objective of tackling unemployment?  I compliment the Minister for cutting PRSI payments because I believe this will be welcomed by employers who want to take on additional workers.  I also welcome the Minister's proposal to change the way people who are on unemployment assistance will be means tested if they take up part-time work. However, that is basically it.  Is this the <Col N="2356" /> radical overhaul of the existing social welfare system which is needed to facilitate getting people back to work? Obviously not.  We have failed to tackle this problem.  More people are out of work and more are long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government's overall response to the unemployment crisis is a farce. There are now three bodies involved &mdash; the Department of Social Welfare.  FÁS and the local employment service which is supposed to provide information, advice and assistance directly to people who are looking for work.  This is in addition to a whole plethora of other bodies involved in this area.  How is any employer or person looking for work supposed to find their way around this maze of quangos?  Instead of adopting a coherent plan to tackle unemployment, all we get is a reliance on the old structures which had their uses and their day but which are obviously in need of modification because of the changes in society and the workplace.</P>
    <P>What does this Bill do in response to the recommendations of the most recent report of the task force on unemployment? We had some political shenanigans on the release of that report when the Tánaiste said that this was the definitive response, only to have the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, telephone Mr. Joe Mulholland of RTÉ to point out that this was not the case. That is not the way to tackle a problem coherently.  The task force recommended that a range of Department of Social Welfare operated schemes, including the back to work allowance and the part-time job incentive scheme, should be examined in the context of other income support measures for those on low pay, such as the family income supplement, PRSI exemptions and other measures to address the interface of tax and social welfare.  The task force stated that there is considerable complexity in the range of income support measures currently in place for those in low-paid employment.  It considered that the role and objective of individual measures need to be clarified <Col N="2357" /> and streamlined to ensure they complement one another.</P>
    <P>What does the Bill do in response to this recommendation?  Nothing.  In the £10,000 to £15,000 income bracket workers with three or four dependants are worse off as a result of an increase in income, so if an employer decides to give an employee an increase of £1,000, £2,000 or £3,000, the employee would tell him that he cannot afford to take it. It would cost the employer more in PRSI commitments but the employee would have less take home pay.  This is as a result of the interaction of the medical card system, differential rent subsidy, etc.  This must be tackled urgently.</P>
    <P>A range of simple measures for the elderly should have been introduced in the Bill.  In the budget, the Government introduced the totally inadequate proposal for tax relief on security measures for those aged 65 and over who live alone and pay tax.  There are about 50,000 such people but the vast majority of them pay very little tax.  Introducing a tax break for vulnerable elderly people who live alone was an insult.</P>
    <P>The response from a wide range of bodies indicated the need for a much wider level of support for elderly people.  The Minister, of course, responded by setting up a task force to examine the issue but the solution is clear.  There should be a social welfare payment to assist elderly people in securing their homes.  Alarm systems, which are available relatively cheaply, would be a tremendous security for elderly people who live alone but they need some assistance to purchase those systems.  In industry or agriculture when one wants to buy a bulldozer, a tractor or a piece of equipment one is generously supported but an old person living alone is offered a tax break which is of no use whatsoever.  We do not need to study that problem at length as it is clear what must be done.  At a time when interest rates are at their lowest level in living memory, the social welfare system uses rates of up to 10 per cent.  This is an old hobbyhorse of mine which I have <Col N="2358" /> brought up several times.  Can you imagine levelling 10 per cent on an unfortunate elderly person who has a few pounds set aside for their funeral expenses?  A decent burial is traditional. What does the Department of Social Welfare do?  It says it will charge the person 10 per cent on it.  In contrast, what happens to a person's few bob in the credit union or bank?  He or she would be lucky to get 1 per cent on it when DIRT and the various bank charges which apply every time a person steps inside the door are taken into account.  For example, if a person wants to change a cheque, make a lodgment or withdraw money, he or she is charged by this country's great banks, one of which recently revealed profits of over £1 million per day in its annual report. Surely those banks have some responsibility and should make some effort to give elderly people a break.  It was those people who helped build up today's Ireland and the banks should pull their weight.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare does not take account of the interest which is earned on this few pounds but uses a national system.  Not satisfied with this, the Minister has introduced rates of up to 15 per cent for some claimants.  Does he not realise that this move is totally counterproductive because he is simply making people afraid to put their money in the local bank or credit union?  Why should they save money with those institutions when they are penalised for doing so?  Why should they save it with the bank when they must pay a surcharge on it?  People can drop into their banks in any town or village to find out the interest earned on their savings for the previous month or year.  I do not know why that cannot be done when it is being done by health boards for other means testing arrangements. It could and should be done by the Department of Social Welfare.  Now is the time to ensure that the interest involved is put against the rate levied on the few pounds people set aside for a decent burial rather than using a penal <Col N="2359" /> system.  This issue is not just my hobbyhorse, on today's Order Paper, Deputy Nealon's Question 226 asks the Minister the plans, if any, he has to re-evaluate interest rates... as it is hard, if not impossible for people, certainly with small savings, to receive anything like interest of 10 per cent currently and if he will do something about it.  I ask the Minister to consider those elderly people and to address this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the treatment of the self-employed.  From April 1988 the PRSI system was extended to the self-employed, but many of them aged 56 and over do not qualify for the old age contributory pension despite the fact that they are required to pay PRSI up to age 66.  On reaching pension age, having paid their annual contributions, they are told they do not have enough payments but that they will be given back the greater portion of what they paid in. That is of no use to them.  They should be given at lease some concession for their payments.  This qualification criterion is inflexible and penalises many thousands of the self-employed.  Surely the Minister could have introduced flexibility to this scheme to enable such people buy additional contributions to enable them to qualify fully for the State pension or, alternatively continue to pay contributions beyond the age of 66 to meet the existing qualification requirements.  Another option, supported by a number of reports, is the provision of a <i>pro rata</i> payment on the amount of contributions paid on reaching retirement age.  I demand that this issue, which must be dealt with sooner or later, should be addressed now.  In reply to my Parliamentary Question 103 on 7 March asking how much is paid into the social welfare fund by the self-employed, I was told it had increased from £21,792,000 in 1988 to £90 million per annum.  The self-employed who contribute that money are entitled to a contributory payment.  I will keep up the pressure to ensure that inequity is taken out of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2360" /> The Bill performs just as badly in dealing with the position of women.  The Commission on the Status of Women 1992 recommends that the term &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;dependant&rdquo;.  It also recommends that social welfare payments should be divided between the recipient and the qualified partner.  Qualified partners should be issued with their own allowance book and the Government should work towards establishing that.</P>
    <P>There was an announcement on 19 February 1995 that the Minister would unveil his plans for a new lone parent's allowance, the main aspect of it being that it would not be subject to means testing, but this Bill provides that it is subject to a means test.  Will the Minister explain why he has introduced a means test for that allowance?</P>
    <P>Those with a disability in residential institutions receive a derisory allowance. Will the Minister introduce a measure to give those unfortunate people an appropriate disabled person's maintenance allowance.?  How does their position fit into the Government's commitment to equality?  This matter has been heavily criticised by the Ombudsman and it is time this archaic measure was changed to ensure those people are given a decent allowance as they do not have the price of a plug of tobacco.  I will introduce amendments section by section on Committee Stage when I will have more time to deal with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister was faced with two main options when designing and developing provisions in this Bill.  His first was to attempt to fine tune the existing social welfare schemes and provisions.  Alternatively, he could have chosen to embark on a systematic and substantial assessment of the overall system.  There were at least three compelling reasons for him to select the latter option.  The first is transformation of the State's finances, second, the rate of rapid change which has impacted on practically all aspects of Irish life and, third, I expected him to adopt a fresh, courageous and even a visionary approach <Col N="2361" /> given his comprehensive contributions in relation to social welfare dealing with the needs and rights of the financially underprivileged to which I listened for many years when he was on the Opposition benches.  Day in day out people, particularly Ministers in various Governments, were blamed.  I thought that when this Minister got into Government substantial changes would be made, but we have had two budgets and the track record is not great.  There is no point in blaming everyone else.  The Minister had an opportunity to do something about the most vulnerable in society, his record is not great.  Less was provided in general increases in the past two years then ever before.  When the net value of the Minister's proposals is assessed, there will be no doubt about the strategic option he has chosen.  For the second year in succession he has come down on the side of minimal change and tinkering rather than a comprehensive review and invigorating reform.</P>

      <P>This is substantial legislation and one that will have far reaching consequences.  There are 11 parts and 46 sections to the Bill.  It provides for increases in the rates of social insurance and social assistance payments. It improves the family income supplement, increases child benefit and transfers responsibility for the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  It also provides for claimants who are dissatisfied with the outcome of the decision made by a health board on a claim for supplementary welfare allowance to appeal it to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  It provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Social Welfare Act in respect of social insurance contributions payable to employers, employees and the self-employed. There are many other adjustments and amendments to the Health Contributions Act and the Youth Employment Agency Act.  By any standard it is far reaching and substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2362" /> It is puzzling that we do not devote more time in this House to debating that bundle of far reaching issues.  In overall terms we get one major opportunity in the political year to discuss these matters in the Social Welfare Bill. We have another more restricted opportunity to discuss them at the time of the Estimates, but in overall terms I and my party believe we do not devote sufficient time and thought to these matters and to working in unison to bring about fundamental and far reaching improvements on these issues.</P>
    <P>This year the Government will spend in excess of £4,000 million on social welfare, an enormous sum.  While we ought to devote more time to discussing how that money is spent to ensure its recipients get the best possible deal and taxpayers the best possible return, we tend annually to engage in a narrowly focused debate ever more difficult to understand given the challenges posed by the nature and scale of poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>A previous Government proposed initiatives on strategic management in the public sector, the intention being to put in place a system that would ensure public resources are used effectively and efficiently, providing a service tailored to consumers' needs, well designed to serve the general public.  When that suggestion was first mooted, part of the overall intention was that each Government Department would produce an action-oriented statement of strategy setting out clear objectives, pointing to the manner in which these could best be achieved and how resources could best be allocated to meet them, ultimately ensuring not alone the efficient delivery of services, guaranteeing that those availing of them would get the best, affordable deal but that taxpayers would get value for their money.</P>
    <P>Somehow we do not seem to have managed to proceed along those general lines.  Rather each year after budget day we tend to effect a number of marginal <Col N="2363" /><i>ad hoc</i> modifications of systems or provisions already in place without engaging in any radical overhaul or investigation of how the system is operating or could be improved while continuing to be confronted by overwhelming demands on the Social Welfare Vote.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years this country has experienced phenomenal growth rates.  Our economic performance is one of the best in Europe and all the financial indicators point to this being a healthy, wealthy country.  That being the case, there is a huge onus on this Government &mdash; not specifically on the Minister &mdash; to endeavour to amalgamate our taxation and social welfare systems and to ultimately ascertain whether we can deliver our citizens a better deal.  Since the ever increasing numbers of unemployed people constitute a huge demand on our social welfare system, it goes without saying that, if we could manage to reduce their numbers, we would have more funds at our disposal to target those in greatest need, who are not in a position to work or fend for themselves.  Here I have in mind the very old and very young in our society.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity we are not making a more sustained, systematic effort to restructure our taxation system, which would enable us to at least provide work for the additional numbers of unemployed people.  When I talk to people in the Small and Medium Firms Association and ask them why they are not in a position to recruit additional workers, inevitably they answer that it is because of their present greatest competitor, our social welfare system.  That is very worrying and must be tackled by key Cabinet Ministers.  The Minister for Finance must give the lead in attempting to tackle that issue since that objective can be achieved only by a radical restructuring of our taxation system.  Simply put, if we continue to tax work as if it is a luxury, can we wonder why the numbers of unemployed people continue to increase?  That issue must be addressed by this Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2364" /> Despite the Minister for Social Welfare having a substantial budget of £4,000 million, the level of increases he is in a position to allocate is relatively small.  I cannot foresee us having a decent social welfare system that will alleviate the grinding poverty within many communities, particularly those already hard hit by long-term unemployment. I have direct, day to day contact with the unemployed in my constituency where we are beginning to witness third generation unemployed people.  We will not be in a position to give those families the help we would wish until we can create jobs and sufficient numbers of people are paying into the Exchequer and fewer drawing on it.  That fundamental principle must be stressed each time we have an opportunity to speak on such matters.  While I note an attempt being made in this Bill to reduce PRSI, a small step in the right direction, it is unlikely to have any sizeable effect.  While commending it I sincerely wish it was more.</P>
    <P>I regret that the position of women remains bleak in terms of equality of access to employment.  Women available for and seeking work are not allowed to sign on at present, a major inequality issue.  I do not know how that inequality could be addressed by an amendment on Committee Stage, but we must devise some system which would enable women who want to work to sign on, thus giving them an entitlement not theirs at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides increases of 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively announced on budget day but they will not result in any significant improvement in the overall standard of living. Before these increases are paid a whole range of increases in day to day living costs will have come on stream.  I refer to the cost of electricity, of basic commodities such as bread and a number of other basic commodities required by any household.</P>
    <P>The increases have been cancelled out before they are paid.  Despite the fact that we are allocating a great deal <Col N="2365" /> of money people are not even marginally better off at the end of the day. It is generally accepted by all commentators that the number of people living in poverty has increased dramatically. Because of the way the system is structrued some people are trapped indefinitely in dependent lifestyles.  That is a very sad indictment on a country that boasts and is proud of its strong economic growth.  It is a failure of public policy that we are not able to translate the strong level of growth into job creation. I call on the Minister for Social Welfare to produce a strategic plan with quantified targets, priorities and specific commitments for the phased improvement and further development of the social welfare system and in conjunction with his Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance, to find the ways and means to generate and create employment and remove the taxation obstacles to employment so that fewer will be dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides the regulatory basis whereby a person who is disatisfied with the determination of an appeal to the health board on his claim for supplementary welfare allowance may appeal the decision further to an independent social welfare appeals office. What was the reason for this change? Have the Minister and his Department no confidence in the appeals system that applies to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme?  If the Minister has confidence in the scheme why has he set about putting in place a different set of procedures?  In my view the Minister has no confidence in the supplementary welfare allowance appeals system and what he proposes is an attempt to take over the appeals system and place it firmly with the Chief Appeals Officer.  I have no great difficulty with that but how will it be achieved and what benefits will accrue from it?  Will the Minister address this question when responding to the debate?</P>
    <P>The economic indicators support the economic commentators forecast of strong growth in the next six years.  Will <Col N="2366" /> this growth transform our economy during the next decade enabling us to meet the convergence criteria laid down under the Maastricht Treaty while at the same time achieving a much greater convergence with the European Union average living standard than has occurred in the past 30 years?  Should that happen, will we have a two-tier nation?  What will happen to the one-third of the population who stand to be left behind?  That is a bleak prospect but in conscience we have to confront it and decide what to do about it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about section 17 which introduces a new one-parent family payment in place of the lone parent's allowance and the deserted wife's benefit. This new payment will be paid to a qualified parent who may be a widow, widower, a separated spouse, an unmarried parent or the spouse of a person detained in legal custody for at least six months and who has at least one qualified child dependant.  In my view this measure is an attack on the deserted wife's benefit scheme which will substantially reduce the number of people eligible for deserted wife's benefit and will also reduce the amount of money, if any, payable to them.  It is an attack also on the insurance based social welfare benefit to which people contribute for protection in cases of desertion.  The proposed measure has been dressed up and presented to this House in the form of a new scheme.  Careful reading of the legislation will show that the Minister is merely using a sprat to catch a mackerel. While providing a more generous means test for one-parent families, such as lone parents, he will make substantial savings on the deserted wife's benefit scheme.  There are approximately 14,000 deserted wives in receipt of deserted wife's benefits at a cost of approximately £70,000 to the Department. These benefits are paid to deserted wives because their insurance or the insurance of the deserting husband gives them that entitlement.  There is no limit to the amount of money they can earn subsequent to or at the time of receiving this benefit.  The Minister now proposes <Col N="2367" /> to reduce that substantially by placing a special ceiling of £12,000 on income.  In addition he proposes to put in place special transitional arrangements under which a reduced rate of payment will be made for a prescribed period.  However, neither the duration of the period, nor the reduced rate or the period of transition is mentioned, but is to be left to regulation.  Will the Minister explain exactly his Department's view of the new arrangements?  Will he spell out exactly his Department's estimates on the impact this will have on the deserted wife's benefit scheme?  Will he advise the House on the number who will lose deserted wife's benefit or whose benefit will be substantially reduced because of the proposed new measures?</P>

      <P>Sections 13 to 15 provide for the transfer of responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare by way of the introduction of a new social assistance payment scheme to be known as disability allowance.  I welcome this.  An increasing number of people, unable to work because of ill health, do not have the necessary social insurance contributions to be awarded disability benefit or invalidity pension.  I am concerned about the assessment of means for disability allowance which will be broadly the same as in the case of unemployment assistance, but the benefit and privilege provisions under which young people living in the family home are assessed with parental income will not be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the change in regard <Col N="2368" /> to assessment with parental income &mdash; it was a matter I raised last year &mdash; I am concerned that in the case of disability allowance we are creating an anomaly whereby if an applicant is young, single and able bodied, and living at home, benefit and privilege will be taken into account but will not be taken into account if one is sick.</P>
    <P>My fear is that we will run the risk of creating a culture of sickness among young people where sickness could be cultivated in order to obtain the maximum disability allowance instead of reduced unemployment assistance.  This potential culture of sickness is to be avoided.  Will the Minister re-think this particular element of the means test strategy?</P>
    <P>This significantly increased level of economic growth and prosperity means the Minister will have a high level of resources available to him.  He will have an opportunity to tackle more decisively and effectively our major economic and social problems, particularly unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  My party strongly recommends that these resources should be distributed more equitably than they were in the past to ensure a better balance in the achievement of economic and social objectives.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the improvements in this Bill, I am concerned about other aspects of it.  I will await the Minister's response to the issues I have raised.  My party will then decide whether to table amendments on Committee Stage.  This Bill does not set out the Minister's social objectives over the next number of years.  There is no mechanism in our parliamentary structure to debate many social issues which need to be addressed in the coming decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Deputy Quill said she regrets the lack of opportuinties to discuss social issues.  However, the Select Committee on Social Affairs provides a forum at which to do this.  A delegation from that committee went to Sweden recently to study a proposal to change its law.  We had an opportunity <Col N="2369" /> to meet officials from its Department of Social Welfare, child care agencies and Department of Justice.  It was refreshing to study a social welfare system which has different problems to deal with and which comes from a different cultural mindset, although our delegation was mainly interested in its laws in relation to the punishment of children.</P>
      <P>A lot of work is being done in this area.  I received a report recently on housing which left as many questions unanswered as it answered.  We also receive reports on means testing.  There is ongoing analysis of poverty which I hope will lead to a major review.  A study on the integration of taxation and social welfare is also of major importance. I could not find recent statistical information for the Department of Social Welfare; the last figures I have are for 1993.  Is that information published in the same way as it was in the past?</P>
      <P>The Bill establishes an appeals system for health boards.  The independent appeals system set up by a former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, was a successful structure.  I welcome its extension to other areas.  I would like a similar appeals system for other parts of the health service, such as medical cards.  I also welcome the introduction of a disability allowance.  For years people lived on long-term supplementary welfare.  There was a gap in the social welfare system for those who did not qualify for disability benefit or invalidity pension when they were sick because they did not have enough contributions. This is a major improvement because some people were living on a low level of income.  It is also directly related to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the improvement in the carer's allowance, it still needs to be reformed.  When this was first introduced by a former Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputy Woods, more than 70,000 carers assumed that their work would be acknowledged at last. However, it was so rigidly means tested that only a small minority qualified. That is still the case despite the <Col N="2370" /> improvements in this Bill.  This week I came across a case which would have been included under the famous prescribed relative's allowance scheme which was abolished in favour of the supposedly more generous carer's allowance.  The prescribed relative's allowance scheme was not means tested; a person who gave up full-time work qualified for it.  The case involved a woman who gave up a job with an income of between £15,000 and £20,000 a year to look after her mother-in-law. She was told that because her husband had reasonable means she would not qualify for any assistance.  This is hard to understand because she is not only looking after an elderly person in need of care but she is also freeing up a full-time job.  I ask the Minister to consider extending this allowance to people who give up full-time employment to care for an elderly person in recognition of the major sacrifice they make.</P>
    <P>Support of carers, which clearly has a health element, should not be the sole responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Department of Health should commence with some form of payment however modest, perhaps similar to child benefit, to those providing care and as resources permit, it should be expanded and developed.  As previous speakers said, a feature of society was that we looked after our old people. There is still a strong will to do this and support would make it easier.  This matter should be taken up not as an income maintenance issue but as a health and social policy issue requiring some form of subsidy.  It is a debate to which we will return because of the age profile of the population.  It is a growing problem which will be of direct concern to the Minister in a number of years and to many of us in the House some decades hence.  It will remain on the agenda.</P>
    <P>Sweden, which has small unemployment numbers, has an extraordinary attitude to work.  Female participation in the workforce is virtually universal apart from during the first year of child rearing.  State provided childcare arises from the extraordinary work ethic <Col N="2371" /> which comes largely from their Protestantism which obliges them to work to earn a living.  That is seen as the greatest role, whereas here we are still struggling with the idea that the mother should be in the home and that it is her primary duty to be there.  Sweden has a totally different environment and social services. Some people will have listened to Vincent Browne's debates with women and men about feminism and its future and the great debate started here by the Taoiseach's wife who expressed a viewpoint that was already known.  It is fascinating that Sweden deals with it so differently because of its child care provisions.</P>
    <P>Sweden had decentralised the provision of social welfare, health and other services.  Decentralisation of the services of the Department of Social Welfare is a debate about which we heard a little in the House but it seems to have been taken off the agenda.  When replying to the debate will the Minister give an indication of his thinking on decentralisation? In Sweden everything from health care to providing medicine is handled by a social welfare committee at municipal level.  In the context of social welfare, centres were developed in various areas and it was expected that services would devolve locally.  I would like to know what progress has been made in that area and future plans.</P>
    <P>We were fascinated to note that one of the responsibilities of the Swedish Department of Social Welfare was based on an analysis of children and their needs.  That is an important issue in this society where it affects lone parenting, which is such a major issue in terms of poverty, exclusion and the whole of society.  One of the duties of the local social welfare committee is to deal with custody and access of children. Swedish thinking on children is based on the child's need and rights &mdash; that is stated in our laws too &mdash; but it has led Swedish people to some very unusual areas.  They live in a society where only 50 per cent of the people marry.  Many people live outside marriage and many <Col N="2372" /> are separated.  They have been dealing with these issues for generations longer than we have.  They have come to the conclusion that it is critical for a child to have reasonable access to both parents and this is extended into the social welfare system.  We sent a copy of the report on our recent visit to Sweden to the Department but if the Minister has not had time to analysie it he might ask somebody to examine it.</P>
    <P>One of the obligations of the social welfare committees of the Department of Social Welfare in Sweden is to investigate and establish the paternity of children where the parents are not married. We have begun to make provision here to pursue a father to support his child. This type of proposal raises hackles here because it is seen as punitive.  It is based on the principle that every child is entitled to a father and a mother.  We facilitate fathers to ignore that responsibility by the way in which we handle the issuing of allowances.  Issuing allowances in Sweden is conditional on the identification of both parents, not on whether that parent is in a position to support the child, and on the attitude that the child is entitled to two parents.</P>
    <P>In responding to the needs of lone parenthood, have we done another injustice to children by facilitating one element of the partnership to forget his responsibility?  This is a matter which could be debated in consultation with lone parent groups.  There are no teenage pregnancies in Sweden.  They do not have a large number of young mothers bringing up children alone, as we have, Because there is so much employment in Sweden, they have alternatives.  It is important that we begin to examine this issue.</P>
    <P>What we have done for lone parents by improving the means test to enable them to return to the workforce has been tremendous.  It has made a big difference in that a large number of women have taken up community employment schemes and other types of employment as a result of improvements in recent years.  That has been valuable in terms of bringing people <Col N="2373" /> back into the workforce and creating new models for children.  We were fascinated by this approach in Sweden and we thought it should be considered here.</P>
    <P>In April 1995 there was a major conference on the European Union programme to foster the social and economic integration of the least privileged groups.  One of its priorities was that any policy responses should be developed in consultation with the recipient group.  I suggest some of these issues be taken up with lone parent groups and those most directly involved with them, with a view to facilitating a fundamental change in thinking.</P>
    <P>It is funny in a society based on Catholic traditional beliefs, supposedly child centred, that we allow at least half of the people responsible for bringing children into the world to condone the neglect of them.  In doing so, we may have created a climate where that becomes more commonplace.  These matters gave members of the committee reason to reflect on whether our response to problems, albeit with the best intentions, lead to poverty traps etc. which we will spend the rest of our lives trying to disentangle.</P>
    <P>The welcome change in means testing for lone parents has highlighted some anomalies.  For example, a married woman obviously cannot qualify for a lone parent allowance.  In terms of being available to look after her children, her husband will not take on that responsibility. She is in a community employment scheme and works with lone parents who take home much more money than her because of taxation and the impact of means testing.  Her needs are as great but her resources to meet them are less because means testing is not based on need but is confined to this category.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvement in exemptions for PRSI contributions for the lower paid which will have a major impact on employment.  The extension from £50 to £80 has led to increases in payments for those on low pay and has facilitated the creation of employment. <Col N="2374" /> That is the way forward in the context of a tax and social welfare system that is seen to be anti-work.  I welcome also the extension of the household budgeting scheme which has worked extremely well for families who find it difficult to manage.</P>
    <P>I support the views of many of my colleagues that the issue of dependency must be tackled in a serious way.  Last year the Minister promised he would introduce a basic income for children this year and move towards a radical integration of child benefit and child dependant allowance.  What has hapened in that regard?  I welcome the £2 increase in child benefit while noting that child dependant allowances have been frozen.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which makes a number of improvements in the social welfare system by way of the new one parent family allowance, the creation of disability assistance and, in particular, the new appeal scheme.</P>

      <P>The function of Social Welfare Bills is twofold; to implement the changes announced in the budget and to alter social welfare law to iron out some anomalies in the system.  Since budget day, and even before, we have been aware of the budgetary aspect of the Social Welfare Bill but it is to the other aspect I want to draw attention.  I have been a Member of this House for 14 years and have seen many Social Welfare Bills introduced but I cannot see any difference between this Bill and its predecessors.  I have never seen a Minister for Social Welfare, of any political persuasion, introduce a Social Welfare Bill designed to create more anomalies or injustices in the system. The general idea is to redress anomalies that have become evident with minimal cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received an unsolicited document from the Minister this morning which referred to this Bill as containing &ldquo;some of the most significant changes ever in the social welfare system&rdquo;.  That claim is misleading to the point of being fraudulent. The reality is that there is much <Col N="2375" /> less to this Bill than meets the eye despite the smug, overblown assertions that it contains significant changes.</P>
    <P>Any objective observer would agree this Bill is hardly revolutionary and, if I may borrow a quote, it will not shake the State to its foundations.  It effects some slight improvements in the social welfare code which are welcome.  I welcome also the provision in regard to disability allowance.  While it will not make any difference in practice to the people already in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, it introduces more coherence to the system.  I welcome also the appeals procedure for SWA which appeared first in the guise of a Private Members' Bill put forward by my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, and which shamed the Government and the Minister into introducing that much needed and glaringly obvious reform in the system.  Serious problems will arise with the new lone parents' provisions as outlined by my colleague, Deputy Quill, but we can deal with that in much greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's opening statement this afternoon but all the high tech jargon about contribution class rates, reciprocal arrangements, <i>pro rata</i> systems, etc. cannot conceal the obvious fact that the everyday reality of life for a large and growing proportion of our population is one of grinding poverty, deprivation and exclusion.  The record of this Government to date has resulted in the poor becoming poorer, and that will continue.  When the poor become poorer the rich generally get richer but that does not happen here because of our grindingly progressive taxation system. The poor become poorer, however, and the Government does not have to take my word for that.</P>
    <P>I refer to the 1996 post budget submittion of the CORI justice group which has no particular axe to grand and which metes out the same treatment, regardless of which party is in Government. That group's report states: &ldquo;Since coming to power this Government has presided over a widening in the poverty <Col N="2376" /> gap of £1,500 in the take-home income of a long-term unemployed couple compared to a couple earning a £40,000 salary&rdquo;. It continues:</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, in 1986, the Government's Commission on Social Welfare published their report.  It concluded that a single person needed £68.50 a week and a couple £110 to provide &ldquo;<i>a minimally adequate standard of living&rdquo; (in 1996 terms)</i>.  Ten years later most social welfare rates are below this level while many low paid employees live in households with income equivalents below this very low poverty line.  In the past ten years the national cake has grown to more than 50%.  However, large numbers of people continue to live in poverty and the gap between them and the rest of society continues to widen dramatically.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, enthusiastically supported the recommendations of the commission referred to in that report.  He enthusiastically supported any proposal that minimal income levels for people dependent on social welfare should be increased to at least these figures. I recall contributions the Minister made when in Opposition to the effect that this was not good enough for him and if he ever got the opportunity he would make major improvements.  He has now had that opportunity, he has laid out his stall for the two years he will be in Government, at least until the next general election, but the improvements have been conspicuous by their absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the high tech jargon and the legal niceties cannot obscure the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare described 3 per cent increases and, for some benefits, a greater level of increase, in harsher economic times as &ldquo;miserable&rdquo;. That is not my epithet; it was so described by the then Deputy De Rossa <Col N="2377" /> from the relevant comfort of the Opposition benches.  When he was given an opportunity to put his hand on the tiller and see what he could do, in the first year he gave 2.5 per cent and in the second 3 per cent.</P>

This issue has been dodged both by him and successive Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the people concerned are living in dire poverty, for example, small farmers and business people whom I meet every day in my constituency.  The law states that if they have paid one stamp less than the ten year requirement, they will not receive a contributory pension whereas if they have paid one stamp more, they will receive a pension at the full rate.  Does <Col N="2379" /> this constitute justice, equity and fairness? Is that what the Minister would describe as socialism.</P>
      <P>I have asked various Ministers, including Fianna Fail Ministers, about this matter during the years and received platitudes in reply.  I was promised that it would be reviewed, considered, examined and referred to the National Pensions Board which was supposed to come up with some magical <i>pro rata</i> pension system or, at least, with something more equitable.</P>
      <P>When I raised the matter by way of parliamentary question on 5 March the Minister stated in reply: &ldquo;The whole question of <i>pro rata</i> pensions falls to be considered in the context of the recommendations contained in the final report of the National Pensions Board, Developing the National Pension System, taking account of the overall future financing of pensions.&rdquo;  In plain language, that means the board is still reviewing it.  This matter has been ongoing for eight years and the board has had ample opportunity to review it. It is time to make the hard decision.</P>
      <P>What will the people who have paid one stamp less than the ten year requirement get in return?  They will receive a refund of 53 per cent, minus the interest except in respect of contributions due after 1 November 1990.  The Government will hang on to the remaining 47 per cent in the maw of the Exchequer.  Most of the people who have made contributions will not gain a red cent.  This constitutes extortion and extra taxation without any benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What plans does the Minister have to ease the tremendous burden which will be placed on the social welfare system of demographic changes?  In Opposition he portrayed himself as a man of vision <Col N="2380" /> who would shake the system to its foundations if ever given an opportunity to do so.  This is one problem he will have to confront squarely while in office.</P>
    <P>Recent figures suggest that the percentage of the total population accounted for by those aged over 65 will rise to 12.5 per cent by 2011 and 17 per cent by 2025.  This will place a tremendous burden on the Exchequer.  At Question Time, on a slightly different subject, my colleague, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, secured from the Minister for Finance the information that the public sector pension bill will rise from £563 million, at 1996 levels, to £1.22 billion by 2020.</P>
    <P>In its 1993 report on meeting the challenge of an ageing population the National Pensions Board recommended that priority should be given to encouraging all employees and the self-employed to take out adequate pension cover.  It stated:</P>
    <P>The projected increase in expenditure required to maintain the existing level of flat rate pensions under the social welfare system in the decades ahead in the light of demographic changes and the already limited scope for increasing revenue from PRSI in the light of the serious unemployment situation has to be tackled.  In view of this it will continue to be necessary to promote second tier pension coverage through occupational schemes and personal pension arrangements.</P>
    <P>What is being done to promote this coverage?</P>
    <P>For tax purposes, a self-employed person is only allowed to contribute 15 per cent of gross wages to a pension scheme.  The reality is that many self-employed persons will not be in a position to contribute until they are well established in their professional occupation or business in their mid-thirties, by which time the rate of percentage they will have to pay to justify an adequate pension which would give them a reasonable standard of living at <Col N="2381" /> retirement age will be far in excess of 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>This anomaly is compounded by the fact that if a company wants to provide pension cover for one of its directors who is paid through the PAYE system the 15 per cent rate does not apply; it can contribute far in excess of this figure. If we are serious about promoting the idea of private pension schemes to remove some of the burden from the State, as recommended by the National Pensions Board which this House set up to advise it, why do we allow this anomaly to remain?</P>
    <P>Lip service has been paid to the concept of encouraging people to take out pension cover.  There has been much loose comment, but one obvious factor has been overlooked, the advent of the so-called flexible economy.  The concept of a job for life, the nostalgic notion to which Europeans are holding on, has disappeared in all but name.  They have faced reality in the United States where it is openly admitted and acknowledged that the flexible economy is the order of the day.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the proportion of people in full-time or permanent salaried jobs continues to fall.  If the flexible economy is the norm, the circumstances which gave rise to the growth of private pensions will no longer exist and more and more people will be forced to depend on the State.  As the burden on the State increases, the amount in real terms it will be able to provide by way of State pensions will gradually reduce. If, in the first quarter of the next century, the elderly are forced to rely on the State for a pension that amounts to 8 per cent or 9 per cent of the average industrial wage, there will be &ldquo;grey&rdquo; riots on the streets.  There will not be a sudden apocalypse, it will evolve gradually. Pensions will be reduced by stealth because of the burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Is there advance planning by the Minister to deal with this matter?  I am extremely disappointed with the record of the Minister for Social Welfare.  How can he call what he is providing for <Col N="2382" /> social welfare recipients, the poorest and most disadvantaged in our society, socialism?  He made a lifetime career from claiming to be a socialist.  He must believe in the Norman Mailer concept of socialism which is that its function is to raise suffering to a higher level.</P>

It provides meagre, mealy-mouthed and minimalist changes and contains nothing to indicate that a self-proclaimed socialist has at last taken control of the commanding heights of the economy.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Department of Social Welfare is probably the most difficult Department to administer, it is a minefield.  Since being elected to the House 21 years ago I have spent most of my time in public life helping people with social welfare problems. Many people find it difficult to know their entitlements.  For that reason, I welcome this first attempt to simplify the social welfare system to enable people to understand their entitlements.  Up to now the Department's attitude has been that if people were able to determine their entitlements, they would get something.  The multiplications, subtractions, divisions and the various qualification terms are a minefield for people in receipt of social welfare payments as well as for those trying to assist them.  I admire the Minister for his excellent work and the constructive role he plays in Government.  I also compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, on the forthright manner in which he is willing to help Members respond to representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2383" /> I agree with some of Deputy O'Dea's comments.  The social welfare system has been generous.  Households in receipt of full social welfare entitlements do not experience poverty and payments have kept pace with inflation. I am often surprised at the comfort in which people who depend on social welfare live.  Their homes are usually kept in good repair and their children are well cared for, an indication they are in receipt of sufficient income.  However, in households in which the income is wasted on alcohol, gambling or drug abuse, the neglect of children is usually apparent, but this can also apply to families in receipt of large incomes outside the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>However, some people experience great difficulty getting their full entitlements. I agree With Deputy O'Dea about the efforts of social welfare officers &mdash; perhaps it is their agenda &mdash; to cut back on people's entitlements. Public representatives often have to make numerous representations on their behalf.  We are frequently told these matters can be appealed, but eventualy the people concerned get the payments to which they were entitled in the first place.  I hope the new regulations eliminate that nonsense which is a waste of time for officials and public representatives.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker's remarks about people who fall short of the number of contributions necessary to qualify for contributory old age pension. The contributions taken from them &mdash; they are not voluntary &mdash; are not recognised for pension purposes unless the full number is reached.  If such people were advised of the matter they could make voluntary contributions to enable them to qualify for pension.  This matter is brought to my notice on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me is that of hidden wealth.  For example, in determining the entitlement of a person with a small business to an old age pension the income derived from the business will be estimated by an officer even <Col N="2384" /> though the records may show that the business does not provide such an income.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, comes from a farming background he should address the nonsense of placing a certain value on a 30 or 40 acre farm as part of a person's income.  People working those small holdings live in poverty and anxiously await the income of an old age pension. Their pride prevents them from letting their neighbours know the extent of their poverty.  This practice should be terminated.  Land is only as good as what it produces and owners of such small holdings should not be penalised in this manner.  It is nonsensical to place a value on such land and deduct that from their pensions.  They are deprived of full pensions through no fault of their own and this matter must be rectified.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill, and of the Committee Stage amendments I propose to table, is threefold. First, the Bill provides for the registration in Ireland of adoptions of children made in the People's Republic of China and will ensure that they are made valid under Irish law.  Second, it will enable the Minister for Health, by way of regulation, to designate other countries from which adoptions will be regarded as valid under Irish law and provides that these adoptions will also be entered in the register.  Third, it makes provision for a voluntary contact register to enable a birth mother and an adopted child to make contact with each other if they so wish.  I have received many representations on the two latter issues and <Col N="2385" /> I will table Committee Stage amendments to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Today's world is little more than a global village, communication is instant and the pace of development in new technology, information, mobility and travel is now so fast that it challenges our ability to cope.  As we have seen on many recent occasions, a tragedy on one continent is instantly transmitted to all others.  People are no longer prepared to wait for Ministers or bureaucrats &mdash; I use this word in the best sense &mdash; who delay and prevaricate to take action. They are correct in wanting action to be taken urgently.  It is time we learned to cherish all the children of the world equally, to treat them without prejudice or discrimination and to make whatever provision we can for their needs.</P>
      <P>For far too long the cloak of public policy has been used to prevent the recognition of foreign adoptions.  In this way we have been guilty of visiting the perceived sins of their elders on innocent children.  As a country which endured famine and foreign domination and which has 72 million sons and daughters scattered throughout the world, we should not hesitate in giving recognition to the needs of orphans or abandoned children abroad.  We should be among the first nations to come to the aid of these children and offer assistance, support and a welcome home to them.  Our people have been among the first to come forward and our duty as Members of this House is to ensure that our laws keep pace with their generous spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling revelation of the plight of millions of children, mostly girls, abandoned in orphanages and other institutions in the People's Republic of China has touched the deepest emotions of the public.  In the context of recent humanitarian disasters, it cannot be denied that the treatment of these children is a humanitarian disaster on a grand scale.  Every year 1.7 million children are abandoned in China and some of these suffer prolonged and agonising deaths in the so-called dying rooms.  As <Col N="2386" /> a country with a tradition of active concern for the suffering of all humanity throughout the world, we must respond to this disaster in any way we can within our power and make a contribution in relieving the appalling suffering of these children.  It would be easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer size of the problem and do nothing on the basis that the little we can do will not make an appreciable impact on the overall problem. However, Fianna Fáil is determined to look at any practical measures which will help even a small number of children.  Humanitarian aid and technical support are needed if there is to be a long-term solution to the problem.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is making representations in this regard, as are voluntary groups and orgnisations. In the meantime we can facilitate the generous response of many Irish couples who could adopt some of these children, and the Bill will do this.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, does not permit adoptions effected in the People's Republic of China to come within the definition of foreign adoptions as contained in section 1 or to be registered in the register of foreign adoptions set up under section 6.  As Chinese adoptions are not recognised here, the Chinese authorities will not allow Irish couples to adopt children in their country.  This restriction in our adoption law prevents Irish couples from adopting Chinese orphans.  The Bill proposes to amend the Adoption Act, 1991, to enable Irish couples who are regarded as suitable and eligible under normal Irish adoption criteria to effect adoptions of Chinese children which will be recognised under our law. Many couples have been assessed and are anxious to proceed with the adoptions as quickly as possible and offer loving homes to children living in appalling conditions.  I am confident that the public will regard the Bill as an appropriate response which will enable Irish couples to help some of these children. I hope the Government will support the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2387" /> One could be forgiven for asking how those empowered to act on our behalf can heistate or delay in any way in arranging for the registration of Chinese babies.  Some couples have been certified as eligible adopters in Ireland while babies have been identified and approved for adoption in China. However, the authorities here will not register these children because of potential differences between the laws and customs in the two jurisdictions.  For example, Chinese law provides that in certain circumstances an adoptive relationship could be terminated by agreement while such a possibility constitutes a peceived impediment to registration here.  This can be overcome by amending our law to provide that adoptions which take place in the People's Republic of China can be registered in the register of foreign adoptions.  We have provided for this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that it will be possible for the Adoption Board to prevent the validation and registration of foreign adoptions if they are considered to be contrary to public policy.  This safeguard is not intended for use in any normal circumstances and should not be regarded as a means of avoiding or delaying positive decisions.  In order to ensure that it will not be abused, the Bill provides for the making of an application to the High Court to direct that the adoption be registered in the register of foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that because in China there are restrictions placed on the number of children per family and that such controls can lead to a climate of secrecy, the adoptions could be regarded as being contrary to public policy here.  Given the millions of abandoned babies in China, the very small number who may come to Ireland and the openness of our laws and provisions, this is not a valid reason to prevent registration.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was published I have been approached by people who have adopted children in other countries and who wish to have them entered on the <Col N="2388" /> Irish register of foreign adoptions.  At present the Minister does not have the enabling power to act on our behalf and designate those countries from which adoptions will be validated and registered. We trust the Minister in this regard.  Accordingly, rather than have to introduce new primary legislation in respect of each country, we plan to provide in section 2 that the Minister may, by regulations, designate any such other country or countries.  These regulations will provide for the validation and registration here of any such adoptions.  This would enable the Minister to meet the needs of children who have been adopted here and their adopted parents.</P>
    <P>The stance adopted by the Chinese arises from the fact that Chinese adoptions are not recognised here because they are considered to be incompatible under the Adoption Act, 1991.  Other states in a similar situation have allowed Irish families to adopt children through their courts.  As a result, a growing number of adopted children living here do not have their status recognised in this State.  I think Members would agree it is totally unacceptable that any of the children who find new homes in Ireland should be regarded as second class citizens here and in the EU.  We want to give the Minister the power to regularise their position and give them a genuine welcome.</P>
    <P>Since 1993 Lebanon and, in some circumstances, France, Germany, Belgium Luxembourg, Paraguay, Poland and some other countries have not been recognised.  People would probably be surprised at this.  We want to make it possible for the Minister to recognise these countries by regulation.</P>
    <P>The dramatic events of the last week have shown clearly the urgent need for a voluntary contact register as a means of bringing birth mothers and adopted children together.  Irish children sent for adoption in the United States or other countries, as well as those adopted in Ireland, want to know their birth mother or both natural parents where this is possible.  It is time to heal the pain these children and their parents have <Col N="2389" /> suffered.  This is a sensitive matter and potentially a legal minefield for the Government.  The Government has already said it will be some time before it is in a position to make any decisions. In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 March Andy Pollak stated: &ldquo;A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said it was still undecided who should have responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's response to the revelations about Irish children sent abroad for adoption&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>According to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8 March, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, announced the previous night that he had &ldquo;discovered there are up to 1,500 detailed adoption files which are the property of the Department but are held in the National Archives&rdquo;.  It was also stated that another 500 files were unearthed in the Department last Thursday.  This was major news of crucial interest to many adopted children who are now adults and are searching for their birth mothers and their roots. It also transpires that the Department was informed last Christmas Eve by an archivist with the National Archives that a file on 20 Irish children had been found in documents received from the Department.  It contained the names of the adopting parents in the US and the birth mothers in Ireland.  It appears that no action was taken by the Government from Christmas Eve until a further file was discovered.  It had come from Iveagh House and contained data on 1,500 Irish children sent to the US for adoption.  We were told last Friday that there are another 300 files in the Department with details of adopted children sent to the US.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to act with considerable urgency in this matter. It should immediately assign responsibility for the details and files on these children to one Department.  This is not a time for saying we are not sure who is looking after the matter &mdash; this is what was said last week.  I understand that this could have been said in the early stages because it may have been <Col N="2390" /> the reality but now is the time to take action and assign responsibility to one Department.</P>
    <P>The Government should collate the information and form a comprehensive data base in a matter of weeks.  It should establish immediately the voluntary contact register we are proposing.  It is the only hope many adopted children have, whether they came from Golden-bridge, the US, or elsewhere.  Where a mother gave false information on handing over a baby because of some fear &mdash; we know the many kinds of fear which existed in the 1940s, the 1950s and the early 1960s &mdash; she could submit the correct details now before it is too late.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is providing the Government with the opportunity to put this matter right.  We are dealing with sensitive matters which deserve an all-party approach.  A register provides a safe and confidential way for birth parents to assure an adopted person that contact would be welcome.  It is essential that the rights of adopted children and birth parents, and the pain they have suffered, are now formally acknowledged by setting up a register.  The Adoption Board has called for the establishment of a contact register and adoption agencies have lobbied for one.  It should be provided immediately.</P>
    <P>The amendments I propose have been circulated in draft form in the revised Bill.  I have taken the trouble to revise the Bill to include the amendments for the convenience of the Minister. I will now have these amendments passed to him.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked me a question.  I am only replying.  The amendment I propose can be discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  In a new section 3 we will propose setting up a voluntary contact register under the control of the Adoption Board broadly as follows:</P>
      <P>3.  (1) The Board shall maintain a register to be known as the &ldquo;Voluntary Contact Register&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(2) The said register shall contain two parts and shall be in such form as the Minister shall by regulations made hereunder prescribe.</P>
      <P>(3) One of the said parts to be known as Part I shall contain only such details as may be prescribed by regulations made hereunder by the Minister, of the identity of birth mothers and their children in respect of whom adoption orders have been made by the Board or where adoptions were made under the laws of such countries as the Minister may by regulations designate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2392" /> (4) The other part of the said register to be known as Part 2 of the Voluntary Contact Register shall contain such details as may be prescribed by regulations made hereunder by the Minister, of the identity of adopters of children and of the children adopted under adoption orders made by the Board or where adoptions were made under the laws of such countries as the Minister may by regulations designate.</P>
    <P>(5) [i] In the case of birth mothers, no details as provided for herein shall be entered in the said register, for the purpose of Part I of the register, unless the birth mother provides such details as may be prescribed by regulations and consents in writing to the entry in the register of the said details.</P>
    <P>This, will be particularly important because consent will be essential in providing such a register.</P>
    <P>[ii] In the case of adopters or adopted children, no details as provided for herein, shall be entered in the said register, for the purpose of Part 2 of the register, unless the adopted child provides such details as may be prescribed by regulations and consents in writing to the entry in the register of the said details.</P>
    <P>(6) The Board shall not accept any details of identity as may be prescribed by regulations hereunder for entry in Part 2 of the Voluntary Contact Register, from an adopted person, until that person has reached the age of 18 years, save that where an adopted person is under the age of 18 the Board shall accept such details of identity for the purpose of Part 2 of the Voluntary Contact Register as may be perscribed by regulations, from the adopter or adopters of that person.</P>
    <P>(7) The Board shall not permit any of the details of identity contained in either part of the Contact Register to be disclosed to any person, unless and <Col N="2393" /> until the birth mother and her adopted child inform the Board in writing, separately, that each wishes to make contact with the other.</P>
    <P>This subsection will also be important.  It is especially important that both birth mothers and adopted children know that that will be the situation.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where the Board is informed in writing separately by a birth mother and her adopted child that each wishes to make contact with the other, the Board shall, forthwith, furnish to the birth mother the details of identity in Part 2 of the Contact Register and to the adopted child the details in Part I of the Contact Register.</P>
    <P>(9)  The Board shall not furnish details pursuant to subsection (8) of this section to an adopted person until that person has reached 18 years.</P>
    <P>(10)  Where a birth mother requests in writing to the Board that any details of her identity entered in Part 1 of the Contact Register be deleted from the said register the Board shall forthwith delete the said details from the said register.</P>
    <P>(11)  Where an adopted child requests in writing to the Board that any details of identity entered in Part 2 of the Voluntary Contact Register, be deleted from the said register, the Board shall forthwith delete the said details from the said register.</P>
    <P>(12)  Where a birth mother in respect of whom details have been entered in Part 1 of the Voluntary Contact Register dies, and thereafter her adopted child whose identity details are entered in Part 2 of the register informs the Board in writing that the said adopted child wishes to make contact with the said birth mother, the Board shall forthwith furnish to the said adopted child the details of identity of the said birth mother in Part 1 of the Voluntary Contact Register.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2394" /> (13) (i)  Where a birth mother of an adopted child has died, the Board shall accept such details of identity of the said birth mother as may be prescribed by regulations, from the next of kin of the said birth mother and provided that the said next of kin consents thereto in writing, the Board shall enter the said details of identity in Part 1 of the Voluntary Contact Register.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Where details of the identity of an adopted child have been entered in Part 2 of the Voluntary Contact Register pursuant to this section, and where details of the identity of the birth mother of the said adopted child are entered in Part 1 of the Voluntary Contact Register pursuant to subsection (13) (i) hereof, the Board shall forthwith furnish the details of the identity of the said birth mother in Part 1 of the register to the said adopted child.  Where the Board are informed in writing by the said adopted child that the said adopted child wishes to make contact with the said birth mother, the Board shall forthwith furnish the details of the identity of the said adopted child to the next of kin of the said birth mother where the Board are informed in writing by the said next of kin that the said next of kin wish to make contact with the said adopted child.</P>
    <P>I have set this out in detail because there is great concern about the issue of a contact register.  I want it to be clear that the register we are proposing is a confidential voluntary register.  This is something we should have already.  It should not be difficult to conclude the voluntary contact register aspect of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the adoption of babies from the People's Republic of China.  It is two months since the nation willed that something be done for them and Irish couples are waiting to hear from Dáil Éireann.  They do not understand the delays, and they want their politicians to <Col N="2395" /> act on their behalf.  The measures we have proposed are simple and direct. They provide for the validation and registration by the Adoption Board of Chinese babies.  If the Government wants to propose amendments on Committee Stage we will be very glad to cooperate in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are also making provision by way of amendment on Committee Stage for the designation by the Minister of other countries from which adoption would be valid under Irish law.  There are also couples with children here in Ireland who are waiting for this important recognition.  Why should we keep them waiting any longer?  They and their children deserve better from us.  Surely this House does not want to keep them waiting any longer.  We have in this Bill the vehicle to put the necessary legislation through quickly.</P>
    <P>The voluntary contact register which we propose would provide an immediate response to an appalling situation, much of it our own making.  It would be of immediate benefit to thousands of adopted children and their birth mothers at home and abroad.  As Maggie Butler said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 8 March: &ldquo;My goal is to find her, my heart's desire is to meet her&rdquo;.  There is no more time for questioning and delay, we must act urgently.  I am sure all Deputies agree with the principle of the Bill.  We call on the Government to support it and discuss amendments in open forum on Committee Stage.  We offer our fullest co-operation in finalising this legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government will consider these matters in conjunction with the Keegan case later in the year.  There is no need to associate these measures with that issue. They are naturally associated with the Adoption Act, 1991.  Consequently, they can be tackled and provided for now as a matter of urgency.  This is feasible and will be widely welcomed in the community.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the good that was done we abhor and denounce the <Col N="2396" /> evils of the past where they occurred.  In its place we present a bright vision of a future filled with caring and compassion and a commitment to cherish all our children equally.  But how will we handle the realities of the present?  We have an opportunity to do something practical now.  Let us do it.  We urge the Government to support the Bill and to make any desirable amendments on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and contratulate Deputy Woods on bringing it forward.  Its publication is timely and it will greatly reassure those presently in the process of adopting children from the Chinese jurisdiction.  It should make the process a great deal easier for prospective parents.</P>
      <P>At any stage the process of adoption is emotional, a time when prospective parents do not need extra pressures and when life should be made as uncomplicated as possible for them.  It is essential that they be reassured that the action they are about to take and the lifelong commitment they are about to make will have the full approval of the law and that their adopted child will have all the protections of the Constitution at present enjoyed by children born in this State or adopted from countries which have been approved by law.</P>
      <P>It is with these ideals in mind that Deputy Woods initiated this measure and I ask the Minister to note the compassionate nature of the legislation and facilitate its passage into law.</P>
      <P>The Irish are a most compassionate, decent and charitable people in the broadest meaning of those terms.  Traditionally, there has never been a shortage of people to care for children who, for one reason or another, have been deprived of the safety, security and love which is the lot of the vast majority of Irish children.  Even in the hardest of times, when food and other material benefits were scarce, people took children who needed a home into their care and gave them the best they had to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2397" /> Much is being made of the conditions which prevailed in some of our orphanages in the 1940s and 1950s.  If the allegations are sustained no defence can be put forward.  Cruelty and degrading treatment to the extent alleged was, and is, wrong and nothing can excuse it. However, I counsel against tarnishing the reputation of the many fine institutions and those who maintained them by attributing to them all the kind of behaviour which has recently been alleged.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion that such behaviour was the norm in every institution which provided care for children or that such behaviour was indulged in by all those in charge.  Members of religious orders who gave lifelong, dedicated service to the boys and girls in their care and who have, since the present horrific stories have broken, been congratulated and complimented on the performance of their duties by the children for whom they substituted as parents, are greatly distressed by both the revelations and their being associated with those wrongs.  They were perpetrated by a tiny minority and we must have regard to the feelings of, not to mention natural justice towards, those countless others who served with distinction, kindness and consideration and not tar them all with the same brush.  It is not our right or place to rush to judgment on them.  It is easy, at a remove of 40 years, to consider what was normal then to be exceptionally harsh now, and we must distinguish between what was acceptable in those less well off and less well informed days and what could not be accepted in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>When, through one legal impediment or another, adoption was not possible the people extended a helping hand and a welcoming home by means of fostering. They often lost out when the children to whom they had grown attached and given freely of their love and care returned either to their parents or to the institution.  I wish to record the State's appreciation of those selfless people who were so charitable.  In <Col N="2398" /> recent years the number of children available for adoption has reduced.  In may respects that is good as it reflects a change in attitudes and a greater tolerance than might have been present heretofore.  It also reflects a greater willingness on the part of young mothers and their families to face up to their responsibilities in regard to the children they brought into the world.  However, the same cannot be said for the male population.  Many fathers who have chosen not to, or who are not in a position to, marry the mothers of their children still think that the responsibility for child rearing rests solely with the mother.  There is need for legislative change in this area with a view to requiring fathers to accept their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The financial and other assistance which the State affords single parents is a basic right and must be maintained. The cost to the Exchequer is significant but if we are to fulfil our responsibilities under the Constitution it is the least we can do.  Much as people would like to see some form of social sanction on the growing trend of having children out of wedlock, the ultimate losers would be the children and, to coin a phrase, that would be inconceivable.</P>
    <P>The number of children in Ireland available for adoption to couples who are unrelated to the child has fallen dramatically in the past 30 years from 1,200 per year to less than a third of that.  This has resulted in Irish couples looking elsewhere for children in need of a good home.  That was most noticeable after the fall of the various Communist regimes across Europe.  When Irish people saw the plight of the children in Romanian orphanages they responded immediately.  The experience of trying to adopt a Romanian baby was not always an easy or happy one in the initial stages but ultimately many couples succeeded in bringing home a child whom they hoped would be recognised as theirs and as a citizen of the State.  Some did not know what the <Col N="2399" /> official welcome would be but, thankfully, the Government of the day regularised this new approach to adoption in the Adoption Act, 1991.  It did so by adopting the Private Members' Bill put forward by Deputy Shatter.  That Fianna Fáil led Government was magnanimous enough to appreciate the legislation was necessary and I hope this Government will recognise the need that exists now.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that with the new mobility across frontiers, ease of travel and improved economic circumstances, the principle of foreign adoption is here to stay.  It is ludicrous to place any barrier in the way of adopting couples who wish only to enrich their lives through the benefits of parenthood not otherwise available to them.</P>
    <P>I am sure this Bill will have the support of all Deputies who do not wish to see a repeat of the situation prior to passing the 1991 Act.  The Bill extends all the provisions of that Act to adoptions and adopted children from China and seeks only to legitimise those procedures in the same way as the Oireachtas did in the Romanian situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's amendments also empower the Minister to designate other countries, which is an eminently sensible step.  It is crucial also in light of what has happened recently that a voluntary contact register be put in place and that it is, obviously, voluntary on both sides.</P>
    <P>I will support this measure and I ask the Government to do likewise.</P>

However, I am in some difficulty because the Bill <Col N="2400" /> originally presented is so different from this one which is, effectively, a new Bill. It must be unprecedented that such major changes have been made by the proposers between the First and Second Reading.  It would seem to indicate in the strongest possible way that the initial Bill was not carefully thought out or worked out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The Government shares Deputy Woods's concern about the large number of children who have been abandoned in the People's Republic of China and who are currently being maintained in orphanages there.  It is sympathetic to the plight of these unfortunate children and is aware of the desire of Irish people to adopt some of them to provide them with an opportunity of growing up in a family environment.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the criticisms that have been expressed recently about the conditions in some of the Chinese orphanages in which the children are being maintained.  However, in the light of recent revelations about the regimes in the past in some of our residential institutions, we need to examine our own consciences about the manner in which we, as a society, allowed innocent children to be locked away and then effectively forgot about them.  We must learn from our mistakes of the past and, in the case of the abandoned Chinese children, seek to work in close co-operation with the relevant Chinese authorities on a number of fronts in promoting the welfare of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appear to be many abandoned Chinese children available for inter-country adoption.  A number of countries have already entered into bilateral adoption agreements with the People's Republic of China to facilitate the adoption of children from there by persons resident in those countries.  The Government, for its part, is prepared to explore <Col N="2401" /> with the Chinese authorities the possibility of agreeing procedures for the adoption of Chinese children by Irish residents.  We should, however, be concerned to ensure that any such agreement would contain appropriate safeguards to avoid the type of situation that is now emerging in the case of our own children who were sent abroad for adoption in the past.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to improving co-operation at international level to safeguard the welfare of children, in particular, in the area of inter-country adoption.  To this end, it recently authorised the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for the signing, subject to ratification, of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption of 29 May 1993. This important convention was prepared under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, of which Ireland is a member.  The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or sale of, or trafficking in, children and to establish a system of co-operation among countries to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned. The convention takes account of the principles of a number of international instruments designed to protect the fundamental rights of children, in particular, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified.</P>
    <P>Before the Hague Convention can be ratified here, it will be necessary to give the convention the force of law in the State.  This will involve making major changes to our domestic adoption legislation. While it is likely to be some time before the necessary legislation is brought forward, the Government has authorised the signing of the convention to demonstrate our support for the instrument and its objectives, and to signal our intention to ratifying it eventually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2402" /> Both Ireland and the People's Republic of China participated in the preparation of the Hague Convention. However, until that convention has been ratified by both countries, it appears that procedures for the adoption of Chinese children by Irish residents would have to be set out in a bilateral agreement.</P>
    <P>We understand that a precondition set by the Chinese authorities for signing a bilateral adoption agreement with another country is that adoptions effected under such an agreement must be recognised in the other country concerned. This is a perfectly reasonable approach on the part of the Chinese authorities who are concerned to ensure their children will enjoy the same rights and privileges as children adopted under the internal law of the country where they will be brought to live.  It is clearly desirable, in the interests of the children, that there should be no doubt about their legal status in the country where they are to be brought up.  The non-recognition of a Chinese adoption or, indeed, of any foreign adoption would affect the adoptive parents' entitlement to exercise parental rights with respect to the child, an issue which I am sure all Deputies will agree is fundamental.</P>
    <P>It is the question of whether an adoption effected in the People's Republic of China qualifies for recognition under Irish law that has given rise to difficulties. Until this issue is resolved, it will not be possible to negotiate an adoption agreement with the Chinese authorities for the adoption of Chinese children by Irish residents.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Chinese adoption law provides for the termination of adoptions effected under that law in certain circumstances.  I understand that the adoption board has taken the view that those provisions render Chinese adoptions ineligible for recognition under the Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Act provides a secure legal framework for the recognition under Irish law of adoptions effected abroad. This enlightened, progressive legislation <Col N="2403" /> was also introduced as a Private Members' Bill by my party colleague, Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>His initiative was motivated out of concern for those parents who had adopted children in Romania and in other countries and who, at the time, were encountering various difficulties with their adoptions in the absence of a statutory framework for the recognition of foreign adoptions here.  Deputies from all sides of the House who were involved in the special committee appointed to examine that Bill can be justifiably proud of the manner in which they helped to develop Deputy Shatter's original proposals.  A remarkable feature of the Bill was the fact that it was processed through both Houses without a single division.  This illustrated the level of good will on the part of all parties to the legislation and its objectives.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Act has been of enormous benefit in regularising the legal position of children adopted in foreign countries by Irish residents and other persons.  I understand that since the enactment of the legislation some 590 foreign adoptions have to date been entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions maintained by the adoption board under the Act, including 464 Romanian adoptions.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, recognition under the 1991 Act is confined to adoptions effected in countries which operate systems of legal adoption similar to our own system.  Section 1 of the legislation contains a definition of what constitutes a foreign adoption, and only adoptions effected abroad which comply with the terms of that definition are entitled to be recognised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the conditions of the current definition of a foreign adoption that have to be satisfied is condition (b) which requires that the adoption must have essentially the same legal effect as respects the termination and creation of legal rights in the country where it was <Col N="2404" /> effected as an Irish adoption order.  On the making of an adoption order under the Adoption Acts, the natural parent loses all parental rights and is freed from all parental rights with respect to the child.  These rights and duties are transferred on a permanent basis to the adopters and the adopted child is thereafter regarded in law as the child of the adopters as if born to them within marriage.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board considers that this condition precludes the recognition of adoptions effected in countries whose laws permit the termination or revocation of adoptions.  The People's Republic of China is not the only country whose laws contain such provisions. The adoption laws of a number of other countries, such as Peru, Guatemala and Thailand, also provide for the termination of adoptions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods put forward the idea that the Minister for Health has power under regulations to designate countries where adoption would be recognised. That was provided for but rejected in a Bill which is now the Adoption Act, 1991.  Under the 1991 Act each adoption is looked at individually to establish whether it complies with the definition of a foreign adoption.  The Adoption Board examines the adoption laws for foreign countries to see whether they are compatible with the definition of a foreign adoption.  This approach serves the same purpose as a system of designating countries.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the first major difficulty the Government has with Deputy Woods's Bill.  It proposes to extend the current statutory system for the recognition of adoptions effected outside the State to include adoptions effected in the People's Republic of China only.  He recognised his mistake in his Bill mark two.  He must have recognised that this disregarded the fact that the adoption laws of other countries contain similar provisions relating to the termination of adoptions.  The Government accepts the desirability of modifying the current definition of a foreign adoption in <Col N="2405" /> order to secure the recognition of adoptions effected under such laws. However, it considers that such a modification must, in the interests of equity, apply to adoptions effected in all relevant countries rather than be confined to those effected in the People's Republic of China.  The acceptance of Deputy Woods's proposal would exclude this possibility.  I am sure that this is not what he intended.</P>

      <P>It would not exclude it. The matter could be dealt with more fully on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill discussed by this House before the Deputy had a fundamental change of view is the one I am discussing now.</P>
      <P>If the law is to be changed to provide for the recognition of adoptions effected in countries whose laws permit adoptions to be terminated, it would seem appropriate also to provide for the withdrawal of recognition in any case where a foreign adoption which has been recognised is subsequently terminated under and in accordance with the law of the place where it was effected. However, no provision has been made in the Bill for such an eventuality.  I presume Deputy Woods recognises this is a serious omission.</P>
      <P>A further fundamental problem that the Government has with the Bill is that it proposes to restrict recognition to Chinese adoptions effected in favour of Irish residents only.  It is important to bear in mind that the Adoption Act, 1991 contains statutory mechanisms for the recognition of foreign adoptions effected in favour of four principal categories of adopters who on the date of the adoption were ordinarily resident in the State, or ordinarily resident for at least 12 months in a foreign country, or domiciled in a foreign country, or habitually resident in a foreign country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of Deputy Woods's proposal would only benefit persons who are ordinarily resident here.  I can see no justification for the exclusion from the Bill of Chinese adoptions <Col N="2406" /> effected in favour of persons who are ordinarily resident, domiciled or habitualy resident in a foreign country.  This would mean, for example, that an Irish couple living in London for some years who adopted a child in the People's Republic of China would not be entitled to have the adoption recognised here, even though the adoption would qualify for recognition under English law.</P>
    <P>However, the most anomalous situation that would emerge from the acceptance of the proposal to restrict recognition to Chinese adoptions effected in favour of Irish residents would be that adoptions effected in the People's Republic of China in favour of Chinese citizens would not be recognised here. Such an approach would be unsustainable.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind the House that while the Adoption Act, 1991 was primarily framed with the Romanian situation in mind, its provisions apply to adoptions effected in countries throughout the world.  Any change in the law must reflect the scope of the provisions of the 1991 Act and encompass all of the categories of adopters specified in the legislation.  This has not been done in the Bill we are debating now.</P>
    <P>I do, however, welcome the fact that the Bill proposes that only Chinese adoptions granted to Irish residents who have successfully completed the pre-adoption assessment procedure set out in section 5 of the 1991 Act would be entitled to recognition.  This assessment procedure provides an important safeguard for the welfare of a child being adopted abroad by Irish residents.  It is fully in compliance with a provision of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which requires states to ensure that children involved in inter-country adoption enjoy safeguards and standards equivalent to those required for national adoption.  I am relieved that the Bill contains nothing that would undermine our compliance with this requirement.</P>
    <P>Certain other aspects of the Bill give me cause for concern.  The first of these relates to the proposal to modify the <Col N="2407" /> application of condition (c) of the definition of a foreign adoption contained in section 1 of the 1991 Act to Chinese adoptions.  That condition provides that the law of the foreign country require that an inquiry be carried out, as far as practicable, into the adopters, the child and the parents or guardian.  I am not aware that this condition presents a difficulty where Chinese adoption law is concerned.  Indeed, I have been informed by the Adoption Board that Chinese adoptions appear to satisfy this condition.</P>
    <P>Apart from condition (b) which I have already referred to in some detail, the other condition of the definition of a foreign adoption that raises a difficulty in relation to Chinese adoptions is condition (d) Broadly speaking, that provides that the law of the foreign country required the relevant adoption authority, before effecting the adoption, to give due consideration to the interests and welfare of the child.  The adoption law of the People's Republic of China does not appear to contain an explicit requirement in this regard, although it is founded on the principle that &ldquo;adoption shall be in the interests of the upbringing and growth of adopted minors&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State suggesting it would not be in their interests to come here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that condition (d) will also have to be modified in order to allow Chinese adoptions to be recognised here.  However, the Bill before the House contains no proposals in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final matter I wish to comment on is the lack of clarity in the Bill as to the date from which a Chinese adoption effected in favour of Irish residents would be recognised.  The Bill appears to provide that such an adoption would be recognised on the making of an application to the Adoption Board for the adoption to be entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions.  If this is the <Col N="2408" /> case, then it represents a curious departure from the approach set out in the 1991 Act.  Surely if a foreign adoption qualifies for recognition here, it should be recognised from the date on which it was effected.  This is the position under the 1991 Act but not in the Bill.  In any event, I would point out that there is no requirement on Irish residents who adopt a child abroad to apply to have the adoption entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions, although there are practical benefits in their doing so.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot accept the Bill because the proposals contained in it are fundamentally defective and would, if implemented, result in inequities in our treatment not only of different categories of adopters but also of different countries.  I have outlined in some detail the nature of those defects and their implications.  I hope Deputy Woods will accept that my criticisms are not motivated by party political reasons but by a strong desire to ensure that the changes that need to be made to the Adoption Act, 1991 are the correct ones.  As those who were involved in the processing of that legislation through this House are aware, this is a complex area of the law and any proposed amendments must be very carefuly framed.  It is vital that nothing is done which would create anomalies in our statutory recognition system.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I assure the House that we will be bringing forward proposals to address the difficulties that have emerged in the operation of the 1991 Act, including those relating to the recognition of adoptions effected in countries whose laws permit the revocation or termination of adoptions in particular circumstances.  Specific legislative proposals in this regard have already been prepared by my Department and circulated to relevant Departments and offices for their urgent observations.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to changing the law to provide for the establishment of an adoption contact register to assist adopted persons and birth parents who wish to re-establish <Col N="2409" /> contact with one another.  It would be my firm intention that an adopted person's right of access to his or her original birth records would also be considered in that context as the two matters are inter-related.  However, such changes would need to be carefully drafted to ensure an appropriate balance is struck between the rights of the respective parties, and that proper safeguards are provided.  I do not consider it would be appropriate to do so in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is intended that all of these proposals will be incorporated into the proposed new Adoption Bill to address the issues raised by the European Court of Human rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland.  That case was brought by the father of a child born outside marriage who was placed for adoption without his knowledge or consent.  In the light of the European Court ruling, it will be necessary to amend our domestic adoption laws to give the fathers of non-marital children a greater say in the adoption process.  I expect to be a position by the end of the month to seek Government approval to draft such a Bill which will include provision for considered amendments of the 1991 Act.  Those amendments will deal not only with what Deputy Woods has sought to achieve, but also with certain other issues that have come to light since the 1991 Act was enacted.  It all the circumstances, I ask Deputy Woods to withdraw both his Bills.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods is doing the House a service by bringing this Bill, which I welcome, before it.  Since it was first published, other related issues have been in the public limelight, particularly in relation to the contact register.  What Deputy Woods has proposed this evening on that issue is of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2410" /> This measure should not become a political football or result in party political wrangling; it should also not be used by parties in this House to wrong-foot one another for some political advantage. This Bill deals with the problems which arise in the context of foreign adoptions.  In 1990 I published what became the Adoption Act, 1991.  This measure, which initially resulted in some political wrangling between the Government and Opposition, rapidly became law with a great deal of co-operation from all sides of this House.  I hope the Government will reconsider its approach to this measure, and Fianna Fáil will reconsider putting this matter to a vote tomorrow evening, so as to afford the Government additional time to consider the substantial changes Deputy Woods has proposed.</P>
    <P>The problems which have arisen in recognising foreign adoptions have come as no surprise to me.  These problems derive directly from amendments to the Adoption Bill I originally proposed, which the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, insisted be included in it.  We achieved a consensus on that Bill and, as the Minister of State said, it was passed without contention, because of negotiations which took place behind the scenes to facilitate the measure being rapidly enacted.  The provisions in section 1 were insisted upon by the then Minister for Health and, I think, his departmental officials.  Those provisions created the difficulty whereby the Adoption Board has determined that we cannot recognise approximately 20 countries' adoption orders.</P>
    <P>When the Adoption Bill was being debated in 1991 it was my view that making some progress was better than no progress at all.  That Bill, in its final form, would have allowed not only for the recognition of Romanian adoption orders but for a large number of other adoptions effected in other countries.  It was inevitable that the type of problem we are dealing with this evening would fairly rapidly surface.  Deputy Woods and the Minister of State mentioned <Col N="2411" /> some of the countries whose adoptions we currently do not recognise, which also includes some of our EU partners.</P>
    <P>It was always my view that paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 1 of the Act would give rise to difficulties, particularly paragraph (b).  In this context, I am in disagreement with both the Minister of State and Deputy Woods.  The Minister of State is right that there is no problem with paragraph (c).  Neither do I see any problem with paragraph (d), as the provision in the Chinese adoption laws, which became operative in 1992, cited by the Minister of State satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d).</P>
    <P>The real problem is with paragraph (b), which requires that a foreign adoption order must have the same effect with regard to the termination of parental rights as an order made in this State.  That wording has &mdash; as I believed it would &mdash; created the situation whereby adoptions which could be terminated by the countries in which they are effected cannot be recognised. In those countries on which it is possible to terminate an adoption order, normally such terminations can only take place in exceptional and unusual circumstances. It is my understanding that they are a very rare event.</P>
    <P>I agree there are serious defects in this Bill.  However, I seriously suggest to the Minister of State to consider using this Bill as a vehicle for dealing with the problems which arise under this area of the law.  This House is supposed to be a legislature and I pressed the view very strongly from the Opposition benches &mdash; and my view has not changed now that I am on this side of the House &mdash; that Members of this House should be allowed to act as legislators.  There are clear problems with the Bill as originally drafted, and the amendments proposed to it by Deputy Woods tonight will not adequately deal with the complexity of some of the issues which need to be addressed.  However, I see no reason, if this Bill is given a gestation period and allowed to come back to a Committee of this House after the Easter recess or <Col N="2412" /> a week prior to it, why the drafting changes required could not be dealt with by a Dáil Committee.  I ask for that aspect to be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's promise of legislation, particularly his statement that the Government has in principle made a decision to address this area of the law.  The Minister of State is telling us that the Government will deal with the issue, but it will take some time because there is not yet even a draft Bill.  I know, as does Deputy Woods and the Minister of State, that when there is not a draft Bill the bureaucracy of Government means it normally takes many months rather than a couple of weeks for a Bill to appear.  If the Bill is to address a wide variety of areas in regard to adoption, we will do well if we see it this side of the summer recess and there is very little chance it will become law before the autumn.</P>
    <P>If the Adoption Bill I published in December 1990, which became law by April 1991, had not been swiftly passed through this House many of the approximately 500 Romanian adoptions, which are now recognised, would not have been recognised and great difficulties would have been created. Speed is of great importance in this area.</P>
    <P>None of the previous speakers pointed out that Catriona Crowe, the archivist, deserves the congratulations of all Members of this House for discovering so many records relating to the adoption of Irish children abroad.  We now know that in the period under discussion approximately 3,000 children were adopted outside Ireland.  We also know that since 1952 approximately 40,000 children have been adopted within Ireland.</P>
    <P>The need for a contact register has been known for many years.  It is extraordinary that the vehicle which is now pushing this as a political imperative is the number of adoptions that were effected abroad.  They are a serious reason we should have the register. However, a greater reason is the many Irish people, now adults, who were <Col N="2413" /> adopted in Ireland and the many Irish mothers and some fathers whose children were adopted years ago who would like to make contact.  We must provide a vehicle that enables such contact to take place and we should do it with a degree of urgency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wood's proposals on this issue merit serious consideration. Neither Government nor Opposition parties should use this issue as a political football.  Let us enact the legislation that is required and do it in proper form without delay.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Shatter's final comments wherein he requested the House not to turn this issue into a political debate. It has not happened so far but we steered a little close to it on one or two occasions.  This is a sensitive issue that can cause great anxiety for the people directly affected.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, took issue with Deputy Woods about the changes he is introducing.  However, that was not a valid argument for withdrawing this legislation.  I doubt that a single Bill has passed through this House that has not been changed.  In some cases, Bills have been greatly changed on Committee Stage, and not necessarily through amendments proposed by the Opposition.  In many cases, substantial amendments are made by the Government.  In my brief time in the House I have seen sections of Bills being deleted on foot of Government amendments.  There is nothing unusual in legislation being changed on Committee Stage; that is what Committee Stage is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods said many of the changes he is introducing arise from the recent debate on adoption.  I have received correspondence from people who have adopted children from <Col N="2414" /> countries where I was unaware such adoptions could take place.  Only this morning I received substantial representations about these matters.  As a result of such representations and for other reasons Deputy Woods has introduced his amendments.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Woods for bringing forward this legislation, particularly following the present public debate on the issue.  It is a short Bill but it is important for those affected by it. Deputy Woods has broadened its scope with his contribution tonight and shown how it might effectively deal with adoptions from other countries.  We can tackle the issues raised in this debate on Committee Stage.  We understand that inter-country adoptions are complex. Complicated matters must be attended to and dealt with and it is not easy for adoptive parents to effect inter-country adoptions.  We have a responsibility to put in place supporting legislation to allow such parents to meet their requirements with regard to adoption, especially as the number of children available for adoption in this country has dramatically decreased in recent years.  It is our duty to help people who wish to adopt.</P>
    <P>With regard to the voluntary contact register, this House will be confronted with a major issue very soon.  There is growing support for the establishment of a voluntary contact register and we all would agree with that.  However, we will soon be challenged to go a step further.  Let us say a national voluntary contact register is established and an individual who has been adopted wishes to contact his or her natural parents. Contact is made through the register with the natural parent, usually the mother, and she indicates that she is not willing, for a number of genuine reasons, to effect a contact.  Whose right is of paramount importance?  Is it the right of the mother or the father who, for their own reasons, do not wish to make contact or is it the right of the adopted person?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2415" /> We will be challenged to confront that issue and to make a decision.  It will be tough and will cause much anxiety but we must confront it soon.  I am not suggesting that we do so tonight but there should be a public debate on the matter so that at some stage we will be able to clarify our thinking as to what might happen in the circumstances I have outlined.  In other countries the adopted person has a right to have knowledge of his or her natural parents and sometimes has a right to go further than that.  We have to reach a level of maturity where we can begin to consider that issue and consider how best we might deal with it.  It is an important issue and it will not go away.</P>
    <P>Legal adoptions were first introduced in this country in 1953 and up to 40,000 people have been adopted since then. The subject of this Bill is inter-country adoptions.  We last discussed this issue in 1990 in the context of the adoption of Romanian children.  There were difficulties for those involved in that debate. Complex social and ethical issues were raised.  There were known cases in other countries of people going to Romania to adopt children and of money changing hands in order to secure such adoptions. That was a difficult situation and it caused immense problems in Romania.</P>
    <P>The complexities of inter-country adoptions mean that we must get the legislation right.  However, we must try to come to terms with those we are trying to help.  We must put in place legislation which will give people the opportunity to adopt and give children the opportunity to be adopted.  That is the purpose of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider carefully his colleague's wish that this issue should not be politicised.  The Government should accept this legislation and, on Committee Stage, bring forward appropriate amendments.  Some of them, as the Minister of State said, might be major in content but this side of the House is prepared to carefully consider them, just as we are prepared to push the amendments proposed by <Col N="2416" /> Deputy Woods.  Let us not delay this legislation; let us bring it to Committee Stage where it can be thrashed out in detail.  At the end of the day we must produce legislation that will give expression to what all sides of the House are trying to achieve &mdash; a Bill that will enable inter-country adoptions to be dealt with in a caring and compassionate way.  If we do that the House will have done itself a service, apart from the service it will do for adoptees and adoptive parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Through television and other media we have got used to being shocked on a regular basis by disasters of many kinds.  They include natural disasters such as earthquakes, famine, disease epidemics and so forth.  Unfortunately, such disasters also include manmade disasters which arise from actions of policies, deliberate or otherwise, which leave countless innocent victims in their wake.  When the victims are little children, the images presented on our television screens pull even more on the heart strings and nowhere is there a more positive and compassionate response than in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Woods for introducing this Bill which is designed as an urgent response to one such tragedy.  I refer to the revelation that countless unwanted babies exist in China.  There is little to be gained at this time by launching an attack on the Chinese authorities because of the alleged ill-treatment of many children in its orphanges.  We must remember that the allegations have not been proved and we must also bear in mind the recent shocking revelations of what happened in our orphanages during the life time of most Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>China has experienced a huge population explosion despite its draconian birth control regulations.  Little children are the innocent victims of being brought into a part of the world which has no room for them.  Ireland, on the other hand, has many couples who long for the opportunity to become adoptive parents but have little chance of doing <Col N="2417" /> so because of the dramatic social changes in recent years.</P>
    <P>An unmarried mother no longer feels she has to avoid the squinting windows of old by giving up her child for adoption, yet the obscenity of cross-channel abortions is continuing at the rate of thousands each year.  If only these women or young girls could come to terms with their situation and realise that abortion is the worst choice of all. They are now happy to raise their children, usually with the loving support of family and friends.  The numbers who choose to take the boat to England are fewer, although I am aware that hundreds, if not thousands, of prospective adoptive parents are heartbroken when the annual figures are published.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has rightly appealed for an all-party approach to the proposals and it appears that his appeal has been heard and acted uppn.  The most important principle is that a child adopted in Ireland, regardless of the country of origin, should not be a second class citizen either here or in any part of the European Union.  The amendments proposed by Deputy Woods will ensure that does not happen. Amendments from either side of the House which are designed to close perceived loopholes in the current legislation will be welcome.  Deputy Woods stated that he trusts the Minister's discretion in using the proposed enabling powers in relation to the Irish register of foreign adoptions.  I concur with him on that point.  I cannot imagine that any present or future Minister could not be trusted in a similar fashion. We may have our different political approaches to certain matters but I have yet to see this House play politics with the lives and happiness of children.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion recently about the urgent need for a voluntary contact register as a means of bringing birth mothers and adopted children together.  This was emphasised in the past couple of weeks with the news that a large number of babies from Ireland were adopted in the United States 30 or more years ago.  The <Col N="2418" /> records in many of these cases were either hidden away or did not contain accurate information.  Like Deputy Shatter, I extend my congratulations and thanks on behalf of so many people to Ms Caitriona Crowe who brought this matter to light.</P>
    <P>It is natural for people to be curious about their roots even when they have been brought up by their natural parents. How many times have we seen Irish Americans, in particular, searching for their ancestors' records?  If a person knows that he or she was adopted, it is natural for them to become curious about their parents.  However, that does not mean the person has not had a happy and loving relationship with their adoptive parents.  Many adopted persons have no desire to contact their birth parents.  Deputy Woods said this is a highly sensitive area.  We must be careful about how we, as legislators. handle this issue.  I agree with the idea of a voluntary contact register but it must be confidential.  Such registers, which will probably be computerised, must be foolproof as far as security is concerned.  We have all considered the scenario of a happly married woman with a family who is suddenly confronted with a young adult, who is the child of her teenage years, but whom she concealed from her husband and family.  This Bill will ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>One aspect of adoption which is barely mentioned is adoptive parents who spend a lifetime of love and sometimes sacrifice to bring up their child. There was a lot of publicity recently on radio and television and in the press about the efforts of adopted people to trace their birth mothers.  Many adoptive parents go through the agony of wondering if they will lose the only son or daughter they have ever known.  It is possible that some adopted people feel pressurised to embark on this search because such publicty could make them feel guilty if they did not do so.  More consideration should be given to adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>From the moment a child is adopted <Col N="2419" /> too many people refer to the fact that the child is not &ldquo;one of your own&rdquo;.  That is the most insensitive remark anyone can make.  Another insensitive remark is that the child is lucky to be adopted or that the adoptive parents are heroic people for giving the child a good home. Most people know they are lucky to have such wonderful parents and, as parents, we know we are lucky to have such wonderful children.  Love is or should be mutual and it is no different for adopted children.</P>
    <P>The maximum age requirement is a perpetual cause of heartbreak to couples who are desperate to adopt a child.  Many married couples in their forties and fifties have no difficulty conceiving and giving birth to children. However, some couples, for medical reasons, are unable to do so, yet they may not have this fact confirmed until they have reached the earlier age at which adoption is not allowed.  I presume this rule will also apply to foreign adoptions so that many abandoned children will be sentenced to life without a home in a family environment.  It is time to examine such obstacles and to do something about removing them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed, among other things, to take many children out of the legal limbo because their adoptions are not valid in this country by giving the Minister the power to designate such adoptions as being valid.  I heartily commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because of repeated representations by concerned parents to me and, no doubt, to colleagues.  For many years Lucan has had three post-primary facilities &mdash; the Christian Brothers school, St. Joseph's post-primary girl's school and the Lucan community college born out of the former technical school in the village.  I first brought this matter to the attention of <Col N="2420" /> the Minister for Education in February 1994.  In reply to a parliamentary question on 15 February 1994, the Minister explained that two of the three post-primary schools in Lucan &mdash; Coláiste Phádraig boy's secondary school and Lucan community school &mdash; had sought additional post-primary places and that these applications were being assessed. I asked that an independent commission study the future requirements of the Lucan area, but the Minister, in her wisdom, decided that was not necessary.</P>
      <P>A year later I tabled another parliamentary question and on Thursday, 9 February 1995, the Minister said that the review had been completed and that an assessment of the application for each of the three post-primary schools for capital grant aid towards the provision of additional accommodation had been completed.  It is now March 1996 and the Lucan community college project is supposedly winding its way through the tortuous delaying tactical type procedures which appear to exist in the Department of Education where analyses, assessments and sketch plans, etc., are undertaken.</P>
      <P>A project has supposedly been approved for Lucan community college but with a severe financial-technical-quality sting in its tail.  According to normal guidelines issued by the Department, £520 per square metre should be allocated for the construction of a properly equipped post-primary facility. However, County Dublin vocational education committee is supposed to be capable of building an extension to the college at a cost of £389 per square metre.  County Dublin vocational education committee has told the Department this is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lucan area has exploded in terms of housing, which is a welcome development. The success of Intel in Leixlip, the proposed development of Hewlett Packard and the existing good housing market has meant that Lucan has become the focus of development in the greater Dublin region.  In the past three to four years approximately 2,000 new <Col N="2421" /> homes have been or are being constructed. Many of the people moving to this area have children of post-primary age and as a result, there is pressure for post-primary facilities.</P>
    <P>The Christian Brothers, the nuns and the community college must get the all-clear to provide these urgent additional spaces.  At present 683 pupils are enrolled in Lucan community college, but the projected 800 pupil facility is probably carrying 183 pupils above its original design.  Parents are uncertain about where to send their sons and daughters for post-primary education. This is an acute problem which must be addressed and I would like the Minister to outline how this will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education, to clarify the position.  In late 1993 and early 1994 applications were received in the Department from the three post-primary schools in Lucan for additional accommodation. These three schools are Coláiste Phádraig boy's secondary school, Coláiste Iosef Naofa girl's secondary school and Lucan Community College.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the applications, a review of the post-primary needs of the Lucan area was carried out.  As a result of this review, it was agreed that extensions to each school should be approved.  At present all three extensions are at various planning stages.</P>
      <P>In addition, grant aid was approved last August for the provision of four temporary classrooms at one of the schools to alleviate its short-term accommodation difficulties.  The Department will ensure that the permanent extensions to all three schools will be provided as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is also carrying out a further review of the area to ensure that all Lucan children seeking a place in post-primary schools in the area can be accommodated now and in the future.  I understand that the three <Col N="2422" /> schools can between them accommodate a total intake of at least 380 pupils each September. Given that the number of pupils leaving primary schools in Lucan each year is around 300, it would be expected that all pupils could be readily accommodated, although not necessarily in the school of their first choice.</P>
    <P>It seems that some of the schools have traditionally enrolled pupils from adjacent areas and that this trend has continued. This approach can cause problems in ensuring that all Lucan pupils are readily accommodated.  The Department expects that schools will normally cater for the demand from their own locality in the first instance and, only if space is still available, enrol outside pupils.  The Department will also consider this issue as part of its latest review of the Lucan area.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some pupils have had a difficulty in securing a place in one of the Lucan schools for next September. However, the latest information available to me indicates that all of these pupils have now been offered a place and the Deputy can be assured that the Department will make every effort to ensure that similar problems will not arise in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter in the context of a recent case tried in the courts relating to an offence committed on a young victim in Dundalk. The young boy who was aged 12 when the offence occurred almost two years ago suffered burns to 80 per cent of his body and 15 per cent burns to his legs. His injuries were, to say the least, horrendous. As a result, this young boy spent three months in intensive care, suffered multiple shock and epileptic and psychotic disorders.  It is obviously harrowing to think that this boy would more than likely have died had it not been for the immediate response of an eyewitness to the horrific event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2423" /> In court last week the judge stated that it was his intention to impose a custodial sentence on the accused.  Unfortunately, it transpired that he could not do this.  He pointed out that the accused, almost 17 years of age, was too old for Trinity House and the only place available was St. Patrick's Institution, a place of detention with a lack of adequate educational facilities.  St. Patrick's does have some educational facilities but it was submitted and, indeed, accepted that they were not adequate in this case and that the accused would suffer educationally and vocationally.  Due to the inadequacy of the trade teaching facilities in St. Patrick's the trial judge had little choice but to give the accused a two year suspended sentence.  He also placed him under a strict curfew and probation supervision by the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>This case clearly serves to highlight the urgent need for a place or places of detention in this State with adequate educational facilities for those aged between 16 and 18 years.  At present, the Eastern Health Board and other health boards are purchasing properties to place young offenders with minders. This is costing a considerable amount of money.  I humbly submit that this money might be better spent if a detention unit with educational and vocational opportunities for young offenders was provided.</P>
    <P>The trial of the Dundalk youth clearly demonstrates that the Irish criminal justice system has little comfort to offer the young victim and his parents.  The system has let this family down.  No words of mine can turn the clock back for the young victim or, indeed, his distraught parents, but the very least they were entitled to expect was that the punishment would fit the crime.  I am not placing any blame on the court but I am placing a considerable amount of blame on a system which allowed a person who committed an offence as horrific as this to walk out on the streets without the punishment being seen to fit, and not fitting, the crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2424" /> For too long under the Irish penal system of justice, people who commit serious offences either spend little time in prison or, if they are young offenders, appear to be able to walk free because there is no place to put them.  The 1908 Children Act did envisage a place of detention with educational facilities. The time has come for us to provide adequate detention facilities for young offenders.  They are now getting the same simple and lucid message as hardened criminals: if one commits a serious criminal offence, the punishment will not fit the crime.  I believe that, not only in this case but in the case of virtually everybody who has the use of reason, there is a crying and desperate need for this State to tell those who commit serious crimes that the punishment will fit the crime and that if they commit a serious criminal offence, not only will they go to prison or a place of detention but they will stay there until they have served their debt to society or be made an example of to others who might be of like mind.</P>
    <P>In this context, I also call on the Government to stop the dithering on urgent legislation.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, on the Juvenile Justice Bill but at this point, I ask him to bring the legislation before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume, rightly, that the Deputy's question was prompted by the court case yesterday in which a 16 year old youth who set another boy ablaze was given a two year suspended sentence with conditions attached.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exericse of their judicial function.  It is not open to the Minister for Justice to intervene in or comment in any way on the conduct or outcome of court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Justice's responsibility is for the detention of male offenders aged 16 <Col N="2425" /> years and over and female offenders aged 17 years and over.  Offenders under that age cannot be sent to the prisons or places of detention operated by the Department of Justice except rarely and in very special circumstances.</P>
    <P>Male offenders aged 16 to 21 years can be committed by the courts to St. Patrick's institution.  If the court had decided to commit the youth to detention at St. Patrick's, spaces were available. In fact, 30 additional spaces were made available at St. Patrick's a fortnight ago, bringing the total number of spaces in that institution up to 188.  Male offenders aged 17 years and over can be sent by the court to the committal prisons: Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick and Portlaoise.  The Department of Justice also has responsibility for the operation of places set up under the 1970 Prisons Act, which include institutions such as Wheatfield and Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    <P>The current provision for young offenders under the aegis of the Department of Education comprises five special schools certified under the Children Act, 1908.  They provide a total of 210 places for boys and 16 places for girls &mdash; 130 in industrial schools, 60 in reformatory schools and 20 places in St. Michael's remand and assessment unit, Finglas.</P>
    <P>The draft scheme of the Children Bill, 1995, was cleared by Government before Christmas and is currently with the parliamentary draftsman.  Latest indications suggest that the Bill will be ready for publication by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the Bill is to remove current ambiguities surrounding the roles and responsibilities of the Departments of Education, Health and Justice and their agencies in dealing with children and special care needs and those who come into conflict with the law.  The issues involved were the subject of intensive debate between the three Departments and the Bill reflects the agreement reached on the way forward for the future.</P>
    <P>On the general question of accommodation provision, I should point out that <Col N="2426" /> it is extremely difficult to forecast with any degree of precision the number of custodial places required to accommodate juvenile offenders.  Demand for such accommodation can vary from day to day depending on decisions taken by the courts.</P>
    <P>Experience within the Department of Education in relation to the operation of the present industrial schools facilities would indicate that the 130 places currently available in these schools are adequate to meet present and likely demand.</P>
    <P>In the case of reformatory school places, there is growing pressure on the 60 places currently available for young male offenders in the 14 to 16 age group.  There is also occasional pressure on the 16 places available for young female offenders.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that, had the court decided to impose detention in the case mentioned, space was available in St. Patrick's institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I use this Adjournment debate to call on the Minister for Transort, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to declare that the strategic alliance process at Telecom Éireann is now officially at an end.  The process to try to sell 35 per cent of Telecom Éireann has now clearly been botched by the Government because of the undue delay in securing a Government mandate and in publishing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten companies expressed an interest in the purchase of a third of Telecom Éireann.  However, seven of them have pulled out and are no longer interested. I call on the Minister to call off this farce of a competition that now remains. <Col N="2427" /> particularly after the withdrawal of British Telecom, and I ask him to go back to the drawing board.  I would like him to lay before the Dáil all the options now available to the company and the consultants' reports in particular for which I have repeatedly asked in this House and have been repeatedly denied.  It is time to have a full debate on the future of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Government policy on the future of Telecom Éireann is a shambles.  The 15 month ideological tug of war within the Cabinet has resulted in the best partners for Telecom Éireann withdrawing from the race.  The contestants who remain look decidedly uncompetitive.  In answer to a recent parliamentary question I was informed that the cost of consultants for this so-called competition amounts to £4 million.  While it is well known that the Minister is something of a &ldquo;consultant junkie&rdquo;, it is beyond belief that the Government is willing to pay so much money for advice to select a player in what has become a one horse race.  Last weekend the media reported that the consultants informed the Government they are satisfied with the pace and direction of talks with the three remaining bidders.  They can make such a statement because any company earning thousands of pounds per week would be very satisfied if the Telecom Éireann process continued indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal last week of British Telecom from the competition followed months of concern about the Minister's handling of the entire process, during which he made a number of fundamental errors.  When the Minister took office, the necessary procedures were in place to ensure that a decision could quickly be taken on the strategic alliance.  However, the Government and the Minister have allowed the process to become bogged down.  All decisions were referred to a subcommittee of the Cabinet which took in the region of 15 months to advance the process.  A Government mandate issued in January of this year and the international companies interested in Telecom Éireann <Col N="2428" /> had to wait until then to obtain the basic information memorandum which it had been expected would issue in early 1995. Serious questions must be asked regarding this delay in advancing matters which resulted in the withdrawal of seven of the ten bidders.</P>
    <P>A major error is also evident in a Government statement issued in January of this year about the entire strategic alliance process.  In that statement the Government made it clear that securing a large cash sum for the 35 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann was the primary aim.  I understand that this emphasis on a large cash sum was the final straw for British Telecom which was already disillusioned because of the lack of clarity in the Government's approach.  Interested parties such as British Telecom could not get straight answers about the investment that would be demanded or the return that could be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Telecom Éireann has missed the boat with regard to attracting the best partners for the strategic alliance.  The blame for this lies in the Government's 15 months inactivity in this area.  I request that the process be officially halted to save as much as possible of the £4 million in consultants' fees.  There should be a full public debate on the future options for Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications I wish to state that the Government's strategy for Telecom Éireann must be seen in the context of our overall national policy objective which is to achieve a telecommunications sector which is in the upper quartile of OECD indicators of price, quality and availability as soon as possible. This objective was laid down by the Minister when the Government approved the mandate for strategic alliance negotiations in July of last year and it is now the cornerstone of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2429" /> In setting out this policy objective the Minister recognised that the long-term economic prosperity of this country is heavily dependent on the provision of top quality telecommunications services at competitive prices.  What matters to this Government are jobs and the competitiveness of Irish industry and services in providing and retaining jobs. Telecommunications development into the 21st century will have a critical influence on achieving this overall goal.  The performance of Telecom Éireann as the leading operating company must be consistent with this policy objective.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Government is pursuing a strategy aimed at achieving a top quality telecommunications sector while ensuring that Telecom Éireann, as the national operator, will continue to provide a first class basic service on a nationwide basis and offering the full range of advanced services at competitive prices to the business sector.  It is intended to retain a majority State ownership of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's view that the formation of a strategic alliance with a suitable international strategic partner is an essential element in this process.  This strategic alliance approach had been formulated and adopted by the Minister's predecessor.  It was then and still is the right approach.  Other strategies such as flotation or going it alone would not address the crucial long-term business strategic issues.  A flotation would simply raise cash but financial considerations or the size of the cheque have never been the overriding consideration. The strategic alliance concept seeks to enhance Telecom Éireann's strengths in addition to addressing those areas of relative weakness in the company.</P>
    <P>Securing the future of Telecom Éireann is first and foremost about addressing the company's internal weaknesses and exploiting the business opportunities that exist.  The right partner will assist in meeting these goals by helping to reposition Telecom for the challenges that lie ahead in the competitive marketplace.  In essence this means <Col N="2430" /> providing a range of strategic benefits, including marketing, managerial and technology skills.  An alliance partner will help to defend the company's international revenues, which are open to competition, protect its domestic market share, accelerate the growth of mobile telephony and exploit cable TV opportunities.  There will also be a valuable injection of funds to Telecom's balance sheet and to assist in its restructuring. It is also important that a partner can give access to additional business development and job opportunities in or outside Telecom's sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put in place all the key enablers to allow this process to continue.  The negotiating mandate was issued, advisers appointed and a management structure put in place to bring this process to a conclusion.  Vital decisions have been taken on the future regulatory structure which mean that we will have independent regulation of Telecom's sector in the summer of this year.  He has also taken the necessary steps to allow Irish consumers to enjoy the benefits an alliance and earlier competition will bring by announcing the liberalisation of the sector in January 2000, some three years earlier than originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>Recent withdrawals, such as that of British Telecom, from this process are not a reflection on the selection process or on the attractiveness of Telecom Éireann as an investment opportunity. If anything, the withdrawal of British Telecom from the alliance process foreshadows the emergence of that company as a serious potential competitive threat in the marketplace which reinforces rather than reduces the need for a strategic alliance.  It is correct to state that an alliance is not the panacea for all the ills that face Telecom Éireann.  It is, however, the Government's view that an alliance is an essential ingredient of a multi-dimensional approach to tackling the problems of Telecom.</P>
    <P>No alliance can be devised which will remove the need for the board and management of Telecom to take action <Col N="2431" /> to meet the future challenges, place its operations on an efficient base and its costs on a comparable basis to those of its competitors.  The Government is committed to supporting the board and management in their efforts to address the significant issues facing the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied, given the players remaining in the alliance process, that a satisfactory agreement from the Government's perspective is necessary and achievable.  Much of the work necessary for the conclusion of an alliance deal has now been done. As the <Col N="2432" /> Minister stated last week in this House, bids will be received on 15 March.  This will be followed by an evaluation process leading to detailed negotiations with some or all of the potential partners in the next stage of the process. Overall, a deal could be concluded in mid-summer.  It is only by following this strategy to a successful conclusion that the overall long-term policy of a dynamic and efficient Telecom sector can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 March 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, the process of tax reform as an important element in overall employment strategy.  The programme, A Government of Renewal states that the Government will accelerate the reform of the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes and especially those with families.  Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, aim to reduce the tax wedge, and encourage enterprise development and growth.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, I have, in my two budgets, made significant increases in the exemption limits and personal allowances, and considerably widened the standard bands.  I have also introduced a new PRSI-free allowance of £80 per week for most employees.  Furthermore, the lower rate of employers' PRSI contributions has been reduced from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent and the income threshold applying to it increased from £173 per week to £250 per week (from £9,000 to £13,000 per annum).  These measures will increase take-home pay, especially in the case of lower paid workers, thereby making employment more attractive and will continue the progress being made in reducing both the employees' average tax burden and the overall tax wedge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition this year's budget also contained a number of provisions designed specifically to ease the transition from unemployment to work. These measures include increases in the income limits applying to the family income supplement (FIS), the retention of child dependant allowances by the long-term unemployed for 13 weeks on <Col N="2069" /> taking up employment, and the retention of the medical card by the long-term unemployed for three years on returning to work.  The retention of child dependant allowances is specifically designed to improve the take-up of FIS, thereby building a bridge between unemployment and employment.</P>
    <P>The impact of the tax and social welfare systems on the incentive to work is of concern to the Government.  In view of the complexity of the issues involved, an expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was established in 1993.  The group has already made two interim reports to the Government and most of the recommendations have been implemented. The group will shortly produce its final report.</P>
    <P>It is planned to make further progress in the 1997 budget towards reducing the tax and PRSI burden on those on low incomes and to improve the incentive to work by pursuing the type of measures adopted in the last two budgets.  In this regard the Government will, of course, have regard to the recommendations of the expert working group.</P>

      <P>As Ireland does not meet the criteria for funding under the Community INTERREG initiative for transnational co-operation against flooding, which normally requires the involvement of at least three member states, there have been no recent discussions between officials of the Office of Public Works and the Northern Ireland authorities regarding drainage of cross-Border rivers.  The prospects for such co-operation in the future are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works existing drainage-flood relief programme involves the preparation of scheme designs and execution of schemes for eight priority areas, which will absorb resources for the immediate future. <Col N="2073" /> While none of these schemes includes the alleviation of flooding in problem areas in the Border region such areas will be considered for inclusion in the new drainage priority programme which is to be drawn up shortly.</P>

    <P>A breakdown of the non-industrial numbers by Department is given in the following Table 1 and a breakdown by main general service grades is given in Table 2 herewith.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Departments-Offices participating in the administrative budget initiative had delegated sanction to appoint staff up to and including higher executive officer level and equivalent provided sufficient funds were available in their administrative budgets to pay for such staff.  Accordingly, they would not have required my Department's individual sanction for most of the new positions created.  Arising out of measures taken by the Government to stabilise numbers in the Civil Service, the delegated authority to create posts up to HEO level under administrative budget agreements has now been superseded.</P>
    <P>As regards the positions sanctioned in Minister's offices, guidelines on the employment of staff for Ministers' and Ministers' of State private offices and constituency offices and in relation to special advisers, personal assistants, personal secretaries and programme managers have been brought to the attention of all Ministers and Ministers of State.  Those guidelines provide that the total number of staff in a Minister's private office may not exceed ten and the number in a constituency office may not exceed six.  A Minister of State may have a private office staff of seven, which may be increased to nine if he-she is assigned to more than one Department, and a staff of five in the constituency office.  Additionally, Ministers may appoint one partnership <Col N="2075" /> programme manager and all Ministers and Ministers of State may have one personal secretary, one personal assistant and one personal or special adviser.</P>
    <P>While the guidelines provide a ceiling on the number and categories of staff which office holders may employ, it is <Col N="2076" /> for each of them to decide whether they require the full permitted complement of such staff.  Questions on the detailed arrangements and costings are appropriate to individual Ministers.</P>
    <P>The staff numbers and costs for my private office and the Ministers of State attached to my Department are set out below.</P>

    <P>My Department does not compile projections of EU commitments in respect of EAGGF Guarantee funding.  The figures which I have given the Deputy are in respect of those programmes which are primarily concerned with assisting farming and social and educational schemes.  The Cohesion Fund is project based and is confined to projects in the transport and environmental sectors. The current round of Structural Funds lasts until 1999 and any commitment of funds beyond 1999 would be a matter for decision in the context of the negotiations of the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

    <P>The random audit programme began in 1992.  No new random cases were selected in 1993 for audit due to concentration of resources on work related to the tax amnesty and major restructuring of the audit programme.  The total number of random audits of tax returns from all self-employed persons and companies which were initiated in the years 1992, 1994, and 1995 was 370.  Some 237 of these have been completed up to 8 March 1996 in respect of all self-employed persons, including farmers. Therefore, random audits have been completed at an average of about 79 over the three years.  The corresponding annual average number of completed audits for farmers only is 24.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of cases who are selected for audit are selected on the basis of perceived defects in their tax returns or supporting accounts and not on a random basis.  The total number of these comprehensive targeted Self-Assessment audits initiated in 1995 (including companies) are 4,129.  These are in addition to normal PAYE (employers) and VAT audits.  The purpose of the random element of the audit programme is to demonstrate to taxpayers that there is a risk of audit for every self-assessing taxpayer even where incorrect returns have the appearance of being correct.  However, experience suggests that taxpayer behaviour is influenced more by the perception of Revenue's ability to <Col N="2082" /> detect suspect tax returns in a systematic way, rather than by the risk of random selection of a return.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that all their audit programmes, including the random programme, will be kept under review. They have, however, in light of the experience to date, no plans to increase the percentage of audits chosen at random.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that, in my Budget Statement on 23 January, I indicated that I intend to introduce an income tax allowance of up to £800 at the standard rate, for individuals aged 65 or over living alone, for the purchase of security alarm systems.  The relief will remain in force for two years.</P>
      <P>With regard to VAT, the position is that EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply, would rule out exemption, zero rating or the reduced rating of such items for old age pensioners or, indeed, any other categories and, accordingly, the standard rate of 21 per cent must continue to apply.</P>
      <P>However, I would point out that the installation of security appliances and alarm systems, would normally be regarded as work on immovable goods (building) which, in accordance with an option provided under EU VAT law, is subject to the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.  The reduced rate would apply to the full cost of installation, subject to the rule that the VAT exclusive value of the goods does not exceed two thirds of the VAT exclusive charge to the customer.</P>

      <P>Since Ireland is not a creditor of any of the world's poorest countries, it is as a member of the multilateral lending organisations, in particular the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that we can best exercise our influence to seek to contribute to easing the debt burden of these countries.  It should be remembered that Ireland's voting strength within those organisations is small, linked as it is to our share of the global economy.  Our influence is nonetheless greater than our relative economic weight, because, although we belong to the developed world and the European Union, we have no imperial history, and the contribution of our missionary and voluntary organisations is widely recognised.</P>
      <P>We have sought, and will continue, to exercise that influence by calling attention in international fora to the need for initiatives towards easing the debt burden, and in particular by supporting that emphasis by highlighting the human dimension of economic development. However, it may be quantified in macroeconomic terms, development must ultimately find expression in improved welfare of populations as regards food, education, and health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the World Social Summit in Copenhagen in March 1995, the Taoiseach was unambiguous in expressing Ireland's concern that much more than has been achieved to date remains to be done to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest countries.  He made it clear that Ireland is prepared to look with a fresh mind at all options, including debt cancellation. He also indicated our willingness to envisage, in respect of the debt owed to multilateral institutions, the sale of gold reserves, subject only to not <Col N="2084" /> undermining the effectiveness of the institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>When I addressed the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Washington last October, I welcomed the growing acceptance that the burden of debt may be a disabling constraint on the economic and social development of very poor countries.  I also urged the institutions to press ahead with work on an initiative to ease the burden of multilateral debt repayment on countries with unsustainable levels of debt.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that there is a currency crisis and, to judge by the low level of interest rates, neither do the financial markets.  I am, therefore, very surprised at the Deputy's suggestion that there is one.</P>
      <P>Sterling has fallen by about 4 per cent against the Irish pound since the end of 1994: sterling has been weak on international currency markets, reflecting <i>inter alia</i> market perceptions of the UK economy.  Sterling has fallen against the Irish pound despite the different evolution of interest rates here compared with the UK, such that Irish interbank rates are currently some 1 per cent below corresponding UK ones.  Furthermore, the fall in the value of sterling should be providing benefits to some businesses, in terms of lower input costs. The Deutsche Mark has of course appreciated against the Irish pound as have some other ERM currencies, a factor which should be of benefit to exporters to the countries of these currencies, while overall, that is on a trade-weighted basis, the value of the Irish pound has increased relatively modestly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of the concerns of some sectors of industry in relation to the Irish pound-sterling exchange rate. <Col N="2085" /> During the past year, and particularly in the run-up to the 1996 budget, my officials and I had a number of meetings with industry representatives during which this issue was discussed in some detail.  It is, of course, a matter for each individual firm in the first instance to make arrangements required to cope with the economic environment in which it finds itself.  Nevertheless, the Government has a key role in trying to ensure that this environment is as conducive as possible to economic activity. The present environment is characterised by low inflation, moderate wage developments under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, interest rates close to historically-low levels, sound public finances, a strong balance of payments surplus and high levels of investment, notably under the Community Support Framework: all of these factors are beneficial for economic activity.</P>
    <P>In addition, in each of the last three budgets, considerable Exchequer resources were allocated to employers through reductions in their PRSI contributions. This was done to assist employers to maintain and create employment and was targeted at lower-paid, labour-intensive and mainly indigenous sectors of Irish industry.  The 1996 changes in employer PRSI reduced the costs of employment of virtually all employers.  The ongoing cost of the PRSI reductions provided for employers in the 1994, 1995 and 1996 budgets is some £124 million annually. There have also, of course, been substantial tax reliefs, mainly targeted at the low paid, and changes in the corporation tax regime designed to assist businesses not benefiting from the 10 per cent corporation tax scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the funds from the EU and other sources available for the southern Border counties; the funds that are additional or consequent on the peace process; and the purposes for which they have been or will be used in each of the years from 1994 to 1996.[3928/96]</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to expenditure under the Community Support Framework (CSF) operational programmes and from the Community initiatives, the Border region (comprising the six counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo) is benefiting specifically from the Programme for peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties and the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme 1994-99, both of which are managed by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the peace programme a total of 300 MECU (approximately £240 million) of EU funds is being provided over the period 1995-97.  At least 20 per cent of these funds (amounting to approximately £48 million) is being <Col N="2087" /> made available for the six Border counties.</P>
    <P>Under INTERREG II a total of 156 MECU (approximately £125 million) of EU funds has been allocated to the Border counties and Northern Ireland for cross-Border projects in infrastructure, environmental protection, natural resources, human resources and economic development.  Of this amount 89.5 MECU (approximately £72 million), significantly over half of the EU funding approved, has been made available for the six Border counties, and, as in the case of the peace programme, matching funding will come from central Government, local authorities, the private sector and community groups depending on the nature of the project being funded.</P>
    <P>Expenditure under the peace programme and INTERREG II will be additional to spending in the Border counties under the 1994-99 CSF operational programmes for Ireland and under other Community initiatives.  To verify this additionality the Department of Finance has requested Government Departments to compile details of forecast expenditure under each operational programme and community initiatives for each of the eight regions.  These forecasts, which are now being finalised, will provide the baseline reference data for establishing additionality of expenditure under the INTERREG II and the peace programme over the period of these programmes.  I assure Deputies that procedures are being put in place to ensure that additionality of funding under INTERREG II and the peace programme will be verifiable and transparent.</P>
    <P>In the context of the peace programme the Department of Finance has asked Departments responsible for CSF operational programmes to examine the possibilities for refocusing these programmes to accommodate the new demands and challenges which have arisen following the cessation of violence. While a major recasting of operational programmes should not prove <Col N="2088" /> necessary, Departments are expected to examine possibilities such as advancing the timing of projects located within the Border region and increased opportunities for cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>Within the peace programme five priority areas of action are identified under the central objective of reconciliaton: urban and rural regeneration, employment, cross-Border development, social inclusion and productive investment and industrial development.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of the problems that are being addressed by the special initiative, the theme of social inclusion will be given particular prominence. Most of the measures under the peace programme are being managed by intermediary funding bodies who are independent of Government Departments and funded by means of global grants. In addition, sub-programme 2 &mdash; Urban and Rural Regeneration &mdash; involves the participaton of county council-led task forces across a wide range of actions. Where measures do not involve intermediary funding bodies or the local authority task forces applicants are advised to apply to the relevant Government Department directly.</P>
    <P>Under INTERREG II, the programme will offer a multisectoral range of measures covering: economic development and tourism; infrastructure; environmental protection; agriculture, forestry and fisheries and human resources.</P>
    <P>As a coherent economic development strategy for the Border region is dependent on adequate infrastructural foundations the bulk of the funding on the Southern side has been allocated, as agreed by the Government, to the Infrastructural and Environmental Protection sub-programmes.  Roads, sanitary services, electricity networks and telecommunications are vital underpinnings to the tourism, agricultural, food processing, industrial and service sectors.</P>
    <P>An INTERREG office was established in Monaghan in October last and an INTERREG development officer has been appointed with the specific remit of assisting with the promotion of <Col N="2089" /> this programme on the ground both in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.  Part of his remit is to inform interested groups and individuals on other sources of EU funding for their particular projects.</P>
    <P>Over 3,000 information packs covering the peace initiative and INTERREG, have been distributed. Nearly 600 applications have been received under INTERREG and a further 500 applications received under the peace initiative, and I am pleased to say that 69 projects have been assisted under both initiatives to date.</P>
    <P>In putting together the peace programme officials in both administrations were able to draw on their track record of co-operation in relation to the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme.  This gave a good basic foundation on which the Commission and ourselves hope to build innovative delivery mechanisms which will ensure a genuine &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; involvement for local communities.</P>
    <P>In the Border counties the implementation mechanisms have been designed to ensure the fullest local involvement in the most direct way possible.  Accordingly, where appropriate and to the fullest extent practicable, the measures under the programme are being implemented by intermediary bodies, ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency. Both of these bodies have offices in Monaghan town and will be particularly concerned with addressing the problems of social inclusion.</P>
    <P>To ensure that all these funds are maximised, the Taoiseach has asked his Minister of State, Deputy Donal Carey, to chair a task force to ensure the relevant level of co-ordination is achieved to get value for money and maximum benefit for the people living in the Border counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced legislation, the Electoral Bill, which will provide funding for political parties. That Bill has not yet been enacted, and so, as a senior office holder in my party, I am committed to playing my part in the essential task of political fund-raising.</P>
      <P>While I have been dismayed by the hypocrisy displayed by the Progressive Democrats on the issue of fund raising by political parties I have been outraged and offended by the misinformation and libellous suggestions and innuendo made by members of that party in relation to my role as Finance Minister.</P>
      <P>I particularly reject the suggestion made by Deputy Molloy, that people who attend such a function, could purchase an amendment to the Finance Bill.  This is a contemptuous comment but Deputy Molloy once made a similar comment about another Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and paid a heavy political price.  The date of this function was deliberately selected so that it would be after the Government had made its final decisions in relation to the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking up office as Minister for Finance I have continued the process, which I began as Minister for Enterprise and Employment in the last Government, of holding breakfast meetings on a weekly basis with individuals from the business, financial, trade union, commercial, academic and industrial sectors, <Col N="2091" /> to listen to their views on whatever issues they believe are of concern and-or relevant to me in my role as Minister. To date, as Finance Minister alone, I have met and spoken with over 108 people in that context.</P>
    <P>I also personally conduct clinics in my constitutency twice a week where individuals from every sector of the community, including those already mentioned, can meet me to appraise me of their concerns, views or proposals in relation to issues relevant to both my role as public representative and as Minister.  To suggest, as some have attempted to do, that the public is denied access to me is false and I believe, for any public representative to deny access to his or her electorate would be suicidal in career terms.  In addition to these regular meetings with the public I attend a large number of functions in my capacity as Minister for Finance where I would discuss a wide range of issues, particularly those of concern to the business and financial community.</P>
    <P>Another fallacy that has been propounded in the last number of days has been in relation to pre-budget submissions. To make the process of formal pre-budget submissions by representative organisations more meaningful and informative for all concerned, I proposed in this year's Budget Statement that, in future, these groups and organisations would make their presentations to the Finance and General Affairs Committee of the Dáil where there could be a full and frank debate on all the issues.  The situation that has pertained to date, where the organisation concerned simply presented their submission, which had already been published in the media, to the Minister of that day without real debate, was of little benefit to the proper evaluation of the proposals involved.  However, at no stage did I attempt to propose that I would not continue to meet with people in the various ways I have described earlier, to hear proposals they might have on budgetary or other issues.  Nor <Col N="2092" /> have I suggested that I would refuse to accept written submissions from anyone on these matters.  In fact, in relation to the Finance Bill itself, I have taken an initiative this year to make the process of preparation of the Finance Bill the most open and transparent in the history of the State.  As indicated in my Budget Statement, I recently published a preliminary list of items to be contained in the forthcoming Bill in order to maximise the amount of public consultation in advance of publication.  I also published last week the draft text of measures for the Bill dealing with consolidation which will prepare the way for next year's Taxes Consolidation Bill.</P>
    <P>Drafting of the Finance Bill is now well advanced and following Government approval, will be published by the end of March.  In addition to the views of Members, there have been and will no doubt be, many representations from interested members of the public.  These are all given a fair evaluation&mdash;from whatever quarter they come &mdash; but I can give no guarantee that any suggestion will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Finally, as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and the first Labour Party Minister for Finance, I am happy to attend fund raising functions for the party when requested and available to do so.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say in advance, with any degree of certainty, that topics will be discussed at such functions. However, I expect that issues of current public import or matters relating to my role as Minister for Finance may arise in any discussions that take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, in last year's budget I introduced a new scheme aimed at renewing and updating the tourist-amenities and facilities in certain traditional coastal resorts which have lost out in recent years to the growth in package holidays to sun destinations.  Initially eight resorts were selected but during the Finance Bill process a further seven resorts were added to give a better coastal balance to the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme which will run on a pilot basis in these areas for a three year period has been in operation since 1 July 1995.  The incentives available under the scheme are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;100 per cent accelerated capital allowances, at an initial rate of 75 per cent for owner-occupiers in year 1 with the remaining 25 per cent at 5 per cent per annum for the following 5 years, or in the case of a lessor at a rate of 50 per cent in year 1 and at 5 per cent per annum for the following ten years;</P>
      <P>&mdash;ten year double rent allowance for traders leasing new or refurbished buildings.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Section 23 reliefs for the construction or refurbishment of, or the conversion into rented residential accommodation.  100 per cent relief is available against all income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-date, I have received numerous requests, in the form of representations and parliamentary questions to extend this scheme.  The vast bulk of these have been made on behalf of towns which are not included in the scheme, although in the case of nine of the 15 seaside resorts which have been designated, extensions to the existing designated areas have also been sought.  My response to all these requests has been that the scheme which is a pilot nature has only recently commenced and that it would <Col N="2094" /> be premature to consider broadening the scope of the scheme at this point.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked if I would consider bringing this scheme into line with the urban renewal scheme.  The present urban renewal scheme will be in operation until 1997 in 35 towns and cities around the country.  The incentives available are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;100 per cent accelerated capital allowances for capital expenditure in the construction or refurbishment of certain industrial buildings in designated areas; initial allowances of 25 per cent (available to both owner occupiers and lessors) and free depreciation of up to 50 per cent owner-occupiers;</P>
    <P>&mdash;maximum allowance of 50 per cent for commercial buildings; free depreciation for owner occupiers of up to 50 per cent and an initial allowance of up to 25 per cent for lessors with the remainder (up to 50 per cent) at 2 per cent per annum;</P>
    <P>&mdash;double rent allowance for 10 years for traders leasing new or refurbished business premises.  Hotels can only qualify for the double rent allowance if the person entitled to the capital allowance in respected of the building disclaims this allowance;</P>
    <P>&mdash;owner occupier housing tax allowance of 100 per cent for cent for expenditure on refurbishment of residential premises, available at 10 per cent per annum for ten years;</P>
    <P>&mdash;section 23 reliefs for the construction or refurbishment of, or the conversion into rented residential accommodation.  100 per cent relief is available against all income;</P>
    <P>&mdash;ten year rates reliefs is available on a sliding scale.</P>
    <P>The reliefs in the seaside resort scheme are more favourable than the comparable reliefs in the urban renewal scheme; 100 per cent capital allowances are available for commercial buildings <Col N="2095" /> in the seaside resort scheme as opposed to 50 per cent capital allowances in the urban renewal scheme.  An initial allowance of 75 per cent for owner occupiers is available in the seaside resort scheme as opposed to 25 per cent in the urban renewal scheme.  Reliefs such as the capital allowances for commerical buildings and the rates relief which exist in the urban renewal scheme are not in my view appropriate to the aims of the seaside resort scheme.</P>
    <P>In response to the Deputy I would have to say that I feel that it would not be appropriate to bring the two schemes into line as they are designed for different reasons.  Consequently, I have not considered amending the seaside resort scheme to bring it in to line with the urban renewal scheme.</P>

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation of commercial property, including livestock marts, is net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Among the factors that determine rental value are: the operations of the property market, changes in economic conditions, the profitability or turnover of business and changes or developments to property.</P>
      <P>A central tenet of the rating code is uniformity and equity between rate-payers. In determining rateable valuation, the valuer has available a number of valuation methodologies.  The courts have decided that the valuer is not required to use any particular method of assessment but may use the method most appropriate to the circumstances of the property.  The most commonly used method is the direct comparative approach in which the valuation of similar properties is taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Livestock marts are valued using whatever is the most appropriate valuation methodology or combination of <Col N="2097" /> methodologies in the particular circumstances. This can involve valuation by a direct comparision on a square footage basis to other livestock marts, or by reference to the turnover or profitability of the livestock mart, or by reference to the development costs of the livestock mart.  All these methodologies are legitimate and accepted mechanisms, depending on the circumstances of the property being valued, for determining net annual values.</P>
    <P>Any ratepayer dissatisfied with a valuation or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent valuation tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>

      <P>Since the passing of the 1995 Finance Act, there have been numerous requests to extend the scheme to additional towns and, in certain cases, to enlarge areas where the incentives already apply.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important programmes in Revenue's special inquiry branch, in the Dublin area and in its local inquiry units in tax offices around the country, is the identification of people with taxable income who are not registered for <Col N="2100" /> tax purposes.  This programme includes a focus on travelling traders.</P>
      <P>As a matter of course, street traders and town markets are monitored and, where appropriate, travelling traders are registered for any tax for which they are likely to be liable.  Revenue is particularly anxious to ensure that traders, whether travelling or in permanent establishments, do not have a competitive advantage over other traders arising from non-compliance with tax requirements.</P>
      <P>Compliance projects dealing specifically with travelling traders are conducted from time to time in various parts of the country.  In one such operation in 1994, approximately 50 traders were identified and put on tax record.</P>
      <P>Special inquiry branch and the local inquiry units pay particular attention to occasional sales by non-resident traders, sometimes organised at short notice, in various parts of the country.  During 1995, more than 50 such sales were attended by Revenue officials and over £200,000 VAT was collected &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Revenue has invoked, against both travelling traders and traders in permanent establishments, the provisions of section 23A and section 37 of the VAT Act, 1972.  Section 23A allows the Revenue Commissioners to require a taxable person to give security for the payment of any VAT which may become due.  Section 39 allows the Revenue Commissioners, where it appears necessary to them, to hold an Irish-based person, who provides a premises, to be liable for the VAT incurred by a trader not established in the State who is trading in that premises.  Both these provisions have proved particularly valuable in confronting non-complaint travelling traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1995, provides that application forms for casual trading licences should be in a form determined by ministerial regulations. The Government has decided that applicants for licences should be obliged to quote an RSI number as this would <Col N="2101" /> help to underpin tax compliance for this category of travelling trader.</P>
    <P>Revenue is broadly satisfied that there is a strong awareness among travelling traders of the possibility of detection of taxable activity.  Revenue activity from 1993 onwards appears to have led to a significant reduction in the number of occasional sales by non-resident mobile traders.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has specific information relating to travelling traders, which could be of assistance to the Revenue Commissioners, they would be glad to receive it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a PAYE taxpayer's tax affairs are administered by the tax office where the employer is registered for PAYE purposes.  The place of registration generally depends on the employer's main place of business.  In general, this does not present any difficulties as, in most cases, the employer and employees will normally be based in the same area.</P>
      <P>Dublin-based employers, and employers based in adjoining counties, are divided between four PAYE districts located in Dublin.  These districts are organised on a vocational basis.  For example, all the newspaper industry employers are dealt with in one district and all the motor industry employers in another district.</P>
      <P>Outside Dublin, employers' PAYE is dealt with in Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Thurles, Tralee, Waterford and Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main circumstances in which <Col N="2102" /> employees' tax affairs may not be dealt with by the local tax office arise in relation to an employer who has employees spread throughout the country, for example, in the public service, banks and other country-wide enterprises.  This results in locally based personnel having their tax affairs dealt with in a centre different from their place of residence.</P>
    <P>Dealing with all employees of an employer in one area has advantages for both employers and employees.  An employer has a single definite contact point for all inquiries regarding his or her employees.  The single contact point also makes it easier for employers to supply the information required by the tax office e.g. details of benefit-in-kind and expense payments.  In addition, the tax office becomes familiar with particular administrative features of different employers.  This avoids the position whereby various tax offices have to ask employers and employees repeatedly for the same information.  It enables Revenue to give a better service to both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are mindful that this administrative system may result in some inconvenience to some PAYE customers from time to time and have taken a number of initiatives to minimise this.</P>
    <P>Initiatives taken to date include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;Freepost&rdquo; arrangements are in place for correspondence with Tax Offices.</P>
    <P>&mdash;All tax offices now have greatly improved customer inquiry facilities for personal callers.  Even if an employee's tax affairs are not dealt with in a local tax office, they can, nevertheless, conduct most tax business through that local tax office.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The service given in the Dublin Central Revenue Information Office (opened in 1993) enables any taxpayer, irrespective of where his-her tax office is located, to walk in off the street and get his-her tax <Col N="2103" /> affairs processed there and then. About 200,000 customers availed of this service in 1995.</P>
    <P>&mdash;In February 1996, a new central telephone information office was opened serving the needs of all taxpayers in the greater Dublin area. This gives employees and other taxpayers who are unclear as to the tax office handling their affairs direct access to a specially designed phone-in service, which will enable them to advance their tax business by phone.  (This office can direct callers to a definite contact point at which their problems can be resolved or in straightforward cases resolve the problem there and then).  Where telephone callers cannot be dealt with promptly contact numbers are taken and the calls returned.</P>
    <P>&mdash;All PAYE taxpayers are supplied annually with a simple form which they can use to update their tax free allowances without visiting or phoning the Tax Office.</P>
    <P>&mdash;All Tax Offices operate tax clinics at various locations throughout the country.  These clinics are designed to provide access to the facilities of the Tax Office at convenient locations outside the tax office.  In 1995, over 100 of these clinics were held at the following types of locations: factories, shopping centres and various trade and agricultural shows.</P>
    <P>Administrative arrangements are continually under review.  Should it become possible, in the future, to offer taxpayers the choice of having their affairs dealt with fully either in the local tax office or where their employer is dealt with, without reducing the efficiencies and other advantages arising from the current arrangement, this will be done.</P>

Any such proposals would have to be made by the European Commission which has sole right of initiative under the Treaties.</P>
      <P>However, in many instances, the most appropriate way for the State to assist charities and similar organisations is by means of direct grant assistance.  A wide variety of schemes are currently operated by Government Departments to this end, ranging from loans to ongoing assistance with day-to-day running costs, depending on the nature of the activity being carried out.  These Exchequer grants take account of the fact that VAT is not recoverable in these cases.  It should be noted, too, that certain projects undertaken by such organisations are also eligible for national lottery funding.</P>

      <P>Irish passports are issued only to Irish citizens.  Non-nationals may hold Irish passports if they are also or become Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>Some Irish citizens, for example those born abroad, are also citizens of other countries.  Non-nationals can acquire Irish citizenship in different ways, for example by naturalisation or by making a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as their post-nuptial citizenship.  In the period 1 January 1994, to 31 December 1995, six passports were issued to Irish citizens whose place of birth was Bulgaria.  Information on the number of passports issued to Irish citizens who were born in other foreign countries is not readily available.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recall, the Treaty on European Union, which sets out the provisions relating to economic and monetary union, was the subject of a referendum in Ireland in 1992.  A White Paper on the Treaty, which contains a chapter on Economic and Monetary <Col N="2111" /> Union and its implications for Ireland was published in advance of the referendum.</P>
      <P>I announced last November that I had decided to commission an independent study of the economic, employment and sectoral implications of Economic and Monetary Union for Ireland.  The Economic and Social Research Institute has been appointed to carry out the study, which is to be completed by 30 June 1996; and I have already indicated that its findings will be made public.</P>
      <P>In addition, the National Economic and Social Council, on which the social partners are represented, is preparing a follow-on report to its 1993 report A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment.  I have no doubt that Economic and Monetary Union will figure prominently in the Council's preparation of this report.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of Economic and Monetary Union I wrote earlier this year to the chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, offering to make a presentation to the Committee about Economic and Monetary Union.  The committee accepted my proposal and an initial hearing took place on 7 and 8 March. The committee indicated that it will return to the subject later in the year.</P>

Funds are also received under various lines in the EU Budget.</P>
      <P>FEOGA Guarantee supports measures under the Common Agricultural Policy and the Structural Funds support development in the productive sectors &mdash; industry, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, etc,; the economic infrastructure sectors &mdash; transport, energy, communications, environmental services, etc. and in the human resources area.  Table I which follows shows the receipts under FEOGA Guarantee, from each of the Structural Funds and other miscellaneous receipts for each of the years from 1985 to 1995.

      <Quest>the reason superannuation entitlements particularly in relation to the calculation of early retirement sums are different in relation to various State agencies with Civil Service conditions and salaries; the number of variations on these schemes that exist; and if he will standardise these in relation to calculation of lump sums and the inclusion of overtime earnings and others in order that the Forbairt scheme can be brought into line with the Civil Service.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the various voluntary early retirement schemes which were introduced in the public sector in 1987 and subsequently. The terms of the scheme introduced in the Civil Service in 1987 were also applied in the local authority, health and teaching areas and in some State bodies.  Other State bodies devised compensation packages tailored to meet their particular needs and circumstances. Consequently, there are differences between schemes reflecting the different target groups within organisations, taking account of the age, service and salary profiles of these groups and the need for particular agencies to <Col N="2119" /> achieve varying levels of reduction in staff numbers.  It must also be borne in mind that some organisations had previously put VER schemes in place.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of reckoning overtime, I would point out that it is normal public sector practice to exclude overtime earnings in the determination of pensionable pay for the purposes of calculating superannuation benefits.</P>
      <P>As regards Forbairt, I would point out that the question of VER-severance schemes for this agency is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I can, however, say that a scheme for a small number of their staff was approved in 1994.  Forbairt has now sought the introduction of a further limited scheme of VER severance and discussions are ongoing as to proposed funding arrangements, etc.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has received representations from the Small Firms Association urging the abolition of section 115 of the Finance Act, 1986, which gives the Revenue Commissioners first call on the books debts of a small company; his views on the assertions by the SFA and ISME that this section militates against small firms securing finance from the associated banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I made a number of significant changes to section 115 last year in order to limit the claimed disincentive effect of the section on the provision by banks of finance to small companies against the security of book debts.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the new provisions are being operated by the banks in so far as notifications to Revenue of fixed charges on book debts are concerned.  Such notice is required <Col N="2120" /> under the revised section 115 if the holders of a fixed charge wish to limit their exposure under the section.</P>
      <P>So far, 248 notifications have been received by Revenue, of which, 204 relate to fixed charges taken out prior to the enactment of last year's Finance Act.  While not all notifications relate to fixed charges taken specifically in exchange for financial assistance to companies, it seems clear that the provisions of section 115 as amended are being availed of and can be worked.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the call by the Small Firms Association to abolish section 115 in full.  However, I have to weigh the potential cost of this to the Exchequer against the likely benefit from increased bank lending to small firms.  I think that the amended section provides a reasonable basis for increased lending by the banks to small companies.  The financial institutions would appear to see more attractions in other forms of lending, such as invoice discounting, which are unaffected by the terms of section 115.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping the operation of section 115 under review within the framework of the considerations just mentioned.</P>

      <P>I understand that the remarks attributed to Commissioner Kinnock in November 1995 were personal comments and were not intended to reflect the view of the European Commission.  Indeed, at the time, the President of the Commission <Col N="2121" /> reaffirmed the Commission's view that establishment of the single currency by the planned date of 1 January 1999 was &ldquo;desirable, necessary and possible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that since Mr. Kinnock made his comments, the European Council meeting at Madrid in December 1995 reaffirmed the commencement date of 1 January 1999 for Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union, adopted a reference scenario or plan for the transition to a single currency based on that commencement date and agreed that the new currency would be known as the Euro and that Euro notes and coins would be introduced by 1 January 2002 at the latest. The European Council also decided that the decision on which member states qualify would be taken as soon as possible in 1998 and be based on 1997 outturn figures.  Preparations at European Union and national level are intensifying on the basis of the timescale set out in the reference scenario and I am satisfied that Economic and Monetary Union will proceed as planned.</P>

      <P>Designation of towns and areas normally come under the urban renewal scheme.  The present urban renewal scheme was introduced on 1 August, 1994 and will operate for a three year period.  The scheme applies to 35 cities and towns throughout the country, including the town of Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Late last year, my colleague, Deputy Liz McManus, Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal announced a comprehensive review of the entire urban renewal scheme to assess the experience gained over the last ten years.  At that time, she said that until the outcome of this review was assessed no new areas or towns would be designated.</P>
      <P>In last year's budget I announced a new scheme of relief for traditional seaside resorts.  This pilot scheme came into effect last July for a three year period. The scheme is in operation in 15 seaside towns around the country, including the seaside resorts of Bundoran, County Donegal.  Until this pilot scheme is firmly established it would seem inappropriate to consider the extension of this scheme to any further towns either in County Donegal or elsewhere in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 50 areas in cities, towns and seaside resorts already designated either under the urban renewal scheme or the pilot scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  To introduce additional designated areas under either <Col N="2123" /> of these two schemes or to introduce a completely new scheme could, in my view, greatly dilute the benefits of the existing schemes.  Consequently, there are no plans to extend designated status to any additional areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The information which I gave the House on 14 December 1995 concerning the amount of tax paid by both the farming sector and the PAYE sector is the most recent information available.</P>
      <P>The net receipts of income tax of £66.5 million from the farming sector, compared with £3,259.1 million from the PAYE sector must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in the PAYE and farming sectors.  It should also be noted that the amount attributed to the PAYE sector includes the tax paid under PAYE on the employee income of farmers.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1992-93, the latest available, indicates that some £56 million in tax was paid by farmers, including farmers who have other trading income, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
      <P>Farmers are assessable to tax on farming profits on actual income on the same basis as other self-employed taxpayers. The normal self-employed allowances may be offset against farming profits as well as special provisions in relation to stock relief and income averaging.  In common with other self-employed taxpayers, farmers are subject to the various compliance and audit arrangements which apply under the self-assessment system.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the evidence currently available from self-employed audits indicates that the compliance levels of farmers are comparable with those of other self-employed taxpayers.</P>

      <P>In the past few years, An Post, with the support of the Government, has made strong advances in the provision of personal banking services, excluding lending, through the introduction of information technology and the automation of its counter transactions.  The Credit Union movement has also made huge strides, including the extensive introduction of information technology systems and a major expansion of its community-based branch network.  In connection with the latter, I would like to inform the Deputy that my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, is preparing a new Credit Union Bill.  In addition to consolidating and up-dating existing legislation, this Bill proposes to allow credit unions to expand their range of financial and advisory services, subject to the approval of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
      <P>It is in view of the implications for retail banking of developments such as these, that the future role of An Post and the credit unions is being considered in the context of the Government's current review of the State banking sector.  As I have indicated in previous replies on the latter, this issue is a complex one which requires prudent deliberation and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on it, pending a decision of the Government.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Decisions in relation to the placing of advertisements regarding the compensation tribunal are a matter for the tribunal.  As the Deputy is aware, the tribunal placed advertisements in national and provincial newspapers.  The total cost for advertising is £162.268.81, including VAT, to date and has been <Col N="2129" /> paid out of the £60 million voted by the Oireachtas for the purposes of paying compensation awarded by the tribunal and the costs of administering the compensation scheme.  The advertising is to ensure that all those persons who may have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion are fully informed of the categories of person entitled to make a claim to the tribunal and the time limit within which to make such application.</P>
      <P>Clause 19 of the scheme for compensation provides that claimants must apply to the tribunal within six months of the date upon which they first became aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C or within six months of the date of the establishment of the tribunal, 15 December 1995, which ever date is the later.  All such persons need to be aware of their entitlement to seek compensation from the tribunal and of the time limit within which they must apply to the tribunal to enable them, if they wish, to submit completed application forms, accompanied by all the necessary supporting documentation, prior to the closing date.</P>
      <P>All awards made by the compensation tribunal will be funded from the Exchequer.  As I have already stated in the House there is no limit on the amount that will be made available to pay compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship to provide general practitioner <Col N="2130" /> medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>The number of eligibility categories for entitlement to health services was reduced from three to two as a result of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991. This followed the detailed analysis of the eligibility system by the Commission on Health Funding and its recommendation of measures to simplify the system and make it more equitable.  In particular, the commission found that there were major problems and inequities inherent in allocating non-medical card holders to more than one eligibility category on income grounds.  These problems were removed when the new eligibility system came into effect.</P>
      <P>A tiered means system of entitlement for non-medical card holders would presumably have to be based on income and would thus reintroduce these problems. In addition, it would make the system far more complex than at present and could greatly increase administrative costs because of the increased number of persons to be means tested.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves and their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to put an exact cost on overall funding for drug treatment services.  These services include out-patient counselling and support to drug users and their families, treatment which is provided in psychiatric hospitals and also in specialised drug treatment centres in Amiens Street, Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street.  There are also detoxification units in Cherry Orchard Hospital and Beaumont Hospital in Dublin.  In addition, voluntary organisations provide various types of in-patient and out-patient treatment and support to drug misusers.  A number of general practitioners are also involved in providing treatment services.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 my Department has provided funding directly to the health boards for the provision of drug prevention and treatment services.  The health boards in turn have grant aided voluntary organisations, some of which are involved in in-patient care.  In 1995, for example, the Eastern Health Board granted over £700,000 to a number of voluntary agencies involved in drug treatment services.</P>
      <P>The total amount of money allocated in 1995 to health boards and the Drug Treatment Centre for drug treatment facilities was over £13 million.  Other services which cannot be directly costed include detoxification and out-patient and in-patient treatment provided by general general hospitals, treatment by general practitioners as part of overall patient care and counselling and support services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I recently reviewed the situation in relation to mixed gender wards in acute hospitals.  Each health board and acute voluntary hospital in <Col N="2134" /> the country was contacted in order to determine the extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>The position is that gender mixing occurs in high dependency units such as intensive care, coronary care and accident and emergency departments.  It also occurs in small geriatric assessment units.</P>
      <P>Outside of these areas gender mixing may occur as a result of emergency medical need where no alternative accommodation can be found at the time of admission.  It is not possible to re-organise the accommodation arrangements for male and female patients on a day to day basis to correspond with the varied demand for male and female beds.  Some flexibility is required occasionally as the alternative would be to accommodate people on trolleys in the accident and emergency department.  In such circumstances patients are usually only mixed for short periods until alternative accommodation can be found.  On such occasions I have been assured that patients are screened off by the use of curtains etc. to ensure that a degree of privacy can be maintained.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to write to the health boards and voluntary hospitals to remind them that where gender mixing must occur in emergency cases outside of the high dependency units etc., every effort must be made to confine this arrangement to the shortest time possible and to ensure that at all times the dignity and privacy of patients are maintained.  The Department will continue to monitor this situation and will ensure that whatever steps are necessary will be taken to bring to the irreducible minimum the extent to which gender mixing occurs in the care and treatment of patients.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Mater Hospital is a public volountary hospital and the selection of student nurses to train in the hospital is a matter for the hospital itself.  All schools of nursing must comply with the minimum educational requirements specified in the Rules of An Bord Altranais when selecting applicants for pre-registration training. Schools of nursing are free to require a higher standard if they so wish and in practice many schools do so.  They may not however apply a lower standard. The educational requirements sought by the Mater for student nurse training this year as advertised were:</P>
      <P>Leaving Certificate Subjects</P>
      <P>Irish, English, mathematics, one other language, a laboratory science subject and one other subject.</P>
      <P>Grades</P>
      <P>Minimum Grade C3 in higher level papers in any three of these subjects, one of which must be a science subject and minimum grade D3 in ordinary and higher level papers in the other three subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a higher standard than the Bord Altranais minimum which is two honours and four passes in the subjects: Irish, English, mathematics, a science subject and two others.  The situation with regard to student nurse training in <Col N="2139" /> this country is that at any given time there are more applicants than there are places available in schools of nursing. As a result, each year a number of unsuccessful applicants apply to hospitals in other EU countries for training places.  Provided such training complies with the relevant EU directives such nurses are eligible for registration by An Bord Altranais on their return to this country.</P>
    <P>The standardisation of educational entry requirements is currently being considered as part of the implementation of diploma based pre-registration nurse training and education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 100 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated last Wednesday, 6 March, in my reply to previous questions from the Deputy, I accept that the law in this area is in need of updating to take account of recent developments in <Col N="2140" /> adoption practice and the changing nature of adoption.  Indeed the Adoption Board itself has also called for new legislative arrangements to be put in place.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify that it is not the policy of the Adoption Board not to release birth record information to adoptees if the consent of the mother cannot be obtained.  The board has informed me that each case is looked at on an individual basis.  The board endeavours to obtain counselling for adoptees and birth mothers and, based on reports of such counselling and screening, the board makes a decision as to whether the information should be released.  I understand that where the birth mother cannot be located, the board makes a decision based on the report of the counselling of the adoptee.</P>
    <P>The relevant provisions of the Adoption Acts relating to birth records and the privacy of records apply only to persons in respect of whom adoption orders have been made.  Persons who were fostered or brought up in residential care, whether before or after the introduction of legal adoption in this country in 1952, but not legally adopted have the same right of access to their original birth records as other citizens.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the necessary legislation providing for a formal adoption contact system will be brought forward as expeditiously as possible, bearing in mind my other legislative priorities in the child care area generally.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, <Col N="2141" /> 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this provision, the chief executive officers of the health boards have agreed to implement a number of measures to assist medical card holders who take up employment. With regard to community employment, persons who have held the medical card while on the Live Register are allowed to retain the medical card for a period of two years after securing a placement on community employment.  The chief executive officers have also agreed that, in considering medical card applications weekly payments under community employment scheme are excluded in assessing an applicant's income.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to tackling long-term unemployment and to addressing any obstacles which prevent the long-term unemployed from taking up employment.  I am also satisfied that the arrangements agreed with the chief executive officers shows the good faith of the health services in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 106 together.  The Deputy raised this matter in the house three weeks ago.  On that occasion I stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that I would forward details in relation to the number of children in care accommodated in hospital beds, bed and breakfasts and ault hostels in 1995 to the Deputy as soon as they become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, requires health boards to take such steps as are reasonable to make available suitable accommodation for homeless children up to 18 years.  Health boards are developing a range of options to enable them to discharge their responsibilities under this <Col N="2143" /> section.  These include emergency hostels and other forms of residential accommodation; day care programmes for adolescents who are currently homeless or at risk of being homeless; out of hours social work services targeted at homeless children; special foster care services for out of home adolescents.</P>
    <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that I do not regard the use of bed and breakfast accommodation as an acceptable response to the problem of youth homelessness.  Indeed my Department has made it clear to the health boards that if, in cases of emergency, there is no alternative to the placement of a homeless child in this form of accommodation, immediate steps should be taken to secure an appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for the child.  However, at the same time, I recognise that the occasional case may arise where the provision of bed and breakfast accommodation may be appropriate for a youngster who is only seeking overnight accommodation in response to a specific unforeseen situation.  I am not aware of the extent, if any, to which children are admitted to hospital for social reasons. I have asked the health boards to report back to me on this issue.  My firm intention is to minimise the use of bed and breakfast accommodation and hospitals in such instances to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board, in whose area the problem of youth homelessness is mainly concentrated, is pursuing a number of strategies to reduce its use of bed and breakfast accommodation and the number of young people in such accommodation has been reduced significantly. In January 1996 the board established an emergency-short-term care facility which can cater for up to 14 young people who are temporarily out of home or are awaiting a more long-term placement.  The 1995 Child Care Action Plan also provided for a further range of important new child care developments, including the provision of additional residential places and an <Col N="2144" /> expanision of the board's out-of-hours social work service into a 24 hour crisis intervention service for all children.  Services for children out of home were expanded during 1995.  These included a day project for children out of home or in crisis.  Funding was also provided for a new service targeted at unattached adolescents and focused on vocational training and social skills.  Additional support was also provided to existing residential services for children at high risk and after care services for boys and girls.</P>
    <P>The Health Estimate for 1996 includes provision for a further investment of £5 million in the child care services. This brings to £35 million on an annualised basis the total additional funding that has been provided for these services since 1993.  I am satisfied that the measures I have outlined greatly strengthen the capacity of the health boards to provide appropriate accommodation and services for these vulnerable children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of important measures have been and are being taken to try to guard against offences against children by child care staff.  These measures are designed to protect children by ensuring that convicted child abusers are not employed in residential centres.  Guidelines on recruitment of staff to children's residential centres were issued by my Department in November 1994.  Under these directions employers must obtain Garda clearance on all staff being considered for appointment to a children's residential centre.  These directions were extended in September 1995 to the recruitment of staff to any area of the health services where they would have <Col N="2145" /> substantial access to children and vulnerable individuals.  I wish to point out that Garda clearances are only one aspect of attempts to protect children from abuse.  It is equally important that employers check references of potential employees and that they have adequate supervision mechanisms of staff working with children.  I also wish to emphasise that excellent work is being performed by social workers and residential care staff, the vast majority of whom are above reproach and share our revulsion at the very idea of any child being abused or exploited in any way.</P>
      <P>Under the Child Care Act, responsibility for monitoring standards in children's residential centres operated by voluntary bodies rests with the relevant health boards while responsibility for monitoring standards in centres run by health boards rests with the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>New regulations under the Child Care Act in relation to the placement by health boards of children in residential care came into force on 31 October 1995.  The regulations require health boards to satisfy themselves as to the standards that obtain in children's residential centres.  Health boards are required, among other matters, to satisfy themselves that appropriate standards, care practices and operational policies are operated in residential centres catering for children placed by the boards.  The regulations also require health boards to visit, supervise and review children in their care on a more systematic basis than before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the regulations require each health board to satisfy itself that adequate arrangements are in place at each residential centre to guard against the risk of injury and for the reporting and recording of accidents and injuries affecting children residing there; satisfy itself that procedures are in place for the prompt notification to the board of significant events affecting children placed there by the board; arrange for the supervision of children placed in residential centres by the board.  It requires that a child be visited as often <Col N="2146" /> as may be necessary, but the maximum intervals between visits will be three months during the first two years of the placement and six months thereafter; arrange for the periodical review of each child placed in a residential centre. Reviews will be carried out at intervals not exceeding six months during the first two years of the placement and thereafter at least once in each calendar year.</P>
    <P>The new regulations also empower an authorised officer of the health board to enter and inspect a children's residential centre as required and to take the necessary action to ensure compliance with the regulations.  Furthermore, the regulations permit the inspection, by a person acting on behalf of the Minister for Health, of the practices and procedures operated by a health board in relation to the provision of residential care services.</P>
    <P>In addition, Part VIII of the Child Care Act contains important new provisions in relation to the supervision and inspection of children's residential centres and will provide a statutory basis to the residential care sector.  In relation to the introduction of Part VIII, much of the ground work has been done.  A working group has already prepared a draft guide to standards in children's residential centres which will form the basis of the regulations to be prepared under Part VIII of the Act. My Department has circulated this draft guide to all agencies concerned with the provision of residential care for children on the standards which should obtain in such centres.</P>
    <P>The guide addresses a range of issues relating to residential care and pays particular attention to the need to ensure that children in care are not exposed to any risk of abuse.  It highlights the importance of agreed child protection procedures for residential centres which would define policy in relation to the prompt reporting and investigation of any suspicions or allegations of abuse or neglect of children while in residential care.  Such a policy would also ensure <Col N="2147" /> that staff are equipped with the necessary skills to recognise and deal with any signs or symptoms associated with bullying, scapegoating, harassment or abuse.  I have given a commitment that Part VIII, and the remaining provisions of the Child Care Act, will be implemented by the end of the year. This commitment will be honoured.</P>
    <P>I have also announced my intention to establish, at a national level and on a statutory basis, an inspectorate of social service in the Department of Health. This inspectorate will be responsible for quality assurance and audit of child care practice, and will undertake inquiries on on behalf of the Minister for Health.  I am confident that, together with the important new provisions relating to residential care under the Child Care Act, this will improve the safeguards and procedures for the protection of children in residential care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to sexual abuse counselling services for the 16 to 18 year old victims of child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>The broad range of counselling services including sexual abuse counselling is available through the health boards community care and social services departments to all victims of child sexual abuse including the 16 to 18 year olds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition specialist investigation and treatment services for persons who have been sexually assaulted or raped &mdash; both male and female &mdash; are available at the Sexual Assault Treatment Unit, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin.  The <Col N="2148" /> unit provides facilities for the effective collection and processing of forensic evidence and a structured environment for the examination and treatment of victims of sexual assault and rape.  This service is designed primarily to meet the needs of the population within the functional area of the Eastern Health Board but is also available to persons resident in other health boards areas.  Victims of sexual assault and rape outside the Eastern Health Board would also have access to local general practitioner-general hospital services for medical examination and treatment.</P>
    <P>Following medical assessment and treatment in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault and rape, victims are referred to support services, both statutory and voluntary, for ongoing counselling and support to deal with the trauma of the asault.  Multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals in each health board area provide pyschological support services for victims.</P>
    <P>The rape crisis centres throughout the country provide valuable support and counselling to victims of rape and sexual abuse, both male and female.  Rape crisis-sexual abuse counselling centres are currently located in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Kerry, Mayo and in Dublin where the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and three Eastern Health Board counselling centres operate.  Funding was also made available last year towards the establishment of a new centre in Athlone.  All these centres receive funding through the health boards.  Services provided by each centre focus predominantly on counselling, both by telephone and on a face-to-face basis, to victims of recent and past rape attacks and to victims of child sex abuse, both male and female.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided £20,000 each to the North-Eastern Health Board and the North-Western Health Board in 1995 in whose areas there are at present no rape crisis or counselling centres to assist with the establishment of centres services in these areas.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht my responsibilities differ in relation to the National Museum and the National Gallery. The National Museum operates as an integral part of my Department whereas the National Gallery, although coming within my overall remit, operates under an autonomous board established under statute.  Any proposals for entrance charges in respect of the National Gallery would, therefore, be a matter for the board, in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Museum is concerned I have no plans to impose an entrance charge on visitors; while I am aware of various studies and commentaries setting out advantages and disadvantages of different structures of entrance charges where they have been imposed &mdash; both in this country and abroad &mdash; I am not persuaded that the public interest would be served by the introduction of any such structures within the <Col N="2163" /> Museum at this time.  It has to be borne in mind that those institutions, while obviously tourist attractions, are not primarily tourist facilities.  They are the repositories of Ireland's moveable heritage and should not be seen as in direct competition with such facilities.</P>
    <P>However in the forthcoming Cultural Institutions Bill which will establish the Museum on an autonomous basis there will be an enabling provision permitting the board of the National Museum, with the consent of the Minister, to introduce such charges.  This is so as not to exclude an option, should a conclusion be reached, at some stage in the future, that the public interest warrants a change in the position.</P>

      <P>Lands identified by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) as containing a special wildlife interest have been proposed for Natural Heritage Area (NHA) designation. I expect to designate these areas after the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been amended.  The proposed NHAs are <Col N="2165" /> listed in appendix 1 which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning authorities have been asked to inform the NPWS of any developments requiring planning permission that are likely to have an adverse impact on the wildlife interest of the proposed NHAs and to provide the NPWS with an opportunity to make representations, or submit reports, in respect of such developments.  It is EU and Government policy to afford grant aid only to developments that are compatible with protecting the environment.  The grant-aiding bodies have been advised of the location of the proposed NHAs.  Farmers with lands in proposed NHAs, who <Col N="2166" /> wish to enter the rural environment protection scheme, are required to accept the NHA requirements as decided by NPWS.</P>
    <P>In addition I have designated 75 Special Protection Area (SPAs) under the EU Birds Directive and these sites are included in the county development plans.  The SPAs are listed in appendix 2 which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>I expect that the EU Habitats Directive will be transposed into national law in the coming months.  This will provide protective measures for Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated under the Habitats Directive and for SPAs.</P>

      <P>The annual dog licence fee of £5 is used by local authorities to finance the operation of dog control services, including the employment of dog wardens and the operation of dog shelters, for which there is strong local demand. The current level of licensing is low and local authorities are incurring substantial deficits on the operation of their dog <Col N="2239" /> control services.  The exemption of any particular group from the licence fee would require amending legislation and would add to these deficits.  In any event, I am not convinced that the present licence fee is a serious deterrent to dog ownership by old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The preliminary report for the Westport sewerage scheme was submitted to my Department in May 1992.  The proposal subsequently underwent environmental impact assessment and was certified for this purpose, subject to a number of conditions, by the then Minister for the environment in October 1993.</P>
      <P>My Department submitted an application for Cohesion Fund assistance for the project in June 1993, and a decision approving planning and design expenditure of £2,209,600 was received in April 1994.  Mayo County Council are at present preparing detailed contract documents for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> A compulsory purchase order for the proposed treatment works site was submitted to my Department for confirmation in June 1995.  As outstanding planning issues have recently been resolved, I am now in a position to consider the appointment of an inspector to hold a public inquiry into the objections made to me against confirmation of the order.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the near crisis situation affecting the supply of water to many Dublin homes; when the strict management regime, known as throttling will cease in view of the fact there are many parts of Terenure, Crumlin, Drimnagh, Walkinstown, The Tenters and the South Circular Road in Dublin where pressure is turned down so low as to effectively deprive residents of any water supply; and when he intends to sanction the necessary resources to allow the local authorities concerned to remedy this situation.</Quest>

      <P>A major investment programme is under way to develop the water supply infrastructure in the Dublin area.  Expenditure in 1995 amounted to almost £18.5 million.  The 1996 water services work programme provides for further investment in the region, including the continuation of the extensive refurbishment programme in Dún Laoghaire and a further phase of the major expansion and refurbishment of <Col N="2242" /> the Leixlip water treatment plant.  All significant infrastructural improvements of this kind benefit the entire Dublin water supply system, which is an integrated one.  An intensive water conservation programme for Dublin will also be commenced this year.</P>
      <P>I intend to publish the major strategic study on the Dublin region water supply very shortly.  This will provide a framework for the future management of Dublin's water resources and for investment over the next ten years.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2245" /> The Government strategy document &ldquo;Recycling for Ireland&rdquo; sets national targets and policies for waste recovery and recycling for the period up to 1999. A review and update of this strategy will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Recycling efforts will be supported in the immediate future by the provisions of the Waste Management Bill, 1995 due for enactment shortly, by the mobilisation of the industry-led REPAK scheme, and by new grant assistance under the waste management sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services.  Additional support may be available in appropriate cases from the enterprise development agencies at local and national level.</P>
    <P>Initiatives under way in relation to waste, other than packaging, include a study on the use of shredded newsprint as animal bedding, which has been jointly commissioned by National Newspapers of Ireland and my Department and is being finalised; and proposals being developed in co-operation with SIMI and farm plastics interests, respectively, in relation to car batteries and farm plastics.</P>
    <P>Since, 1989, a total of £2.2 million has been paid by my Department by way of 99 grants to 58 organisations involved in the recycling of a wide range of waste materials.  Grant assistance is directed primarily to support expenditure of a capital nature on recycling infrastructure and is not generally made available to support operational costs.  These grants will have an enhanced allocation of some £2 million this year.</P>

      <P>The amalgamation of the school referred to by the Deputy with a neighbouring school was considered in the past but efforts to secure unanimous agreement to such a development were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school on 30 September 1995 had fallen to four pupils.  Accordingly, my Department notified the school's management that grants would be withdrawn with effect from the end of the current school year. This is the normal course of action with schools of this size and is in accordance with the rules for national schools. Amalgamation was no longer considered appropriate as there were so few pupils involved.</P>
      <P>The normal criteria for school transport will apply to the pupils concerned in this case.  Eligibility will be determined by reference to distance to the nearest suitable school.

    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision in principle has been taken to extend maintenance grants to qualifying Irish students studying approved <Col N="2255" /> courses abroad with effect from the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>The detailed arrangements to give effect to this extension are being finalised in my Department at present. These arrangements involve the inclusion of the relevant courses abroad among the approved courses for the purposes of qualifying for receipt of a maintenance grant under the 1996 schemes of student support.  The specimen schemes, in accordance with practice in recent years, will issue to local authorities by early May.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking successful applicants for student grants apply for, and are provisionally awarded, their grants in advance of knowing which of the approved courses they will eventually pursue in order to qualify for grant payment. Such students, mature or otherwise, who subsequently pursue an approved course, which in the schemes of 1996 and subsequent years will include specified courses abroad, will qualify for payment of their grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167, 168, 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>A vocational education committee exercises its functions in a number of ways.  There are functions which it may perform at its own discretion through the powers given to it under the 1930 Act.  There are functions which it may perform within parameters laid down by the Minister.  Examples of such paramaters are the requirement to remain within annual approved budget, and to adhere to approved rates of pay, staff allocations, rates and conditions for travel and subsistence etc.  There are functions which a vocational education committee may perform only with the express approval of the Minister.  Raising of loans and purchase of property are examples of such functions.</P>
      <P>The auditing of vocational education committee's to ensure compliance with statutory and financial control procedures was the responsibility of the Local Government Auditor up to 31 December 1993.  From 1 January 1994 this responsibility has been transferred to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>Among the projects in which County Westmeath vocational education committee was involved without specific approval of the Department were:</P>
      <P>(a)The purchase of premises at Montbard, France.  The expenditure incurred by the vocational education committee on this project was £65,602.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" /> (b)The purchase of a property at Delvin for use as a Youthreach centre gave rise to expenditure of £30,000.</P>
    <P>(c)The purchase of a property in Ballynacargy for Youthreach purposes gave rise to expenditure of £9,000.</P>
    <P>(d)The hosting in Beaune, France of a conference related to the schools/industry links scheme. This conference was organised on a self-financing basis.  However, the net deficit on the conference was £15,000.</P>
    <P>(e)The provision of a computer course in conjunction with the National Rehabilitation Board over a three-year period.  The course qualified for EU funding of 55 per cent.  However, assuming a successful application for the maximum EU aid, balance of £99,378 was chargeable to the committee's account, which amount could not be met from within the approved allocation.</P>
    <P>(f)the operation of an arts resource centre which was not specifically approved by my Department and which was not funded within the annual approved non-pay budget.</P>
    <P>(g)The operation of an information technology centre without specific departmental approval, the cost of which could not be met from within the annual approved non-pay budget.</P>
    <P>(h)The continued incurring of expenditure on a school/industry links pilot project in 1994 despite the fact that the Petra Transnational Partnership Scheme under which the project was being funded ended in 1993.</P>
    <P>Final details of expenditure on the programmes referred to at (f), (g) and <Col N="2260" /> (h) are being sought from the acting chief executive officer of County Westmeath vocational education committee and will be made available to the Deputy shortly.</P>
    <P>Following the retirement of the former acting chief executive officer a new acting chief executive officer was appointed in June 1995.  Revised control systems and procedures are in place in the vocational education committee and I am satisfied that County Westmeath vocational education committee is operating efficiently and within authorised limits.</P>
    <P>The issues raised in the report of the inspector who was appointed to examine the management and operation of its financial scheme by County Westmeath vocational education committee have been addressed or are being addressed by the acting chief executive officer in co-operation with the Department.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has sought the observations of my Department in relation to a number of issues which he raised with the vocational education committee as a result of the audit of the 1994 accounts.  My Department is finalising its observations for the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to moneys allocated to County Westmeath and other vocational education committees is outlined on the following table for the years 1987-95.  Records prior to 1987 are not readily available in my Department.</P>
    <P>The financial position in County Westmeath vocational education committee for the years ended 31 December 1987 to 31 December 1994, as reported in the annual financial statements (V15s) of the vocational education committee, is also outlined.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the vocational education committee at 1 January would be similar to the position at 31 December of the previous year. The auditor expressed reservations in relation to some of the assets and also the comprehensiveness of the liabilities shown in the financial statements for <Col N="2261" /> each of the years 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993.  The audited financial statement for the year ended 31 December, 1994 has not yet been received in my Depart <Col N="2262" /> ment.  The position at 31 December 1995 is not yet available to my Department as the financial statement for that year has not yet been received.</P>

      <P>No funding was approved by the European Commission for a Eurotecnet project in Westmeath.</P>
      <P>The project in question was an element of a young workers innovation project operated by four vocational education committees, and was financed by the Department of Education.  The project was co-ordinated by the Department through the curriculum development unit of City of Dublin vocational education committee.  Grants totalling £29,000 were paid to County Westmeath in respect of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application was made to the European Commission for ESF support for the project, for a three year period starting in 1988, as an innovation project under Article 5 of the then ESF guidelines. Notification was received from the Commission in mid-1988 that the application was not approved for ESF aid. <Col N="2265" /> This was not uncommon at the time, given the volume of applications.  The participating vocational education committees were notified by the Department that the project would not be funded beyond the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>The Department in approving an allocation of funds for this project on 15 December 1987, attached a number of conditions in regard to the usage of the funds in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>A decision in principle has been taken to extend maintenance grants to qualifying Irish students studying approved courses abroad with effect from the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements to give effect to this extension are being finalised in my Department at present. These arrangements involve the inclusion of the relevant courses abroad among the approved courses for the purposes of qualifying for receipt of a maintenance grant under the 1996 schemes of student support.  The specimen schemes, in accordance with practice in recent years will issue to local authorities by early May.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking successful applicants for student grants apply for, and are provisionally awarded, their grants in advance of knowing which of the approved courses they will eventually pursue in order to qualify for grant payment. Such students who subsequently pursue an approved course, which in the schemes of 1996 and subsequent years will include specified courses abroad, will qualify for payment of their grants.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the usual funding procedures expenditure by local authorities on maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme in 1996 will not fall to be recouped by my Department until 1997.  The provision for maintenance grants for students studying abroad in 1996 under the vocational scholarship scheme is of the order of £54,000.</P>

    <P>When a single school development in Moate did not seem in prospect, the management authorities of the vocational and convent schools pursued a policy of co-operation between the schools.  In order to facilitate this co-operation an application for refurbishment and the provision of additional facilities was approved by my Department at a cost of £235,000.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, as the Deputy is aware, agreement was reached between the three school authorities to a single school development in the town. Officials from my Department are currently addressing the needs of this new community school.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 183, 184, 185 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>A key consideration in the selection of a location for the new community school in Moate was the precise extent, configuration and cost of the sites on offer to my Department.  Initially, my Department's approach was to ask the Mercy and Carmelite Orders for sites of similar size, so as to be able to make an accurate cost comparison.  Further discussions were held to determine the precise layout of the Carmelite site because the configuration of the original site being offered was not ideal for the development of a community school and ancillary facilities.  It was in the context of these discussions that the Carmelite Order decided to offer a site comprising approximately 20 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An ordnance survey map of the overall site was also requested but was not critical to deciding which site was the best location for the community school. I should also mention that a decision on the location had to be taken urgently as it was imperative that the new school commence operation in September 1996 and temporary additional accommodation has to be provided in the meantime. The Carmelite Order was as anxious as any other party involved that <Col N="2271" /> there be an early decision and at no stage was my Department asked to defer the decision pending the production of a map.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for officials from the planning section of my Department to meet with a deputation, to explain the decision, if such a meeting is required.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 202, 203, 204, 205 and 235 on 20 February 1996, in which I set out the background to the matter and the factors taken into account in arriving at a decision.  I wish to reiterate that all factors, including educational, logistical and cost were taken into account before I gave my decision that the community school should be provided on the Mercy and vocational education committee sites.  I should also mention that the combined Mercy and vocational site provides adequate space for the needs of the new school.</P>

      <P>Circular letter M10/94 sets out the circumstances in which certain pupils may be allowed to substitute any other subject, from the list of approved subjects, for Irish, in second-level schools.  These pupils include those who have a specific learning disability of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment <Col N="2272" /> in basic language skills in the mother tongue.</P>
      <P>School managements are authorised to grant exemptions from the study of Irish in accordance with prescribed procedures. These include a written application made by a parent or guardian to the principal of the school, the preparation of a written report on the student by the school authorities in consultation with relevant teachers and, in the case of an application for exemption on the grounds of specific learning disability, the provision of a report from a qualified psychologist.  Circular M10/94 sets out the criteria for determining whether a specific learning disability exists.  Guidelines for psychologists on assessment and reporting on this matter were issued to psychologists by my Department in March 1995.</P>
      <P>The decision to grant an exemption is made by the school authorities and is conveyed to the parent or guardian by way of a written certificate.</P>
      <P>A copy of this certificate is sent to the Department.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In 1995, I allocated £150,000 for a pilot scheme of grant-aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.  All applications for support under this scheme were carefully considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>It was decided that funding under the pilot phase of the scheme should be allocated as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to special schools for physically handicapped children in respect of their daily transport routes; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;to provide assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for the hearing-impaired and visually-impaired who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to fully evaluate the operation of the pilot phase before considering any modification or expansion of the scheme.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the case to which he refers will be given every consideration in the event of any further expansion of the scheme being undertaken.</P>

      <P>I would, however, refer the Deputy to the commitment in the Government policy agreement to reform the law relating to the administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the Committee on Fund-raising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes.  This report, known as the Costello report, included recommendations relating to the law on periodic lotteries.

Written submissions, which were invited following the seminar, have been examined.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána spouses and children's contributory pension scheme was introduced with effect from 23 July 1968 for members serving on or after that date.  Under the terms of the scheme there was provision for the payment of <i>ex gratia</i> pensions but only in respect of members of the force who had retired or died before 23 July 1968, i.e., the effective date of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The deceased member opted not to subscribe to the contributory scheme. On his death his widow qualified for what is referred to as an ordinary Garda widow's pension.  She had no entitlement, at that date, to a pension under the contributory scheme and was not covered by its <i>ex gratia</i> provisions.</P>
      <P>The latter scheme was subsequently revised in 1984 and at that stage serving and retired members or their widows were given an option to join the scheme with effect from 1 November 1984.  The widow concerned exercised this option and elected to meet her contribution liability by means of deferred payment of her contributory pension until 7 June 1986, from which date until the date of her death she was in receipt of both pensions.</P>

      <P>In February 1995 I approved a proposal from the Garda Commissioner to transfer the Garda Divisional Headquarters for the Louth-Meath Division from Dundalk to Drogheda.  A new Garda Station is being built in Drogheda at present as a divisional headquarters and it is proposed to proceed with the transfer to Drogheda in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the deployment of personnel and resources to individual areas.  They inform me that they are satisfied that the move is a necessary and logical administrative one.  I believe that the relocation of the divisional headquarters to Drogheda will have the advantage of placing it nearer to all major population centres within the division and this will enhance the effectiveness of policing in the division as a whole.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the move which is to take place will have no effect on policing in Dundalk, nor the Border area which it patrols.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Methadone is a synthetic heroin substitute prescribed as a means of replacing dependence on illegal drug taking.  It is used widely in detoxification of addicts <Col N="2289" /> and also on a long-term maintenance basis with addicts whose dependence is very advanced.</P>
      <P>Methadone maintenance is a recognised treatment strategy which is widely applied as a harm reduction mechanism for serious drug addicts.  International studies have shown that one of the beneficial consequences for individual offenders suffering from drug dependency who achieve stability through a course of methadone, has been to reduce their motivation to commit further crime in order to feed the habit. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the availability of maintenance plays a significant role in reducing the level of drug related crime in the wider community.  I am not aware of any Irish study in this respect but there is no reason to believe the crime reduction impact should be any less here.  In the light of my information about the positive impact of this treatment approach, I particularly welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Health of his plans for a major expansion in community based services, including methadone maintenance, for addicts.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparation for the new drug treatment programme, which is being put in place at Mountjoy Prison, an informal survey was carried out on the drug background of committals there over a four week period.  The data from this survey is still being collated. Preliminary indications are that a very small proportion, possibly less than five per cent, of committals questioned had previously availed of a course of methadone maintenance in the community. My policy will be to continue methadone maintenance in prison for addicts where the medical advice is that this is appropriate and to provide humane detoxification in all other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to sound a note of caution about methadone use.  Methadone is a toxic drug.  Its use on a long-term basis is not without side effects and is only appropriate where the medical advice is emphatic that it is appropriate.  Drug <Col N="2290" /> addicts have a tendency to top up medication with illegal drugs including heroin, with potential risk of a fatal outcome. For this reason, urine testing is crucial to ensure that the person under treatment is not abusing drugs.  Regular urine testing will be a strong feature of all prison based methadone treatment.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas.  They have informed me that the new Garda regions have been fully implemented and that the offices of the assistant commissioners to the new regions are fully operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new structure the State will be divided into six regions, each under the control of an assistant commissioner. This new structure will provide the Garda Síochána with a much greater operational focus in terms of its leadership and will provide for a much more co-ordinated and cohesive <Col N="2291" /> approach to tackling, on an operational basis, all facets of crime.  It will provide for an operational span of control which is wider than the present Garda division, yet more focused than the current centralised method of controlling cross-divisional operational matters from Garda headquarters in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides <Col N="2295" /> an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>Since it was introduced in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years. For example, in 1995 the weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse was increased to £150 a week and the scheme was further expanded with the inclusion of carers who look after the recipients of occupational pensions.  In last January's budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 which is an 8 per cent increase on the current rate.</P>
      <P>The question of further development of the carer's allowance, including the extension of the eligibility criteria, is currently being examined in conjunction with the Department of Health in the wider context of health care provision generally in the home.  Any proposals arising from that review would, of course, also have been considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, United States and Quebec, and is currently negotiating social security agreements with Switzerland and the United Kingdom (in respect of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man). The proposed agreement with the United Kingdom covers non-EU nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of bilateral social security agreements is to protect <Col N="2296" /> the social security (pension) rights of persons who work or have worked in both Ireland and the relevant country with whom the agreement is in force and who are, or have been subject to the social security legislation of both countries.</P>
    <P>It does this by allowing social insurance contributions paid in one country to be counted towards qualifying for certain payments in the other country.  The payments covered in this country are old age and retirement pensions, survivors and orphan's pension, invalidity pension and death grant.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the agreements it is possible to qualify for: an Irish payment based solely on Irish social insurance (PRSI) contributions or, an Irish payment based on a combination of Irish contributions and contributions paid in the other state.  If the other state does not have a social insurance system, residence there would count instead. The person concerned might also qualify on the same basis for a payment from the other state and which could be payable in addition to the Irish payment.</P>
    <P>Those in receipt of social security pensions from countries with which Ireland has bilateral social security agreements and who are living in Ireland, may qualify for the free schemes available under the Irish social security system subject to the normal qualifying conditions.</P>

      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme was a major success again last year and proved to be of significant benefit to local communities and voluntary groups.  Many valuable projects have been undertaken by students over <Col N="2297" /> the past three years which would otherwise not have been carried out and complimentary letters have been received praising both the scheme and the quality of work carried out by the students.  A survey of 500 sponsors and 400 students who participated in the 1995 scheme has endorsed the fact that both local communities and the students benefited significantly from the scheme.</P>
      <P>Because of the success of the scheme and in recognition of the valuable contribution made by third level students to their communities, I propose to continue with the scheme again this year.  A detailed evaluation of last year's scheme has been completed and based on the results of this evaluation, some minor changes will be introduced for this year's scheme.  Advertisements will be placed within the next week in the national papers inviting both sponsors and students to apply.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kerry cannot have his contributory old age pension calculated over a 17 year period rather that over a 30 year period in view of the fact that he paid no contributions between the years 1961 and 1973.</Quest>

      <P>Under the relevant legislation entitlement to contributory old age pension is calculated from the date a claimant first paid social insurance contributions or from 1953, whichever is the later, up to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned became insurably employed in 1961 and his pension entitlement must, therefore, be calculated over the 30 year period from 1961 to 1990.  The years between 1961 and 1973, when he has no contributions, cannot be ignored.  The records of the Department show that he had a total of <Col N="2298" /> 908 reckonable social insurance contributions in the 30-year period, which is equivalent to a yearly average of 30. Based on this average, he currently receives an old age contributory pension at the rate of £68.50 per week.  In order to qualify for the maximum rate of £72.80, he would need a yearly average of 48 contributions over that period.</P>

      <P>I have recently published the Social Welfare Bill 1996 which contains provisions for the introduction of the new one-parent family payment. This scheme represents a significant rationalisation of payments to lone parents, in that it will amalgamate the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit payments.  The new scheme will bring about full equality between men and women and will remove the concept of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; from the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1996 also contains provisions for a new method of assessment of capital in the case of the disability allowance which will replace disabled persons's maintenance allowance currently administered by the health boards, and the new one-parent family payment.  These provisions represent the first step in standardising the method of assessing capital across the various social assistance schemes so as to improve the equity of the system.  It is my intention to extend the standardised capital assessment to all other social assistance schemes over time as resources permit.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system is kept under continuous review and I would expect to introduce further rationalisation and streamlining in the future as the opportunities arise and resources allow.</P>

      <Quest>what plans, if any, he has to re-evaluate interest rates in order that they are more in conformity with what is happening on the ground in view of the Government's expectation that low interest rates will continue; his views on whether it is unfair that, in calculating means from investments and savings for social welfare payment purposes, any balance after the first £575 is assessed at ten per cent; his further views on whether it is hard, if not entirely impossible, for people with small savings to receive anything like that kind of interest at the current time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have.  Different methods of assessment are applied in the various social assistance schemes.  For example, in the case of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent.  In the case of old age pension, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent while recipients of lone parent's allowance and widow's (noncontributory) pension have an initial disregard of £200 plus £100 in respect of each dependent child and the balance is assessed at 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I intend, over time, to standardise the method of assessing capital across the various social assistance schemes so as to improve the equity of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have commenced this process in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996 which provides for a new method of assessing capital in the case of the new disability allowance which will replace disabled person's maintenance allowance currently <Col N="2300" /> administered by the health boards and the new one-parent family payment. The Bill provides that the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000 will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to extend these provisions to all other social assistance schemes over time.  In view of the large number of cases involved, this will have significant administrative implications and can only be achieved on a phased basis.</P>

      <P>Carer's allowance is a means-tested payment for people who live with and provide full-time care to elderly or incapacitated people.  Once the need for full-time care and attention is established the nature of the incapacity of the person being cared for does not affect the payment of the allowance.  To pay the allowance without a means test in the case of one particular group could not in my view be justified and I have no plans at the present time to remove the means test for recipients of the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department allocated an amount of £500,000 in 1995 and proposes a similar allocation for 1996 for the assistance of Irish emigrant welfare organisations in Britain.  The distribution of this assistance is made by me based upon the recommendations of the DÍON Committee &mdash; the advisory committee on the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain. These allocations provide financial assistance to organisations to employ professional workers to assist with the welfare problems of such emigrants.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, the British Government does not directly fund Irish emigrant welfare organisations in Britain.  However, financial assistance is available in certain circumstances from the local borough councils and health authorities there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no direct funding through my Department for pre-emigration advice and counselling groups in this country. The Deputies may wish to note, however, that FÁS has a statutory duty to provide pre-departure advice to persons intending to live and work abroad. FÁS implements this policy by the provision of pre-departure migration services which include individual advice and counselling to intending migrants. Information on employment opportunities and the living and working conditions in other EU member states is available to Irish job-seekers in all FÁS offices.  FÁS has trained Euroadvisors in each of its regions who, in addition to operating the EURES (European Employment Service) system, are responsible for the delivery of pre-migration advice.  Such advice is aimed <Col N="2303" /> towards discouraging unplanned and unprepared emigration.  In order to widen access to pre-departure migration advice, FÁS is currently activating local networks of statutory and voluntary sector information/advice providers.</P>
    <P>I would urge persons intending to live and work abroad to contact FÁS well in advance of their departure to ensure that they obtain the best possible advice and assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>The points raised by the Deputy in these questions involve matters which are for the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance as well as my own Department.  Following consultations with those Deparments I would like to respond as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recycling industry has certainly grown in importance in recent years. <Col N="2304" /> There are various initiatives in operation to support recycling activities.  The Minister for the Environment has operated a grant scheme to support recycling activities since 1989.  The grants support capital expenditure on systems for the collection and segregation of waste materials for reprocessing or re-use. This scheme is directed mainly at small-scale commercial and voluntary operators. The Waste Management Bill, which will shortly be enacted, will provide the Minister for the Environment with extensive powers to promote the prevention, recovery and safe disposal of waste.  The national recycling strategy, &ldquo;Recycling for Ireland&rdquo; published in 1994, has placed the promotion of recycling high on the Government agenda.  I understand that the Minister for the Environment will publish a review of the strategy in the near future to guide and give impetus to the full development of recycling in Ireland.  A welcome development in the recycling area is the recently launched REPAK scheme.  REPAK is a new organisation, which will be established, run and funded by industry to co-ordinate and finance the recycling/recovery of packaging waste.  REPAK has set itself a target recycling rate of 27 per cent for packaging waste to be achieved by 2001. I understand that the funds collected will be used in REPAK to contract out the collection, sorting and recycling of packaging waste.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion to extend the business expansion scheme (BES) to the recycling industry, the Deputy will be aware the BES scheme was due to terminate during 1996 but, after a review of its operation and performance in 1995, the Minister for Finance announced in the recent budget that it would be renewed.  The BES has traditionally been targeted on the manufacturing sector since this is regarded as the riskiest area of economic activity offering the highest potential jobs return.  Accordingly, if an activity qualifies as a 10 per cent manufacturing industry then it is generally within the scope of the BES.  Given the cost of the <Col N="2305" /> BES to the Exchequer, any extensions to the scheme, to include industries other than manufacturing industries, have to be considered in the context of the existing costs and the need to ensure at all times that Exchequer resources, particularly tax reliefs, are targeted on those areas that offer the highest likely return in terms of the costs of the relief involved and overall economic objectives.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion to extend Forbairt support to the recycling industry, the Deputy will be aware that Forbairt only provides financial assistance to developments which are based on the use of waste as a raw material, and which are used to produce products in a traded sector.  Projects must satisfy normal commercial criteria and they are considered on their merit by Forbairt on a case by case basis.  Forbairt also provides assistance under the feasibility study grants programme to assist companies to investigate market opportunities for recycled products.</P>
    <P>In addition, financial assistance to support waste recovery, waste recycling and the development of waste infrastructure will be available under the Solid Waste Management Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 which will be administered by the Department of the Environment.  The Minister for the Environment, will I understand, shortly be in a position to announce details of this scheme.</P>

      <P>My plans for 1996 are that the local employment service should be established and consolidated in 14 key areas. These consist of the 12 original partnership areas and two non-partnership areas, Clare and Kildare.  I believe it is preferable to assess the progress of these 14 areas before extending the service countrywide.  What we learn about the current phase will be of benefit to other areas in establishing the service in the future.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the special circumstances in the Clondalkin area, in particular the relationship to the Tallaght partnership and the operation of the FÁS pilot employment action centre.  I am currently considering how best the Clondalkin partnership can be accommodated in the establishment of the current phase of the local employment service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that matters relating to project applications to a city or county enterprise board fall within the day-to-day responsibility of the enterprise board concerned and are not a matter in which I have any direct function.</P>
      <P>It is not in any event possible to quantify the precise number of projects which have been refused by the four CEBs in the city and county of Cork since their establishment.  Very many applications are received by each board, some of which are considered eligible for support by CEB's in general and others of which are refused because the project is not considered by the board in question to be worthwhile or viable proposal.  According to figures supplied by each of the four Cork boards, the number of jobs created in CEB-assisted enterprises in the city and county from the date of establishment of the CEBs to the end of December 1995 was as follows; Cork city EB 110 jobs (full-time), Cork north CEB 103 (full-time), south Cork EB 200 (full-time) and Cork west CEB 134 (full-time) and nine (part-time).</P>
      <P>Of the 450-plus projects approved by the four Cork CEBs to date and subsequently established, figures returned by the boards concerned indicate that a very small number &mdash; nine &mdash; have failed.  This is hopefully a reflection of the quality of the projects coming before the boards and the thoroughness with which the evaluation committees and the members of the Cork boards have carried out their functions.  It has to be said, however, that it is very early days to be assessing the long-term sustainability of these projects.</P>

    <P>The total proposed investment in all the Cork projects approved up to the <Col N="2309" /> end of December 1995 amounted to £8,329,991, according to figures supplied by the four boards.  It is not possible to quantify the total investment in each individual project for reasons of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that in referring to the number of posts, the Deputy is referring to the number of employees in the four Cork boards.  Each of the boards employs three staff.</P>

As such their pay and conditions of employment are matters for negotiation between the supervisor concerned, his or her union and the relevant sponsor.

The benefit to the economy of these plants is substantial, especially in terms of the provision of well-paid skilled and third level employment and tax revenue to the Exchequer.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the problems posed by horses in urban areas and, following examination of the issue by a consultative group from the Departments of Justice, Environment and my own Department, the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation and South Dublin County Council, I proposed a general scheme of <Col N="2313" /> a Bill to deal with the matter.  The general scheme, which was approved by the Government in December 1995, makes provision for local authorities to licence horses and that horses be identified, registered and kept under control.  Provision is also made for seizure and detention of stray horses, for the recovery of costs and penalties for breaches of the legislation.  The text of the Bill is currently being drafted.  I have referred the matter to the Dáil Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, which will examine the proposals on 17 April.  I intend to have the Bill published as soon as possible after that.</P>

      <P>The circular letter and form pertaining to the area aid replacement forms was dated 25 January 1996 and issued on 26 January to 2,489 1995 livestock aid applicants identified by my Department as having submitted a permanent grassland area aid application form in 1994 but not in 1995.</P>
      <P>The issuing of these letters was accompanied by a widespread information campaign in the farming media to ensure that herdowners would reply to the letter in good time.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the issue of the letter, a small number of herdowners contacted my Department to say they had not received a copy of it.  They were sent the same letter and form which had issued on 26 January bearing the original 25 January date.</P>
      <P>The task of completing the form accompanying the letter was quite simple with three &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; questions to be answered before the form was to be signed and returned to the area aid unit in the envelope provided.  In view of this, I cannot accept that an extension to the period initially allowed for return of the forms is warranted.  It should be noted that the usual twenty days' period of grace for acceptance of late applications applies in this case and runs from 24 February 1996 to 14 March 1996 (subject to 1 per cent penalty for each working day the application is received after 23 February).</P>

      <P>It was a condition of the 1992 ewe premium scheme that applicants keep on their holding for 100 days from 7 March 1992 to 14 June 1992 the number of sheep on which they <Col N="2316" /> applied for premium.  Following two inspections of the flock of the person named, on 26 May 1992 and 5 June 1992, he was deemed to have been in breach of the requirement to maintain all the sheep on which he applied for premium for the 100 day retention period. Of the 400 sheep applied on only 295 were presented at the inspection on 26 May 1992.  At the inspection on 5 June 1992 151 sheep were presented but the brands on these sheep were fresh and the inspecting officers were not satisfied that the sheep in question formed part of the original flock.</P>
      <P>The person named would have been aware of the difficulties with his application following these two inspections. He was also informed verbally of the decision to withhold payment on 12 November 1992 and again on 21 December 1992 and was also given the reasons for that decision.</P>
      <P>This case was the subject of a parliamentary question on 2 March 1993 and of various representations in 1993 and 1994.  The person named was also written to on 27 July 1994 concerning the non-payment of the 1992 ewe premium.</P>
      <P>The position in 1992 was that an informal appeals procedure was in place whereby an applicant who was dissatisfied with a decision in relation to headage or premia grants could appeal that decision to the Department.  The person named made verbal representations to both his local office and to the offices of my Department in Castlebar. The decision to withhold payment of his 1992 ewe premium was maintained.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that towards the end of 1995 I put in place a new headage and premia appeals unit in my Department.  That unit operates independently of the staff involved in implementing the schemes and the appeals process includes the right to an oral hearing.</P>

      <Quest>the reason an application has not been made under the terms of section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990, to the High Court, seeking the disqualification of the directors and senior management in 1990 and 1991 of the Goodman group of companies from acting as directors or managers of any company in this State; and if he will have arrangements made to have the necessary application made in view of the policies and activities of that group of companies as outlined in the beef tribunal report.</Quest>

      <P>There are several circumstances in which an application under section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990, for the disqualification of persons from acting as directors, auditors or from managing companies can be made.  The only circumstance in which I as Minister could make such an application would be as a creditor of the particular company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of now it has not been established on a legal basis that I am a creditor of <Col N="2319" /> the Goodman group of companies but I have sought legal advice as to the options open to me under this Act. Where I have sought specific recoveries in the case of Rathkeale and Shannon Meats, the group is contesting the extent of the proposed recoveries and in the case of Rathkeale proceedings have been issued, and will be issued shortly in the other case.</P>
    <P>On 18 October 1995, I wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions referring to section 160 and the possibility of his taking action against those who may have abused the beef intervention system on the basis of the report of the beef tribunal.</P>
    <P>I was informed by the Director of Public Prosecutions that any application by him under section 160 would have to be grounded on evidence and that no such evidence was available to him at the time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.</P>
      <P>The question of research into animal welfare is a matter for Teagasc, which keeps abreast of international developments in the matter.  A study of group versus individual penning of sows was carried out by that body over ten years ago and published in <i>Annales de Recherches Veterinaires</i> (Vol. 15, p. 1881).  At present a specific project relating to the effects of flooring materials on the health and welfare of sows and piglets is under research by Teagasc, with financial assistance from the EU Structural Fund.  Furthermore, an officer of Teagasc is a member of the Animal Welfare Section of the EU Scientific Veterinary Committee which furnishes advice to the EU Commission on welfare matters.  I have no plans to expand this level of activity in relation to welfare.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of sow numbers on the lines requested is not readily available. Of the total population of 158,000 sows in the State, it is estimated that some 85 per cent are in tethered systems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.  The Deputy will appreciate that over the years my Department would have received numerous requests, applications and general inquiries about the licensing of TV re-transmission systems.</P>
      <P>I can say that since the commencement of proceedings against me in 1994 in the case referred to by the Deputy I have received about a dozen inquiries regarding licences for this type of system in different parts of the country.  All these have been either responded to or will be responded to shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My position following the court judgment in that case is that I must consider anew the application by <Col N="2323" /> Southcoast for a licence to provide their services in the UHF band.  It is important to note that the court judgment in this regard was in respect of the plaintiff company only.  I will have to consider the implications for other parts of the country as part of this process.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of that assessment there are no plans to issue any licences to operate within the UHF band and, therefore, I do not see any useful purpose being served by communicating again with anyone who might previously have sought permission to operate in the band.</P>

      <P>To date no grant aid has been provided to Donegal County Council under the Coastal Protection Sub-Programme of the Environmental Services Operational Programme 1994-99.

In these circumstances the coastal local authorities have been advised that it will not be possible to aid all of the priority proposals submitted.</P>

All locations identified by the local authorities, including Donegal County Council, will be considered over the period of the operational programme.  The fact that no works have been aided so far in <Col N="2324" /> County Donegal does not mean that works will not be aided between now and 1999.</P>

It is envisaged that a full report into this accident will be completed within the next three months.  It is my intention that a report will be published, subject to legal considerations, in due course.
