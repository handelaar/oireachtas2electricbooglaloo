      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was the right decision.  While it is understandable that 500 soldiers are being brought back to Northern Ireland, it is regrettable at a time when troops had been withdrawn <Col N="1506" /> to barracks and sent back to Britain.  It is ironic that those who wished to see the British Army out of Ireland have succeeded in bringing them back in greater numbers.  Will the Taoiseach say if a date has been set for the meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister?</P>

      <P>Earlier in the week the NESC issued a report on job-sharing which, according to the media, has the Government's full support.  Will legislation be introduced on job-sharing? Does it make sense for the Government to be seen to support job-sharing while in its Departments it is doing everything possible to block and obstruct applications even where the full criteria are met?</P>

    <Title>Northern Ireland Peace Process: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I paid tribute to the Nationalist politicians in the North, those occupying the middle ground there and to the consensus in this House.  I asked if it was possible to analyse what the parties hoped to gain from the peace process.  It would be simple to do.  I may be naive, but I would like straight answers to basic questions. Such an analysis and explanation would be helpful to let us know what the IRA and Sinn Féin expect?  Surely they do not expect a 32-county Ireland &mdash; none of us expect it immediately.  It is an aspiration for us all but achievable only with the agreement of the majority in the North.  I paid tribute to John Hume, among others.  What will happen when John Hume and his like retire from politics? Those people have gone through hell and high water for 25 years.  What will happen when such magnificent leadership goes?  The lack of such leadership could leave a great vacuum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a point which may be a little delicate for the British but we cannot afford to be too sensitive on such issues.  The British Government's representative in Northern Ireland is the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There have been good, bad and indifferent Secretaries of State.  One of John Major's most serious mistakes was to replace Peter Brooke as Secretary of <Col N="1512" /> State for Northern Ireland.  Peter Brooke appeared initially to many of us to be a &ldquo;fuddy-duddy&rdquo;.  However, he was appreciated and recognised ultimately as the most outstanding Secretary of State for Northern Ireland since 1972-73.  His removal caused great problems; it was an unwise decision.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brooke was replaced by Sir Patrick Mayhew who would be regarded by many as being on the right wing of the Conservative Party.  His attitude and sympathy towards the Unionist cause was not helpful before and during the peace process.  The British Government has much to answer for with regard to the breakdown of the ceasefire through its appointments and by listening to Unionist die-hards who have no intention of compromising.  Their ambition is to see the IRA surrender and the restoration of Stormont.  That is how I read it. If any person has seen anything else in print or heard anything else on radio or television which suggests otherwise, I would like to hear it.  If the peace process is to succeed, there must be compromise and people must be prepared to stand up to those who have taken entrenched positions.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have never given an inch to the IRA in its murderous and ruthless campaign.  There has been no similar activity on the other side.  There must be give and take between the two sides and they must come together, but this is not happening.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the British Prime Minister, who has dismissed the Mitchell report, has been promoting the idea of an election, I presume along the lines of the Sunningdale Agreement.  That would not create any difficulties for me because it worked well until it was brought down by the Unionists by their militant strike.  The British Government under Sir Harold Wilson should not have caved in.  This was a typical example of the way the British Government gave way to the Unionists and it set us back 20 years.</P>
    <P>I can see the problem of the SDLP and that of other middle ground parties, <Col N="1513" /> such as the Alliance Party.  An election would only polarise the two communities in the North with the extremists doing well and the moderates suffering. This would not be of any help and would lead to people taking up entrenched positions.</P>
    <P>Last night I praised Gerry Adams and make no apology for doing so.  Like John Hume, he has played a major role in the peace process to date.  It has been clearly illustrated in the past six days that he was not aware of the IRA's proposal to resume military operations. This defeats the idea promoted by the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that the IRA and Sinn Féin are synonymous, although they are linked.</P>
    <P>Mr. Adams has played a pivotal role. His high international profile has aroused tremendous jealousy within the Unionist community whose politicians have shown no ability to compromise, rather they appear to be competing with one another to see which one of them can be more insulting to individuals within the Government and politicians in general in this State.</P>
    <P>We must recognise those who have made a generous contribution, in the process putting their own lives at risk. There are elements within the Nationalist community and the IRA who would like to get rid of those who are seen to be moderate, such as Mr. Adams, who has been shown to be so during the past 16 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>We should expose the bigots for what they are.  Invariably, bigotry and intransigence are all I have seen from people such as Mr. Trimble, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Paisley.  Their policy is no surrender, no compromise and not an inch. We cannot hope to succeed with such an attitude.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have been very much to blame for not taking on the British Government on certain civil rights issues.  The British Government has shown a degree of vindictiveness which is unacceptable.  I clearly heard the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs say some months before <Col N="1514" /> Christmas that the attitude of the British authorities towards IRA or republican prisoners in British jails hardened following the announcement of the ceasefire and the initiation of the peace process.  To add to the suffering of republican prisoners even though they had committed atrocious crimes and already suffering under a tough regime &mdash; one cannot blame the authorities for placing them in top security prisons &mdash; was at variance with the spirit of the peace process.</P>
    <P>If the British Government continues to be intransigent and support the hard-line attitude adopted by the Unionists, the Government should at every opportunity bring the matter to the European Court of Human Rights.  What did we do for the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family who were treated outrageously by the supposedly fair-minded British system of justice?  They were treated abominably and we did nothing to defend or vindicate their rights.  Whenever there is a breach of human rights it should not be left to the families concerned or small groups to fight the case.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to ensure that Irish people, from north or south of the Border, are treated properly and not victimised. By insisting on the protection of civil rights and the introduction of anti-discrimination measures Irish people have drawn a reaction from the British Government which borders on hysteria. It sees itself as having been humiliated in the eyes of the world and its reaction has not been to seek reconciliation, but to show vindictiveness.  It may appear that I am adopting a hard-line, but to get justice you must stand on your own two feet, be fair and firm and make no apology for doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully endorse the sentiments of Deputy Deasy.  While the process has run into difficulty, if people continue to be reminded of that set of principles it will succeed, although there are times when one has to be firm tough and critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies I met in the corridors <Col N="1515" /> of Leinster House in the past few days indicated it was unfortunate that no notice was given.  Those who have been following the peace process during the past six months were not surprised when it came under pressure.  Each time Sinn Féin mentioned this it was accused of threatening violence and using blackmail tactics.  It was also accused when something did happen.  This goes to show that politicians seldom win.  If we make a courageous decision and it succeeds we may get a little thanks, otherwise we are criticised.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this debate is taking place.  This House unanimously endorsed the Downing Street Declaration, the Framework Document and the statements on the cessation of violence and, perhaps, it should carry out an audit every three months on the progress or otherwise of such matters.  The Framework Document appears to have been buried since its publication last February, it has not been heard of since. People North, South and elsewhere, are asking what happened, why the peace process went wrong and how can it be put back together again.  This debate must address those questions and come up with answers.</P>
    <P>This is not a party political issue, it is a national one.  Consequently, there are political brownie points only for those who fully support the peace process, which all Members do.  My party expressed its support for the process on a number of occasions.  Earlier this week Deputy Bertie Ahern said he would not criticise the Government for moving forward in a positive way and doing whatever needs be done.  He said Government members would not have to look over their shoulders as far as he was concerned.</P>
    <P>We are all travelling in the same direction on a journey for justice and following a path to peace.  Suggestions and contributions designed only to be helpful to the achievement of the final objectives of the peace process should never be criticised, irrespective of their <Col N="1516" /> origin.  All Members subscribe to the objective of peace, though there are elements elsewhere who do not want to bring about peace and maintain it, but that will not be easy.  The physical force tradition has never been converted in the history of the State nor has the wider republican-Nationalist family ever been brought together with one objective in mind, to achieve consensus on peace.</P>
    <P>When people talk of a pan-Nationalist consensus they fail to understand what we are following through on. Peace is the first objective, talks will follow and that will take some time.  What broke down along the way?  During the past 17 months all people on the island enjoyed the benefits of peace.  Based on past averages, approximately 140 more people would have been killed and hundreds, if not thousands, maimed or injured in Northern Ireland if the troubles had continued.  Many more have been spared all types of injury and have begun to taste what peace can mean to the lives of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Peace made people sit up and think about the black hole to which they were consigned for 25 years.  Any one who suggests that there was not peace should ask those on the Shankill Road, the Falls Road or the Ardoyne area whether their lives changed in the past 17 months.  Their answers will be direct. A few days ago on a radio programme Joe Duffy telephoned a man from the Shankill Road and asked him for his feelings on what happened.  His answer was simple, he welcomed the peace process and the ceasefire and said people were told 18 months ago that talks would take place in the following three or four months.  He wondered why those talks did not take place.  He said the people wanted talks and they should have taken place 15 months ago.  He could not understand what politicians were doing for the past 15 months and made a request to them to get down to business and listen to those whom they represent who do not want a return to violence.  They want the peace to last and politicians, irrespective of how <Col N="1517" /> many, to sit down and talk, but not undermine the continuance of the peace process.  A short time after the ceasefire people began to take peace for granted and they will not let it go easily at this stage.  Much as I condemn the bombing in London last Friday, I do not regard the process as a failure.</P>
    <P>It was with the Irish Government I led, not the British Government, that the Provisional IRA made a peace accord in August 1994.  Whatever legitimate criticisms can be made, the record will show that we fulfilled to the best of our ability the obligations on the Irish Government to the Nationalist and republican communities in the North and sought by and large to act in concert with them.  As the person who sealed the peace accord with Gerry Adams and John Hume on 6 September 1994 in Government Buildings I was naturally anxious, and indeed entitled, to meet Gerry Adams and hear him explain why the peace accord had been broken and why those who had taken risks had been let down.  I wanted to hear that from him.  When I asked him if the bombing in London was the appropriate response to delays, frustrations and so on his reply was unequivocal.  He said it would not be his choice or the choice of his party.  That is the answer I expected from him.  It is easy to criticise people who do not know what others, whether John Hume or Gerry Adams, have gone through.  How long will it take Northern society to produce another John Hume or Gerry Adams if we do not make full use of what they can contribute at this stage?</P>
    <P>John Hume spent half of his life trying to bring peace to Northern society. Gerry Adams has been working behind the scenes for a long time to try to win the argument to leave behind the physical force tradition, to produce an alternative strategy and to show that the 25 years of violence was futile.  The bombing in London last Friday was similarly futile.  It was not only politically silly and stupid but there was no morality attached to it.  One cannot justify the taking away of innocent human life as a <Col N="1518" /> response to what should have happened but did not.</P>
    <P>A recent statement from UVF prisoners called on the Unionist people not to support those in Unionist leadership who gloated over the deaths of two British citizens.  I am sure all Members felt as sick as I when they witnessed the body language and the facial expressions following the death of two innocent British citizens.  Nobody is entitled to take human life.  It is the saving of human life that is at stake, not political requirements.</P>
    <P>We delivered as far as possible during our time in Government.  People are asking why the ceasefire broke down. They can make their own judgments on what went wrong, but it was inevitable that the activities or non-activities of the past nine months would bring pressure within the republican movement on those who reluctantly went along with a decision to choose the political route on the road to democracy.  That was bound to happen.</P>
    <P>We are all political realists in this House.  We can understand that when John Major got into trouble and his leadership was undermined, he needed time and space to work out his position. We also recognise that the Unionists were heading into a leadership contest with four candidates in the field, each trying to be more hard-line than the other to secure the leadership.  We recognised that for what it was, but it was reasonable to expect that when John Major's position was consolidated, and the Unionist leadership contest was out of the way, things would start to happen.  Unfortunately, the process went into reverse.</P>
    <P>Some people high up in the Tory Party foolishly advised John Major that the ceasefire would hold, that the IRA would not or could not return to violence and that he need not do anything, but he did worse than doing nothing.  He used the decommissioning issue as a delaying tactic.  Everybody associated with the Downing Street Declaration knows decomissioning was not a precondition. The Northern Ireland Office <Col N="1519" /> accepted on 24 June last year that it was not a precondition before the ceasefires, and in this House the Taoiseach, reporting on his first meeting with John Major, said it was not the policy of the Irish or the British Government to have decommissioning as a precondition to talks.</P>
    <P>Those who study and understand the psychology of what we had to deal with will understand that we faced difficulties not only with the IRA but also in the trenchant opposition of the loyalist paramilitaries.  People did not seem to understand that this would be the biggest contributing factor to wrecking the peace process.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Dimbleby programme a few days ago a loyalist paramilitary told how he carried his injured wife from a building that had been bombed by the IRA, yet he was man enough to tell John Taylor, who was also on the programme to get on with talks and put the issue of decommissioning on the back boiler or else it would wreck the peace process.  We all know what decommissioning represented to both sides.  The prospect of decommissioning aroused fear on the Unionist side among loyalist paramilitaries, and on the Nationalist side among the IRA.  How were we to square those two circles?  Did anybody stand back from this issue and ask why both sides were against it?  It was neither acceptable nor obainable at that time. Many spokespersons in the South, including me, frequently pointed that out and that if the peace process was not fed, it would starve and when something drastic happened, we would all sit back and ask how it happened and why we did not see it coming and why we did not do something about it.  Everybody was cosy in their own positions.  They all thought the ceasefire would hold, not recognising the tensions that had existed for years between those in the republican movement who wanted to go the political route and those who wanted to carry on the physical force tradition. Whatever those of the physical force <Col N="1520" /> tradition may think about the success of the operation last Friday, it certainly played into the hands of the people who gloated afterwards and said, &ldquo;we told you so&rdquo;.  This country is full of hindsight decision-makers and cynics, but nobody should put any priority before that of saving human life.  Archbishop Robin Eames said to me in my office that the greatest personal satisfaction for anybody in political life should be to be in a position to contribute to saving human life.</P>
    <P>People wrote to me and spoke to me on the streets of Northern Ireland, Dublin and elsewhere and asked me how I could support a policy of releasing people from prison sooner than they should be released.  There is an analogy between that argument and what happened last Friday.  I could only tell them that nobody can change what happened yesterday and that no matter what I or anybody says or does, in Government or elsewhere, it will not restore the life of a father, mother, brother, sister or other relation lost but that if we can bring ourselves to change our mindset, we can ensure that in future no family loses its father, mother, brother or sister.  The same applies to where we go from here after the events of last Friday.</P>
    <P>Many people can give reasons for the breakdown of the ceasefire.  It has happened, can we learn from the problems that occurred in former Yugoslavia, Bosnia or South Africa when difficulties arose in the peace process as in those countries?  When difficulties arose, all political and community leaders intensified their efforts to ensure there would not be a further breakdown.</P>
    <P>Early on in the peace process the Government faced that dilemma and a difficult choice had to be made, but it made that decision on its best judgment. Nobody would deny a Government, British or Irish, the right and the responsibility to protect its citizens as its first priority.  I do not subscribe to the view that paramilitary organisations can ever defeat a Government.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the peace process was up and running, we had a raid on a post <Col N="1521" /> office in Newry during which a postman was tragically shot.  That was a difficult call for our Government.  My colleagues in Government, who were aware how tough I had been at different stages with the republican movement, knew it was not easy for me to send for Gerry Adams to hear from him the reason the peace process had gone off the rails so soon.  When I heard his explanations about discipline not being imposed in various units, I made it quite clear that if we had a repeat of such violence, I would not listen to that excuse again and the door would not be open to him to explain what had occurred, recognising that in managing organisations and units whose mindsets have been closed for the past 25 years and who followed only the physical force tradition, difficulties will inevitably arise.</P>
    <P>We cannot throw away the success we have achieved.  We cannot waste the great historic opportunity being handed to us.  Physical force has been our tradition for centuries but, if we keep our nerve, we now have an historic opportunity to leave that behind us.  I made it clear to Gerry Adams that I wanted him to tell the IRA that I felt as let down as everybody else and that I did not relish the idea of hearing on a foreign television station about a bomb blast in London.  It was politically stupid and totally morally wrong.  One cannot excuse taking human life, whatever the cost.</P>
    <P>For people, particularly those with militant minds in the IRA, to regard the efforts and the successes of people like Gerry Adams and his colleagues as a failure, is nonsense.  They have made remarkable strides in promoting the republican and the Nationalist cause. Their honourable efforts should not be regarded as a failure.  The Sinn Féin leadership has brought the republican community in the North into the political mainstream for the first time.  It gave dignity to the communities it represented. Its achievement was recognised and respected throughout the world.  It helped to forge as powerful a political instrument for change as any in <Col N="1522" /> our history, that is the Nationalist consensus for peace.  They won powerful friends in the United States, including President Clinton.  All this is now in danger of being lost.  I want to send a clear message to those in the militant wing of the IRA that there is no cause greater in any society than peace and the sooner it recognises this the better.</P>
    <P>We needed people like Gerry Adams, Pat Doherty, Martin McGuinness, Rita O'Hare, Mitchel McLaughlin, Tom Hartley and their colleagues to get to where we were.  We need them now and we will need them again if we want to get to where the people on the street want us to be.  The peace process does not belong to any individual, Government or party.  It belongs to the people who have a very clear message for the politicians.  To them the issue was simple &mdash; the violence had to stop and it had to be replaced by talks.  Up to last Friday the violence had stopped for almost 18 months but we are now as far away from the talks as we were before we started.</P>
    <P>There are four proposals on the table and the Governments must sit down and work them out.  Under the Downing Street Declaration &mdash; at times one wonders if Britain would like to discard this document and the Framework Document &mdash; both Governments have solemnly declared they will set a definite date for all-party talks.  This is what is required to bring about a rapid restoration of the peace process.  We all subscribe to the Taoiseach's call to the IRA to stop the violence, hand up their arms and come into the political process. That call has been made repeatedly since the troubles broke out in 1969 and it has never been answered.  That is why we need the people who had the influence to bring the process this far.  Some of these people openly admit that over the past four or five months they have been losing the argument within the republican movement because of non-political activity.</P>
    <P>I said on many occasions that if the peace process was not fed the pressures would return to undermine it.  I am not <Col N="1523" /> going to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; because as a politician I recognise that at times certain situations cannot be resolved. However, I do not accept that there were not issues and policies which could have been dealt with.  For example, the British Government's policy in regard to prisoners hardened after the ceasefire and no care was shown for prisoners, although we all know the great influence they had in bringing about the ceasefire.  Yet they got a rougher deal after the ceasefire than before it.  What is the mentality of a government which refuses to give medical care to a man who has been diagnosed with cancer? Why did it take a consultant from Canada to point out that if he was not looked after he could die before action was taken?  I hope this man receives care in time.  What effect did this have on the people who spent 25 years cocooned in a military mind-set and who always believed that the only way one could get anything from Britain was through the barrel of a gun?  In addition, one obstacle after another was put in the way.</P>
    <P>What is wrong is that too few people understand the mind-sets with which we must deal.  I have given illustrations of the mind-sets of the IRA and the leaders who are in favour of physical force.  I also looked at the mind-sets of the loyalist paramilitaries who made the exact same points as republican paramilitaries about the British Government's prison policy &mdash; they did not get a hearing either.  They will say why they do not trust the British Government.  It is common-sense to sit down with people and to try to work out a new accommodation.  If one does this they will outline their principles and what they stand for.  As they told me in recent days, the bombing of London will not go unreplied to if it is repeated.  Good people on that side are holding the lid on it but they say a bomb in London is an attack on their British ethos and is the same as if it was planted in Belfast. Those are the sort of dangers which <Col N="1524" /> must be averted.  &ldquo;Must&rdquo; is a great master as it has to be done, and we all know what has to be done.</P>
    <P>I spent hours working out their mind-set and they can sit down and work out in a practical way a new accommodation which will enable people to live together.  They say that when a Catholic looks across a wall or down the road at a Protestant they do not see him as a problem but as a victory to be achieved. The Nationalist community say:</P>
    <P>Be very careful about decommissioning. We have been exposed too often.  It is easy for people to lecture us from abroad but we have spent 25 years trying to defend ourselves when we were burned out.  If you visit Bombay Street or any other small street you will see bullet holes in the walls over children's cots.  Until there is confidence in the process watch what you are doing.</P>
    <P>These are not the views of militant people who advocate taking a person's life.</P>
    <P>These are the mind-sets which have to be changed and Senator George Mitchell put his finger on this faster than anybody I know.  He made two statements, the first was about the decommissioning of arms &mdash; the British Government did not want to accept this &mdash; and the second related to the decommissioning of mind-sets.  A spokesperson for the loyalist paramilitaries recently said to me that the Mitchell report would be extremely difficult for Sinn Féin and the IRA to accept and deliver on and equally difficult for the loyalist paramilitaries to accept but that if everyone had rowed in behind it it would have been a blueprint for the end of the war for all time.</P>
    <P>That opportunity was thrown aside when the British Prime Minister sidelined the excellent report and replaced it with full support for a Unionist proposal. What effect was this expected to have on the mind-sets of people who do not see things as we see them?  It was the straw which broke the camel's back. The decision to back a Unionist proposal to the exclusion of the Irish Government which was a partner with <Col N="1525" /> it in peace was the clearest indication yet that Britain was going back to where it had come from, that is to seek a military solution.  Having regard to the decision to send more troops to the North, I hope the British Government does not expect the Irish Government to be partners at war.  The mentality and mind-sets to which George Mitchell referred have also to be changed in Britain.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the British Government sought, and still seek, a military solution although we all know that violence has not paid on either side over the past 25 years.  How many times did we hear it said that the IRA is finished and gone for all time?  It was this challenge which goaded it into proving it was still in existence.  The Mitchell report was a blueprint for the end of the war and no three people grasped the complexities of the problem faster than the men given that responsibility.  I am not pointing a finger in any direction but I want a commitment to a date for all-party talks so that we can get back to where we were.  Some members of the IRA Army Council have not fully appreciated the progress that has been made by the people I mentioned earlier. I too worked with John Major, and I praised him on many occasions.  I will be fair to everybody.  He had conviction and courage.  On the first night we sat down he said that he and I together would never condemn society in Northern Ireland to another 25 years of violence and that we would do whatever we had to do to avoid that.  I say to him today: &ldquo;you know what you have to do; go and do it&rdquo;.  I believe he will get a far better response from the British if he does it than if he does not, because British people equally have an interest in peace.  Would anybody seriously suggest that people in east London want to see another bomb there, in Warrington or Guildford or anywhere?  Of course they do not.  However, we all know the reality of politics.</P>
    <P>We are entering the last year before an election.  Somebody suggested to me on the day before John Major spoke in the House of Commons that there was a grave likelihood that the 11 Unionists <Col N="1526" /> and the 30 Euro sceptics, the right wingers, the hard-liners, would have to be kept on board, because they, not the Unionists, were the greatest danger to the continuance of the Government. Gordon Browne, the shadow Chancellor, more or less confirmed to me a couple of weeks ago in Dublin that there was a real danger that John Major would throw the Mitchell report back at the Americans to satisfy 30 of the hard-line members of parliament from his own party because they would love to hear the British Prime Minister tell the Americans that this was their business, that they make their decisions, and that the Americans should stay out of it.</P>
    <P>If such political considerations are to determine the future of the peace process, there is greater need for all of us to speak with one voice.  We have won respect around the world for our peace process.  I do not expect anybody to accept my assessment of why it broke down.  People can make up their own minds on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The time allowed is exhausted, but I am sure the House would want to hear out the former Taoiseach.  Is the House agreed on that?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It was bound to undermine confidence when things that could be done were not done, and that is what happened.  We had problems before &mdash; on the questions of clarification, permanence, etc.  Then we came to the question of decommissioning and, unfortunately, that was allowed to take root, and it did much to undermine confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the British Government took its unilateral decision to announce an electoral process with no guarantees that it would lead to talks.  It could well be said &mdash;and the small parties in the North say &mdash;that it could be a recipe to put them out of business because they are an embarrassment to official Unionism. What is happening is a struggle for the <Col N="1527" /> soul of official Unionism and that is why David Trimble was elected; they want to win back what Dr. Ian Paisley won from them.</P>
    <P>Dr. Paisley has threatened to march and fight for the cause and never let the Union be broken, but if he came down here, would anybody open the door and talk to him?  They would be delighted to talk to him.  They would not accept or agree with what he propounds, but if he came down, would he not be accepted? We say that everybody should be treated the same because the root cause of the problem in Northern Ireland &mdash; let us not look at the symptoms but at the root causes &mdash; is that the Nationalist community did not get a fair deal, they were treated as second-class citizens and could not make any progress, and the men of violence took over to try to do it.</P>
    <P>The Downing Street Declaration and all our efforts for 17 months was to take away any justification for that agenda and wean the people from violence.  We now have to contend with a struggling Unionism on the other side which is equally vicious, because David Trimble is setting out to win back support with the result that two parties are more right-wing than one was previously.</P>
    <P>That is why the small parties will continue to speak for themselves.  As David Ervine will tell anybody, they were used as cannon fodder in the struggle within Unionism.  They will no longer participate in that.  They are standing on their own to speak for themselves.  They set down the six principles which are enshrined in the Downing Street Declaration because they have a practical approach.  They do not trust the British Government and they see what is happening in society.  They see all the young Unionist people going to Britain to be educated at third level and not coming back.  They see the signals of what that could bring down the line, and they would prefer to work out a new accommodation.</P>
    <P>The language has changed to a large extent on one side and not by one iota <Col N="1528" /> on the other.  Until the language begins to change the process must be slowly nursed along.  Unfortunately last Friday gave a fillip to the people who said &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, to the people who said &ldquo;you cannot trust the IRA&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Father Denis Faul made an interesting comment the other night when he said that it was different this time, that the Protestants were not blaming the Catholics.  They are all now beginning to blame the politicians who could not produce a definitive date for talks.  They know that talks is the only way to ensure that violence does not start again.</P>
    <P>I join everybody in saying that Friday was bad, but let us not make it worse. The people who telephoned me and wrote in the past few days have deep concerns that if violence is allowed to drift back in it will be far more vicious than before.  To those down here who say that what happens in Northern Ireland does not matter to us, I say it does matter, because we are all winners or we are all losers.  We must change the mind-set in Northern Ireland and convince people that we are not talking about victory or defeat, or domination and superiority of one over the other, but that everybody can win.  This is what the last 17 months was beginning to show.  We were winning in the context of investments and jobs.  The best thing the people in the Shankill who do not have jobs could hear was about investment which would give them a job.  The peace process was a fillip for tourism, North and South, in every shape and form.  More and more investment and support was coming in from Europe and the United States.  Without this we will all be losers, so let nobody sit back and just say that we tried our best and it did not work, because if we do that the choice we are making will be to allow violence to start again, and if it starts we will not see it stopped again in our generation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there was no split in the IRA, that there was no split in the Republican leadership.  Everything they did during the period of time I worked <Col N="1529" /> with them was geared towards ensuring there would be no split.  Sometimes people have to accept things they did not want and did not like, but the overriding principle was not to have a split. None of us wants to see a split because it is bad enough trying to contain one organisation without having to contain more than that.  We saw that in this country before, and we do not want to see it again.</P>
    <P>The undermining of confidence, and the British Government apparently having less and less consultation with the Irish Government, is not acceptable. Neither is it acceptable that one Government in the peace partnership should make unilateral decisions and it should be told that time and time again. We have the same stength of voice in this partnership operation as we have at any of the Council forums around the world, but we are being treated as people who do not have a voice.  Are they trying to return to the old position that this is an internal British problem and that nobody has any business interfering? That is the sort of thing we hear from David Trimble only too often. When he was asked if there would be direct talks after the election he said that they could be two years away.  What does he think will happen in that two years, and how are we to contain the pressures that are there for two years? The only way to contain them is to start all party talks.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House should know that the British Government was asked by Sinn Féin in May 1994 to clarify whether rejecting the Downing Street Declaration or objecting to parts of it would prevent parties from becoming involved in talks.  The formal reply of the British Government was that parties &ldquo;were free to determine their own views on the Declaration&rdquo; and &ldquo;to represent those views in future negotiations&rdquo;. Later on it said &ldquo;acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a precondition for entering the talks process&rdquo;. They are now, in effect, trying the exact opposite.  When people moved towards the goalpost, it was moved again.  We <Col N="1530" /> saw that when the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major sidelined the Mitchell recommendations and suggested adding a seventh principle.  An international commission was appointed and came up with a result that would have brought everybody into talks and would have given the Unionist community and the loyalist paramilitaries the assurances to which they are entitled on decommissioning and how it would be carried out.  Decommissioning is their greatest fear and is also the greatest fear on the republican side.  The Mitchell report was hard on everybody and if it cannot be resurrected, its dumping will be seen in history as the greatest mistake of all.</P>
    <P>There were a great many mistakes, which taken together undermined trust and confidence.  When the Nationalists and republicans saw what the British Government was trying to do to the Irish Government they did not have any great confidence in the process.</P>
    <P>The obligation on both Governments is to get the process back on track and bring all four proposals to the table.  If an outsider is to be involved there is no better man than the former US Senator, George Mitchell because all sides have confidence in him and know that his report was the answer.  I am not taking sides on elements of the proposals.  All I want is a date for peace and a return to the way things were last Thursday.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at notes of my last full meeting as Taoiseach with Gerry Adams and the Sinn Féin delegation in Government Buildings on 21 October 1994.  At the end of that meeting Gerry Adams recalled the difficulties he had had with the British Government over the hunger strike.  He told me how long it had taken to reach the ceasefire and that since its inception there was no trace of violence by Republicans because the alternative, a political route to talks was on offer.  He told me if they failed, the Sinn Féin representatives around the table would get the blame.  The alternative needed to be seen to work and if not, the most historic opportunity for peace in our time <Col N="1531" /> would have been squandered.  The stupidity of it all seems so tragic now.</P>
    <P>Everybody must work to rebuild peace however difficult the task may be. I praise the loyalist orgnisations for their restraint to date.  Having spoken to their representatives yesterday afternoon I have a good insight into the problems they are having in being restrained. That restraint needs to be reciprocated. I told Gerry Adams that another bomb blast will probably end the peace process for our lifetime.  He told me he will take reponsibility for going back to the IRA every time he thinks he can succeed, but the lack of trust makes that difficult.  It will take time to rebuild trust.  In the meantime like everybody else in this House I do not want to see one more life lost in a cause that is best served by democracy as was demonstrated in the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>A leading loyalist described the Mitchell report to me yesterday as the best means of consigning political violence to history.  He said it was an act of folly to brush it aside.  People did not understand John Hume's emotional response in the House of Commons on 24 January but perhaps they understand it better now.  George Mitchell is needed to bridge that gap between the two Governments and all parties.</P>
    <P>I belong to a party that was born out of the old IRA.  I understand the motives of patriotism that inspire republican activists.  That is not to say I support them.  I appeal to their patriotism today and ask them to have the courage to recognise that the armed struggle no longer has the purpose it once may have had, to restore and guarantee peace and security to the Irish people and save their people and others from new hardship and suffering and to rejoin the wider republican family and fellow Irish nationalists at home and abroad in the continued political struggle for Irish freedom &mdash; in the broadest understanding of that term.  That means working out an accommodation with our neighbours in Northern Ireland because this is a small island on which all of us have <Col N="1532" /> to live.  That was first said not by a republican leader but by Edward Carson who recognised in 1917 that we needed a &ldquo;Council of Ireland&rdquo; and brought the suggestion to the Irish Convention. King George V at the opening of the Parliament in Stormont said:</P>
    <P>I hope today is a prelude to the day that the people of this country North and South, coming from two parliaments or one, whatever is their choice, that all Irish people living on this island will work together for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>Lord Craigavon the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland said:</P>
    <P>This island is too small for us to be kept apart for all time ... change will come but not in my time.</P>
    <P>We have an historic opportunity for change.  I have taken every opportunity at question and answer sessions in the North to take Unionists back through their history and lay it on the line for them what would have happened if the Government of Ireland Act had been implemented.  As I said to John Major the first time we met, he and I would not have needed to talk if the Government of Ireland Act had been implemented.</P>
    <P>People wonder why republicans have a total distruct of perfidious Albion from the day partition was pushed on them.  They have been betrayed since the 1920 Act, the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and so on.  When the chips were down and courage was needed to bring change, they were betrayed by the British Government.</P>
    <P>They believed in joining the wider republican family with an Irish Government leading it for the first time and that by gathering international support from America, Australia and Canada they could win the argument on the international stage.  It was precisely that alternative strategy Gerry Adams took to the IRA as the basis for the peace accord.  That accord has been put back but so too have the measures that could <Col N="1533" /> have been taken in advance of all-party talks to start to rebuild confidence.</P>
    <P>Ireland is at a crossroads.  If we take the wrong turn we will do an injustice to our children and future generations because we will have given away the best opportunity for peace.</P>
    <P>No one would have believed 18 months ago that we could broker a ceasefire.  Nobody would believe the ceasefire could last.  No one believed changes in the use of language would move people slowly towards peace. When one comes up against an intractable problem, one must leave it aside and go on in a different way.</P>
    <P>The republican leadership in its militant and political form has a job to do and people can make their own assessment of what went wrong.  We cannot undo the damage done last Friday but I have given some ideas why it happened. When people do not keep promises, confidence breaks down but we cannot retreat into self righteous rhetoric and take up an easy and popular position of condemnation.  Trying to hang people up on words is not the right way to solve problems.  We want the saving of human life and peace.</P>
    <P>Eleanor Roosevelt once wrote that politicians should do the things politicians think they cannot do.  Many politicians in this country and in Britain turned their backs on the issue and said they could not do anything about it.  If this generation of politicians say the same, take the wrong road and make the wrong decisions I do not know when leaders such as John Hume in the Nationalist community and Gerry Adams in the republican community will be able to influence those who do not see it that way.  We needed them before, we need them now and we will need them in the future.  Can anyone put their hand on their heart and say who will have any influence with the IRA in restoring the position other than those who are there now?  We cannot do it nor can the Government.  We will join with the Taoiseach and call on them to lay down their arms.  We know it will be a futile exercise but we will still do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> There is some cynicism because we had peace for 18 months and people are asking why politicians do not get their act together and get talks going.  Deputy Deasy spoke about open and frank discussions and asked us to look into our hearts to see if we could have done more, why did we do this and not that. Perhaps the House should be given an audit on progress every three months.  If that had been done people might not have been as surprised as they were that the pressures won through last Friday. Signals can mean a lot and anyone who listed the signals over the last eight or nine months could not fail to recognise that pressures were building up.</P>
    <P>The historical opportunity still exists. We must get to know the different mind-sets and realise that it is about rights and recognition for a minority that was downtrodden for so long on one side.  Why would the Unionist tradition not try to maintain the <i>status quo</i> for as long as possible?  Such people dispensed power and privilege and the <i>status quo</i> suits them fine.  They will try hard to get a Government in Stormont but will not mind if they do not succeed as long as they retain the <i>status quo.</i> However, the <i>status quo</i> is not the answer to maintaining peace and saving human life in the future.  Just as with Lord Craigavon, Edward Carson and King George change will come.  The greatest instrument for change has been in operation for 18 months.  The price must be paid for peace and saving life. We should be courageous, take risks and be prepared to pay the price.  History will thank those who take risks even though some may fail.  They will not be seen as weak but as visionaries who saw opportunities and knew if they did not take them they would not be given the chance to do so again.</P>
    <P>I want this House to unanimously endorse the Downing Street Declaration, the Framework Document, the ceasefire and speak with one voice in ensuring that we get a return to peace and keep it.  Above all I want us to be courageous enough to recognise what has to be done and do what must be <Col N="1535" /> done to get a return to peace.  Then we can go on to work out structures and change mind-sets.  It is a terrible indictment to hear parents in Northern Ireland say they will have to change their school children's uniforms because it is too easy to recognise their identity. Young people went out and enjoyed themselves and children played in the streets in the past 18 months.  Will we deny them that again?  We did it for 25 years and people wonder why they think differently from us.  If we lived there for 25 years we would think the same way. The people there believe we deserted them in their hour of need, not in a military way but in not speaking up for them.  Some are genuinely afraid that we will drift back to that position again.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the IRA leadership, the Government and all parties to give the right signals, do what they can to help to build the confidence that can restore peace.  I say to the IRA, &ldquo;no more; we have had it; we do not want any more; we cannot take any more&rdquo;.  The status and good name of Ireland built up by President Robinson and the politicians who go abroad must not be tarnished. There were two Irish good news stories in the past 18 months, we had an island at peace with itself and the best economy in Europe &mdash; a marketer's dream as one person said to me in the US.  We must maintain that and do whatever is necessary to ensure that no one destroys or sullies it.  Empty calls without any action will not deliver the peace or keep it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McGinley. Last Friday I was at a function in Cork which is a long way from Belfast and London.  There were 850 people there, including the Minister for Finance.  The feeling when the news of the bombing broke was one of shock, disbelief, shame, anger, sorrow for the victims and condemnation of the IRA.  The last time I remember anything approaching that emotion in Cork was when we heard the <Col N="1536" /> news of the death of John F. Kennedy in 1963.  There was the same feeling of loss, shame and horror at the passing of something which might not return.</P>
      <P>Later in the evening when people were speaking about it there was condemnation of the British Government particularly for its response to the Mitchell report and its sudden espousal of elections in Northern Ireland.  That was felt to have contributed to, though did not justify, the bombing in London.  The resumption of violence is totally unjustified and counterproductive.  I very much welcome, as does the Government, the consensus in the House on a general broad approach to the problem.  I also welcome the support for the Government from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>It is harder to persevere inch by inch in frustrating negotiations than to flip the lid and attempt to bomb a way to all party talks.  Unfortunately, that is what happened last Friday.  The trouble with Friday night's bombing is that it played into the hands of those who claim that Sinn Féin/IRA have their own twin track approach &mdash; one track following the democratic process and the other the bomb and the bullet.</P>
      <P>Irish nationalism in all its shades must discipline itself to work within a peaceful and democratic framework, with all the frustrations which that entails, if we are ever to find an agreed accommodation with our fellow Irishmen in the North and those who share diametrically opposite views.  We cannot defeat them or their masters in London and conversely the Northern Irealnd state, supported by the forces of the Crown, has not and will not defeat Irish nationalism.  Accordingly, there can be no outright winners or losers and an historic compromise must ultimately be struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether our generation can bring that about or generations yet unborn that compromise must be found one day.  It will not be found unless through painstaking negotiation in an atmosphere of peace and trust far from the threat of bullets and bombs.  The tragedy of last Friday is that it inevitably <Col N="1537" /> destroyed the fragile beginnings of that trust as well as shattering the peace itself.</P>
    <P>However we must not give up.  We must all pick up the pieces.  There is nothing else to do, no other way to go.  The forces of Irish nationalism must unite in a permanently peaceful pact both with ourselves and our adversaries, but those adversaries too must meet us half way and they have not done so to date.  The murderous act of last Friday, shamefully perpetrated in the name of Irish nationalism, cannot be justified in any circumstances.  Neither can we accept the failure of the British Government and the Unionist parties to commence in earnest the process of reaching the elusive and historic compromise. Sooner or later that compromise must be found if peace, prosperity, cohesion and fairness are to replace the fractured and fundamentally unstable society in the northern part of this island.</P>
    <P>The peace process of the past year-and-a-half did not achieve what many hoped it would, but it did achieve a lot. Above all else it gave to a whole generation traumatised by violence, terror, murder and fear a precious insight into what peace itself cold bring.  Those who for 18 months have stood in the sunlight of peace will never again accept the darkness of despair.  They demand peace, they demand it now and, in the words of President Clinton in this House on 1 December last, they will have it.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Reynolds, I say to the leaders of the IRA, in God's name will you listen to the voices of Irish nationalists, nationalists of all shades?  Some of them, and I am not one, offer support to your organisation, some of them go further and regard you as freedom fighters, even as heroes.  I find that very difficult to understand, but then I never lost a brother, sister, parent, child, relative or friend in the bloody conflict of the past 25 years, so I can never fully understand the feelings of those who have been seared by such tragedy and tribal bloodshed.  While I do not claim to <Col N="1538" /> understand all that, I understand very well the yearning for peace of all Irish people, peace in which to bring up their families, free from the knock on the door, the bullet in the night, the terror and the trauma, the funerals, the tears, the hatred, the despair.  I implore the leaders of the IRA not to plunge our long suffering people back into that wretched situation but instead to give peace a chance, not for a month, a year or even a decade but forever.  While that will not guarantee a final solution acceptable to Sinn Féin-IRA, the realisation of their aims, even in part, has no possibility of attainment except in the climate of a permanent peace.  That is the reality, anything else is a delusion and a recipe for chaos, devastation and death.</P>
    <P>If the IRA reinstates the peace, as only it can, and do so permanently we in Government and in this Parliament dedicate ourselves to redoubling our efforts to reach the historic compromise. It will not be easy, it will not be quick, it will try our patience; there will be times when some will be close to giving up, but there is no other way, no magic answer, only the slow, deliberate and determined movement towards that elusive formula and compromise which can bring about an agreed solution. That solution must unite the minds and hearts of the people of this island and unlock the rich potential of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter working together for the benefit of all.  That is a long way off but it is an ideal worthy of a great nation.  We need to kick-start the process which ultimately can lead to the attainment of that ideal.  The leaders of the IRA can and must play a lead role in all of that by guaranteeing the peace and participating too as builders rather than destroyers of all our dreams.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Minister Coveney, I believe certain events leave an indelible impression on people's minds.  For example, the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 was an event that will always be <Col N="1539" /> remembered.  I just listened to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  I well remember the signing of the Downing Street Declaration in London.  I was there that day, as was Deputy McDowell, attending the British-Irish parliamentary body.  I remember very well the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, visiting the Irish Embassy at lunchtime and the great feeling of euphoria that a major step forward had been achieved. I was in the House of Commons that afternoon and witnessed the great hope and optimism at the events unfolding. That was more than two years ago and there have been many ups and downs since then, particularly in relations between Ireland, Great Britain, and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are very few people who do not remember where they were last Friday night when the news broke that the IRA ceasefire had ended and, worse still, that the campaign of violence had recommenced. I was driving in the rain between Killybegs and Glencolumbkille when I heard the news flash on the radio and I listened with disbelief, horror and utter dismay.  It is difficult for any reasonable person to accept that the vicious circle of violence could be inflicted on us once again.  The unexpected announcement caused a deep and dark shadow of gloom to descend on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I class myself as a Border Deputy who represents a Border constituency. Donegal has the largest land border of any county with Northern Ireland and it is considered by many as part of the North.  I have had to explain to many people, not all of them foreigners, that while Donegal is geographically in the north, it is politically in the south.  No county in the Republic has been more aware of the campaign of violence in the North in the last 25 years than Donegal and no southern county has suffered more economically, financially and socially from the troubles.  Our only natural hinterland is Northern Ireland. To the west the county is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and its only land <Col N="1540" /> connection with the rest of the Republic is a narrow strip at Bundoran.  It has been said that if the bridge at Ballyshannon was gone one could reach Donegal only by sea or through Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The cessation of violence during the last year and a half has brought new vigour, contentment and prosperity to Northern Ireland and Donegal.  I am a regular traveller to the North and it was gratifying to see the changes there since the violence ceased.  Almost immediately the tension visibly eased as security personnel vanished from the streets, pavements and public places.  Body searches remained only as unpleasant memories. Northern Ireland, urban and rural, adopted a new air of normality almost overnight.</P>
    <P>During the pleasant hazy days of last summer I spent a few days in that beautiful part of Ulster stretching from the Bann along the north Antrim coast to the glens and into Belfast.  One day last August more than 50 per cent of the cars and vehicles parked at the Giant's Causeway bore southern Irish, British or continental Europe registrations. That would not have been the case the previous year.  Last summer more was done to create understanding and goodwill between the North and the South and to bring communities closer than in the previous 25 years of violence.  All the people of Northern Ireland responded magnificently with their joy and warm welcome for the large influx of people visiting the North.  It would be unbearable if there were a reversal of what occurred last summer as a result of the madness of last Friday's bomb in London.</P>
    <P>The improvement in Donegal was as dramatic as that in the North.  Not since 1968 did that county have such an influx of visitors from the North and the South.  Many people ventured North for the first time because of the peace process. In 1995 there was an increase of 56 per cent in the number of visitors to Northern Ireland over 1994.  We must maintain that trend at all costs.  We can never again return to the dreary years <Col N="1541" /> of violence that stunted and blighted the lives of so many people and families.  It was distressing last night to watch the broadcast of the deployment of troops throughout the North again.  Border security posts were dismantled last year and it would be intolerable if barriers and checkpoints were again set up. Those travelling North and South have had enough long stops, checks and delays.</P>
    <P>The way forward is through dialogue and discussion.  The contacts and bridges built during the ceasefire must be maintained at all costs.  I am glad the Government is continuing dialogue with all relevant groups and parties, including Sinn Féin.  That party seems to be our only line of communication with the IRA and its members must do everything possible to persuade the IRA to call off its campaign of violence immediately. We must get all the parties around the same table, as the only way forward is through discussion and open dialogue, nothing less.  Violence is not the way forward.  We have had 25 years to prove that point.  The Irish people want peace for themselves and their children.  Life is short, too short to be blighted by terror, violence and the upheaval of families and communities which we have witnessed so often in the recent past in the North.</P>
    <P>The southern economy is booming. There is strong international support and commitment for the peace process from the European Union, the United States and many other countries.  Yesterday evening I attended the launch of the 1995 annual report of the International Fund for Ireland at which we were told the total investment generated by the fund since 1986 is in the region of £700 million, all of which is targeted at specially disadvantaged Border areas.  The fund is financed by international communities, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union.  The Delors package of £270 million targeted at Border regions was mainly designed to underpin the peace process.  We have a major responsibility to ensure peace is <Col N="1542" /> immediately restored and violence must be renounced as a vehicle for progress. Talks, discussions and dialogue must continue between all parties.  That would lead to a Northern Ireland where all communities can live in peace and harmony and enjoy the benefits of life.</P>
    <P>After recovering from the initial shock of hearing of last Friday's announcement and the bombing, the Government and the Taoiseach have reacted responsibly and sensibly.  The emphasis is on dialogue, talks and the immediate restoration of peace.  We must also welcome and applaud the responsible attitude and supporting role played by the Opposition parties, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Independents.  We have shown a solid, united front against the resumption of violence.  Northern Ireland and the peace process are too crucial to be made a political football.  We cannot play such games with the lives and futures of so many people.</P>
    <P>Events this week in the Dáil have clearly illustrated that the resumption of the peace process is an issue that unites all parties.  I earnestly hope that this unity of purpose continues until the peace process is firmly re-established, as this is the only way forward for Northern Ireland and the whole island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I intended to produce a few notes on what I would say today, but every time I wrote a paragraph the thought process stopped because so many of the sentiments that immediately leap to one's mind in these circumstances sound trite when committed to paper.  We are all against violence and deeply shocked and dismayed that the IRA ceasefire broke down.  We are all horrified that innocent people in London have been blown to pieces to make a point about Irish politics.  We all feel a sense of indignation and frustration that the political process seemed to be so inadequate in the context of the opportunity opened to us by the IRA ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with care to Deputy Reynolds and I agree with much of what <Col N="1543" /> he said.  In the past we have tended to create issues of principle which seemed to be insurmountable when a principle is not of much assistance in reconciling two or more forces in Irish political history, when all claim to have a monopoly of principle on their side.</P>
    <P>A number of weeks ago there was a discussion in this House about 1916.  In that context I remarked that perhaps we should move on to discuss the Civil War, a somewhat flippant remark. Listening to the debate, it occurred to me that the republican side in the Civil War may have lost the struggle but it won the peace.  The arguments put forward then about oaths and so on were issues of principle over which people were willing to shoot each other, but what happened during the succeeding decades proved that the loss of life in that struggle was utterly and completely futile.  I speak as somebody whose family was divided by the Civil War.  An uncle of mine was shot down on the top of Ben Bulben fighting for the republicans in Sligo.  His father sat where the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, sits as a Minister in the Government that was fighting that Civil War.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile taking on board what Deputy Reynolds said about the futility of creating issues of principle through which we drag, force and break each other when what is needed is a view of where we are going.  We need a view of the long-term and where the opportunities lie for unity and agreement rather than issues of principle on which we can disagree.</P>
    <P>What inspired me to say all that was Vincent Browne's column in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  In one sense his article was depressing as in effect it implied the IRA will not accept the Mitchell principles, it will never declare a ceasefire to be permanent if it is restored and all the formulae we can demand and say are desirable and necessary in the present context will not be forthcoming.  If we set down that road again we will have another lengthy debate about words, when what is really needed in this <Col N="1544" /> House is some consideration of where we consider the peace process is going.</P>
    <P>One of the shortcomings of the Hume-Adams process was its preoccupation with words.  Words seemed to be so important to people on the physical force side of Irish politics which is a curious irony.  They seemed to be so concerned with words but so unaccustomed to using and relying on them, and the force of persuasion through words, rather than on other methods.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with Hume-Adams is it brought us down what I consider to be a rather barren <i>cul de sac</i> in which we all became concerned with the concept of national self-determination. The limitations of that particular exercise were exemplified by Deputy Ahern in his contribution.  One can talk about national self-determination until the cows come home and argue about what is and is not legitimate in pursuit of national self-determination but if one transposes any of the rhetoric, theory and political theology we have heard in this benighted country for 25 years about national self-determination to somewhere like Bosnia, you see just how futile and empty are such concepts. Where people are divided on something and both claim to be in the right, national self-determination and principles of international law fall away in dealing with the reality of political and ethic conflicts of a kind.</P>
    <P>I want to look forward to what kind of solution is really available at the end of the peace process because if we lift our eyes above the immediate problems that lie in our track and look to what could be achieved with goodwill, we have some inkling of what we should do to achieve it.  Like Deputy Ahern, I believe it is not possible to reverse the partition of this country by the use of force; it can only be done by a process of political persuasion because any unity of a political kind on this island can result only from a process in which the political method is the only one adopted.</P>
    <P>The principle enshrined in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, i.e. that the future <Col N="1545" /> status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom can only change if a majority of the people there so wish, which was registered at the United Nations, is correct and it is the cornerstone of any possible solution.  However, that is not to suggest that we are committed to some kind of internal solution in Northern Ireland because it is part of what is termed &ldquo;the Union&rdquo;, which is a bilateral process.  The other side of the Union is the rest of the United Kingdom and it is open to them to say to those who support the Union in Northern Ireland that the terms of continuing the Union are that a society must be created in Northern Ireland which is genuinely open to Unionist and Nationalist aspirations, even-handed as between both and which recognises the validity, status and dignity of each community.</P>
    <P>We must now identify the broad outlines of a solution which can stop the struggle in Northern Ireland which from time to time over the past 50 years has broken out in ruthless conflict.  These are that we can accept as one principle the view registered in the United Nations that the majority in Northern Ireland will determine whether it remains part of the United Kingdom or joins an all-Ireland state, but we do not accept this means the majority have a licence nor does the principle confer an implicit right for it to run Northern Ireland in the interim as it wishes.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the imperative is to create a society in Northern Ireland in which people of whatever tradition feel equally at home and in which in the last analysis the decision as to whether it remains part of the United Kingdom in ten, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 years time is one which is made peacefully and by a majority of the people in circumstances which do not threaten anyone.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental failure on the part of the British establishment to confront the reality of Unionist intransigence and we should always bring this to their attention, privately and politely if necessary, and keep it at the top of our agenda.  What has been wrong is <Col N="1546" /> that people in Northern Ireland have been allowed to get away with the proposition that the Republic of Ireland is a foreign country and the Éire Government, as it is now referred to by some leading Unionists, is a foreign Government which has no legitimate interest or role to play in bringing about a real solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.  That proposition is so obviously wrong in practice that the theory behind it must also be wrong.</P>
    <P>If at some stage under the Anglo-Irish Agreement some 51 per cent of the people of Northern Ireland voted in a plebiscite to withdraw that part of this island from the United Kingdom and propose to attach it to this State, and then stated to the Unionist minority that being British is a matter of owing allegiance to a foreign state, the British Government is a foreign Government, British links are sundered irrevocably, and British influence, institutions and culture in Northern Ireland are foreign culture, it would be utterly and profoundly wrong.  If we are serious about the proposition that a majority in Northern Ireland for the time being maintains the current position in place, the corollary must be that the majority owes it to the minority to treat them now as they would be treated if the 51 per cent voted the other way.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a political rationale for nationalist Ireland to insist Dublin has a role and nationalist Ireland has an interest in how Northern Ireland evolves as a society.  It is not correct to simply say that we will divide a solution into three strands, that on one strand, the internal governance of Northern Ireland, the Nationalists in Northern Ireland are on their own and Dublin's role is confined solely to being a party in negotiations as to how North/South relations evolve.  The whole island has an interest in how Northern Ireland evolves as a society, that all of Ireland are in fact historical partners in the great project of creating in Northern Ireland a society which genuinely belongs to both communities there.  To me the logic of that is we can have no <Col N="1547" /> more of the rhetoric of Taylor and Trimble to the effect that the Republic is a foreign State which is interfering and meddling in their business.  We must get the message across, particularly to the Conservative Party in England, that that is not acceptable, that it is just as unacceptable as if at some future date 51 per cent of people in Northern Ireland decided to leave the United Kingdom, after which we could trample down the remaining 49 per cent and say that their connection with the United Kingdom, their British identity, was a matter of allegiance to a foreign State. I see a symmetry here which justifies a completely different approach by the Government in its dealings with the Conservative Party in England.</P>
    <P>One of the things Deputy Albert Reynolds said, with which I agree, is that the brush-off to Mitchell by John Major was not directed towards appeasement of the Unionist MPs in Westminster; it was directed towards the 20 Little Englander Euro sceptics who believe that, at the next English election, being sound on the constitutional issue will somehow save the Tories' skin.  If, as I believe was the case &mdash;and I have every reason to believe it having spoken recently to some members of the Conservative Party &mdash; that Major's brush-off of Mitchell was directed towards appeasing, not the Unionists but a motley group of people on his own backbenches who regard macho posturing on Ireland as somehow helpful to their own political interests in England, it was a tragic mistake and misjudgement by John Major.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to apportion blame but we are now in a position in which, if we want to create a settlement in Ireland, we must approach it on the basis that words and principles do not obstruct the democratic process.  If the IRA reinstates its ceasefire, if a little sticker &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; is attached to it, would anybody trust that sticker?  Does it really matter exactly how and in what words Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and Mitchel McLaughlin <Col N="1548" /> deal with the six Mitchell principles and sign on for their substance?</P>
    <P>If the settlement in Northern Ireland is one in which it will remain part of the United Kingdom until a majority decides otherwise, in which institutions and laws will be put in place which create a genuine equality of esteem and a partnership society in Northern Ireland &mdash; through its assemblies, executives and the rest &mdash; if that is the ball park dimension of a solution, why is it necessary to tell a group of people that they must subscribe to a particular formula of words before they sit down at the table and discuss the substance of such a solution?  Why is it necessary to tell them to subscribe to a particular set of principles &mdash; going back to the Civil War, to take a particular oath &mdash; or make a particular electoral declaration before they can sit down and talk about the future of their society?</P>
    <P>Therefore, I was driven reluctantly to the conclusion that the proposition set out in Vincent Browne's article is correct, that the primary obligation on the Irish Government now is to drive the political process forward; that it follows from that that getting into knots and tangles about formulae, getting hung-up and broken on so-called principles is wrong.  Of course, another thing follows from it, that we can no longer go down the road of pretending that everything is possible in all-party talks.</P>
    <P>To a large extent Sinn Féin has been the victim of a lot of mollycoddling verbal appeasement, to the effect that everything is possible if it sits down at the table.  That is a falsehood; everything is not possible and its agenda, in terms of a united Ireland, is not on in the context of any settlement we can foresee evolving in the near future.</P>
    <P>We must take a flexible approach to the republican movement and ask them why they do not participate in talks about a settlement.  We must be realistic about where a settlement will be found: let us stop saying we cannot talk about the terms of a settlement because it could offend Gerry or Martin if we concede in advance that all-party talks will <Col N="1549" /> not be about a united Ireland in the next year, five years or whatever.  Let us give up the pretence that some people will be invited to participate in a process whose terms are so open-ended as to render it impossible to deliver to them what they are selling to their own hard, right wing men of violence as possible outcomes of these discussions.</P>
    <P>As a State and through our Government, I am convinced that we must now set out a view of a Northern Ireland settlement.  It is about time the ball park limits to a settlement were stated clearly, in terms which ordinary Unionists and Nationalists can understand; that Sinn Féin should not be excluded from contributing to discussions on that settlement by verbal formulae. However, this House must also push forward politics because its absence, accompanied by wrangling, surrender to the rhetoric of Taylor and Trimble, the perception that this Government is in some sense a foreign one, hostile to the interests of the Unionists must end.</P>
    <P>In putting together what was perceived by the Unionists as this pan-Nationalist front, we have created a threat.  Therefore, we must now make it clear to Unionists that we understand the terms of a settlement.  We must be clear and honest among ourselves as to what it is possible to achieve.  If we do that, then all the posturing on principles. formulae, words and all the rest of it will fall away but, if we do not, we face a very troublesome few years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Labour Party public representative I totally and categorically condemn <Col N="1550" /> the outrageous act perpetrated by the IRA at Canary Wharf in London on Friday evening last, a hideous act of depravity and violence, completely at odds with the efforts of all those involved in building a lasting peace in Ireland.  No individual or public representative committed to democracy and democratic politics could justify the action of the IRA on Friday last.  This violent act should be condemned universally by all self-respecting political representatives.</P>
    <P>I urge Sinn Féin to demand that the IRA categorically and unambiguously announces a total cessation of violence. The peace process can only be restarted on the ending of hostilities.  There is no place for the bomb and the bullet in politics.  By its selfish action on Friday last the IRA betrayed the peace process. Much of the good work undertaken by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the British Prime Minister, John Major, and the US President Bill Clinton, has been drastically set back by the events of last Friday.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on all politicians not to allow the peace process to wither and die.  We must work harder than ever to breathe life back into the process.  If we allow it to die we will do a grave disservice to all the people.  It is time for public representatives and politicians to show courage in the face of this adversity.  I urge mainstream Unionist parties, who have a responsibility in this area, to play their part in resurrecting the peace process. The Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party have a major role to play in the talks process. Their absence deprives the democratic process of the essential element of having all parties involved in debate.</P>
    <P>Politicians must seize the initiative. They must not allow the IRA to strangle the process.  There is a better way.  I urge the Irish and British Governments to ensure the peace process is taken away from the terrorists. We must tell the IRA to stop the killings. It cannot have it both ways.  Either it is committed to the peace process or it is not.  There are no half measures. <Col N="1551" /> That is the reason I urge Sinn Féin to demand that the IRA reinstate a ceasefire. Let us all work together to begin a sincere dialogue, based on the democratic principles and values which we all share.  Peace is still the prize we are chasing and we must not allow it to elude us at this stage.</P>
    <P>The bomb on &ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo;, as it is now regarded, shattered the peace process and the hopes of communities North and South.  It may result in the resumption of the killings, maimings and destruction.  One cannot operate with a bomb in one hand and a ballot paper in the other.  It is impossible to be part of the democratic process while being prepared to use force to further political objectives.  The democratic way to solve problems is through dialogue, consultation, non-violent confrontation and debate.  An essential part of that process is to accept the right of people to change their opinions.</P>
    <P>Words are not strong enough to condemn the action of those responsible for the bomb last Friday.  A Government cannot allow murder or the threat of murder to set the political agenda.  The State is based on democratic principles, we do not use violence and reject its use. We accept that violence in one area of life will open the door to a floodgate of violence in other areas.</P>
    <P>Part of the role of Government in a democracy is to protect the people from violence.  Despite the bleak outlook, we must attempt to find ways and means to re-establish the peace process.  We must work to heal the divisions between people North and South.  There will not be a change in Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority and acceptance of the legitimate aspiration of the minority.  In the absence of violence there will be peace which will produce a climate suitable for reconciliation.  We must encourage people of violence into the political process and release them from the futile <i>cul-de-sac</i> in which they now find themselves.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin will have to work to reinstate the ceasefire and wait until it <Col N="1552" /> is resumed before being involved in the democratic process.  Direct talks cannot take place in the shadow of a bomb.  The British Government must make a positive commitment and join the Irish Government to deliver a solution to the tragic problem which has affected our two islands for so long.  The Unionist leaders will have to join the Nationalist leadership to find a solution.  We owe it to the next generation in the North to produce an environment that will enable them to have a quality of life comparable with that of their counterparts throughout this island, Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Tánaiste said:</P>
    <P>... it is our fervent desire that Sinn Féin be part of negotiations we wish to see in place.  All parties represented here have worked closely with Sinn Féin in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation for almost a year and a half.  We have all gained from the experience.  I appeal to Sinn Féin to make it possible to participate without qualification in the peaceful, democratic process.  I call upon the IRA not to stand in the way of allowing Sinn Féin to do so.  The people of Ireland are tired of wars. Violence begets violence.  We demand peace.</P>
    <P>That is the message we send out from here.  Peace is essential.</P>

      <P>I join Members who have expressed their shock and sadness at the brutal bombing by the IRA of Canary Wharf on Friday last and extend my sympathy to the families and relatives of Inan Bashir and John Jefferies and to those who were injured.  A bomb in a crowded area was calculated to create the maximum number of indiscriminate casualties.  It reminds us of the many other incidents of terrorism that occurred in these islands on the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It reminded me of the bomb that exploded in Talbot Street, Dublin, in May 1974 on a Friday evening at 5.40 p.m. near where I worked.  Some of the <Col N="1553" /> innocent victims of that atrocity were street newspaper sellers.  The bomb in Canary Wharf shattered the peace process which had endured for 18 months. Responsibility for this atrocity and the damage caused to the peace process rests with the IRA.  I support the Government statement in response that there will not be ministerial meetings with Sinn Féin until the IRA campaign is terminated.  The approach of this Government and its predecessors has been consistent in this regard.</P>
    <P>The past 18 months of peace has allowed unparalleled progress on this island.  Many people in the North enjoyed living a normal peaceful life for the first time.  In the transformed climate there was peaceful interaction between people North and South.  Last year was a boom year for tourism in the North.  Increased investment from Europe and the United States created thousands of new jobs throughout the island's economy.  Last Friday's bomb has damaged these developments.  If the violence resumes these painstaking gains could be eroded.  The IRA has shown a contemptuous disregard for the welfare of the Irish people in terms of their hopes and aspirations and their natural right for peace for themselves, their families and society.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that we play our part in efforts to draw back from the brink of a renewed spiral of violence.  Our approach must be based on continuing repudiation and renunciation of violence, coercion and threat as a means of securing political progress.  We must make it clear that admission to dialogue and the right to take part in negotiations has to involve an end to violence.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the inclusion of Sinn Féin with other democratic parties at the forum was based on a clear commitment to a total cessation of violence.  The meetings of the forum have been postponed for a month as a result of last Friday's bombing.  As a member of the Labour Party delegation I participated at the forum and I pay tribute to its work over the past 15 <Col N="1554" /> months.  While the absence of Unionist political representation at the forum was a setback, many organisations and community groups representing the Unionist tradition attended the forum, made valuable submissions and participated in cross-party debate.  I pay tribute to the late Senator Gordon Wilson who ably expressed the views and concerns of his tradition.</P>
    <P>Like other parties represented at the Forum, the Labour Party made fact-finding missions to Belfast, where we met with all the political parties with the exception of the DUP which did not respond to our invitation.  I found those meetings very productive and helpful. For the first time we met with Unionist parties and exchanged views on a wide range of North-South issues.  In particular, the meetings with the new loyalist parties, the PUP and the UDP, were important.  These parties were vital in bringing about a ceasefire on the loyalist side and are bringing much needed fresh thinking to bear on the peace process from the Unionist side.  We also met with the Sinn Féin group on Belfast City Council and could not but be impressed by their dedication and commitment.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the Forum two weeks ago a paper entitled, <i>Paths to a Political Settlement &mdash; Principles and Requirements,</i> was presented.  This paper set out basic democratic principles considered necessary to attempt to achieve a political accommodation and settlement on this island.  Regrettably, it was not possible to obtain all-party agreement on it as Sinn Féin could not accept the consent principle which was also contained in the Downing Street Declaration.  I hope conditions will allow the Forum to reconvene soon and continue with its important tasks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report of the international body chaired by the former US Senator George Mitchell which was produced last month.  The main recommendation of the Mitchell commission called on the parties to negotiations to affirm their total and absolute commitment to six principles, namely, to democratic and exclusively peaceful means of <Col N="1555" /> resolving political issues; to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations and to agree that such disarmament must be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission; to renounce for themselves and to oppose any efforts by others to use force or threaten to use force to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations; to agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all-party negotiations and to resort to democratic and exclusively peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of that outcome with which they may disagree; and, to encourage the end of punishment beatings and killings and to take effective steps to prevent such actions.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell commission represented a fair and even-handed approach and went to great lengths to be fair to all viewpoints.  It provided a way out of the impasse on decommissioning.  The immediate response of John Major and the British Government to the Mitchell report was extremely disappointing and a valuable opportunity to move the peace process forward at a critical time was lost.  At the time most people believed that John Major adopted such an approach because of his need for Unionist support in the House of Commons. However, we have been told since that the approach was adopted to satisfy Euro-sceptics in his own party and it is even more regrettable the action was taken for that reason.  The statement made by John Major on Monday was positive and, hopefully, the two Governments are now back on the twintrack approach.</P>
    <P>The recent personal attacks by the Unionist leaders, David Trimble and John Taylor, on the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, were unwarranted and represented a crude and inept attempt to divide the Irish Government parties.  The Unionist leadership would better serve the people it represents if it could develop meaningful policies to address the issues which divide the two traditions in <Col N="1556" /> Northern Ireland and on the island as a whole.  No political leader as a partner in successive Governments has put so much time and effort into trying to resolve the difficulties in Northern Ireland than the Tánaiste.  It is dishonest to accuse him of being a mouthpiece for the IRA.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement of next week's summit between the Irish and British Governments and, hopefully, the twin-track approach will resume.</P>

      <P>I condemn the bomb at Canary Wharf.  Killing and maiming is not the way forward; violence is not the answer.  My constituents, who are in a Border area, are well aware of the futility of violence and of the fruits of the past 17 months of peace.</P>
      <P>It is now everybody's duty to persuade the IRA that the campaign of violence should go no further and the ceasefire should be re-established.  The two Governments should not close the door to those with influence.  The Taoiseach should have met the Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, on Friday night or Saturday morning last to discuss the situation with him and to find out exactly what was happening.  The peace process must be restored.  It is unfortunate the British Government sent 500 troops to the Border areas; it is unnecessary at this point and will do nothing to defuse the situation.  It is an insensitive knee-jerk reaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ceasefire brought hope of an end to violence.  It was seen as an opportunity to build a future on the basis of the Joint Declaration of December 1993.  The Joint Declaration laid the basis for a ceasefire.  Each Government was committed to remove the causes of conflict and to an agreed framework for peace.  Paragraph 4 of the declaration <Col N="1557" /> stated the British Government's position as being to &ldquo;achieve such an agreement which will embrace the totality of relationships&rdquo; and its role being &ldquo;to encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement of such agreement...by dialogue and co-operation, with full respect for the rights and identities of both communities&rdquo;. What happened to that commitment? What went wrong?</P>
    <P>The lead article of the <i>Irish News</i> of 12 February stated that &ldquo;from the very first hour of the ceasefire, the isolation of republicans was a central part of British policy&rdquo;.  I cannot disagree with that statement.  Too much valuable time was wasted on the definition of words and introducing preconditions.  A more pragmatic approach was required.  The then Irish Government and Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, within days of the ceasefire met Gerry Adams.  They assisted Sinn Féin to change to the democratic approach.  Sinn Féin was accommodated at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  However, I have been concerned about the political vacuum created because the British Government did not move with the required speed.</P>
    <P>I listened to the South African vice-President, Mr. De Klerk, at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation make two important points which are pertinent to the Irish situation.  First, where there had been a difficulty between the National Party and the ANC they moved rapidly to get over the difficulty because they saw the potential problems of a political vacuum.  Second, with regard to decommissioning, he said he would have liked to have done more but he recognised that if he had tried to do more South Africa would not be where it is today.  They were pertinent points in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>In the House of Commons on 13 January 1994, John Major said that if Gerry Adams wished to enter into discussions he knew how he might do so &mdash; he could decide to give up violence, after three months enter into exploratory talks and then enter into the democratic talks process itself.  Mr. Major said that was the <Col N="1558" /> route ahead and the only question that needed to be asked was whether Mr. Adams would stop the violence and enter the democratic process.  Why did the British Prime Minister not follow through?  Why were promises broken? It is not good enough for a sovereign government to allow itself to be paralysed by a dozen Unionist MPs &mdash; that is an abrogation of its responsibility.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years Nationalists on this island have taken a quantum leap forward.  When I was growing up the accepted Nationalist view was that no minority on the island had a right to impede a united Ireland.  Nowadays, no Nationalist wants to see a united Ireland without the consent of the majority of people in the North.  However, in the same period Unionists have not moved an inch.  Unionists still do not want to recognise the rights of Nationalists on this island, particularly those in the North.  They want elections first.</P>
    <P>Is this a delaying tactic?  The DUP and the UUP would compete with each other on the hustings to see which one of them could go further into the trench. That is not the kind of mandate required.  It is obvious that they are seeking an internal solution within the Six Counties and a return to Stormont. The three strand talks process encompassing the North-South relationship in Strand II, must be on the table.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 56 of the Mitchell report contains a loose reference to an elected body.  It states that oral and written submissions were received and such a body was mentioned in the communiqué.  I condemn the Taoiseach and the Government for this.  It also states that it would have to be broadly acceptable and have an appropriate mandate and that the three strand structure should be improved.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been part of the peace process from the beginning.  Its party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, played a leading role and his analysis since Friday has been an important contribution. On Saturday he made the excellent <Col N="1559" /> suggestion that George Mitchell should be invited to be a peace envoy.</P>
    <P>The decision of the British Government to sideline the Mitchell report was disastrous.  In this context, the Government could have done more in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the divergence of opinion among the three party leaders.  On a number of occasions statements issued by the Minister for Social Welfare were at variance with statements made by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  The Taoiseach was wrong to refuse to meet John Hume and Gerry Adams as he must be seen as the leader of the Nationalist consensus and the three party leaders must speak with one voice.  The IRA must call a further ceasefire, the two Governments must agree a joint approach and the Nationalist consensus must be re-established.</P>
    <P>Many proposals merit consideration, including the proposal made by my party leader that George Mitchell whose report should be implemented immediately should be invited to act as a peace envoy.  John Hume has proposed that a referendum should be held on both parts of the island while the Taoiseach suggested proximity talks.</P>
    <P>It is essential that all-party talks take place immediately and even the children on the street know that all parties which have a role to play, including Sinn Féin and the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries, should be invited to attend.  In this way we can put the peace process back on track and, I hope, move forward to find a solution to the problems on this island.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to two deeply committed and passionate women from Northern Ireland, one from Andersonstown and the other from the Shankill Road, on a late night television programme last night as they said time and again that the peace should belong to the people and that there should be dialogue, not death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have two powerful women in <Col N="1560" /> this country who represent their respective countries here which have been actively, centrally and crucially involved in the peace process.  I am pleased that one of these women &mdash; the American Ambassador, Jean Kennedy Smith &mdash; considered the matter so serious that she should be present at the commencement of this debate on Tuesday.  Her Government, particularly President Clinton and Senator Mitchell, has played a pivotal and extremely valuable and important role which must not be diminished, but strengthened, in the weeks, months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>For the past 17 months we have had the best opportunity since the foundation of the State to achieve a just and lasting solution to the political problems on this island.  No one ever said that the process would be easy and that we would achieve anything without taking risks.  I was present in Downing Street on 15 December 1993 with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, when the Downing Street Declaration was signed.  This was not agreed without risk taking and much pushing and prodding along the way.</P>
    <P>When the British Prime Minister took office he knew very little about this island and even less about the problems of Northern Ireland, but he was prepared to sit down with Deputy Reynolds and learn about the history of this country and that risk taking was necessary to achieve what had been unattainable up to then.  Where is he now?  Has he gone into an underground bunker?  What has he been doing for the past 17 months, other than ensuring his own personal political survival?</P>
    <P>Where has Sir Patrick Mayhew been for the same period?  I can recall clearly that on a number of occasions in the past he was unhelpful when we were trying to push forward to seek solutions. For the past 17 months he has put forward obstacle after obstacle to a just and lasting solution to the problems on this island.</P>
    <P>The Downing Street Declaration was followed by the announcement of the <Col N="1561" /> ceasefires which, in turn, were followed by talks, the Joint Framework Document and then the obstacles.  After it was stated that there would be no talks the British Government got caught on the hook of decommissioning.  It later presented the Washington Three proposal which was followed by the on-off September summit and the Mitchell report prepared by a man who had a deep understanding of and commitment to the resolution of the problems on this island.  What happened to this marvellous document It was put in the bin by the British Government which called instead for elections.  I am glad the Government said no.</P>
    <P>I cannot absolve the leader of the main opposition party in the United Kingdom, Mr. Tony Blair, from blame. Those who aspire to leadership of their country must above all show vision which at present requires courage and risk taking.  There has not been much evidence of this across the water during the past 17 months.</P>
    <P>The response to what happened last weekend, which none of us can condone and all of us condemn, has been to step up security.  It would appear that the only answer the United Kingdom authorities have to the problems on this island is to move on the security front. One of the consequences of the years of strife has been the strong security measures which have had to be taken north and south of the Border, many of which are obtrusive, as Deputy O'Hanlon who lives near the Border is well aware.</P>
    <P>These measures include the look out posts which are a blight on the landscape, the closure of Border roads and the blowing up of bridges, leaving craters on the roads.  When Minister for Justice, I visited all these posts and I am aware of the inconvenience and major difficulties they caused for honest, ordinary, decent citizens, Catholic and Protestant, in the North, some of whom had to take a round trip of 25 to 30 miles to get from one point of their farm to another.  The entrance to one house on <Col N="1562" /> the Border was in Northern Ireland and the back door in the South.</P>
    <P>We have to learn the lessons and make sure that decommissioning is not made a precondition for anything, not just talks, although everyone agrees that this has to take place.  We have spent £2.4 billion of hard earned taxpayers' money on security measures on this side of the Border and we will not go down that road again.  That money is needed to deal with criminals in this society and must be used more productively.</P>
    <P>Senator Michell did the job he was asked to do with great courage and understanding.  In paragraph 35 of his report he gave the British Government an opportunity to get off the hook.  It states:</P>
    <P>In addition, the approach offers the parties on opportunity to use the process of decommissioning to build confidence one step at a time during negotiations.  As progress is made on political issues, even modest, mutual steps on decommissioning could help create the atmosphere needed for further steps in a progressive pattern of mounting trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that any democratically elected political leader of a sovereign Government would put into a shredder a fundamental document that was the basic foundation for working towards change on this island.  The women on television last night called for dialogue, not death.  We have not had dialogue for the past 17 months.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste need to do some tough talking.  The approach of all British Governments in the past has been to divide and conquer the Irish.  I assure the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that the Opposition will support them in their efforts to continue to unite the Nationalist community on this island.  Let us ensure that irrespective of what obstacle the British Government puts in the way that unity is not split. Let us ensure that difference in emphasis between Government leaders here does not allow a British Government to push in and create a bigger crater.  We <Col N="1563" /> do not want that.  We want the obstacles removed and tough talking with the Prime Minister, John Major, and the Secretary of State, Patrick Mayhew.  We want them to realise that the Irish Government means business and that we will not allow this glorious window of opportunity we have had for the past 17 months to be frittered away for lack of courage and risk taking.  Any member of the British Government or Prime Minister who has the courage to take personal and political risks to resolve, peacefully and politically, Britain's biggest conflict and drain on its economy will be commended.</P>
    <P>Many people have shown courage.  I have already acknowledged the courage of John Major.  John Hume and Gerry Adams also showed courage and Deputy Reynolds, in particular, showed great courage and took personal risks. We should not shut out those who took risks, particularly those on the republican side, whether Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, Rita O'Hare, Mitchel McLaughlin, Pat Doherty or any of the others who convinced the IRA to keep their guns silent and that there was hope through the political process.  We should not shut them out.  Let us continue to have dialogue, not death.  There should be no &ldquo;mights&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybes&rdquo; about talks, a definite date is crucial.  That is the core issue as far as our party is concerned. We need Senator Mitchell as a peace envoy.  He is the core issue as far as our party is concerned.  We need Senator Mitchell as a peace envoy.  He is an international and independent figure and understands the problem more than anyone.  We want all the people on the island to live together side by side, to build trust, seek reconciliation and reach agreement on our future.  We must set a definite date for all-party talks.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and hope our contributions make some impression on those listening.  All of us felt a profound sense of depression at the news last night that 500 extra UK troops are being sent to Northern Ireland.  During the past 18 months there had been a steady reduction in the number of troops in Northern Ireland. Their absence from the streets &mdash; like the gradual withdrawal of our security forces from the Border &mdash; was one of the tangible signs of peace which brought great joy to people all over the world.  Those who planted the bomb last Friday bear full responsibility for putting 500 troops back on the streets of Northern Ireland.  I hope that is borne in mind the next time a person takes up a can of graffiti paint to scrawl &ldquo;troups out&rdquo; on a wall in the North.  The British Government is slow to respond to various initiatives in recent months and we all felt the same deep sense of frustration at the tortuous pace of progress. However, the frustration felt then is nothing to that felt now.</P>
      <P>It is a tribute to the resilience of democracy that neither the Irish nor the British Governments permitted themselves to be diverted from the search for peace by the atrocity last Friday night. We must be clear about one matter.  The renewed efforts in recent days to find a route out of the impasse are despite, not because, of the IRA's actions.  I am hopeful that the peace process will be put back on course.  I am also cautiously hopeful that those in the republican movement who recognise the futility of violence will be able to persuade last Friday night's bombers to restore the ceasefire.  That is the immediate task facing all democrats on this and the neighbouring island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long-term, however, we must confront the historical nature of violence on this island and those who resort to it.  Deputies have referred to the schizophrenia with which we view the so-called physical force tradition.  This was evident in some of the contributions last night as there appeared to be some <Col N="1565" /> confusion as to whether the British Government or the IRA was responsible for last Friday's bomb.  The term &ldquo;physical force tradition&rdquo; is a euphemism we use to conceal our discomfort. Physical force sounds far more innocent than plain common language such as violence, murder or slaughter.  All Members must face up to that because the majority of us are politically descendent from that ambivalent tradition.</P>
    <P>When we look at the IRA and the bewildered faces of English families who have lost a loved one we are looking into the mirror of our history.  It is not a pleasant sight but we can learn from it.  In this regard I speak from experience.  Some Members of my party and the parties from which we originated had their roots in the physical force tradition.  I understand the difficulties associated with abandoning the certainties of physical force for the uncertainties of the democratic process. After all, the will of the people is never predictable.</P>
    <P>Having witnessed that journey at first hand I assure those trying desperately to make the same journey that it is worthwhile.  Having controlled and dominated people's lives for 25 years it is not easy to give back that control to the people.  This is about allowing people to live their lives in the manner in which they want to live them, however much we may disagree with that.  This is about teaching people to relinquish that control.  While we do that every day in other areas, the difficulty in this case is that the people who refuse to relinquish control can kill people.</P>
    <P>Violence has its own impetus.  After a number of months or years it becomes a way of life which is extremely difficult to abandon.  That is one of the reasons the punishment beatings continued in Northern Ireland during the 17 months of the ceasefire.  It is about control and determining how others live their lives. Violent acts may be planned by a group and committed in the name of a collective concept, in this case, the Irish <Col N="1566" /> nation; that is what fills us with such deep shame.  We must not forget that those acts of violence are committed by individuals who ultimately must take responsibility for their actions.  The individuals who used frustration as an excuse to murder two men and injure 100 more had been conditioned by a culture that has glorified violence.  That culture must be challenged and, as individuals and collectively, we must ensure that challenge is successful.</P>
    <P>In the short-term the democratic politicians must, through dialogue and compromise, create the conditions for a lasting peace.  In the long-term, however, as a society we must confront the physical force tradition and all that it means and has meant in the past.  That will not be easy.  It will mean confronting the icons of our own popular mythology, examining them and rejecting many of them as inappropriate. Surely our future, and that of our children, is worth the sacrifice of a few faded remnants of history.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lynch for sharing her time with me.  It is ironic that while politicians have said they will not waver in the storm of a resumption of violence, it took the exploding of a bomb in London to initiate this Dáil debate.  Business has been suspended for the week to allow us, as elected representatives of the people, express our opinion on the peace process.  This debate should have taken place some months ago when matters that have frustrated Members of the House on all sides could have been brought to the fore rather than it being precipitated by the events of last Friday.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the vile actions of the IRA on Friday last resulted in an overwhelming wave of sadness throughout the country.  That feeling was not one of anger or outrage which, unfortunately, has been the reaction so often in the past, but utter sadness and almost despair at the slaughter of innocents and the fact that so much potential seems to have been destroyed by a single mindless act of terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> As a constitutional politician I deplore the actions of the IRA and I repeat the sentiment expressed by the Taoiseach and others that the use of violence is never acceptable as a method of delivering a political message.  Democratic politics is about compromise, conflict and finding a resolution to problems in the interests of what we, as elected representatives, determine to be the common good.</P>
    <P>Like most members of the Fine Gael Party, I have been strongly criticial of the republican movement in the past, abhorring its reign of intimidation, terror and death not only in Ireland but in Britain and in Europe over many years Nevertheless, the cessation of violence in August 1994 utterly revolutionised the political landscape in such a way as to renew hope in the prospect of a lasting settlement after a quarter of a century of mayhem, destruction and death. Most Members of this House were prepared to give Sinn Féin the benefit of the doubt by trusting the sincerity of its sea change in the autumn of 1994.</P>
    <P>Last Friday confirmed our worst fears.  The act of faith had been thrown back in the face of the Irish Government and John Hume.  The natural option as a result of Friday's events would be to close all doors and regress to a pre-ceasefire position but, even in the aftermath of Canary Wharf, doors must be left open and channels of communication in some form be kept in place if a full scale resumption of violence is to be avoided and if Sinn Féin can again be trusted to deliver on the restoration of a cessation of violence. Tomorrow's meeting between officials of the Irish Government and Sinn Féin is, therefore, welcome and I hope it will produce some form of positive dividend.</P>
    <P>The ceasefire of August 1994 opened up so many windows of opportunity not only for political structures but also in areas of economic activity, trade, tourism and engendered an overall feeling of well-being not experienced on this island for generations.  This positive feeling was no better exemplified than <Col N="1568" /> on the faces of the smiling and positive Irish people in Belfast, Derry and Dublin during the visit of President Clinton. We all remember the innocent face of the ten year old girl whose smiling, happy countenance was shown around the world on satellite television.</P>
    <P>I refuse to accept that all that can be shattered by the events of Friday last.  I cannot avoid forming an opinion, however, that over the past 18 months there has been a lack of commitment on the part of the British Government on the Irish question.  The words &ldquo;generosity&rdquo; and &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; were used freely by John Major when asked about a possible ceasefire in the run up to 31 August 1994.  The response has fallen far short of those sentiments.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in the first instance the ceasefire was far from being an end in itself but a means towards achieving a lasting understanding and settlement.  This understanding would not be contained in any specific timeframe but rather an arrangement where solid progress could and should have been reported over a period of years.  Not only do Nationalists feel let down, but those citizens longing to live in a peaceful environment, free of the daily threat of bombs and bullets, feel shattered and despondent following last Friday's events.  It is a source of regret that so many obstacles were evident to any realistic basis for talks.  Those obstacles fuelled a sense a frustration within the Nationalist community, a frustration directed at the British Government.</P>
    <P>Since August 1994 we experienced wrangle after wrangle on the permanence of the ceasefire, the principle of consent, the issue of decommissioning, the sudden sidelining of the Mitchell report before its ink was dry and, more recently, the insistence by the British on elections prior to any talks.  It was against this atmosphere of obstacle after obstacle that the camel's back broke and the men of violence were allowed take stage.  We cannot say Gerry Adams did not warn of such a scenario &mdash; he did so on many occasions &mdash; but the <Col N="1569" /> British refused to accept the fragile nature of the peace process.</P>
    <P>Over recent months I have expressed a specific interest in the prisoner issue believing that as in the resolution of all major international conflict, the prisoners should take pride of place.  Progress on the prisoner issue has been far short of that expected and must be unfavourably compared to the resolution of major international conflicts. One can contrast the treatment of republican prisoners in the UK with that of Private Lee Clegg which speaks for itself and need not be elaborated upon.</P>
    <P>Recategorisation, repatriation and review in relation to the prisoner issue has been minimal over the period of the ceasefire.  This sense of frustration is all too real for the prisoners and their families, all of whom embraced the ceasefire which was brokered in the first instance by many of them.  Are they now to be the losers on the resumption of violence?  Where now stands Paddy Kelly, treated in a most inhumane manner while in a British jail?  What use is his support for the ceasefire as he awaits death from cancer in Belfast, far away from family and friends?  Where now stands the transfer of sentenced prisoners under the European Convention and the improvement of conditions for those in British jails, or will they be the pawns condemned indefinitely in the fallout of the resumption of violence?</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest that the British, particularly John Major and Michael Howard, took the ceasefire for granted and over that period let Nationalists down.  If I criticise the British Government for so doing, I am equally critical of the British Labour Party which is equally culpable.</P>
    <P>If the path to negotiations between the parties is to advance, Sinn Féin must convince the militants to restore the ceasefire without doubt and without condition and that must be done with immediate effect.  In addition, the British Prime Minister must demonstrate that he is not a prisoner of unionism and clear evidence must be shown on his part that the arithmetic in the <Col N="1570" /> House of Commons will not be a further stumbling block to progress.  Just as the Taoiseach signed an act of faith in Sinn Féin, John Major, in an atmosphere of a restored cessation, must act in the spirit of generosity he promised as far back as August 1994.</P>
    <P>This decade has seen remarkable progress on conflicts of immense difficulty in eastern Europe, South Africa and the Middle East.  It is not asking too much that representatives of a people longing for peace should be prepared at least to proceed to a talks table without the use of bombs or bullets to further their aims and without saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to everything and &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; to any form of progress. The British politicians in particular must show that they possess the necessary courage and will to advance matters further and in this regard a restoration of the cessation of violence, followed immediately by a date for talks, is absolutely essential.</P>

      <P>I join previous speakers in extending my sympathy to the families and relatives of the two people killed and those who were injured in last Friday nights's atrocity in London.  I add my voice to the condemnation of that atrocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I laud the great people who achieved this great peace prize for us one and a half years ago.  John Hume, Gerry Adams and Deputy Albert Reynolds put much work into bringing about the ceasefire at great personal and political risk to themselves.  Who can forget the great work done by the then Taoiseach. Deputy Albert Reynolds, in exhorting all concerned to come into the process which led to one a half years of peace, no bloodshed and prosperous times for the entire island, particularly the North? Who can forget his repeated taunt: <Col N="1571" />&ldquo;who is afraid of peace&rdquo;?  People listened to him and the peace prize was put in place.  God bless the people involved in bringing about peace.</P>
    <P>We should condemn the atrocities but should not condemn people or look into their backgrounds.  In recent days Gerry Adams has been condemned in this House and elsewhere.  He should be taken at his word and on the basis of his track record in recent years.  He was part of the process which led to peace. When I think of Gerry Adams I say <i>Deo gratias</i>, thank God for his attitude, skills and ability to act as a conduit between the men of violence and the political process.  Where would we be without him?</P>
    <P>We can condemn its atrocities, way of life and aspirations but the IRA is a fact of life.  The might of the British Army and nation, with the assistance of the Irish security forces, have not been able to put a dent in its armour.  The people whom I lauded achieved what the might, muscle and fire power of mighty nations could not achieve.  We should give Gerry Adams the credibility he deserves.  In his magnificent speech my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, called on the IRA to restore the authority of its political leadership.  I endorse that call and ask everyone both inside and outside the House to do everything possible to ensure that the credibility and authority of the leadership of Gerry Adams and his colleagues in Sinn Féin are assured.</P>
    <P>The British Government has much to answer for and the levers of procrastination used by it over the past 18 months must be condemned.  The main players must deal with this issue in a sensitive way but these levers must be condemned.  I am referring to the decision to home in on the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;&mdash; the significance given to this word lost us many months &mdash; the demand for decommissioning outside the context of any agreement and the diabolical and totally unacceptable treatment of the Mitchell report.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and <Col N="1572" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs and all those involved in next week's summit well.  I add my voice to that of Deputy Bertie Ahern in pledging the support of Fianna Fáil for their efforts.  I wish the blessing of God on that meeting which may be the most important one in which the main players will ever be involved.</P>

      <P>I put much work and thought into writing my speech.  Over the past 12 months I have devoted much time to working for peace in my own way.  I believe in dialogue but not in violence.

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Whip made a case for more time and the Government agreed to an extra day but this was not enough.  The Government Whip should be flexible when making arrangements for debates and ensure that all Deputies who wish to make a full contribution can do so.  I cannot say all I want to say in five minutes and I do not intend to butcher my speech.  I will not destroy it but will distribute it to members of the media if they are interested.</P>
      <P>The blame for this tragic impasse in the peace process could be laid at many doors but condemnation or blame never solved anything.  Efforts to force people to say things they do not want to say never solved problems but this has been the history of the past 16 months.  Building bridges solves problems.</P>
      <P>I hope that instead of retreating into our shells, we will redouble our efforts to bring peace to this country.  I hope those people who have become complacent in the past 18 months will remember that until we arrive at a soluntion to which all the people on this island can subscribe, the nightmare of the partition of this country will not have been resolved.</P>
      <P>What happened last Friday is a tragedy.  Let us stop apportioning blame.  I wish the British Government would condemn and blame, and look into their own hearts.  I will continue to look into my heart to see if there is anything I have not done during the past year, to see if there was more I could have done to try to convince those people who have seen no other way out of their situation other than violence during the last 25 years that, despite what we have seen in terms of lack of democracy in this House today, democracy really does work.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on the Northern Ireland question and the collapse of the peace process.  Would that I was here to eulogise the peace process and its progress to date but, alas, black <Col N="1574" /> Friday changed all that.  I offer my sympathy to the families who have been bereaved and wish a speedy recovery to all those who were injured.</P>
      <P>Let us be grateful for the peace breakthrough after 25 years of war in the North, and give due recognition to all those who participated in its inauguration. It took courage to put the peace process together.  Many politicians and non-politicians took personal and political risks in putting the package together but, as Deputy Albert Reynolds, said, who is afraid of peace?  Now, who should be afraid of talks and negotiations to get the peace process back on the rails?</P>
      <P>Mistakes were made along the way. Despite 17 months of peace, little progress was made in getting all-party talks and negotiations under way.  John Major had difficulty at home in regard to his leadership, etc.  Nevertheless, he gave certain commitments, as did our Government, to Sinn Féin and the SDLP but he, with the Northern Ireland office, failed to keep the momentum going, perhaps for political reasons.  The Labour Party in England did not help either as it tied itself too closely to the Conservative Party and did not heed the warnings of Kevin McNamara, a man who knows Ireland well and has a great interest in this country.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin, particularly Gerry Adams. Martin McGuinness, Pat Doherty and Mitchel McLaughlin, did their best to uphold their new direction in the democratic process of persuading the IRA to give peace a chance and accept commitments given them by our Government. The SDLP and Sinn Féin were needed then, are needed now, and will be needed in the future to get the peace process back on the rails again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember that no great progress was made on the Nationalist side until John Hume and the SDLP took risks by taking Sinn Féin into their confidence and thereby presenting a united front for the Nationalist aspirations. Thankfully we had a leader down here in Deputy Albert Reynolds <Col N="1575" /> who aided them in every way possible and pointed the direction forward.</P>
    <P>We must once again all become persuaders. The parties in the Republic, the SDLP and Sinn Féin must again get the Nationalists behind the process.  We ask the British Government to be the persuaders of the Unionists.  This process is too important to leave on the long finger.  There must be no more procrastination. We must get the peace process back on track immediately before there are any more atrocities.</P>

      <P>It is with great regret I learned that the IRA issued a press release in the past few minutes indicating that the cessation of violence is definitely over.  I am a relatively young man, in my 30s and, at a very early age, I started to learn and to read that this small island had its problems.  I grew up hearing and learning about the needless conflict and the turbulence of the Northern situation.  It is with emotion and pain that I recall RTE news flashes of tragedy, bombings, killings, sadness, abusive police forces &mdash; the nightmares that reflect 25 years of violence.  Professor C.L. Carter once said that prosperity in Ireland would have to await a united Ireland.  I do not believe that.  I believe prosperity in Ireland only has to await peace, and we saw the start of that prosperity in the past 17 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I placed many questions on the Order Paper and I have made many submissions on the Northern situation.  I was asked to withdraw some questions and I did so.  In early 1994 I tabled a question which I left on the Order Paper.  When I received a call from the Taoiseach at the time, Deputy Albert Reynolds, asking me to remove the question, to which I agreed, it was a clear signal that something big was happening. The Fianna Fáil-led administration and the Taoiseach were not just going over old ground but exploring new ground and travelling the extra mile.  Little did I realise how much was happening.  Doors were being opened, talks were under way, hard bargains <Col N="1576" /> were being teased out.  These involved high risks and courage.  Out of all that the Irish peace process of 17 months was born.</P>
    <P>In the early days of the peace process Deputy Albert Reynolds was criticised for moving too fast, but he was one of the architects of the process and was determined in the best national interest to give all it took.</P>
    <P>Within a few months our partners in Government, the Labour Party, were looking for a head over the relevance of the Duggan case to the Smyth case, official A in the Attorney General's Office and the appointment of the Chief Justice and, of course, there was the Labour Party Leader's personal pride as the high king of Ireland.  He was quoted as saying at the time that the peace process was bigger than any single individual, but he made it clear that his pride was more important than the peace process.</P>
    <P>At the time of the break-up of Government the peace process did not matter.  There was a demand for a head on a plate at all costs, and none of us should lose sight of what happened at the time.  I honestly believe, as most people in the country do, that if Deputy Albert Reynolds's Fianna Fáil-led administration were still in power the peace process, while it would have had its difficulties, would have retained the consistency we saw in its early months.</P>
    <P>I do not blame just the Labour Party or the Government.  John Major and the British Government mishandled the peace process particularly since the Framework Document was issued in February last.  They continually created new obstacles to progress and sought to treat the Republican movement as a defeated people with whom they were not required to keep faith.  John Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew forgot that the progress they had made was the result of listening to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the past few days I have come across the latest example of the British Government trying to move the goal posts as it did over decommissioning. John Major has now suggested that a seventh principle be added to the six Mitchell principles as an essential basis for talks.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the ceasefire was broken.  I sympathise with the families and friends of the two unfortunate men who died when the IRA detonated a bomb in London on Friday last.  In all probability they did not know where Ireland is or understand the problems arising from the history of the relationship between Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>I empathize with the people of the six north eastern counties.  Are people who tolerated violence for the past 25 years to be subjected to the same again?  It is terrible to subject people to the threat of such violence for the rest of their lives.  People under 30 years of age hardly remember when there was peace in their part of the country before the ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members can emphasise to the Government the absolute necessity of restoring peace.  The Government must urge the IRA to renounce violence while at the same time urging the British Government to see the value of all <Col N="1578" /> party talks.  Economic advantages have accrued from tourism and industrial transfers as a result of the 17 months of peace.  The economic advantage is trivial compared to the people's new found peace of mind.  One can see plainly the contentment on people's faces.  I never thought one could read such expression in a person's face but I recall that poem by Goldsmith: &ldquo;They came to recognise the days disaster in his morning face&rdquo;. During the past 17 months you could see the radiance return to the faces of the people of the North.  It would be disastrous if that was taken from them.</P>
    <P>Were we responsible in any way for the breakdown of peace?  Did we take peace for granted?  Did we monitor the progress of peace?  If we did, we did not do it sufficiently well.  If we were monitoring the progress we would have recognised the chinks in the armour. Nationalists were telling me more than six months ago that peace could not last because they maintained they got nothing out of it.  I know that is not true but they maintained they got nothing but broken promises.  They were promised all party talks after three months of the ceasefire.  That three months came and went and there were no all party talks.  Words such as &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; became a precondition, then arms had to be handed in before they could take part in talks.  The handing in of arms later became the decommissioning of arms, a red herring that is still with us. The communiqué of 24 November signed by the Prime Minister, John Major, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, proposed that all party talks would most certainly take place by the end of February 1996.  We see what has become of that.</P>
    <P>The former US Senator, George Mitchell, chaired an international commission on Northern Ireland.  One of the main planks of his report was that decommissioning could take place in tandem with all party talks.  That appeared to be acceptable to everyone until Prime Minister, John Major, made his speech in the House of Commons. He devoted six lines of his 20 page <Col N="1579" /> speech to the Mitchell report, discarding it completely.  What did he replace it with?  He proposed the holding of elections. What would elections in the North prove at this stage?  Whatever neighbourliness has grown up between communities in the North would be dissipated completely if elections are to be held.  Once the campaigning starts all parties will return to their own corner and come out fighting for their point of view.  That will polarise the communities further.</P>
    <P>Our objective should be all party talks and the renunciation of violence.  We should pressurise our Government &mdash; I know we are pushing an open door &mdash; to impress on the British the importance of agreeing to all party talks while impressing on Sinn Féin and Provisional IRA the necessity to renounce violence.</P>
    <P>The Government holds the view that all party talks should take place in Northern Ireland and I fully agree with that but we do not appear to be putting that into practice in the Twenty-six Counties in that the Government will not speak to Gerry Adams.  We should speak to Gerry Adams.</P>

      <P>My generation did not know peace in Northern Ireland until 17 months ago when the ceasefire was declared.  In every news bulletin until then we heard horrific reports of violence and the deaths of innocent people. Usually a bishop or politician strongly condemned each of these acts of violence and rightly so, but it did not stop the killing.  It was only when John Hume initiated dialogue with the terrorists, despite strong criticism at the time, that any real progress was made.</P>
      <P>The Canary Whaft bombing was a callous and cowardly act.  Innocent people were injured and killed.  How anyone can condone such an act and live with themselves is beyond me.  The sad fact is that such acts have been done for 27 or 28 years.  John Major's rejection of the Mitchell report was a blow to the peace process.  The report was a lifeline to the process and John Major should have considered it a little more favourably.</P>
      <P>Whether one likes or dislikes Gerry Adams, he has played a major role in the peace process.  The ceasefire would not have been possible without him.  At this sensitive and crucial stage I put it to the Taoiseach that we should not refuse to meet him, even at ministerial level, if that is what is required to establish peace.  We should bend over backwards to do what we can to end this madness.</P>
      <P>For 28 years the policy of successive Governments has been to condemn violence and to refuse to speak to those who condoned it.  It is very easy to condemn violence.  It is not so easy to understand why people feel it is necessary to use it as a means to achieve something.  Perhaps that is where we should start from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Understandably, people North and South are disappointed and saddened by the Canary Wharf bombing but we must move forward.  It was a despicable act and a setback to the peace process. We have learned in the past 17 months <Col N="1581" /> what it is like to have peace in Northern Ireland.  People want peace and, as politicians, we must do whatever it takes and talk to whoever it is necessary to talk to at whatever level is required to achieve peace again.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid am a roinnt leis an Theachta Gregory.  It is vital that we do not forget the victims of the breakdown in the ceasefire.  People need not have died.  It was an anti-British and anti-Irish act of violence.  It condemns the Irish people to further instability and flies in the face of international opinion.  The area bombed was built by Canadians and that is ironic when one considers the make-up of the Mitchell Commission. Responsibility for that act must be borne by the IRA.  If We look for responsibility in other areas, our prisons would be empty as prisoners would say they were the victims of some circumstance or other that led them to commit crime.  The winners are the arms trade and criminals who will be free to commit crime as security forces are redirected in the fight against terrorism.</P>
      <P>The Sinn Féin leadership is also a victim. Its credibility has been damaged. History will judge those who took part in the peace process, those who broke promises and said things could happen. My party strongly disagrees with Sinn Féin policy.  However, Sinn Féin is also a victim, and far from being frozen out it should be brought into the peace process in an effort to repair it.  The Forum can be a vital part of restarting the peace process.  It is not to meet for the next four weeks but it is important that bilateral talks continue.</P>
      <P>We support the proposal by John Hume to hold a plebiscite in the North and South.  It is time to put to rest the IRA claim that it has a mandate from the 1918 election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party has four main proposals. There should be a new twin-track approach where all the parties able to come together should do so at a multilateral forum while bilaterial meetings should be held with Sinn Féin, the <Col N="1582" /> Unionist parties and others.  The international panel for decommissioning, proposed in the Mitchell report, must be set up now.  Sinn Féin must be urged to sign up to the proposals in the Mitchell report as must the British Government. That report was drawn up to bring both sides together and if all sides are not prepared to trust an internationally renowned and respected body set up for this purpose, we will be despondent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement that elections would throw petrol on the flames is valid in the context of the elections that have been spoken about.  If elections are to be held somewhere along the line, let us talk about what kind of election would accommodate the diversity of opinion and the smaller parties that have been crucial in the process &mdash; I am talking of the Unionist parties &mdash; and those that must be represented if there is to be consensus to bring about peace.  At present there is gerrymandering in many Northern Ireland constituencies.  We must consider a list system.  Whenever it is decided to hold an election we must look at securing the widest possible representation and non-majoritarian structures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the discussion to which attention may not have been drawn and that is the early release of prisoners.  It is a grave mistake to break agreements on the release of prisoners.  I am particularly <Col N="1583" /> concerned that IRSP prisoners in Portlaoise who were due to be released following commitments given at a meeting in the Department of Justice on 18 December and whose organisation has not breached the ceasefire are now victims of recent events.  Two of them were due for release in the last few weeks. Their organisation has maintained the ceasefire and has not been involved in violence.  It is a great mistake on the parts of the Irish and British Governments to use prisoners as pawns and hostages.  I ask the Government to give a lead on this and, where commitments were made, to bring about the early release of specific prisoners from Portlaoise prisons.  Those releases should proceed.  Mr. Adams was one of the architects of the peace process and it is a great mistake, and will be seen as such in the future, for the Government not to continue to talk to him.  I hope it changes that policy.</P>

      <P>The last day of August 1994 and 13 October 1994 were truly historic days.  They were the days of republican and loyalist ceasefires were announced.  Those decisions were warmly welcomed in this House, in the 32 counties and indeed throughout the world.  We believed that the tragic chapter of 25 years of violence was over and fervently hoped there would never be political violence on this island again. The dreadful and horrific atrocity in London last Friday night has been rightly condemned by every Member of the House and by every sane person in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard of the London bomb as I left home to travel to a Fianna Fáil cumann meeting in Swanlinbar, a town on the Cavan-Fermanagh border in which bombs were planted on a number of occasions and which was devastated by the violence.  The people attending that meeting, among them a few people from County Fermanagh, were absolutely appalled and outraged.  They were shocked that once again the freedom of the previous 17 months might be taken <Col N="1584" /> from them.  A number of Border roads leading to that small town have been reopened.  By and large people going about their daily business could travel through the nearby permanent vehicle checkpoint without being stopped or harassed, as they had been for the previous 25 years.  They never wanted to see again the terrible loss of life witnessed by every parish in the North.</P>
    <P>The Downing Street Declaration, the cessation of violence and the publication of the Framework Document are important milestones in our history.  We have enjoyed peace because of the political abilities and single-mindedness of Deputy Reynolds, John Hume and others.  In their work before the cessation of violence they were vilified by a large section of the Irish media, but they never lost the commitment and courage necessary to bring about peace.  They made it clear that in order to advance, consolidate and underpin peace there had to be meaningful progress in addressing the issues concerning those who had come into the democratic mainstream.  The peace dividend had to be meaningful and visible to every sector of society.</P>
    <P>The introduction by the British of preconditions following the announcement of the ceasefire was an act of betrayal in the trust established between the two Governments in their successful negotiation of the Downing Street Declaration. Our party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, referred to that matter in his excellent contribution last Tuesday. He gave quotation after quotation from the British Prime Minister and his senior Government colleagues that the renunciation of violence would provide the route for Sinn Féin to democratic talks.</P>
    <P>A commitment was made in the Framework Document that all-party talks would commence as soon as possible. Once again the British Government did not deliver, nor it appears did it make an effort to deliver on those solemn commitments.  The one constant in British policy towards Ireland is the reneging on commitments by that <Col N="1585" /> Government, always at crunch times in our history.  Instead of talks, new obstacles and road blocks were put in the path of progress.  Every individual who has spoken to me about the North since last Friday believes that the British Government exposed the peace process to huge risks and that a new veto was handed to the Unionists.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week BBC Northern Ireland conducted a telephone poll in which 66 per cent of respondents stated that all-party talks are needed now. Why was greater urgency not shown throughout 1995 in getting all parties to the negotiating table?  Why did it take President Clinton's visit here last November to force the late night flight to London and the subsequent communiqué to talk only of a firm aim of all-party negotiations by the end of February?</P>
    <P>The British Government disregarded the Mitchell report.  The proposal within hours of an elected body demonstrated clearly the conscious decision of the British Government not to act in good faith.  Is it any wonder John Hume was so enraged in the House of Commons? The provocative action of the British in bringing back troops is to be deplored. It is the Royal Irish Regiment, the full time UDR personnel who are being sent to the province of Ulster, including my neighbouring county of Fermanagh.  I have spoken to people in that county in recent days and they are absolutely appalled that harassment, permanent vehicle checkpoints and mobile checkpoints could become a feature of their lives again.  The present predicament is blamed on Mr. Major and the British Government.  Likewise, our Government is blamed for failing to maintain the momentum generated by Deputy Reynolds and Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the British Government and establishment was signalled by the outlandish remarks of Mr. Mates, M.P., at the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body meeting in Cardiff last September to the effect that the Irish and British Governments might have to <Col N="1586" /> contemplate a short-term return to violence. At that meeting I asked whether Mr. Mates was representing the British Government's views, as he did so often in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for sharing his time with me.  Considering the constituency he represents, he has a voice of authority in dealing with the question in hand.  In time to come the question, &ldquo;where were you at 7 p.m. on 9 February 1996?&rdquo; will be constantly raised.  That was the time we heard the news that the IRA ceasefire had ended and, within a few minutes, that a massive bomb had exploded in London.  People checked to see whether they had heard correctly.  There was a sense of disbelief, numbness, dismay and consternation.  There was a feeling of outrage at what had happened.  There is no need for each of us to stand up and say how much we condemn that atrocity, but it is with a great sense of outrage that we do so.</P>
      <P>Out of that has been born a very strong determination that in these days and the days ahead a very clear and consistent line must be taken by all sides to ensure the peace process is reconstructed, renewed and brought back on course.  In that process Fianna Fáil intends to take a very central role, as we have done since Deputy Reynolds brokered the peace process.  Of course there is a democratic role for Opposition, but on this question, through our former leader, Deputy Reynolds, we have played a huge role and continue to play a role through our present leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  There is recognition on all sides of his grasp of the problems, the contacts he has made and the course he wishes to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a time of great crisis, Abraham Lincoln said to his fellow Americans, &ldquo;we must think anew and act anew&rdquo;. That is a very appropriate quotation in present circumstances.  There is no longer respect for old slogans or for entrenchment and solemn reiteration of views held for years.  Neither is there acceptance that one should close one's <Col N="1587" /> mind and heart to talks with anybody.  I am strongly convinced that, regardless of the position of Governments and Opposition in recent years, the main participants in this whole process should be met again and again.</P>
    <P>Gerry Adams and his colleagues played a central role in achieving the peace process.  Is it not puerile to demand that they condemn this outrage while insisting that they demand of the IRA, as we do, a renewal of the ceasefire. The issue is not as simplistic as ritualistically calling people to condemn this outrage.  I openly condemn violence as do the people of Ireland but we live in a complex society.  While recognising that the Government has the right to say it will not formally meet Sinn Féin I urge on it frequent liaisons, meetings and talks with anyone who can help save the peace process.  This is not about saving face, it is about saving lives.  I strongly commend to the Government Mary Holland's article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today and her equally interesting trenchant article last Saturday.  I have no time for old ways if new ways will bring about change.  There is no need to cling to precedents if by meeting people we can bring the peace process back on track.</P>
    <P>While John Major was dilatory and disregarded the warnings he is not to blame for what happened.  A distinction must be drawn between what happened, and the careless, dilatory and pandering way the British Prime Minister dealt with the issue.  He signed documents with Deputies Reynolds and Bruton and a communiqué with Deputy John Bruton on the basis of trust, and engaged in the process of getting Senator George Mitchell involved, but all that was to be cast aside for the appreciation of the baying Conservative backbenchers who whooped with delight when he spurned the Mitchell report and opted for elections.</P>
    <P>At the best of times elections are <Col N="1588" /> inflammatory.  They are occasions of triumphalism or despair for the vanquished. The words, &ldquo;to fight an election&rdquo;, carry echoes of argument and a good deal more than that in the northern context.  Whatever the Nationalist parties wish will determine our stance, but elections, as we know them are extremely divisive and will draw the worst out of all concerned.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the document outlining the process of proximity talks in detail circulated to all Members by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and I thank him and his office for it.  While the idea was not popular initially, it has grown on us.  If that process can be successful in getting parties together &mdash; I do not care if members of the various parties are in one or ten buildings as long as they debate the issues &mdash; we should consider it.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned about holding traditional elections in the context of Northern Ireland.  An election campaign would involve loud voices in heated arguments and major rallies at which messages of hatred and entrenchment would ultimately give rise to violence. They would not be a good idea, but perhaps nationalists parties can work out and agree a formula for an acceptable election process.  However, my experience of &ldquo;normal elections&rdquo; here is that they do not breed an atmosphere of serenity or give rise to peaceful debates.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a calm clear commitment to the reconstruction of the peace process.  The alarming mood swings and position switches in which the Taoiseach indulged on Saturday night when he said holding of elections would be like pouring oil on a burning fire, and the next day when he said perhaps the elective process should be given some thought, do not serve the cause in which we are all engaged.  Such random and capricious public comments by the leader of this country, to whom people look for single-mindedness in dealing with this business, reflect inconsistency of thought.  Such inconsistency does not engender clam, or give the <Col N="1589" /> impression that a firm hand is on the tiller.  Those inconsistencies are noted with interest, commented upon and influence the manner in which we are viewed by other Governments.</P>
    <P>We should recommit ourselves to reconstructing the peace process, to actively endorsing the Mitchell report and to continuing to press the US for a more emphatic central role in the peace process for Senator George Mitchell. We must all become persuaders and minds and hearts must be kept open to all ideas, persons and organisations. Why should we exclude people like Gerry Adams who were central to the peace process?  Their exclusion is not right.  It is no time for saving face, it is a time to save people.  If we must move away from entrenched positions held by Governments for 60 to 70 years, so be it.  That is the way we must go.  We have a matter of days to put a coherent shape on the proposals to move forward.  The peace was never meant to be passive.  It was welcomed but it was meant to be active, lively, developmental and linked to political progress.  I strongly recommend intensity of purpose and co-operation between all concerned in the peace process so that we can rescue and reconstruct it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>As previously stated, I intend to publish the Government's national sustainable development strategy towards the middle of this year.  Work on its preparation is advancing within my Department, in consultation with the green network of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The preparatory process for the strategy is supported by recent work completed in relation to data and methodology for sustainable development indicators, and by the local agenda 21 process; it also draws on policy developments at EU and international levels. In addition, I have recently invited submissions from interested individuals and organisations, which will be taken into account in finalising the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to the Minister's commitment of 3 May 1995 that the sustainable development policy would be published before Ireland's Presidency of EU.  Is it still his aim to have that policy document ready in June prior to Ireland taking up the Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is still my intention. The scale of work undertaken to put this strategy together is greater than I envisaged originally.  Notwithstanding that, we have had a number of direct contacts with environmental departments in the European Union from Denmark to Austria, enlisted support from other Government Departments and established a green network of all relevant Departments.  Certainly, the volume of work is huge but it is still my aim to have the work completed and <Col N="1591" /> published before we take up the Presidency of the EU in the middle of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a recent newspaper advertisement inviting submissions and consultations which must be in before the middle of next month.  What does he intend to do with those submissions? Are written submissions from groups and individuals the only consultation in which the Minister intends to be involved or does he intend to have more extensive consultations?  If he is to publish the document in June, the timescale dictates that the documents and submissions will not receive much consideration by the Minister beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that all submissions received will be carefully considered and any good ideas will certainly be taken on board.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  Huge work has already been done on this whole process within the EU and in other EU countries and we have taken advantage of their experience in that regard.  We have invited submissions, the closing date for which is 15 March, and I am anxious that there should be a level of consultation in advance of the final preparations of this document.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development has had submissions from a number of interested groups and has taken direct evidence from a number of Departments and outside bodies, all of which is being carefully monitored by my officials also.  Any positive input from the committee itself or any submission to the committee will be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development, the Minister knows I felt it would be better if the committee took submissions and made its report prior to the production of a document by the Government. <Col N="1592" /> What we are doing at present is something of a pointless exercise although it is extremely interesting.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Government's commitment to sustainable development will be dented severely by the fact that the REP scheme will come to a halt in about two months time due to lack of funding, there are ongoing rows between the Environmental Protection Agency and the IFA on a variety of environmental matters, the forestry strategy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and all the other issues which arise due to the present lack of environmental protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy and that will not surprise him.  The fact that these issues are arising is evidence that we are moving ahead at a great pace.  If nothing was happening, nobody would be excited. The fact that people are engaging in dialogue now, and some people are voicing contrary views, means we are moving fairly rapidly on the whole environmental protection front.</P>
      <P>In terms of the timeframe for finalising this document, I had a similar discussion on the finalising and drawing up of the strategy of the national health policy, as the Deputy will recall as he was in Government then.  On that occasion, I proceeded on the basis that it was better to listen to people's views and then, as Minister, draw together the best strategy.  One can listen and discuss forever and never get to a proper strategy.</P>
      <P>The strategy itself will not be written in stone once it is in place.  It will be organic and will be able to grow and develop as new ideas, technologies and practices come to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first of the Deputy's other two points, the REPS is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I am supportive of his efforts to ensure significant funds are <Col N="1593" /> available to ensure all farmers who wish to participate in the REP scheme are enabled to do so but it is outside my direct ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the question of forestry, I intend taking a strong environmental initiative on forestry practices which is coming to fruition in terms of the dialogue between myself and my friend and colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed sludge management arrangements for the Galway secondary treatment plant are at present being finalised by Galway Corporation in accordance with my recent authorisation to advance the design of this plant.</P>
      <P>As already determined by the EIA process, sludge management at Galway will involved anaerobic digestion to produce methane for power generation, together with dewatering to yeild a product with dry solids in the range of 23 per cent to 35 per cent.  This product would be transported from Mutton Island in sealed containers, involving an estimated 14 trips per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original intention was to dispose of dewatered sludge at the Carrowbrowne landfill.  However, it was always accepted that this disposal route should be contingent on the conclusions of a review of that landfill facility to be carried out by Galway Corporation.  That review has now established that there is limited further landfill capacity at Carrowbrowne, which cannot therefore be <Col N="1594" /> relied upon for the disposal of sewage sludge.</P>
    <P>In order to promote the maximum re-use of sewage sludge as a secondary raw material, in accordance with the requirements of the EU Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment, my Department circulated an advisory strategy document on sewage sludge management to local authorities in June 1994.  This envisages, in the case of Galway city, the re-use of all dewatered sludge by landspreading on suitable forestry plantations and farmland.  I anticipate that the detailed sewage sludge management arrangements to be finalised by Galway Corporation will have regard to this recommendation.</P>

      <P>For how long will that continue?  It is my understanding that the number of trips will considerably increase during the next five, ten or 15 years.  Would he also confirm that the route from Mutton Island to the Carrowbrowne landfill site runs through the centre of Galway city?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan was designed to cater for the anticipated population growth and development needs of the city of Galway, on which our estimate of 14 trips per week is based.  At some future date, if there is a huge growth in the population of Galway, that might increase.  As the Deputy will appreciate, to cater for a population of 68,000 people will require 14 trips per week, or two trips per day, taking the dewatered sludge from the treatment plant at Mutton Island and disposing of it.  With proper traffic management flows, the route to be taken can be planned.  However, no matter where the treatment plant is located, the sludge has to be removed as under European law since 1988 we are <Col N="1595" /> no longer entitled to dump it at sea.  The best environmental policy is to use it as a secondary material by way of landspreading, a proper nutrient that would be of benefit to forestry plantations. This has to be worked out in some detail before the plant becomes operational.</P>

      <P>What is the lifespan of the Carrowbrowne landfill site?  In the meantime, bearing in mind what the Minister said about spreading the slurry on land at a later stage, has he any alternative site in mind to the Carrowbrowne site, or had consultations with Galway County Council about an alternative when its lifespan expires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that I do not believe the Carrowbrowne site would be suitable, that it is nearing the end of its useful life.  Although that was the proposal in the original environmental impact assessment, we have advanced in terms of our attitude to sludge.  The volume of sludge to be disposed of in Ireland will increase substantially as more treatment plants become operational and we can no longer dump raw sewage into our coastal zones.  We will then approach European norms in terms of the quantities of treated sludge &mdash; a secondary raw material that is a good nutrient for such practices &mdash; to be land-spread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The strategy and financial plan set out in the <i>Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999,</i> provides the framework within which individual projects on both national primary and national secondary routes are progressed by the National Roads Authority, in co-operation with local authorities and forms the basis for the allocation of grants to individual projects by the authority.</P>
      <P>With the objective of providing an understanding of the strategy outlined in chapters 3 and 4, the Operational Programme includes, at Annex 2A, an indicative overview of specific projects being considered for the period of the programme, using all sources of funding EU Regional and Cohesion Funds and national resources.  This indicative overview list is necessarily tentative given the complex statutory and non-statutory procedures which must be complied with before particular projects can proceed to construction stage and the factors which can impact on progress once construction stage is reached.  In addition, all projects for which EU assistance is sought have to be approved in accordance with the requirements of the Regional or Cohesion Funds, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Inclusion of a project in Annex 2A does not necessarily imply that the project will be submitted or approved for EU assistance.  Projects other than those listed may also be submitted and/or approved if they meet the criteria of the relevant fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1994, a monitoring committee was established to oversee the implementation of the programme and to ensure satisfactory progress in achieving its objectives.  The 1994 annual report on the implementation of the programme as a whole was approved by the monitoring committee in October 1995 and then sent to the Commission.  I am arranging for copies <Col N="1597" /> of that report to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.  Reports have also been sent to each regional authority in relation to progress on the implementation of the programme within their respective regions.  The annual report of the National Roads Authority for 1994 is already available in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is the Government's plan for national roads for the remainder of this century and formed the basis of the application for regional funding to Brussels, on which we built our hopes, is the Minister saying that its carefully worked out targets have no validity and may not be attained?  What is the position of the several key projects earmarked in the plan to begin in 1995, which did not begin then and which, according to the national roads programme announced, are not due to begin until 1996?  I am thinking of projects like the Southern Cross route, the Blackpool, Cork by-pass and the Nenagh and Kildare by-passes.  When are these key projects, central to the objective of this programme, due to commence? Will they be completed within the lifetime of the programme, or even completed before Euro funding runs out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Deputy could deduce from what I said that we were not going to meet the targets set out in the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999.  Of necessity, the list and starting dates in the annex to the programme were indicative.  One encounters difficulties when acquiring land.  Some of the projects are the subject of legal action, in others planning difficulties may arise, and new priorities may emerge. However, it is still envisaged that the plan will be completed within the timeframe set out.  We know the routes planned, the TENS &mdash; the Trans-European Networks &mdash; are also set out and, while the phasing might not be indentical to that suggested in the published plan, all the projects to which Deputy Quill <Col N="1598" /> referred will be completed within the timeframe 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am encouraged by the Minister's remarks, I should like to see some evidence of progress.  Would the Minister agree that, if he were to furnish an annual report to this House on the progress on this plan we would have a little more confidence in it? There are two projects for which there is no legal reason, or any other of which I am aware, for delay : one is the Blackpool, Cork by-pass on which so much industrial and commercial development depends, and the other is the Southern Cross route in Dublin, due to link the port of Dún Laoghaire with the national roads structure.  As there is no reason of which I am aware those projects should not commence in 1996, perhaps the Minister would give a reason as there is grave suspicion &mdash; I hope unfounded &mdash; that this plan is not being politically driven.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have been accused of not being very forthcoming on achievements of my Department.  I assure the Deputy that the great achievements of the national roads plan during my term in office will be published with as much fanfare as I can muster&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I will enable the Deputy to ascertain what has been accomplished.  The Deputy is being a little disingenuous in focusing exclusively on the Blackpool, Cork by-pass, a very important link road of which I am totally supportive while not mentioning that in 1995-96 practically a quarter of all national roads moneys are being spent on projects in County Cork.  I am referring to the Lee tunnel on which Cork Deputies lobbied for years but which is being correctly paid for this year.  Therefore, she will realise there is huge investment in the county of Cork, as there is elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> At the end of this year I look forward to opening the Northern Cross route, the northern end of the sea ring, and to advancing the southern end of the sea ring that will link into the N11 to places like Rosslare and the south-east.  All of the projects to which Deputy Quill referred are on my agenda and will be completed.  I should point out that between now and the completion of the plan some £1.099 billion will be spent on national primary roads and an additional £114 million on national secondary roads, complementing the huge increase for non-national roads I announced last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the requisite funding for the commencement of phase one of the Blackpool, Cork by-pass, a three-phase project with an attendant funding requirement of £4.1 million, not provided this year?  There is universal fear that the project will not be complete before the Euro funding runs out and that we will have the bizarre situation of a super fall-in highway from the county feeding into a quagmire of city streets.  If the work does not commence shortly the implications for job creation in Cork city are very real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Roads Authority, which has statutory responsibility for the implementation of the plan &mdash; and which is separate from me and my Department &mdash; could decide to spend all its funds in Cork this year and then, perhaps, the Deputy would be happy.  If most Deputies could say that between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the money being spent on national roads was spent in their county, they would do it with a sense of satisfaction and would not have the nerve to demand more.  The Blackpool by-pass will be built in the timeframe agreed by the National Roads Authority who will implement the responsibility given to it by this House under the provisions of section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 16, 25, 36 and 81 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 Public Service Vehicles Regulations brought about a fundamental re-structuring of the law applying to the licensing and operation of taxis and hackneys.  I made those regulations following consideration of the report of an interdepartmental committee, examination of the response to that report from local authorities, interest groups and the <Col N="1601" /> general public, and discussions with representatives of the various interest groups.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the regulations was to devolve to individual local authorities all of the significant functions relating to the licensing of taxis and hackneys and, in particular, the power to determine the number of new taxi licences which may be granted in respect of each taximeter area.  The regulations provide that before deciding to authorise the grant of new taxi licences, local authorities must engage in a public consultation process to ensure that the views of taxi interest groups and of people using taxi services are taken into account.</P>
    <P>Under the 1995 regulations, licences at all times remain the property of the issuing authority but can be renewed every two years on an ongoing basis by the holder.  Local authorities have power under the regulations to apply conditions or restrictions to the transfer of licences and can, in that context, introduce non-transferable licences if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to amend the regulations at this stage.  They were drafted, as I have already indicated, following a long review process, and it is now a matter for the local authorities concerned to apply them, as they consider appropriate in their areas.  I intend to review the position in the light of experience of the operation of the regulations, but I do not think that it would be right to initiate any review until at least one year after the commencement of the new system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I am pleased local authorities now have the power to determine the number of new taxi licences which may be granted in respect of each taximeter area.  I am pleased also that local authorities have the power to issue non-transferable licences because to date that information could not be obtained from the Department.  In relation to rented non-transferable taxi licences, does the Minister appreciate there is a <Col N="1602" /> danger of the taxi business falling into the hands of a private monopoly?  Traditionally, certainly in Dublin, a taxi operator had one plate but a couple have 12 or 15 plates while one company has approximately 30.  Local authorities in Dublin would wish to be able to rent non-transferable taxi licences in order to maintain total control rather than discover in 20 years' time that a private monopoly has a couple of hundred plates and, as such, has cornered the market.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on local authorities having the power to control rented non-transferable taxi licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of power has been devolved to local authorities under the new regulations.  I want to see how that will be implemented.  It is for local authorities to determine the number of licences.  If the local authority consider that somebody has a monopoly and is not using that monopoly well, it can issue more licences and set the fees for such issue and attach any conditions it wishes to the licence.  The licence will always remain the property of the local authority issuing it and is subject to review every second year.  Sufficient control is available to allow a local authority to determine the type and scale of taxi service and hackney service to be operated within their area.  My view is that those decisions are best made by local representatives who know the area rather than by me and officials of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the regulations were drawn up following consultation with representatives of the various interest groups.  It is only now when local authorities are exercising that authority and considering issuing new plates that they see the problems.  The points raised in my questions have arisen in the local authority of which I am a member.  What is the position about confining the licence to one driver only?  While the Minister emphasises that the local authority can impose whatever conditions it wishes we are <Col N="1603" /> restricted in our attempt to work within the regulations.  In Dublin where there are 2,000 taxis, 4,000 people earn their living from them because they are working 24 hours a day.  If the licence was confined to one driver, they would come out when the business was available rather than sit around at 11 a.m.  It may be that the Minister was not farseeing when considering his regulations.  Please accept that these are the problems we now see and we are stuck with issuing more plates under the old regulations. While the Minister has emphasised the conditions we are hamstrung.  If we have to pursue these issues I hope the Minister will give them a sympathetic hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always anxious to learn from experience.  If the experience in Dublin is that further changes in the regulations are required I will consider any such proposals.  I would like a reasonable period to elapse, having made significant and far-reaching changes, shortly after I became Minister and which came into force in September 1995, before initiating any review.  I would like to see how these nationwide regulations work.  If local authorities in Dublin, having put the regulations as they exist into effect, discover in six or eight months' time that further changes are required I will listen to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin City Council is under pressure because the other three councils have power to issue plates from August-September.  Because of this we have to move quickly and we cannot wait a year or so.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter in, say, August-September and decide if changes need to be made.  We have to make fundamental changes quickly or else the other three councils will begin to issue licences and form their own taxi areas.  We in Dublin City Council are under particular pressure and I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>I am pleased there is pressure which means it is imperative to make decisions, otherwise there might be a long process of reflection before any decision is made.  I will examine carefully any submission from Dublin City Council.  I did reflect on the issuing of a single driver taxi plate but I was not minded to do it because there was a great deal of evidence to suggest it was not the right thing to do.  If Dublin City Council makes a submission, having considered it is the right way to proceed, I will examine it afresh.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that there was consultation and discussion with sectors of the industry prior to making the regulations.</P>
      <P>The situation in Dublin is unique in that public transport brings thousands into the city at night and the service finishes before those people go home. Does the Minister support the view that Bus Átha Cliath and other elements of the public transport network should be party to such consultations?  Will he give an indication of the format for such consultations?</P>

The regulations are good and fair and they have been broadly welcomed.  I welcome them not only because they are a good way of dealing with traffic but they are also a good sampler of devolving powers.  Many local authorities welcome that decisions can be made locally rather than centrally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> In terms of the requirement to discuss at local level, I expect one would obviously hear the views at subcommittee level or council level of any interested group which wants to make a submission in advance of a determination being made.  The process cannot be open-ended but a reasonable opportunity must be given to those involved, including the consumer who is quite often excluded from consideration when these decisions are being made.</P>

It is easy to become confused when meeting all the different groups.  It is a good example of the devolution of power, but when the council comes back to the Minister will he give us a decision quickly?  It is important to the process that whatever we decide action is taken quickly, and that will entail the Minister coming back to us promptly with his response to our suggestions.</P>

        <i>Apropos</i> the pressure from the consumers to issue new taxi plates on the basis that there is an inadequate service, will the Minister arrange with his Government colleagues to take account of the fact that the pressure on taxi services is at pub closing time?  The customers of the public houses leave at the same time and with the road safety practices being developed in relation to drink driving, they all need taxis.  Consequently inordinate pressure is put on the service.  Does the Minister agree that apart from the need to reorganise the taxi and hackney services, account will have to be taken of the pressure at pub closing time which may mean a change in the licensing laws?  I know it is not <Col N="1606" /> the Minister's responsibility but he may have a relevant input with his Government colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 17, 28, 41 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>State grants for non-national roads in 1996, as shown in the 1996 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version), published in December 1995, amount to £146.36 million.  An additional sum of £0.5 million is available, to be allocated to eligible county councils, under the Peace Process Initiative; this was provided for separately in the Abridged Estimates.  Total grants available in 1996, therefore, amount to £146.86 million, which represents an increase of nearly 40 per cent on the base provision for 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> When I initiated the restoration programme for non-national roads last July, I allocated an additional £20 million to fund the programme in 1995. That special provision is repeated in 1996, and another £20 million has been added.  The additional £40 million brings to £73 million the total grants available this year for works connected with the pavement restoration programme.</P>
    <P>Expenditure of this magnitude requires that all possible steps should be taken to ensure the funds are spent efficiently and effectively and maximum output is achieved.  The framework which I recently announced for the administration and operation of the restoration programme includes a comprehensive package of measures designed to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Firm estimates of the cost of restoring the network are not available at present. Accordingly, a pavement condition study will be undertaken by consultants to determine the extent of the backlog of deficiencies in the network, and the cost of restoring it over a ten year period. This study should be completed before the end of the year and overall funding requirements can be determined at that stage.</P>
    <P>Definitive judgments are not possible, on the basis of available data, on the efficiency of local authority road operations. I am, therefore, arranging for an independent audit to be carried out covering all aspects of this, including the relative efficiency of direct labour operations as against the use of private contractors. I expect that the study will identify scope for improvements leading to cost savings and higher output.</P>
    <P>Details of the 1994 and 1995 grants for non-national roads are contained in a booklet which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the increase the Minister has obtained this year in the allocation for non-national roads &mdash; at worst it is a £26 million increase.  I am sure the Minister will thank Fianna Fáil for the pressure it put on the Government last year which <Col N="1609" /> enabled him to get the increase agreed at Cabinet.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have heard the Minister and the Taoiseach talk about a £750 million, ten year programme. Is that the case?  With regard to the study the Minister has undertaken, there is a study from the Institute of Engineers undertaken in 1992 which showed the total cost of restoring the pavements of non-national roads would have been in the region of £1 billion at that time, with a subsequent rate of attrition of 20 per cent.  Why the need for this further study when we know that the minimum cost will be £1 billion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the study is that we do not know.  We have disparate elements of data.  I tried to get an overall view of the matter last year because I thought I could get support from the Cabinet for a comprehensive package.  I was not able to get the data. We have some data which is helpful but it is not comprehensive.  We have data from local authorities and county engineers which is subjective and does not comprise a uniform analysis.  We are undertaking such an analysis.  Some work was done last year to obtain an indicative figure.  The figure arrived at was £750 million.  By the end of this year I will have a more perfect figure in terms of the actual cost involved.</P>
      <P>We have an infrastructure which has been valued at £16 billion.  It is estimated that 30 per cent of the entire non-national road network is deficient.  To bring the network up to standard a significant injection of additional funding is required.  We are starting from a base of approximately £100 million a year plus the funding from the local authorities' own sources.  It is possible, through the provision of additional Exchequer moneys and additional funding from the local authorities' own sources, to make a dramatic drive over a period of ten years to bring these roads up to desired standard.  The sum of £750 million is an indicative figure of the scale of works required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> I am glad I was in a position to commence the process.  Since my appointment non-national road allocations have been increased by 34 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned funding from the local authorities' own sources.  Will he confirm that the figure of £750 million will be made available exclusively by the Exchequer?</P>
      <P>In relation to the road restoration programme the Minister mentioned that the local authorities will be requested to submit programmes to the Department which will be reviewed periodically.  Will he confirm that the local authorities will have absolute discretion to decide which roads should be completed?</P>
      <P>I have acknowledged that additional funding is available, but is it not the case that the Minister has reduced the discretionary road grants to local authorities by almost 50 per cent in order to provide £20 million of the £73 million required&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to fund the road restoration programme, with the result that less money will be available for maintenance work, such as the surface dressing of roads, and we will face a bigger problem in five years' time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a pointless exercise if, following the provision of a significant increase in Exchequer resources, the local authorities reduced proportionately the allocation from their own sources.  I have made it plain to them &mdash; they have all responded favourably &mdash; that they should at least maintain the allocation from their own sources at its current level and, if possible, try to increase it in line with inflation.  Most have done much better. The figure mentioned is the total required from Exchequer resources.  I hope that this will be augmented significantly by funding provided from the local authorities' own sources, <Col N="1611" /> depending on the ability of individual councils to contribute.</P>
      <P>When I examined the matter in some detail I discovered that there were <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements, in terms of the way potholes were filled and patching work was carried out.  I am providing for a measure of regulation and the local authorities are co-operating.  It is a matter for them and local authority members to decide which roads should be improved.  I have indicated, however, that at least one kilometre should be done at a time, not six or 15 yards with the result that we end up with a crazy pavement pattern.  The public should be able to see the value of the work being done.</P>
      <P>The funding for pavement works has been combined in one allocation, rather than five or six subheads under which small sums would be available to local authorities, to ensure we obtain real value.  It has been indicated to me by county engineers and managers and the chairman of local authorities that the impact this year will be remarkable.  In coming years we should be able to achieve the objective we have been talking about for decades, that is, bringing non national roads up to an acceptable standard.  This is the first real vote of confidence in rural Ireland in many a long year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for adopting a strategic approach to the restoration and reconstruction of county roads.  The additional funding is welcome. It is important that we obtain value for money every inch of the way as it costs millions of pounds to improve small stretches of roads and billions of pounds for major roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it is his intention to carry out an efficiency audit.  Does he have a timeframe in mind so that we obtain a clear picture at an early stage as to which is the more efficient way of approaching roadworks, whether it be direct labour or private contractors?  When does he expect to <Col N="1612" /> receive the results and when can we expect to see changes made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the agreement of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance to engage the Efficiency Audit Group which operates under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach to oversee the independent study of the way roadworks are carried out in each local authority area, the aim of which is to ensure best practice, uniformity, high standards and maximum output.  I do not have a definite timeframe in mind, but the benefits will be seen immediately it starts work.  This may be an ongoing process&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government gave a commitment to devolve greater powers to the local authorities.  It is a management function to nominate the roads for which funding should be made available.  While I welcome the increases the problem in Cork is that the discretionary grant has been reduced by £1.6 million this year.  As a consequence, insufficient funding will be available to carry out patching work on certain roads.  Another problem is that after a period of ten years the condition of some roads will be such that it will be much more expensive to bring them up to the required standard.  Will the Minister consider this aspect and perhaps next year allow the local authorities and local authority members more discretion to nominate roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If my memory serves me correctly, in excess of £13 million was allocated to the Cork local authority this year.  A number of roads had to be <Col N="1613" /> specifically nominated for improvement by my Department in order to comply with European Union criteria.  I have given as much discretion as possible to local authorities to identify roads that need improvement.  the only criteria I laid down for the restoration programme relate to the quality of work on pavements, engineering qualifications and audits.  I am sure nobody will quibble with that.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 12, 43, 48 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Overall responsibility for the provision of traffic signs on the national road network is a matter for the National Roads Authority.  Responsibility for signposting on non-national roads is a matter for each local road authority.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the policy and practice relating to the use of both Irish and English in traffic signs, a circular was issued to all road authorities on 30 September 1994, setting out revised guidelines relating to the use of Irish on traffic signs.  For the first time, it was directed that all new information signs not depicting place names must display text in both languages.  Bilingual signs must display the Irish text in italics above the English text which must be in Roman letters.  Under section 95 (16) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 the guidelines in the circular have the force of law and I do not envisage that further legislation or regulation would improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals to amend the present arrangements as set out in the <Col N="1615" /> circular.  These arrangements were introduced following both a review of the practice applied to bilingual signs in other European countries, including Wales, and consultation with An Grupa Stiúrtha for Irish in the local government service.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that there is a specific link between signposting and road accidents or that our signing system creates undue difficulties for tourists generally.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive traffic signs manual is being prepared by my Department for use by road authorities.  This will set out the standards required for all types of road signs.  I am confident that will lead to significant improvements in traffic signing generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the proliferation of signs and the <i>ad hoc</i> way they are placed along roadsides give rise to a great deal of confusion?  It is important that proper design procedures are adopted by his Department for transmission to local authorities. Will the Minister request local authorities to be sympathetic towards small private sector developers who are consistently frustrated by local authorities in their efforts to erect well designed directional signs, particularly for bed and breakfast accommodation in rural areas?  I understand local authorities frequently refuse to allow such operators erect signs at appropriate strategic locations.  While I accept they must conform to certain standards along the lines set out in the Minister's circular, will he direct local authorities to be more sympathetic towards small self-employed operators who are frustrated in their efforts to erect signs, even those funded by themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three types of statutory sign, information, regulatory and warning.  The type of sign mentioned by the Deputy would fit into the category of information signs for tourist destinations or bed and breakfast premises. I am aware from people in County <Col N="1616" /> Wexford of the concerns that may arise from a proliferation of such signs.  A large number of them can be unsightly. They are also dangerous on main traffic routes because people can become distracted by them.  We must strike a balance. Many local authorities accept finger post signing of set dimensions, proportions and coloration.  A balance must be struck between the commercial needs of small operators and road traffic requirements and determination in that regard is best made at local authority level.  The regulations and legislation allow discretion to be applied sympathetically, if necessary, while at the same time maintaining the priority of road safety.</P>

The guidelines in the circular are mandatory and binding on road authorities.  If the Deputy has specific instances in mind, I will examine them.  If he believes a road authority is not complying with the statutory regulations he should alert my Department and we will discuss the matter directly with the road authority concerned.</P>
      <P>In regard to specific signs, in particular, place signs, under the regulations the only place names that will appear on signs in Gaeltacht areas are the leaganacha Gaeilge den ainm.</P>

      <P>In his reply, the Minister said there was no connection between poor signs and road accidents.  Will he explain the basis on which he made that statement?  Surveys in the United Kingdom demonstrate that where there has been improved road signage there has been a significant reduction in the number of road accidents.  People in the United Kingdom claim that good road signage is an important information and safety feature.  If that applies there, I fail to understand why it would not apply here.  Despite the regulations, our signage system is very unsatisfactory.  It is not unusual, particularly in summer months, to see a car driven by a tourist stopped on a roundabout holding up traffic while the driver tries to read a sign and his co-pilot a map.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that, despite the regulations, our road signs system is <Col N="1618" /> very unsatisfactory?  I urge him to go back to the drawing boards, as he did in the case of the county roads, and put in place at national level a blueprint for road signs which could then be implemented on a local authority basis. The system is unsatisfactory from the point of view of road safety, tourism and the motorists who contribute a great deal of money every year to the Exchequer by way of taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific link has been brought to my attention between particular accidents and bad signposting but I accept that signposting is essential in a comprehensive, safe traffic management plan.  On the last occasion I answered questions in the House I outlined a number of initiatives I intended taking in relation to the whole area of road safety, one of which was drafting a comprehensive traffic signs manual which is well under way.  That will be issued to every local authority and it will bring about a degree of uniformity in respect of the signs erected by local authorities, particularly local road authorities. The national primary roads are the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.  I indicated previously to the House that the NRA embarked last year on a multi-annual sign improvement programme.  It started on the N1 and N2 during 1995 and it will continue on the other national primary routes in the coming years to improve not only signposting but road marking because it is equally important that there is clear delineation in the lines painted on roads.  All these measures are part of the ongoing work to improve road safety.</P>

      <P>We may not have specific details of how this problem has contributed to accidents but I have no doubt it has definitely caused some marital problems on occasions.  Our road signs are not satisfactory.  A number of days ago I attended a funeral which the Minister's colleague also attended.  Myself and three others travelled together and we noticed that the signs on both the motorway and the <Col N="1619" /> minor roads were appalling.  Some of them were old, bent, dirty and badly illuminated.  In comparison with road signs in other countries they are a joke and something must be done about them.  In some countries road signs are sponsored by oil companies.  The company logo is usually small and discreet and the signs are clearly visible.  Will the Minister consider the possibility of allowing road signs to be sponsored by private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Something is being done about the difficulty to which the Deputy referred.  The National Roads Authority is upgrading signs and road markings on a route by route system.  On the question of sponsorship, the local authority of which I was a member accepted sponsorship from a motor firm, Mazda, to sponsor road signs on the non-national roads.  That is open to them if they wish to do so.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider making a regulation that all signs, regulatory, information or place names, would be bilingual, the only difference being that the Irish would be an uachtar in the Gaeltacht while the English would be an uachtar in non-Gaeltacht areas.  The present system leads to the ridiculous belief that people from non-Irish speaking areas never visit the Gaeltacht while those from the Gaeltacht never manage to make their way out of the reservations to the non-Irish speaking areas.  In addition, it does not take account of the Irish speakers living in various areas throughout the country.  In Wales, all the road signs are statutorily equal in both languages.  Will the Minister consider, in a country with two official constitutional languages, passing a regulation that all signs without exception would be bilingual on that basis?</P>

Road signs is the only matter on which we seem to have a difficulty but I must bear in mind the advice I am given in relation to traffic safety.  I am considering the matter but if putting &ldquo;yield right of way&rdquo; and &ldquo;géil slí&rdquo; on the same sign is confusing and causes an accident, we must take that into account.  I will consider the proposal made by the Deputy.  The only area not covered at present under the regulation is in relation to warning signs but if I can change the regulation and make billingual signs compulsory without impacting on traffic safety, which is my main consideration, I will certainly do that.</P>

I have already indicated to the Deputy that I <Col N="1621" /> will again reflect on making warning signs bilingual.  My Department has gathered evidence on road signs not only from Wales but from Finland and other countries.  If I can be convinced that it will not have any adverse effect on road safety, I will certainly do as the Deputy asks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 26 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, empowers planning authorities to attach conditions to planning permissions while section 26 (2) contains specific provisions for conditions requiring contributions towards expenditure already incurred, or to be incurred, by the planning authority in respect of works which have facilitated, or will facilitate, the proposed development.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the attachment to planning permissions of contribution conditions, and on the contributions required, are matters for the relevant planning authority in the first instance. Such conditions can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála, which can, where it considers it appropriate, give to the planning authority directions relating to the attachment, amendment or removal of conditions to which the appeal relates, or of other conditions.</P>
      <P>The principle of requiring a developer, in appropriate cases, to contribute to the cost of services facilitating a proposed development has been established since the inception of the present planning code more than 30 years, and I see no reason to depart from that now. In some cases planning contributions make it possible to permit development sooner than might be the case if the necessary services had to be provided solely out of public expenditure.  Where a developer considers that contribution conditions are unreasonable or excessive, the matter can be reviewed by An Bord Pleanála on appeal.  In these circumstances, I have no proposals to amend the Planning Acts in this respect.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his position on this matter?  I accept his statement about the original intent of section 26 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, but this power is <Col N="1627" /> now being abused by local authorities who are attaching conditions to all sorts of planning applications.  The latest example of which I am aware involved an extension to a house where a person was being charged £4,300 for works to be undertaken by the local authority. The Minister should look again at this provision and issue firmer guidelines to local authorities.  It is all very well to tell people they can make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála but many people are afraid to do so in case more stringent conditions are applied.  This power is being abused at present and I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>There is some merit in what the Deputy says.  In general the principle is right, but imposing onerous conditions would be an abuse.  I do not want to get involved in the planning process because there is a statutory planning procedure with an appeal process to An Bord Pleanála.  However, I will look at any case the Deputy wants to refer to me and take it up with the local authorities concerned to find out if a view is emerging that this is an easy way to augment incomes.  That is not what is intended in the Planning Act.</P>

      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputies Connor and Jim Mitchell.</P>
      <P>It is with a sense of sadness and distress I speak in this debate having just heard the news that Central London is once again closed down &mdash; an explosive device has been found and thankfully made safe.  On this occasion there is no loss of life, but it raises the very upsetting scenario that once again we are into a saga of ongoing violence.  This must raise new worries about the progress of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which looks at obstacles to reconciliation in the South. I was reminded once again of the slow process involved in negotiation when people have a totally different history, background and perspective.  At that meeting, and at many others at the <Col N="1721" /> forum, I saw the willingness of people to work to find a solution, to restructure language, to maintain inclusion.  The difficulties of arriving at a consensus were clearly illustrated at forum meetings. That mirrors the experience of every peace forum.  To develop our work we need strong motivation, strong commitment to peaceful politics, to dialogue and to discussion.  These are critical.</P>
    <P>It saddens me that the work of the forum has been put in abeyance by the violence of last Friday.  What purpose is served if we stop the meetings of the forum, and Sinn Féin and its political leaders are excluded once again?  This is the price we pay as a democratic society when violence is used.  These are the enormous setbacks we suffer.  Nothing justifies the use of violence such as was used last Friday, not the slow rate of progress, not the many setbacks.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy to the families of those who died and to those who suffered injury in the Canary Wharf bombing. It injured not just families and individuals, but halted the tentative steps towards peaceful democracy and the courageous steps of many people in the last year and a half.  It seriously injured the hopes of everyone.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell report is a well written, optimistic document.  It offered hope and a way forward.  One of the key phrases in it referred to the need for a decommissioning of mind sets.  We are reminded yet again, by the events of the past week, of this most difficult of all processes without which none of us is able to take the necessary risks for peace.  Perhaps much more than decommissioning of arms, this is the challenge for the IRA, and one they are failing to accept.  No matter what political obstacles or differences emerge the people of this island now expect and want the future to be negotiated.  They want negotiation, not violence.</P>
    <P>There are many questions for all sides, many questions preoccupying us, including the role and current relationship of Sinn Féin to the IRA and the range of its influence.  How are people to believe the IRA if another ceasefire <Col N="1722" /> is announced?  In the aftermath of the bombing have the Unionists the ability to move beyond their old rhetoric which reinforces positions held and is so full of hopelessness and mistrust, and has the British Government the courage to challenge Unionist intransigence?  There are questions for all sides.</P>
    <P>John Major has taken risks for peace and I congratulate him on taking them. However, there is no question but that the British Government has serious questions to answer about its response to the Mitchell report.  It deserved a much more detailed and considered response, involving both Governments, in keeping with the partnership approach.  It deserved serious discussion and commitment at the highest level.  I had a terrible sense of foreboding when I saw how that report had been responded to.</P>
    <P>Nothing justifies violence, but we must look at certain issues.  There is a Fine Gael report on a visit to republican prisoners in Britain from 15 to 17 January 1996.  I do not have time to go into the details of that report but the delegation concluded by saying:&ldquo;it is with regret that we conclude that current Home Office treatment of prisoners is actually damaging and destabilising the peace process&rdquo;.  I have to ask why there was no progress in 17 months without violence.  Why was there no progress on repatriation, and a marked deterioration in the conditions of those held in special secure units?  These are questions that have to be answered.</P>
    <P>Mary Holland said on radio the other day that we must ask if we have done enough to maintain the peace.  It is clear that maintenance of peace is the responsibility of all citizens and cannot be a matter for politicians alone, although politicians must lead.  We have to encourage people power, and we are certainly seeing that at the moment. People power can inform, shape and move us as politicians, and move the process forward.  Politics cannot fail on this occasion.  We cannot fail to create for our children an Ireland of hope, not despair.  As politicians we have to rise <Col N="1723" /> beyond the old mind sets with imagination and boldness.  It is so easy for old ways to predominate, to hear the same voices and the same stereotyped comments. This is a particular difficulty in politics in the North.  The sense of hopelessness and helplessness among ordinary people last weekend is a warning that we need to find effective and meaningful ways to make this process not simply inclusive of all political leaders and factions but of people.</P>
    <P>The media has a role to play in this by airing the broadest possible representation of views, North and South.  I want more women to contribute.  I listened to programme after programme on the North without hearing their views. That is intolerable.  If we are to create a new Ireland it must be shaped by men and women and women's voices must be heard.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to hear the Taoiseach and Tánaiste say the door is still open to Sinn Féin.  It is very important that meetings be held at official level and that discussions continue.  We must also examine how the Mitchell report can be put centre stage.  The proposal by John Hume should also be seriously considered as should that of the Tánaiste on multilateral proximity talks.  We must consider all possibilities even those we may instinctively resist as without discussion there is no basis for rejection.</P>
    <P>Many of us reacted instinctively to the proposal to hold elections put forward by the Unionists and the British Government.  I share that sense of suspicion and cynicism because it is almost inevitable that the outcome would reinforce old attitudes and positions. However, I, too, must decommission my scepticism.  We must have a credible election process to break through stereotype views.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that much of what occurred at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation has been lost.  We know the contribution made by the voluntary sector North and South and must assess how such contributions can reach wider <Col N="1724" /> audiences.  All television stations, RTE, BBC and UTV, must examine that issue.</P>
    <P>When I last spoke on Northen Ireland I said the bombs and guns may be in tactical abeyance but we must work to ensure that the philosophies which condone their use lose sway.  Last Friday's events show that much work needs to be done.  I said that the challenge for the IRA is to enter the democratic process and acknowledge that it can accomplish much more on behalf of Nationalists by providing a radical new dimension to politics in Northen Ireland.  I also said it was a hard road and that the future would show whether the IRA has the genuine interests of Nationalists at heart.  A resumed campaign of intimidation of its own people and the further destroying and polarising of society in the North would confirm that it serves no interest but its own.  I call on it to reconsider its actions.</P>
    <P>President de Klerk was asked at the Forum what had made the difference in South Africa.  He said that there could not be a long-term solution that did not involve all the major parties and population groups in our country.  His speech bears reading and discussion.  There can be only one choice for the future.  During the past 18 months we glimpsed the depths of the rewards that await us. With that in mind let us find, and support our leaders in finding, the necessary reserves of courage, imagination and determination to restore peace and hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time. Violence is morally and politically wrong.  If people are maimed and murdered, bigotry, prejudice and hatred will be heightened instead of being eased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too much blame has been laid at the door of the British Government.  While it is to blame for much it should not be blamed unrealistically.  John Major's duty to his party is to survive in Government for as long as he can.  Because of the dodgy arithmetic in the House of Commons he looked to the Unionists for support.  For many years, the SDLP <Col N="1725" /> has committed its votes to the Labour Party Whip in the House of Commons. Where is the sense in that when it could have used its four votes to support the British Government and as leverage to get what it wanted for Northern Ireland?  The SDLP has given that leverage to the Unionists and now it screams and complains that the British Government is not playing fair.  It is unrealistic to criticise Mr. Major for playing for time in the hope that the opinion polls improve.</P>
    <P>There have been urgent and repeated calls from the Government, Sinn Féin, the SDLP and people on the street for all-party talks to commence immediately. That is unrealistic.  I cannot see any circumstances in which Dr. Ian Paisley will talk to the Irish Government let alone Sinn Féin.  There is a danger that we are in a cul de sac on this issue and have turned down the one suggestion that might break the impasse, that is, an election.  While I am not in favour of just any election I can see circumstances in which a plebiscite/referendum might break the logjam.</P>
    <P>The position in Northern Ireland has been compared to that in South Africa, Bosnia, Israel and Palestine.  There are legitimate comparisons to be made but to compare any IRA or Sinn Féin leader with Nelson Mandela or Yasser Arafat is absurd.  They represent the over-whelming majority of their people but Sinn Féin and the IRA represent a tiny minority whether in the North or South.</P>
    <P>As long as Unionists remain intransigent all party talks are extremely doubtful. I hope they can be achieved through holding an election/referendum or round table/proximity talks.  However, I cannot see Dr. Paisley agreeing to compromise.  He has forgotten that you do not have to make peace with your friends but with your enemies.  If the perceived enemy is this State or Sinn Féin they are the people with whom he will have to make peace yet he seems to be a total bigot in that respect.</P>
    <P>We should not abandon other possibilities, including both Governments <Col N="1726" /> operating together and agreeing on matters which would show the Nationalist community in the North that their rights are recognised.  Why is it not possible for the two Governments to agree to give RTE access to the airwaves in Northern Ireland?  Why is it not possible to give Aer Lingus access rights to Belfast Airport?</P>
    <P>If local councils in the North are dominated by Protestants the chairman will be a Protestant.  The same does not apply to Catholic dominated councils. Why does the British Government not legislate, as we did, to ensure that committees reflect the strength of parties in the council and that their chair rotates thus ensuring Nationalist involvement?</P>
    <P>The RUC is not an acceptable police force in its present form.  However, it would create major problems for the Protestant community if it were disbanded. We should examine a system of two tier policing, provincial policing under the RUC and district policing under each council, 11 of which have Nationalist majorities and 15 of which have Protestant majorities.  The two Governments must work in unison.  If there is a lack of trust or confidence between them, there is no hope.  It is vitally important that bridges are rebuilt and that trust and confidence is restored.  Mr. Ashdown laid down the iron law, which we can repeat, that the two Governments must work together in trust and harmony.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal more to say but I want to give Deputy Connor the opportunity to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for sharing time with me.  I am shocked by the news that a bomb was planted at Charing Cross, one of the busiest areas of London.  On a normal day 500,000 people or more will pass that way.  If that bomb had gone off, people would have been killed in their hundreds.  We must condemn that approach to dealing with the Northern Ireland problem.  I condemn absolutely the bombing of Canary Wharf last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have served on the Forum for Peace <Col N="1727" /> and Reconciliation since April 1995.  It has been a truly remarkable experience to listen to the viewpoints of Catholics and Protestants who have come to the forum &mdash; ordinary people from community and women's groups, sporting organisations, the Churches &mdash; and given an honest account of how they think the situation in Northern Ireland should progress, its relationship with the Republic and the set of relationships between Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Republic.  A common thread in all submissions is the need for peace and resolution of conflict and the great ease that people enjoyed during the ceasefire.  Everyone hoped the ceasefire would hold, that arms would be decommissioned and there would be permanent peace.  What happened on Friday last and what might have happened today in Charing Cross almost shatters that dream.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Government's work in preparing for the ceasefire.  The Government changed attitudes towards a great many people.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds realised we had an historic opportunity to change attitudes to Sinn Féin-IRA, to work with Sinn Féin as a political organisation with a small mandate because it was a conduit to the people who held arms.  That would have been unthinkable five years ago but the Government made that quantum leap.  The same generosity and willingness to change and grasp the historic opportunity did not exist, unfortunately, in Whitehall.  It did not exist in the portals of Glengall Street, the headquarters of the Unionist Party.  That is very unfortunate.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary backbench member of the Government I call on our friends in Westminster whose hearts are in the right place not to become prisoners of a small minority but to seize the opportunity. We would have expected the British Prime Minister to accept the Mitchell report without question &mdash; there are questions, of course, that Sinn Féin never fully accepted the report but it behoved the British Government to <Col N="1728" /> accept it without question.  I would have wished to draw analogies with Belgium and so on but time does not allow that.</P>

      <P>The past year and a half has given a small taste of what peace means to people, North and South.  Tourism has been booming in the South creating extra jobs for young people and a source of extra income in rural areas.  Many people were able to fulfil a lifetime ambition to travel safely to see the beautiful scenery in Northern Ireland.  We were looking forward to having the security and prison forces allocated to combat the drugs and crime problems.  What do we do now?  Foreign and British tourists flocked here when peace was declared and were impressed with the scenery and the hospitality they enjoyed.  Multi-nationals were again looking at this country as a suitable base for their operations.</P>
      <P>The peace process helped to boost our economy.  The benefits to the people in the North were even greater because they had suffered most.  Their children could again play in safety, teenagers could enjoy their formative years without hatred and bitterness.  We no longer had daily deaths and people were slowly beginning to trust one another.  The Van Morrison song &ldquo;There will be days like this&rdquo; meant peace not war.  The Northern Ireland tourism industry recorded best ever earnings and there was a reawakening of Northern Ireland's potential as a base for industry.  Cross-Border co-operation was at an all time high and there were joint promotions in tourism and agriculture.  The peace process has shown what a great country we could have and people North and South deserve the rewards that peace brings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject totally the actions of the British Government in sending extra troops <Col N="1729" /> to Northern Ireland.  The Prime Minister's unwillingness to promote the peace process is disastrous.  Every effort to start talks has been hindered by the British who have totally ignored the hard work and effort it took to create the peace process.  It upsets me and those whom I represent when I think of the time and effort that was invested by people trying to achieve peace because when they handed the peace baton to the politicians, disaster struck; the Unionists refused to take it and threw it on the ground.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Major, would not run with it.  Perhaps the Irish Government could have put more effort into getting both of them involved in the race for peace.  Is the British Government trying to avoid dealing with the issue?  If it had reacted differently when peace was declared 18 months ago we might have a different situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>My view of the situation in Northern Ireland is informed by political and personal contacts in district council and other circles.  I was honoured a number of years ago as chairman of Clare County Council to lead a delegation in the first formal twinning of councils North and South, facilitated by Co-operation North.  I learned that contact is good and improves relations.</P>
      <P>I share the sense of revulsion of all Members at the return to violence with the Canary Wharf bombing.  I share the deep sense of despair of my friends in Northern Ireland and the ordinary people who live there at the prospect of their peace of mind being shattered and their daily lives blighted by violence and the fear of violence.  Unfortunately we have come to experience the fear of violence in this part of the country in recent months and have come to understand what it means.  There is no evidence that the London bombing was a once-off tactical intervention.  Consequently, there has never been a more urgent need for decisive and imaginative political action based on informed analysis of the current position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech of my party leader, <Col N="1730" /> Deputy Bertie Ahern, was universally welcomed.  Some Opposition Members, when they drew the attention of the House to shortcomings of Government policy, were branded as undermining consensus in the House.  We must be clear about this matter.  The Fianna Fáil Party Leader has set out the party's position for support.  That should not and does not preclude Members from expressing concern about aspects of handling the peace process.  Virtually every speaker has heaped blame on the British Government, and I agree with them, but we must examine the role of this House and the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the Taoiseach's performance.  He has worked well in terms of the peace process.  I agree with the view of my party leader on the involvement of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  The Tánaiste has found himself in a difficult position, changing from one role under Deputy Reynolds to a very different role under the Taoiseach.  Nobody would find such a transition easy and it is impossible for him to continue to play that role.  I suggest that the Taoiseach appoints a Minister to deal specifically with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The actions of the IRA last Friday were morally and tactically wrong.  The peace agreement of 1994 was a wonderful achievement.  At the time many people did not want peace, did not believe it would come about and have tried to bring it to an end ever since.  I am talking not only about the Loyalists but about some of their fellow travellers in the media who have predicted for some time that the peace process would break down.  If it comes to an end &mdash; I am horrified at the stories I heard today &mdash; there will be no forgiveness for those responsible.  I am referring not only to the IRA but to everybody involved in the process.  There is a huge onus on everybody to keep the show on the road.  It would be an absolute disgrace if the peace process is allowed to break down because of arrogance and pig-headedness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> I cannot understand the minds of republicans.  I see no future in going back to a campaign of violence.  They tried that for 25 years and it did not get them to the negotiating table.  At the same time we must try to understand their view.  They are not democrats. They have a mind-set which is moulded by their environment, where for many years they believed they were treated as second-class citizens.  We must try to work with them and there is no point in demonising them.  We must continue to talk to those who are politically minded within Sinn Féin.  We can stand on our high horse, make many demands and retreat into our own position, but that will not contribute to progress.</P>
    <P>I understand the responsibility on the Taoiseach, but I urge him to keep the doors of communication open to those who have influence on the republican movement, otherwise we will have to endure another 25 years of violence.  We should try to understand the minds of those working at the coalface such as Gerry Adams and his colleagues.  The political reputations of many of us might be damaged by this process, but for those living at the coalface, more than their reputations will be damaged.</P>
    <P>The actions of the IRA last week and again today undermine the standing of the republican movement.  We should try to bring about a position where they will be listened to by their colleagues. Some people seem to think that the position today is similar to that in the 1970s and they personalise every contribution made.  Gerry Adams and his colleagues may have suffered a severe setback last week, but there is no point in dancing on their graves; nothing will be achieved by that.  Breaking links with the IRA Army Council will not contribute to the process.</P>
    <P>The republican movement believed it would be sitting round the table at all-party talks within a couple of months of August 1994, and it is regrettable that did not happen.  I urge the Government not to be discouraged by the events of last week and today.  If we reject talks it <Col N="1732" /> will only lead to violence.  As long as there is hope I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to keep the doors of communication open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has shown the maturity of Irish democracy. It has been measured and balanced in tone and content.  Even when criticisms were made they were constructive and well meant.  The fact that the debate was sustained over three days demonstrates the deeply felt wish of all our people for peace.  Many speakers wished for more time to explain their views and put on record their rejection of the appalling act of violence at Canary Wharf which left two innocent people dead and very many with injuries they will bear for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>In particular I appreciate the thoughtful and constructive approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in his speech on Tuesday. The Government is working and will continue to work assiduously to have the ceasefire restored.  That is essential for progress.  The Government, with the British Government, will continue its efforts to bring forward proposals which will ensure that all-party talks take place.  As Deputy Ahern said, it was &ldquo;a profound miscalculation for those who carried out or authorised this bombing to believe that their political case will be strengthened by last Friday's action&rdquo;. He also said: &ldquo;The bomb has damaged the credibility of all of us who urge people to put their trust in the commitment to peace of the movement which combines Sinn Féin and the IRA&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not need to underscore that the argument to convince all the relevant parties to come to the negotiation table has been made much more difficult by the bombing.  In an interview today in <i>An Phoblacht</i>, a spokesman for the IRA claims that there was a <i>quid pro quo</i> understanding that all-party talks would commence rapidly after a complete cessation of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spokesman says that was a clear and unambiguous understanding with the previous Taoiseach about which he <Col N="1733" /> was clear and of which I was informed on assuming office.  Let me make it clear to the House that I was not informed of any such clear and unambiguous understanding. I was not informed of any specific understanding or deal of that kind with the previous Government in relation to talks.</P>
    <P>In his speech Deputy Bertie Ahern said that Fianna Fáil, too, needs to be self-critical and perhaps it could and should have done more to tie down firmly Sinn Féin and the IRA on the one hand and the British Government on the other to more explicit commitments before the ceasefire, assuming this could have been achieved.  The tradegy of the abrogation of the ceasefire is compounded, as I said on Tuesday, by the fact that so much progress was being made on the Irish Government's proposal for proximity talks.  The path to all-party talks was being cleared slowly but steadily when this bomb shattered the lives of innocent people in London who had done nothing against Ireland to deserve their fate.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate Deputy after Deputy sent out a clear and unequivocal signal to all who would seek to pursue political aims by violent means.  Those who sincerely wish to stand with us will never be denied a place provided violence does not form any part of their political agenda.</P>
    <P>The key challenge for Sinn Féin is to secure the restoration by the IRA of the complete cessation of hostilities.  Until that situation prevails, the Government cannot and will not treat that party in the same way it treated it throughout the IRA ceasefire.  At the same time we recognise the right of Sinn Féin to bring the people it represents into politics. The Government sincerely hopes that party will bring itself back into the fold of exclusively democratic and peaceful politics.  That is why we are leaving open official channels of communication.</P>
    <P>As I said on Tuesday, both Governments must now steer the process towards our shared aim of reaching an agreed settlement.  Securing the necessary allegiance to any such settlement <Col N="1734" /> demands that the value of parity of esteem and equality of treatment apply throughout.  I use the word &ldquo;values&rdquo; advisedly because that conveys the sense of fairness which must apply in all societies, especially in those divided on grounds of identity, allegiance and aspirations.  These values must be reflected in all the key principles and structures applying to a future talks process. In particular, therefore, the three core relationships at the heart of present divisions will need to be addressed in a comprehensive way.  No one relationship can be subservient to the other two. That is vital to the accordance of equal respect for the aspirations and identities of both traditions on this island.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Raphael Burke on the integrity of the six principles set out in paragraph 20 of the Mitchell report.  Those principles, with the recommendations on decommissioning, offer a new and insightful signpost to all-party talks.</P>
    <P>As far as the Unionist parties are concerned, a unique challenge rests with the UDP and the PUP to do everything possible in the interests of ensuring that the ceasefire of the combined loyalist military command holds.  Loyalists, even if they define their nationality differently, have shared the pride in the peace process and I hope that pride sustains them in the days and weeks ahead.  A special onus rests on the shoulders of the two main Unionist parties.  It is not good enough simply to retrospectively cite last Friday's bombing as justification for their minimalist response to the unprecedented opportunity presented by the ceasefires.  The building of peace and the working towards agreement requires a greater generosity of spirit from the two main Unionist parties than was evident throughout the past 17 months.</P>
    <P>This is a particularly difficult time for the SDLP.  For many years John Hume and his party struggled, often in very difficult circumstances, to have the voice of democratic nationalism heard in Northern Ireland.  They spoke the language of tolerance, forgiveness and <Col N="1735" /> equality.  Guided by those values John Hume made a judgment to engage in face to face dialogue with the Sinn Féin leader while the IRA campaign was still under way and in that dialogue the seeds of the ceasefires were sown.  I know that he and all members of his party are deeply disappointed that his courage and trust in the republican movement were dashed by the IRA bombing last Friday.</P>
    <P>While it is important to reflect on the mistakes of the past in order that we may learn from them, it is also important that we, collectively, should not become despondent about the future.  We must be neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but realistic.  We must be willing to trust again, perhaps less than before, but enough to work positively. This requires a positive act of will to postpone some of the necessary reflections on the awfulness of what has happened and to try again.</P>
    <P>The Government will leave no stone unturned in the search for political agreement in an environment of lasting peace.  The British Prime Minister and I agreed last Sunday to the pursuit of two key objectives, first, to secure the restoration of the IRA ceasefire and, second, to continue our work towards the commencement of all-party negotiations. With a view to achieving those objectives I suggested five issues to the Prime Minister on which the two Governments need to work together in advance of our planned meeting later this month.  The five issues include the creation of a way forward in which Sinn Féin could honourably rejoin the political process when the IRA campaign is over; a way in which this Government's proximity talks proposal might be further developed, particularly in the context of the principles and recommendations set out in the Mitchell report which affect all-party negotiations; whether and how an elective process, which would meet the Mitchell conditions, might follow from proximity talks and could lead directly and speedily to all-party negotiations; the need to <Col N="1736" /> consider John Hume's proposals for referenda North and South as a means of mandating all parties on this island to pursue political agreement by unequivocally democratic methods and how the active role of the United States Administration might be deepened to augment our shared efforts towards peace and agreement.  Agreement, not imposition, must apply to those five issues.  The principles of parity of esteem and equality of treatment for Nationalist and Unionist communities must at all times guide our actions towards the achievement of our shared aims.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government should pursue the policy it believes is right.  It should not pursue a policy designed to appease or to provoke the IRA which, unfortunately, will work to its agenda.  The Irish Government must pursue the agenda that it, as a democratically elected Government, believes is right for the Irish people.  It must take its stand on that basis.</P>
    <P>I stress that the task is now immensely complex.  Getting agreement between the two Governments and across both northern communities on the five issues I mentioned while violence continues is not something that can be done easily in a week.  I have no illusions about that after all that has happened.  I do not propose to set an impossible task.  That would be of no service to the House.  For those reasons I propose to be as truthful as I can with the House about the difficulties that remain in our way.  We must be honest enough to admit that the unilateral revocation of the ceasefire puts in question the entire basis of the peace process as it had been operating previously.  The Government had to establish a clear public distinction between the approach pursued in conditions of ceasefire and the approach it will follow now that the ceasefire has been revoked.  A democratic Government cannot allow any perception to grow that it condones violence in any way.  It cannot accept any blurring of the line between democratic processes and the use or threat of <Col N="1737" /> violence.  The bomb, unfortunately, gives cause to those who questioned the genuineness of the ceasefire all along.</P>
    <P>We must be willing to ask ourselves questions, including ones that are profoundly uncomfortable.  The assumption made by some throughout the last 16 months that as long as nationalist Ireland stayed together there was little risk of an IRA bomb has not been altogether vindicated.  In the last three weeks all of nationalist Ireland, as one might describe it, was actually more united than it has been for many months.  We all were agreed in our opposition to what was seen as a preemptive approach to elections. Nationalist Ireland was never more united, the IRA chose to let off a bomb in London.  People should reflect a while on that.</P>
    <P>There are other questions which we must be honest enough to ask ourselves. If there was a ceasefire tomorrow and all-party talks started next week, would the IRA resume violence whenever the talks reached a difficult point from a republican point of view?  Is there anything that Sinn Féin can say to convince people that this assumption would be wrong?  If the republican movement's position is that there would be no split and not a single bullet will be handed over until a final settlement is reached, does this mean that a small minority can, as a matter of principle, always dictate policy to the entire movement?  Is Sinn Féin willing to support unambiguously the six Mitchell principles?  Will Sinn Féin do the same in relation to the Mitchell guidelines on modalities for decommissioning?</P>
    <P>It is possible to be optimistic that this is only a short-term resumption of violence. It is possible to believe that if talks once start, the IRA will never return to violence again, no matter what setbacks republicans face in the negotiations.  It is also possible, unfortunately, to be pessimistic.  The House must be honest enough to consider both possibilities.</P>
    <P>It is human to hope for the best but pessimists can point to the cancellation <Col N="1738" /> of the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis.  Was it postponed back in January in case a planned military operation caused difficulty? Pessimists argue that Sinn Féin needed to buy time, knowing from their talks with the Mitchell body that they might not be able to accept the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself, it would be foolish for me to sign up to such a totally pessimistic approach but equally I must be realistic.  The sensible thing is to make a synthesis of both pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, pick out those things about which we can be fairly sure and proceed from there.  That is what we have done.  We will go on talking to Sinn Féin at official level but we will go on being suspicious of the IRA.</P>
    <P>What we cannot do is condone criminal or delinquent behaviour, not least because in the middle of a public concern about civil crime we cannot be ambivalent about political crime.  What kind of example would we give our children who are tuned into television if we tell them it is all right to talk to people who knew the people who set off the bomb in London and who refused to condem it?  How could we turn out lawabiding citizens if we ourselves appear to be ambivalent about crime in London? We cannot combat crime in rural Ireland and condone it in Northern Ireland or in Britain.  These issues may not be the issues of the hour but commentators need to address them.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a few words about my personal approach to the management of the peace process.  It is essential that the Dáil be realistic and honest about the huge extent of the divisions which actually exist in Northern Ireland.  These divisions concern the most fundamental question of all &mdash; to what State should they belong.  There is no more difficult question to resolve in politics.  That fundamental division has persisted for three centuries or more and 25 years of violence has deepened it and added personal bitterness and hurt to the already divided views about the most fundamental of all political questions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> The risks that are taken to bridge this gap are not ones which are purely political or personal for those directly involved and they involve every person living on this island.  We have seen civilised countries elsewhere in the world plunge into the most appalling and comprehensive barbarities because of over-ambitious handling of conflicts over national identity.  Let this House not forget that.  The prosperity that we enjoy in this State is built on the existence of a political consensus within it. Without the consensus underpinning our political institutions we would not enjoy economic prosperity at all.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the conflict about national identity is increased because it coincides generally with a division in respect of religious belief, which in turn creates differences about philosophy and language.  At times, the two communities in Northern Ireland, even when trying to reach out towards one another to find an accommodation, speak in such radically different language that they do not understand one another.  What one side sees as a gesture of conciliation is seen by the other as an aggressive proposal simply because the modes of thinking are so different.  The Unionist mind approaches political problems from a literal and inductive approach, working from practical purposes backwards towards general philosophical conclusions.  Due to its theological and philosophical origins, the Nationalist mind starts from general principles and then tries to put a practical form on them.</P>
    <P>Against this background, let me outline what I believe is the appropriate road for the Irish Government.  The Government is bound to lean to one side in favour of the Nationalist community. We have an obligation to do so under the Anglo-Irish Agreement but in practical terms we have an obligation to do so too because the Nationalists are in a minority.  The counterpart for the granting of the principle of majority consent, which gives a majority a right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, is that in the meantime the <Col N="1740" /> Irish Government must redress that balance in favour of the Nationalist minority through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but it does not mean the Irish Government must see itself exclusively as seeking to understand just one community. If that was its role, the Government could not contribute to compromise.</P>
    <P>The basis of successful negotiation is to start by seeking to understand what one's adversary wants and needs, and then try to find a way, consistent with the interests you represent, whereby your antagonist's interests can also be satisfied.  This means that if the Government is to find an agreement on behalf of Nationalists, it must seek to understand and allay Unionist fears.  This means, for example, if Unionists come up with an idea, we do not shoot it down the following day.  The fact that Unionists often shoot down ideas which Nationalists put forward in that way is not only not an excuse but a positive reason for the Irish Government to do the opposite.  If everyone took that attitude and rejected ideas because of their source, compromise would become completely impossible.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has an obligation to Nationalists to go out of its way to understand Unionist concerns because that is the way to reach agreement on behalf of Nationalists.  That is why I have sought to understand Unionist worries about decommissioning and have sought not to shoot down Unionist suggestions about an elective process on principle.  Unless the Government is seen to understand Unionist concerns about what happens to IRA arms while Sinn Féin is at the negotiating table, we will not get the Unionists to the negotiating table in the first place.  If Unionists think the Irish Government is both blind and deaf to their concerns, they will not wish to negotiate with us.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, Unionists may not negotiate with us at all.  That is the real political risk that anyone who reaches out to them is running; that is a genuine political risk which I am prepared to run.  The real risk-taker in a <Col N="1741" /> peace process is not the person who goes out of his way to understand the worries and fears of his own supporters but one who goes out of his way to understand the worries and concerns of the supporters of his antagonists.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies in relation to proposals for an elected body.  I first heard of Unionist suggestions for an elected body at the European summit in Majorca.  I then publicly asked Nationalist politicans not to reject these out of hand.  I could immediately see the dangers in the elective process; that it could undermine the three-stranded approach; that it could lead to an internal solution; that it could entrench a majority-minded analysis of the problem within Northern Ireland itself.  But I took the risk of saying that it should be considered because I believe it is only by considering the ideas of others and trying to turn them to good account that one ever makes a breakthrough in a genuine negotiation and, by &ldquo;a genuine negotiation&rdquo;, I mean a negotiation based on persuasion not coercion.</P>
    <P>Let me put it quite bluntly: no Nationalist leader pursuing an exclusively Nationalist agenda has solved the Irish problem.  I could name the great leaders of Irish nationalism, both of the constitutional and of the physical force traditions, for the past two centuries. None actually solved the divisions between the two sections of our people in the ancient Province of Ulster.  That is a fact.  Their approach, while eminentely successful in separating this part of Ireland from Britain, unfortunately, was not successful in reconciling the two sections of the people who live on this island one of which is concentrated primarily in Ulster.  That is why I believe that a different approach &mdash; learning the lessons of history &mdash; is a risk worth taking.</P>
    <P>I have gone out of my way in this debate to listen to the ideas of others rather than become an over vigorous proponent of my own.  I hope I do not sound overly vigorous in what I am now saying.  I have lent an ear, I lend an ear <Col N="1742" /> to the concerns of the republican community, I understand that the republican community in Northern Ireland have suffered more through violence than anyone else.  I understand that it is their lives that have been disrupted most of all.  I understand that there are many others who live in comparative comfort who can afford the luxury of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; but equally I understand that, if there is to be an agreement, we must bring all together.  And I understand the key to democratic politics is patience.</P>
    <P>This House has shown great patience throughout this debate.  It is a great compliment to this House that so many Members have contributed; I have not heard the criticisms voiced elsewhere about this House over the past three days.  This House has done itself credit for the past three days.  The speeches have been of a very high quality, the concern has been genuine; the disagreements reasonable.  While not physically present for all this debate because of other responsibilities, I can assure every Member that I am intent on taking careful account of everything that has been said in this debate and on paying as much attention to what has been said from the Opposition benches as to what has been said from this side of the House because I believe that, in this manner, this House can set an example as to how a peace process really works.</P>
    <P>A peace process works by putting oneself in the mind of one's traditional antagonists.  It is my regret that the republican movement, while undoubtedly sincere in its decision to give up violence, has not sufficiently educated its own supporters that the giving up of violence is not merely a political tactic; that the giving up of violence and the choosing of a political path means that, at the deepest possible level, one has to accept the principle of consent, not necessarily consent in the particular form spoken of in debates here in a constitutional form, but consent in a more profound form, consent in the sense that you respect the right of other people to differ from you; consent in the sense <Col N="1743" /> that you will never use violence to make them change their mind, not just in practice but in principle.</P>
    <P>In that sense I regret that over the past 16 to 18 months there would not appear to have been the internal debate that ought to have taken place within the republican movement.  It is regrettable that there were not more meetings within the republican movement at which the actual logic of peace could have been debated because, to my mind, the logic of peace points in no other direction than that of the ultimate and gradual removal of the military arm of the republican movement.</P>
    <P>Given the principle we are adopting of respect for other people's views, of course, that is a decision one must let the movement take for itself.  Any attempt to force that decision on it from outside is liable to be counter-productive because of what we know about the way people react to coercion from outside anyway.  That was the mistake about the Washington 3 condition, not that it was unreasonable in itself, which it was not, but that it was being imposed from elsewhere, from a source that did not command the sort of sense of support and trust that the people who needed to make the decision required. But that does not mean that it is not a decision that the republican movement ought to be able to take for itself by itself.  It is regrettable that the republican movement did not have that debate with itself.  It is a debate that sections of virtually every party in this House have had with themselves at some stage in the history of this island in this century &mdash; crossing the path from physical force to exclusively peaceful methods.  It is a hard road to follow &mdash; the logic, the comradeship of the physical force tradition are difficult to shake off.  The bravery undoubtedly shown is difficult to forget, but these must be shaken off, they must be passed into the past if true peace and reconciliation are to be brought about.</P>
    <P>My regret &mdash; having listened carefully to representatives of Sinn Féin in the <Col N="1744" /> many meetings I have had with them &mdash; is not one which prompts me to doubt their sincerity, certainly not of the people I met &mdash; I do not doubt their sincerity &mdash; but I do regret that they did not engage in the necessary serious self-analysis to pass from a strategy of the armalite in one hand and the ballot paper in the other to a strategy that says it has grasped the ballot paper with both hands.</P>
    <P>In the present traumatic reflection undoubtedly taking place in republican areas I hope the people will reflect on the logic of the peace process, which is the total abandonment of violence.  I do not expect republicans to necessarily appreciate that message when put to them in trenchant tones by people who, to their mind, have never experienced any of the sacrifices they have experienced &mdash; therefore, I do not expect them to accept that from me &mdash; but I do expect them to think about it for themselves because I can see no other way back.  This time, when the republican movement come back &mdash; as I hope they will &mdash; to the path of peace, for their own sake it must be for good; for their own sake it must be the result of a thorough and conscious decision to change, not just their tactics but the entire philosophy of its movement.  This time the peace process must not be superficial, it must be radical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise this item on the Adjournment is that I was privileged to meet the sister of Mr. Wei Jingsheng, Ms Wei Sansan, at a meeting sponsored by the International Commission of Jurists and by Amnesty International in Ireland.  Mr. Wei Jingsheng is now serving his second sentence of 14 years.  Previously, he was sentenced to a period of 15 years' imprisonment, which was curtailed near its end, for placing democracy posters on Democracy Wall in Peking in the period of great unrest in the People's <Col N="1745" /> Republic of China in 1979.  He served 13½ years of his 15 year sentence.  During that period he suffered tremendous hardship and deprivation, losing many of his teeth and developing a heart condition sitting in a primitive cell in a distant part of China, simply for expressing his true conviction about the need for democracy and liberty in China.</P>
      <P>As part of China's effort to conduct a charm offensive internationally to get the 2000 Olympic games moved to Peking he was released as a result of American pressure.  Many people in his circumstances would have simply said they had played their part for liberty and democracy and fade quietly into the background.  On his release he again compaigned for liberty and democracy in China.  He met an American diplomat and set up a movement in China for liberty and democracy.  He was arrested shortly after meeting the American diplomat and detained without a warrant for a number of months.  Subsequently he was placed on trial on a charge of conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the People's Republic of China.  He was indicted and convicted at a show trial and handed down a sentence of 14 years to be served in the prison from which he had been released on 13 December 1995.</P>
      <P>His crime is simply that he supports liberty and democracy.  It is probable, bearing in mind the suffering he endured on the last occasion, that he will die in prison unless international opinion is mobilised to stand by him and to vindicate, not merely his rights but the rights for which he has sacrificed so much over the last 15 or 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am calling on this House to bear witness to his struggle and on the Government to raise the issue of how this man has been treated &mdash; he is by no means alone but he is one person of whom we have been made aware by Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists &mdash; and to take the opportunity of the forthcoming conference in Geneva in March to press for <Col N="1746" /> international condemnation of the systematic abuse of civil liberties and suppression of human rights in China by the Government of the People's Republic of China.  I ask the Government to bring the matter further than it has done before and not merely to support EU resolutions in that regard but to use our position as a non-aligned country to advocate strongly to other countries, who have hesitated in the past, to take a strong stance in support civil liberties in China and not to allow this man's suffering and persecution to be in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It is one of importance and deserves to be raised in the House.</P>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng is one of China's most important dissidents.  He is an advocate for freedom of expression and the pursuit of democracy by peaceful means. He holds that it is not desirable, or even possible, to modernise the Chinese economy under the single-party rule of the Chinese Communist Party.  Mr. Wei was awarded the 1994 Olof Palme Prize.</P>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng was sentenced to 14 years in prison on 13 December 1995 for his alleged attempt &ldquo;to subvert the government&rdquo; in China.  It should also be recalled that he had received an earlier sentence of 15 years before his release in September 1993 having served about 14 years and six months of that sentence. He enjoyed a period of liberty which only lasted six months in 1993-94 before being again detained until his trial in late 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 December 1995, the EU Troika of Heads of Mission at Beijing made a démarche in favour of Wei Jingsheng. The response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry was that the matter was purely an internal affair.  On 12 December 1995, the permission of the Supreme Court of the Municipality of Beijing was requested for the EU Troika Heads of Mission to attend Mr. Wei's trial but without success.  Following the draconian sentence of 14 years which was <Col N="1747" /> imposed on him, a European Union statement was issued on 14 December 1995 which deplored Mr. Wei's continued imprisonment and sought his unconditional release.  This EU position has, of course, been conveyed subsequently to the Chinese authorities in contacts, <i>inter alia,</i> with the Foreign Ministry in Beijing.  Recently during the course of the EU Troika/China Human Rights Dialogue meeting, with participation from Ireland, which was held in Beijing from 22 to 24 January 1996 the matter was raised with the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In all these instances the rather unsatisfactory response has been that Wei Jingsheng committed a criminal offence for which he was sentenced by the Chinese courts and that the matter was an internal one and of no concern to third parties.  The Government, with our EU partners, is mindful of the continuing plight of Mr. Wei and will continue to raise his case with the Chinese authorities.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently availed of all appropriate opportunities to raise the question of human rights abuses with the Chinese authorities. During his visit to Ireland on 6 October 1995, I raised a series of human rights issues with Chinese Vice-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Qian Qichen, and I will continue to do so as long as matters remain unresolved.  The Government also supports the initiative which has brought about meetings within the framework of the EU Troika/China Human Rights Dialogue, two meetings of which have taken place within the past 13 months and are hopeful that these exchanges will eventually bear fruit.</P>
    <P>I take it that the reference to the International Conference in Geneva to which the Deputy referred is to the 52nd Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which will take place in Geneva from 18 March to 26 April 1996. Ireland is playing an active role at the present preparatory stage and will continue to do so at this forum.  However, given that the process of widespread <Col N="1748" /> consultation and co-ordination is in train at present, it will be appreciated that precise information as to the full details of any draft resolutions cannot be provided at this remove of one month from the forthcoming session as they are not yet available.  If it is decided to put forward a resolution at the Commission on Human Rights, the Government would support this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the owner of a mobile phone which facilitates my everyday business.  Like many other Deputies I am deeply concerned at the huge rash of planning applications which have been received in the local authority, of which I am a member, and in all other local authorities during the past five or six months.  I have been trying to raise the issue since then when I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the reason we need more than one mobile phone transmission network.  In the case of any other utility, for example, gas, electricity or water there is a single basic delivery system.  The mobile phone network seems to be the only example where we must have two competing systems.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts today, Mr. John Loughrey, Secretary of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, agreed that there should be one network and that, perhaps, the Minister, Deputy Lowry, should have insisted, from the beginning, on one network for this facility.  I accept the comments made by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, last evening in relation to the planning authorities, but the creation of a national grid cannot be left to a number of planning authorities. It was not done with the ESB or with the other utilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deep concerns have been expressed about exposure to microwave and electromagnetic radiation.  The Bristol study released yesterday suggests a link <Col N="1749" /> between electromagnetic radiation and the attraction of radon in the substructure and cancer.  We will have 600 high frequency electromagnetic transmission masts which will surely have similar effects through creating intense electromagnetic fields.  If I had more time I could refer to American and Canadian experts who have expressed great concern on health grounds.</P>
    <P>My constituency, which is one of the most beautiful in the country, stretches from Coolock to Howth.  It has been defaced recently by the erection of these new transmission networks.  The masts are unbelievably ugly; they are often up to 40 metres high and may be three by two by four metres in area.  A pleasant suburban street in Sutton now has a mast dominating its skyline which looks like an alien craft.  In Raheny, Donaghmede and in other areas on the north side of Dublin, applications are pending or have been approved for these horrendous structures and, indeed, some have been built.  They are a form of environmental pollution.  One of the applications before Dublin Corporation was for a site at Our Lady's Hospice and another is for a Christian Brothers School, which is unbelievable when one considers the consequences.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications should call in Esat Telecom and Telecom Éireann and ask them to consider the possibility of creating a single transmission network. The Minister for the Environment could insist on this being implemented at local level through the planning authorities and the Minister for Health could closely monitor the resulting single network. The deregulation of important utilities under EU provisions carries with it significant consequences.  This is the first time a totally new facility has come onto the market which needs a new nationwide transmission network. In the past it was taken for granted that there would be a single network and I see no reason there cannot be a single network in this case, if necessary independently operated and facilitating a number of competing users.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> On environmental and health grounds the rash of applications for these monstrosities which are beginning to appear requires urgent action from the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and his colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important issue.  It has caused public concern and, in so far as it impacts on my Department, I will monitor it closely.  The aim of the Government's telecommunications policy is to ensure Ireland's telecommunications systems rank among the best in the OECD countries as regards availability, price and quality of telecommunications services.  This will help to promote industrial and commercial development and enhance social exchange and mobility in Ireland.  The Government has announced its intention to issue a second licence for the provision of GSM or global systems for mobile telephone services.  The two operators will be obliged to provide GSM coverage to 90 per cent of the population within four years.</P>
      <P>The planning decisions regarding the installation of base stations and other equipment for mobile telephone systems are taken by the local planning authorities.  Due to the anticipated growth in the number of communications masts and the need for a consistent approach by the various planning authorities, my Department in December last issued draft consultation guidelines in relation to the planning issues associated with mobile telephone systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft consultation guidelines were issued with a view to the widest possible circulation to interested parties and comments have been invited by the end of this month.  All comments received will be considered in my Department before the guidelines issue in their final form.  I am concerned to ensure the environmental impact of <Col N="1751" /> communications masts is as low as possible. It is estimated that up to 600 masts in total could be required.  This figure could be reduced substantially if arrangements were made for mast sharing and I expect the operators to come forward with appropriate proposals.  I accept that for technical reasons sharing may not always be possible but it has an important role to play.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has had direct discussions with the ESB, Telecom Éireann and Esat, and there is a large measure of agreement to share facilities. He and I will continue to promote this issue.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about ill health effects to which the non-ionising radiation associated with the telecommunications antennae can give rise. While any health issues arising are primarily matters for the Minister for Health, the draft consultation guidelines provide that operators, applying for planning permission, should be required to furnish evidence that the proposed installations comply with the guidelines of the International Radiological Protection Association or other internationally accepted standards.  This is to ensure the use of best international practice.  In deciding on the definitive guidelines, consideration will be given to monitoring arrangements to ensure installations are meeting the appropriate standards.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed about possible devaluation of property due to telecommunications masts.  The planning and development Acts do not provide for the payment of compensation in such cases.  Any question as to whether a claim to compensation or damages would arise is a matter for the general law and property owners who believe their property has been devalued have the option of seeking damages through the courts.</P>
    <P>I repeat that full consideration will be <Col N="1752" /> given to all comments received by the end of this month from any interested parties on the contents of the final draft guidelines to be issued to local authorities and planning authorities in determining applications for such masts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, for being here again in the absence of the Minister for Education; this is the fourth time he has been present for a matter I have raised and I hope he is getting the credit for any good that comes out of these matters. I ask the Minister of State to remind the Minister for Education that on her visit to Carndonagh on 8 March, she will no doubt be requested to visit St. Joseph's boys school in Moville and meet the people involved with it.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the critical situation at St. Joseph's school.  On 26 November 1995 the secretary of the school action committee wrote to the Department of Education outlining no fewer than 18 serious deficiencies in the school, including health hazards and the presence of rats and other vermin.  In addition, five pertinent questions were posed seeking information on the normal procedures adopted in such cases. To date no reply has been received by the group other than an acknowledgement of receipt of the letter, although I received a written answer to a parliamentary question on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reply mentioned that the cost of refurbishing the school would be prohibitive and the Minister would now consider amalgamating the boy's school with the existing girls' school.  I understand this would envisage putting new buildings on a site adjoining the girls' school.  I am glad that at least the matter is being looked into &mdash; to use a phrase popular with civil servants.  However worthy this proposal, I am concerned about the fate of the children and teachers in the meantime.  Their morale is at a low ebb and some children have already been moved by their parents to <Col N="1753" /> schools in Greencastle, Muff and Whitecastle. One classroom was in such a bad state of repair that the class was moved to an empty chalet at the girls' school after Christmas.  This was an improvement to some extent but was still far from ideal; for example, the boys now have to share the toilets with the girls.</P>
    <P>To further illustrate the seriousness of the matter.  I understand that the post of principal and one other teacher have not yet been filled because of the conditions in spite of being advertised on a number of occasions.  I appeal to the Minister to proceed with whatever plans there may be regarding the new buildings and address, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of providing immediate improvements at the existing boys' school.  This is demanded in the interests of the children who may have left school altogether by the time the new buildings are provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my Department's current position in respect of the situation that currently exists in St. Joseph's national school, Moville, County Donegal.  I am aware that the school has a current staffing level of a principal and five assistant teachers with an enrolment of 158 pupils.  The accommodation consists of five permanent classrooms and a prefab which I realise is in a poor state of repair.  As a result, the pupils normally located in the prefab are now being accommodated in a community hall.  I agree that this is less than satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that St. Joseph's is reflecting the national trend of falling enrolments which suggests the loss of a teacher in September 1996.  The planning section of my Department is currently reviewing its accommodation requirements with the educational needs of the area in general.  As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to a Dáil question on 23 January last, I would be disposed <Col N="1754" /> to considering proposals for an amalgamation of St. Joseph's with the girls' convent national school on the girls' school site.  My Department has asked that the matter be considered locally and the views of the interested parties obtained.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department's professional staff have recently visited St. Joseph's and are in the process of compiling a report which will outline details of any works requiring attention.  When this report is received and considered, in conjunction with the views of the local interested parties, my Department will be in a better position to assess the educational needs of the area.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the urgency of the case and appreciates the concerns expressed by the school authorities. It will be in contact with the board of management at an early date concerning the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to order an immediate investigation into the companies responsible for the distribution of books, recorded music and magazines in the Republic.  Approximately two weeks ago the Minister, Deputy Bruton, replied to my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, as follows:</P>
      <P>In respect of magazines, I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs, if, in his view, it is necessary to carry out a survey to establish the extent to which price reductions resulting from the appreciation of the punt have been passed on to consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was extremely mild.  I sought permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment because of the number of people who have contacted me from all over the country to complain about the exorbitant cost of UK magazines and <Col N="1755" /> the failure to pass on the benefits resulting from the current favourable exchange rate of the punt.  If the reverse was true, the additional costs would be passed on immediately by way of price increases.</P>
    <P>For the past 18 months the punt has been worth significantly more than sterling. As a consequence, one would expect goods imported from Britain to be cheaper, but this is not the case.  Irish consumers are being fleeced by the distribution companies which operate a virtual cartel.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business and Finance</i> has highlighted many examples to show that the savings accruing from the weakness of sterling are not being passed on to consumers. This merits investigation.  For many months the exchange rate of the punt has been approximately £1.03 sterling and we are told it will be higher during the year.  Books which cost £20 in Britain should cost about £19.33 here. However, because the benefits are not being passed most bookshops are charging more.</P>
    <P>This daylight robbery is particularly obvious when it comes to the price of magazines and recorded music.  Even when higher Irish VAT rates are taken into account, the cost of UK magazines in the Republic is between 10 and 20 per cent higher than it should be.  For example, <i>Business Week</i> has a recommended British cover price of £2.  Taking the appropriate factors into account, this should translate into a cover price of £2.17 in the Irish marketplace, but a price of £2.59 is being charged.</P>
    <P>Purchasers of tapes and compact discs are also being fleeced with <i>Business and Finance</i> calculating that, when VAT and exchange rates are taken into account, Irish consumers should be getting recorded music from Britain at a 1 per cent discount.  Instead there is a markup of between 3 and 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>I call for an immediate investigation into the companies responsible for the <Col N="1756" /> distribution of recorded music, books and magazines.  Eason's and Newspread, the two companies which distribute magazines, have serious questions to answer about the pricing policy they set for newsagents.  They operate a virtual cartel and deserve to be investigated.</P>
    <P>The investigation by the Director of Consumer Affairs must take into account the consistent weakness of sterling during the past 14 months.  The companies mentioned should not be allowed get away with the excuse that they are covering future price increases. they should be forced to compensate consumers for the overcharging during that period.</P>
    <P>There is a range of specialist magazines dealing with such topics as health and beauty issues, DIY &mdash; including carpentry, construction, gardening and mechanical engineering &mdash; and computers. It appears that the companies in question have decided that it does not matter to the person who buys these magazines whether they pay £4.50 or £5, but that is not the point.  They may well be able to afford to pay the extra 50p, but why should they?</P>
    <P>When Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment I took up this issue.  The Minister of State may recall that in 1992 there was a currency crisis which, thankfully, did not last very long.  When I met the representatives of one of the companies in question, they informed me that I did not understand what was a very complicated matter, as if I would not be able to comprehend it.  They explained that they had to buy in advance, but 14 months have passed without any of the benefits being passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister was far too timid in asking the Director of Consumer Affairs &ldquo;if, in his view it is necessary to carry out a survey&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister of State to take heed of what I am saying and to order the director to conduct such a survey and publish the results so that the public will see where the profits went during the past 14 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The distribution of magazines and newspapers in Ireland is controlled by two firms &mdash; Eason and Newspread, Eason has some 70 per cent of the market.  Both firms apply a formula for the pricing of foreign magazines which was recommended by the National Prices Commission in 1983. The Irish selling price is calculated as follows: sterling cover price at the rate of exchange of purchased currency, plus 5 per cent uplift, plus VAT.</P>
      <P>In 1990 the formula was altered.  Contact was made with the Department at that time and approval was sought for the new formula but while this was not forthcoming it appears that Eason and Newspread applied the new formula anyway.  In the course of its examination of this matter, the Department of Enterprise and Employment became aware of certain arrangements between Eason and Newspread which effectively ensured that magazines sold by both firms were sold at the same price.  This was, of course, before the passing of the Competition Act, 1991, which prohibited all anti-competitive practices.</P>
      <P>In general, the price differential between UK-Ireland magazine prices arises from the currency differentials between the punt and sterling; the 21 per cent VAT applied here but not in the UK and the distribution charges imposed by the importers.  In regard to the currency differentials, while the director has expressed concern that consumers would benefit from the increased value of the punt, it is not within his powers to compel distributors or retailers to reduce their prices in line with currency movements.  The director is keeping the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a survey in 1992 by the Director of Consumer Affairs the following practices have been admitted to by Eason and Newspread.  When Eason, which is the dominant player in the market, is about to make a deal in relation to the forward price of sterling <Col N="1758" /> it notifies its only competitor.  Newspread admits that it attempts to make a deal for forward sterling purchase at or about the same time as Eason &mdash; there is evidence that this is the case.  Both firms use currency conversion charts which allow newsagents to convert from UK cover prices to Irish prices by the use of the formula mentioned above.  In order to enable the situation with regard to imported magazines and newspapers to be fully examined the Minister could commence an inquiry under section 22F of the Prices Act, 1958, as amended. This would enable the question of margins, etc. to be investigated with full legal authority to demand answers, papers, etc.</P>
    <P>In 1992 Eason notified this practice to the Competition Authority.  The matter was investigated by the Competition Authority in 1992-93.  The Competition Authority took the view that there was a practice by Eason and Newspread that amounted to an anti-competitive practice.</P>
    <P>The companies went to the High Court to stop the Competition Authority investigation.  When the case was over the companies withdrew the notification of agreement that had prompted the Competition Authority investigation. There is no agreement now before the Authority.  The Authority published its prospective findings in its 1993 annual report as a separate appendix. In that regard I refer the Deputy to Paragraphs 36 and 47 of the Competition Authority Report, 1993, particularly Annex 5.  This may strike the Deputy and other Members as an unusual decision by the Competition Authority.  The Authority will, when the amendment Bill is enacted, have wide new powers that will enable it to initiate investigations into issues such as these.</P>
    <P>In 1993 when the Authority was about to take a decision on the matter Eason obtained an injunction preventing it from so doing.  Subsequently, when after an oral hearing, <Col N="1759" /> the Authority was about to take a decision &mdash; believed to be unfavourable to Eason &mdash; Eason withdrew the notification.</P>
    <P>I take responsibility for the circumspect language of the earlier reply to the Deputy.  It is in keeping with my timid and tepid personality that it was so circumspect. However, I can confirm that the Director of Consumer Affairs has <Col N="1760" /> commenced the investigation into the prices of magazines in Ireland and I will let the Deputy know the outcome as soon as it is presented to me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for national policy in relation to the development of mobile telephone networks lies with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Any health issues arising from the development of such networks are matters for the Ministers for Health and Transport, Energy and Communications.  As the Minister for the Environment, my functions arise from the fact that antenna support structures require planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already informed the House, I have issued draft consultation guidelines on the planning issues arising in connection with communication masts for the guidance of planning authorities, operators and the general public. The draft guidelines advise that operators be required to furnish evidence that their installations comply with the International Radiological Protection Association (IRPA) guidelines or other <Col N="1630" /> relevant international standards.  This is to ensure that best international practice is followed.</P>
    <P>While Article 9 (1) (b) of the 1994 Planning and Development Regulations provided, as a transitional measure, that antenna support structures, below certain heights, would be exempted development for a period of six months from the coming into force of the regulations on 16 May 1994, all such structures now require planning permission. It is open to any person to make an objection to the planning authority where an application is made in relation to any particular development and, if dissatisfied with the decision of the authority, to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Acts do not provide for the payment of compensation where it is claimed that the value of land is reduced by the development of adjoining land.  Any question as to whether a claim to compensation or damages would arise in such circumstances is a matter for the general law and any question of establishing a tribunal to deal with any such claims would not be a matter for me.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of public roads, including the provision of facilities for pedestrians, rests with individual road authorities.

It is a matter for individual road authorities to select the projects they wish to fund, subject to the general guidelines which apply.  In the case of national roads, any necessary improvements in pedestrian facilities would be a matter for consideration by the local authority concerned and the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <P>Traffic and parking by-laws made by the Garda Commissioner under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, following consultation with the relevant local authorities and with my consent, provide the statutory basis for the application of disc parking. Under these by-laws, the introduction of disc parking in any area is a matter for the local authority.  The charges for parking disc are set down in the by-laws.</P>
      <P>Sections 35 and 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, to be commenced later this year, provide for the replacement of sections 89 and 90 of the 1961 Act and will allow local authorities to make their own by-laws in relation to paid parking controls generally, including disc parking, without the approval of the Commissioner or the Minister.  This devolution of control is in line with the general policy of extending the discretionary powers of local authorities; it is desirable also, in this particular case, to give local authorities maximum freedom, in the exercise of their traffic management and other responsibilities, to determine the level of charges and other conditions which should apply to parking in their areas, having regard to local circumstances.</P>
      <P>As present, rates of charges for disc parking vary widely and it is probable that local authorities would wish such variations to continue having regard to the different circumstances of different areas.  The adoption of a national disc parking scheme, with standard fees, or the introduction of mutual recognition arrangements while maintaining different fee levels, could give rise to significant income losses for some local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> Under the arrangements proposed under the Road Traffic Act, 1994, it will be a matter for local authorities generally, or particular groups of authorities, to determine whether or not to introduce standard conditions and charges for disc parking.  A possible alternative would be the introduction by local authorities of arrangements whereby discs would be more widely available for purchase in their areas, particularly by visitors, singly or from on-street machines; I will be asking local authorities to consider this and other possibilities fully in reviewing their disc parking systems.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993 redefined and circumstances under which essential repairs grants are payable. Effectively, such grants may be paid in respect of a house in any area subject to the following conditions: the occupier must be approved for local authority housing; the house cannot be made fit for human habitation, in all respects, at a reasonable cost but the repairs proposed will prolong the useful life of the house; and there would be no continuing demand for local authority housing at the location of the house in respect of which the grant is sought.</P>

      <P>The overall objective of national road development policy, as outlined in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999, is to provide, within the framework of a balanced and integrated transport policy, for the safe, efficient and cost effective movement of people and goods by road. One of the key aims of the programme is to link in with the network in Northern Ireland so as to provide, over time, a coherent strategic road network for the island as a whole.</P>
      <P>In seeking to secure those aims, there is a high level of on-going contact and co-operation between the road authorities here and in Northern Ireland, all of which have available to them people of experience and skill.  I refer, in this connection, to the detailed reply to Questions Nos. 14 and 92 of 12 December 1995.</P>

      <P>Provisional returns made available by the Garda Síochána show that 437 people died, and 9,784 were injured, in road accidents in 1995.</P>
      <P>Detailed analysis of the reports prepared by the Garda in relation to traffic accidents generally in 1995 is being undertaken by the National Roads Authority and the full results will be presented in their report, <i>Road Accident Facts 1995,</i> later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the number of people killed and injured in road accidents in 1995 is a matter of grave concern, especially as the increase did not reflect <Col N="1636" /> the trend over the past few years.  A preliminary analysis of fatal accidents carried out at my request by the National Roads Authority in relation to the last six months of 1995 suggests that excessive speed and drink were major contributory factors, that a significant number of young road users were killed, and that motorcyclists and pedestrians accounted for a disproportionately high percentage of deaths.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the adoption of a new approach to road safety and, with this in mind, I am having a full assessment of road safety policy carried out; this will include an appraisal of the roles of the bodies already involved, and of the scope for more involvement by bodies at local level.  I hope to be in a position to announce the results within the next two months.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing the licensing of drivers provide that access to a provisional licence for category A licences (motorcycles) is restricted to those who have either held a licence under sub-category A1 (motorcycles under 125 cc) for at least two years in the previous ten years, or those over 25 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Second Directive on the Driving Licence provides that it is a matter for each member state to decide <Col N="1637" /> whether or not to introduce sub-categories such as that applying here to motorcycles under 125 cc.  I am at present reviewing the driver licensing regulations in the context of applying those provisions of the Second Directive which are not yet in force.  However, it is my intention to retain sub-category A1 as I am concerned that providing access to large powerful motorcycles for people lacking experience raises fundamental questions of road safety.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the criteria for access to category A licences are now more restrictive in this country than in the United Kingdom.  It is possible, however, that the entry into force of the Second Directive will encourage the harmonisation of such criteria.</P>

      <P>The grants in question fell into two main categories: the EU co-financed scheme of specific improvement grants, and the INTERREG grants which became payable in 1995. The allocation of funds in each case was project-based.  The selection of projects for funding from among the applications submitted by local authorities was determined on the basis of their compliance with the strict EU eligibility criteria, the priority attaching to particular projects, and the needs of different areas.</P>
      <P>Specific grants were also made available in 1994 and 1995 to the Border counties involved to meet in full the cost of reopening cross-Border roads.  In addition, two county councils received grants in 1995 to assist them in the purchase of road repair machines.</P>

      <P>As the bridge in question is on a regional road, the cost of the works involved would normally fall to be met from Tipperary South Riding County Council's own resources provision for such roads, supplemented by the available road grants.  It is a matter for the council to determine its own priorities in the expenditure of these grants, subject to the general guidelines issued by my Department.  It would also be open to the local authority to consider whether to apply for funding in 1997 for the project under the EU co-financed scheme of grants.  No such application was made in respect of it under the 1996 scheme.</P>

      <P>It has been the stated policy of Government, since announcing the intention to establish the Environmental Protection Agency, that the agency's integrated pollution control licensing function should operate on a self-financing basis.  The fees provided for under the Environmental Protection Agency (Licensing Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995, and approved by the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment, are designed to recover the costs to the agency of processing applications for licences, reviews of licences or revised licences; they also reflect the need to maintain equity between different classes of licensable <Col N="1639" /> activity and to avoid placing an undue burden on small-scale enterprises.  I am satisfied that these objectives are currently being met.  The regulations also enable the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce, refund or waive fees in certain cases.</P>
      <P>The integrated pollution control licensing system has been in operation since May 1994.  In the light of the progressive expansion of the licensing system and the experience gained by the Environmental Protection Agency, I intend to keep the level of application fees under review in terms of both self-financing and equity objectives.</P>
      <P>Annual compliance monitoring fees for activities licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency are a matter for the agency to determine on the basis of its costs, and to recover directly from the licensed activities.  All licensing fees payable to the EFA are subject to independent audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General so as to ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that the self-financing objective is fully and fairly achieved.</P>

      <P>The case for additional EU funding for roads in Border counties was, of course, put forward in discussions with the European Commission on the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties. However, the programme as adopted by the Commission gives priority to measures such as promotion of social inclusion; facilitating cross-Border reconciliation, linkages and co-operation; supporting productive investment; and promotion of employment; the more traditional infrastructural programmes, such as roads, for which other means of financial assistance are available were assigned a lower priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the limited provision for infrastructure in the programme, a sum of £3 million has been made available to my Department for roads investment in 1996.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to previous questions on this subject, the decision to undertake a special restoration programme for regional and county roads took account of the seriously deficient condition of significant lengths of these roads, a fact which is attested to by the views of public representatives in this House and elsewhere.  The main problems with the non-national road network are to be found in county council areas and these have been given high priority in the allocation of the 1996 non-national road grants which I recently announced.  Over £73 million has been set aside under the restoration programme in 1996 and will be used for the repair of road pavements on non-national roads in county council areas.</P>
      <P>A total of £8 million in discretionary block grants has been allocated to urban road authorities in 1996 for works on roads in their areas; and £4.9 million of this is allocated to county borough corporations. The level of block grant allocations to urban authorities generally has increased significantly in the last few years, from £5.5 million in 1993 to £8 million in 1996, an increase of 45 per cent.  In the same period, discretionary block grants to county boroughs have increased from just under £4 million to £4.9 million, an increase of 23 per cent. In addition, a sum of £3.07 million has been allocated to urban authorities in 1996 under the EU co-financed scheme of grants for improvement projects; of this amount, £1.87 million is allocated to county borough corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also made a special once-off provision of £1 million in 1996 to be allocated to certain urban authorities by <Col N="1645" /> way of a supplementary grant for restoration of road pavements where exceptional damage has been caused by works connected with water or sewerage schemes which has not otherwise been provided for.</P>
    <P>In all, grant allocations of £12.07 million are available to urban authorities in 1996, an increase of £2 million on the grants paid in 1995.</P>

      <P>I hope to publish shortly a consultation paper on Seanad representation for emigrants.  This will form the basis for consideration of the issue by the Dáil Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the Seanad and the general public, in advance of submitting a Constitution Amendment Bill to the Oireachtas and putting the issue before the people at a referendum.  It remains the intention to hold the referendum this year but, having regard to the necessity to allow sufficient time for consultations to take place.  I am not in a position at this stage to give a definite date.</P>

      <P>An extensive range of controls, under legislation within the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, applies to the transportation of dangerous substances. Additional controls apply in relation to the carriage of toxic substances by air and the shipment and disposal of such substances at sea.</P>
      <P>Regulation of hazardous waste transportation is principally governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community, which has direct application in Ireland.  The European Communities (Transfrontier Shipment of Waste) Regulations, 1994 provide supporting administrative and enforcement provisions in relation to this EU Regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waste Management Bill, 1995, currently before Seanad Éireann, provides for substantial amendments to existing controls in relation to the collection, transportation, recovery and disposal of hazardous waste.  The Bill provides for the preparation by the Environmental Protection Agency of a national hazardous waste management plan, the licensing by the agency of waste recovery and disposal operations <Col N="1647" /> and the issue of permits by local authorities for waste collection activities. The Bill also provides for appropriate powers of monitoring and inspection by the agency and local authorities.</P>

The standards, measurements, use and legal status of signs are set out in such regulations and directions.  Guidelines setting out the technical requirements and methods of application of thermoplastic road markings were prepared by the City and County Engineers' Association in 1988, in association with my Department. These provisions are being reviewed at present in the context of the preparation of a comprehensive traffic signs manual.  I intend to launch this document as early as possible this year. The estimated cost of providing white centre lines and yellow edge lines on a typical kilometre of non-national road is £1,325.</P>

      <P>The application period for diversity immigrant visas for the United States for the year October 1996 to September 1997 is 12 February to 12 March 1996.  It is estimated that Ireland's share of the total of 55,000 visas available worldwide will be about 1,200.</P>
      <P>Information about how to apply is available from the US Embassy in leaflet form or by telephoning 667 2707 or 668 8049 in Dublin.</P>
      <P>People born in Ireland, North and South, are eligible to apply.  An Irish citizen born in a country (e.g. Britain) whose nationals are not eligible to apply may qualify if (a) his-her spouse was born in a country whose nationals are eligible or (b) his-her parents did not reside in that country when he-she was born.</P>
      <P>The US Embassy has been made fully aware by my Department of the concerns previously expressed by the Deputy in the House about misleading advertisements by outside intermediaries. In the Embassy's announcement at the end of January of the availability of diversity immigrant visas for 1996-97 it was stated that many so-called visa services charged exorbitant fees and made unrealistic claims.  My Department issued a statement to the media on 6 February clearly advising applicants that using intermediaries did not enhance their prospects in the lottery, that there was no guarantee that applications sent through intermediaries would be delivered in time and that applicants could avoid unnecessary fees by applying direct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of providing tax relief on childcare costs has been examined from time to time in the context of how the State can provide assistance to families with children.</P>
      <P>The Tax Strategy Group considered the issue during its deliberations prior to the budget but did not come to a final view on the matter.  The issues of cost, targeting, equity, the effect on the labour market, and the black economy are relevant in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been studies both here and in the UK on this subject.  The Second Commission for the Status of Women in its report to Government in January 1993 considered the matter but did not recommend that tax relief for childcare expenses be given to working parents.  The commission considered that it was preferable that any additional state assistance for childcare facilities should be provided through increased investment in childcare support and services rather than by providing tax relief to parents for work-related childcare costs.  (The NESC Report No. 91 on Women's Participation in the Irish Labour Market reached the same broad conclusion.)  The commission noted that tax relief would do nothing to increase the supply or quality of childcare and would not improve the training or the supply of qualified childcare workers. <Col N="1656" /> Furthermore, it concluded that tax relief would be of little or no use to those with low or no income and that it would be of more benefit to the higher paid than low earners.</P>
    <P>In the UK the Institute of Fiscal Studies, in a report for the Equal Opportunities Commission entitled <i>The Impact of Subsidising Childcare,</i> examined a number of alternative methods for subsidising childcare.  In regard to tax relief, the report concluded that it &ldquo;has little beneficial effect on work incentives and channels money towards those who are already well placed in the childcare market&rdquo; (page xv, Executive Summary).</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce tax relief for childcare expenses at this time.  As the Deputy is aware, tax relief is but one of the methods by which assistance can be provided for children and may not, in fact, be the most appropriate method.  The State already provides considerable assistance to parents, in particular through expenditure on child benefit, education and health services.  I will, of course, keep the matter under review,</P>

      <P>The unit in question was opened by the Eastern Health Board on 4 January.</P>

    <P>The arrangement is that the board has contracted for the exclusive use of the premises, including the recreation <Col N="1657" /> rooms.  The proprietor of the premises also owns the building next door.  At one point it had been possible, although not permissible, to pass from one building to the other via a doorway.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that a partition is currently under construction which will ensure the absolute separation of the two premises and that sound proofing has also been installed. These renovations, which I expect to be fully completed very shortly, will eliminate the possibility of such incidents referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The centre is staffed by ten child care workers, including an acting manager.  It comprises one element of the board's new crisis intervention service which is managed by a newly appointed senior social worker.  I am satisfied that a high standard of care is maintained in the unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I intend to deal with Questions Nos. 65, 66, 67, 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>International research has shown that it is possible to reduce the anti-social behaviour of intravenous drug misusers by taking them into treatment on methadone maintenance programmes.  I am satisfied that such programmes are a valid and successful part of an integrated response to the problem of heroin abuse.</P>
      <P>The report of the Expert Group on a Protocol for the prescribing of methadone set out recommendations for the involvement of general practitioners in methadone maintenance programmes. The Protocol recommended that general practitioners should become involved by taking on responsibility for the care of drug misusers who had first been stabilised at community drug treatment centres.  It also outlined the criteria necessary to ensure that methadone prescribing occurs in a controlled, responsible fashion.</P>
      <P>Many elements of the Protocol have already been implemented.  Most notably, a central treatment list of all patients being prescribed methadone has been established.  A general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and thus ensure that the patient does not receive methadone from more than one source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present details of 680 patients for whom methadone is being prescribed by 25 general practitioners have been supplied for inclusion on the central treatment list.  A further 700 drug misusers are prescribed methadone in treatment <Col N="1659" /> centres at Pearse Street, Baggot Street, Amiens Street and Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>During 1996 it is proposed to expand treatment services to drug misusers who are currently on waiting lists for such treatment.  The number of additional persons for whom treatment will be provided will depend on the success of the Eastern Health Board in establishing further community drug centres in local areas and also on the number of additional general practitioners and pharmacists who are prepared to prescribe and dispense methadone respectively to stabilised drug misusers.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Eastern Health Board has encountered local opposition in some areas to the establishment of treatment centres and the board is currently engaged in widespread consultation with local community groups to deal with issues of concern to them.</P>
    <P>Plans are at an advanced stage to run a pilot programme which will allow for the full implementation of the recommendations in the Protocol.  It will involve a selected number of patients who have been stabilised in drug treatment centres and who will be referred to general practitioners for continuation of methadone maintenance treatment and overall medical care.  The elements which will be included in this pilot programme are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;drug misusers, who will be referred to general practitioners, will have been previously stabilised in a health board treatment clinic,</P>
    <P>&mdash;each patient will be provided with a personalised treatment card,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a facilitator, appointed by the Eastern Health Board, will provide liaison between treatment centres, general practitioners and pharmacies.</P>
    <P>&mdash;any drug misuser who becomes destablised while under general practitioner care will be referred back to a treatment centre for attention and further treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> The pilot programme will run initially for a six months period and it is hoped that, with the support of the appropriate professional organisations, general practitioners and pharmacists will continue to be part of the overall programme for the provision of treatment services for stabilised drug misusers in their own communities.</P>
    <P>To date many general practitioners and pharmacists have been reluctant to become involved in the provision of services for drug misusers and I can understand that reluctance.  I am confident, however, that by moving ahead with this pilot programme in a controlled, systematic manner, this reluctance can be overcome.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, provides a statutory framework for the regulation and recognition of foreign adoptions.  The Adoption Board has a central role in the administration of the legislation.  To enable the board to cope with the additional work arising from the processing of applications relating to foreign adoptions, the 1991 Act provided for an increase in the membership of the board from seven to nine members. Additional administrative staff have also been assigned to the board since 1991.</P>
      <P>As regards the criteria for adoption selection in this country, I am not aware that these are in need of review.  Irish residents wishing to adopt a child here or abroad must undergo a detailed assessment of their general suitability. These assessments, which are carried out by the adoption agencies, provide an important safeguard for the welfare of the child.</P>
      <P>Eligibility to adopt is determined by reference to the legal requirements laid down in the Adoption Acts.  In this context, I would point out that section 10 of the 1991 Act extended the categories of persons eligible to adopt and introduced a standard minimum age for adopting parents.  These measures were specifically designed to ensure greater flexibility in our legal adoption system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's policy on the provision of childcare services is centred on the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991. The Child Care Act represents a major reform of the law in relation to the care of children.  It provides a modern legal framework for the protection of children from abuse and neglect, and the development of a wide range of child care and family support services to assist children and families in need.</P>
      <P>The Act is being implemented on a phased basis.  It has been necessary to adopt this policy of phased implementation because of the need to put in place a proper infrastructure to support the legislation and to provide the health boards with the extra resources required to enable them to cope with the new demands imposed on them under the legislation; 61 of the 79 sections of the Act are now in force.  These include the core provisions of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  I was very pleased to be in a position to bring these core provisions into operation with effect from 31 October last, together with three new sets of regulations governing the placement by health boards of children in foster care, residential care and with relatives.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the timescale set by the Government for the full implementation of the Act, it is my intention that the remaining 18 sections of the Act, which deal with the supervision of pre-school services and the registration of children's residential centres, will be commenced by the end of the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned that for the legislation to be effective, it must be backed up by a sustained programme of <Col N="1663" /> investment in the development of new child care and family support services which are capable of responding to the needs of those whom the Act is designed to assist.  The implementation of Parts III to VI in particular have enormous resource implications.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, in the region of £35 million on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of new child care and family support services. There have been significant increases in staffing levels and a range of new services and facilities have been put in place throughout the country.  Over 850 new permanent posts have been created for the child care services.  The Health Estimate for 1996 includes provision for a further round of new service developments in the child care area.  These allocations represent the largest ever investment of resources in our child care services and demonstrate the commitment of the Government to strengthening those services and equipping them to respond to the needs of vulnerable children.</P>
    <P>The main features of the Child Care Action Plan for 1995 were:</P>
    <P>The creation of some 342 additional posts for the child care services.</P>
    <P>The expansion of assessment and therapeutic services for the victims of child abuse.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional accommodation and supports to help homeless youngsters.</P>
    <P>The establishment of new special care units catering for children who are out of control.</P>
    <P>The development of locally-based helping services to assist families in difficulty.</P>
    <P>Increased financial support for voluntary groups providing services for victims of family violence.</P>
    <P>Last week I announced an increase in the basic rate of foster care allowance <Col N="1664" /> payable to foster parents in respect of children aged 12 years and over.  The allowance will be increased from £44.50 to £60 per week with effect from 1 March 1996.  Over 75 per cent of all children in the care of health boards are at present in foster care.</P>
    <P>Details of the further developments to be funded in 1996 are being discussed with the health boards at present.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these major new developments will enhance the capacity of the health boards to meet the challenges that lie ahead in a vitally important area of our social services, and to deliver the range of services and supports required for the effective operation of the Child Care Act.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The subvention scheme which accompanied the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, was implemented on 1 September 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it, receive assistance towards the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 8.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, obliges a health board to follow the procedures <Col N="1665" /> set out in the Second Schedule to the regulations when assessing the means of a person who has applied for a nursing home subvention.  The Second Schedule defines income to include wages, salary, pension, allowances, payments from part-time and seasonal work, income from rentals, investments and savings and all contributions from a separated spouse or other person.  Income from all sources in the twelve months preceding the date of application may be taken into account.  The objective is to establish the weekly disposable income of the person seeking a subvention.  Income tax payments, mortgage repayments, pay-related social insurance payments and other statutory contributions should be deducted from the gross income in arriving at the net amount.  As can can be seen from the above the health boards take into account reasonable outgoings when assessing an applicant's means for subvention and I am satisfied, that there is no need to amend the regulations on this point.</P>
    <P>The current levels of subvention and the position of those dependent elderly who have no funds other than their non-contributory pensions are amongst the various aspects of the scheme which have been examined by a working group, comprised of officials of my Department and the health boards, which reviewed the operation of the Nursing Homes Act.  I understand that the group has finalised its report and I expect to receive it in the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The dental health action plan provides for the setting of oral health goals and the improvement of oral health promotion and preventive <Col N="1667" /> programmes including substantial capital investment in the national fluoridation programme.</P>
      <P>A significant enhancement of the public dental services through a more clearly defined role for health board dentists concentrating to a large extent on oral health care and services for children. There will be a significant increase in manpower.</P>
      <P>The extension of eligibility to children under 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>The improvement of secondary care orthodontic services through the recruitment of additional consultant orthodontists and support staff.</P>
      <P>The expansion of hospital based oral surgery services through the appointment of additional consultant oral surgeons and support staff.</P>
      <P>The introduction of new arrangements for the provision of adult dental services with the participation of private dental practitioners.</P>
      <P>A new Dublin dental hospital and school.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in implementing the action plan as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;The dental treatment services scheme commenced on 1 November 1994.  In the initial phase of the scheme emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults with medical card entitlement. Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons 65 years of age or older with medical card entitlement.  Since the introduction of the scheme waiting lists for dental treatment for medical card holders aged 65 years and over have been eliminated.  It is my intention to introduce the second phase of the scheme on 1 April 1996.  Under the second phase routine dental treatment will be extended to persons with medical card entitlement in the 16-34 year age group and full denture treatment will now be extended to all <Col N="1668" /> edentulous persons with medical card entitlement.  A total of £8.8 million is provided for the dental treatment services scheme in 1996.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Legislation to enable me to extend eligibility to children under 16 is now in place.  I have already extended eligibility to those under 14 years of age.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Additional funding in excess of £3 million is now being provided to health boards on an annual basis for the development of children's dental services.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An additional £1.65 million is now being provided to health boards on an annual basis for the development of orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Approval has issued for the recruitment of over 140 additional staff.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Funding has now been provided to the Mid-Western and Western Health Boards to establish consultant oral surgery services in their regions.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Capital funding in excess of £4 million has been provided to health boards for the improvement of dental facilities and flouridation plant.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Planning for the building and equipping of a new Dublin dental school and hospital is at a very advanced stage.</P>

      <Quest>his current policy on childcare provision; the projects, if any, that have received funding; and the future plans, if any, there are for the development of childcare services.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility for childcare policy resides with my colleague the Minister for Health under the Child Care Act, 1991.  Full implementation of that Act is promised <Col N="1669" /> by the end of this year, when provisions relating to the regulation, supervision and inspection of childcare standards and facilities will be introduced.  This will ensure the necessary regulatory infrastructure for childcare services to develop.  It will also enable better monitoring of the capacity and standards of such services.</P>
      <P>Recognising the contribution which childcare provision can make in promoting equal opportunities I undertook early action on the establishment of my Department to ensure that the National Development Plan included a childcare element.  As a result the Community Support Framework has set aside a total of nearly £8 million to support equal opportunities measures including childcare initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I initiated a pilot childcare initiative in 1994 to support and facilitate a limited number of innovative projects for the setting up, on a pilot basis, of childcare measures utilising the skills of suitably trained local people so as to enable local residents to avail of education, training, retraining and <Col N="1670" /> employment opportunities which they might otherwise be unable to undertake in the absence of a childcare facility. The scheme is targeted at designated disadvantaged areas and is to assist with start-up capital costs only.</P>
    <P>The scheme is being administered, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd., which is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies established by the Government in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The following table details the projects funded to date and funding has already been committed to an additional four projects, subject to their meeting the relevant criteria.</P>
    <P>Additional funds have been provided in 1996 to continue this pilot childcare initiative and I have arranged for a review of the first series of projects to determine whether the objectives of the initiative are being met.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1994 the area of State-owned lands in the Ballycroy area of north-west Mayo amounted to 2,582 hectares.  In 1994 the State acquired a further 3,329 hectares. In 1995 a further 3,804 hectares were purchased to give a total area of 9,715 hectares.</P>
      <P>This total includes 1,778 hectares where the State does not have full title and also includes land acquisitions where contracts are awaiting signature.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service and Mayo County Council have commissioned a study on the &ldquo;Conservation of the Natural Heritage of North-West Mayo&rdquo;.  I hope to have that study available to me within a month or so. Until I have had the opportunity to peruse this study the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to make any announcement concerning a national park or a possible timescale for the acquisition of any further lands that may be recommended for acquisition by the consultants.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities were advised by my Department on 10 February 1994 in relation to external joinery in new local authority housing schemes.  The authorities were requested, with a view to obtaining value for money in the long-term and reducing future maintenance costs, to review their specifications in the light of their experience with the maintenance of their housing stock and to ensure that materials used in new schemes are appropriate for their purpose and local conditions.  The choice of specification should be based on the need to achieve value for money, having regard to initial cost, maintenance cost and the probable life of the elements concerned.  The specification should ensure that the materials and workmanship involved in manufacture and installation meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the EU Construction Products Directive.  Alternative prices should be sought at tender stage for different types of external joinery to enable an assessment to be made by the authority of the best value for money option.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by its enrolment figure at 30 September of the previous school year.  The enrolment for this school on 30 September 1994 was 387 pupils, which warranted a staffing of <Col N="1692" /> principal teacher plus 12 assistant teachers for the 1995-96 school year. Accordingly, there is no basis for the sanction of a 13th assistant for the current school year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment figure for the school at 30 September, 1995 was 390 pupils, but since the staffing schedule for the 1996-97 school year has not yet been determined it is not possible at this stage to indicate what staffing levels will apply next year.</P>

The figure does not include any element in respect of staffing costs, as it would not be feasible to differentiate those costs from the overall staffing costs of the institutions.</P>
      <P>As regards educational facilities, there is a provision of £0.405 million for educational equipment and materials in this year's Prisons Vote.  In addition, the pay costs of teachers, which are funded by the Department of Education, come to approximately £3.014 million.  There is also a prison staffing cost in respect of supervising prison education units, but, as in the case of recreation, it would not be possible to differentiate this.  Figures are not readily available for the capital cost of recreational and educational facilities which have been provided over the years, often as integral parts of broader based capital projects.</P>

      <P>The annual cost of the operation of the prison system per head of the prisoner population was approximately £44,600 in 1995, based on the 1995 provisional outturn.  The estimated cost per prisoner in Mountjoy, Portlaoise and Limerick prisons was £44,000, £88,700 and £54,300 respectively.  The high cost at Portlaoise is attributable to the staffing levels which have been required to cater for subversive prisoners.  The Department's accounting arrangements do not make it practicable to distinguish the cost per female prisoner in Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána are centrally involved on the committees of all of the Youth Diversion Projects funded by my Department to date.  Moreover, they take an active part in the planning and implementation of the activities of each project.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of these projects include: (i) identifying the young people at risk and assessing intervention programme to service their needs; (ii) addressing the needs of the target group by promoting productive and <Col N="1698" /> creative use of their leisure time with a view to enabling their integration into main-stream youth activity groups; (iii) liaising closely with parents, schools, other agencies and the community in general; (iv) developing Garda/community relations.</P>
    <P>The premises used, and equipment required, for these projects varies and is decided on by each committee having regard to local needs and the type of activities undertaken.</P>
    <P>The projects stimulate young people in a positive way through arts and crafts; drama/dance/music; cooking; community awareness courses; camping; climbing; fishing as well as communication and life skills.  In this way the young people are helped to appreciate and understand the value of sport, art, the countryside etc. as well as benefiting from their involvement in these activities in groups.</P>

I am informed by them that the sergeant at Achill retired on 24 December 1995 leaving the station with a strength of <Col N="1701" /> three gardaí.  I understand that arrangements are being made to assign a sergeant from the current promotion list to Achill.</P>

      <P>A number of improvements affecting those 75 years of age or over were introduced in recent years.  Persons aged 75 years and over who were getting or who previously had a free telephone rental allowance retained their entitlement to the allowance regardless of who came to reside with them.  First time applicants for the allowance, aged 75 and over, may qualify if there is one person residing with them who is not normally an excepted person in the household as outlined above.  Furthermore, in last month's budget, I announced that the age limit for dependent children was being increased from 15 to 18 years with effect from next July.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April.  An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 is paid to qualified householders in areas where there is a ban on the sale of bituminous coal.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance was increased from £4 to £5 per week in October 1985. Detailed information on the cost of the various fuel types at that time is not available.</P>
      <P>In the five year period from 1989 to 1994 expenditure on the national fuel scheme increased by almost 54 per cent. This year a sum of £44.5 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the scheme.  Increasing the fuel allowance from £5 to £7.50 per week would cost an estimated £18.3 million.</P>
      <P>Last year I increased the income limit for the national fuel scheme from £5 to £10 per week.  In this year's budget I announced a further £5 increase in the income limit which will take effect from October 1996.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum contributory pension rate or savings/investments of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>Retrospective equal treatment payments are being made in a number of instalments.  Payments on account were made to all claimants by September 1995.  Subsequent payments are being made following a detailed examination of individual claims.  Where this examination revealed that overpayments had occurred on earlier equality payments the amounts over-paid were deducted from the balance of arrears due.  Some 225 such cases were identified by my Department and the amounts due were recovered by deducting the sum due from further payments to be made.  In addition there were two cases where overpayments in respect of earlier social welfare claims were recovered.</P>
      <P>A number of legal issues concerning the question of recovery of overpayments are at present under consideration with the Attorney General's office.  Any further action will depend on the outcome of this consideration.</P>

      <P>An application for grant assistance was received from the person concerned towards the cost of two residential weekends followed by two ten-week courses in bereavement counselling for young adults but could not be met out of the limited resources available.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to export refunds on cattle and beef.</P>
      <P>Last autumn the EU Commission cut export refunds on a number of occasions in order to bring about a more orderly flow of export licence applications in this the first year of the GATT Agreement.  Since then I have done everything possible to get refunds back to levels which would provide reasonable returns to beef producers, and in particular winter fatteners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have impressed on the EU Commission, and my colleagues at the Council of Ministers, the urgent need for <Col N="1714" /> measures to be put in place which would address the problems now being encountered in this sector.  I am pleased that the Commission has responded to this pressure by increasing refund by 5 per cent on live cattle and male carcase beef and 7.5 per cent for boneless beef at the meeting of the beef management committee on 2 February.</P>
    <P>While this increase, following on a 14 per cent increase last December, is welcome I will continue to press for a restoration of the refunds to levels which would make Irish beef and cattle competitive on international markets and at the same time would provide producers with a reasonable return on their investment and effort.</P>
    <P>I wish to add also that the payment of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium, which is worth up to £60 per steer slaughtered this spring, is an important factor in maintaining returns to winter fatteners.  This, in conjunction with premia payments which have increased by £250 million since the CAP reform agreement in 1992, should help to strengthen the income situation of beef producers in general.  I do not need any convincing on the importance of this issue and I will continue with my efforts to seek further export refund increases and use every other means at my disposal to ensure that cattle prices can be maintained at adequate levels.</P>

      <P>There is as yet no <Col N="1715" /> specific stocking density or stocking limits set down for sheep under REPS in proposed NHAs.  Up to now the stocking density to be applied on any NHA site under REPS is that prescribed by the approved REPS planning agency in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</P>
      <P>I have, however, recently arranged to have a group look at the conditions to be applied to the conservation of NHA sites under REPS.  This committee has representation from my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the REPS planning agencies and the farm organisations.  I am satisfied that a set of broad guidelines can be agreed to facilitate planning agencies in setting stocking density for sheep and other livestock in NHA areas.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am happy with the uptake of REPS in NHA and I expect that it will continue to be quite satisfactory.</P>

My Department does not fund repair works at landing facilities.  Such works are a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authority, in this case, Galway County Council.  The Department will in certain instances consider, grant aiding capital development <Col N="1717" /> works if they are in the fisheries interest.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is no storm damage funding mechanism available to my Department.  Funding is only available to aid priority coastal protection works in instances where ongoing erosion is taking place.  In this regard the Department grant aided a £75,000 protection scheme at Gurteen, Roundstone, County Galway, and a £100,000 protection scheme on Inishboffin, County Galway, during 1995.</P>

      <P>In response to representations from the Derryinver Quay Development Group, the Department investigated the possibility of modifying the proposed £60,000 development scheme at Derryinver to allow for the provision of a deepwater all tide landing platform.  The Department's assessment is that the cost of such a modified scheme would be excessive.  The Department is proceeding accordingly with the original improvement scheme and Galway County Council have been informed of this decision.</P>
