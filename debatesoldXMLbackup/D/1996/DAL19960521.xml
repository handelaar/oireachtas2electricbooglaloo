      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Prime Minister and I had a constructive review last night of developments in the lead up to the 10 June all-party negotiations.  We discussed the key issues relating to the arrangements <Col N="1462" /> for the negotiations.  I assure the House that our intensive efforts are aimed at elaborating in detail on how we can deliver our joint commitment that the negotiations will be substantive, fully inclusive and will not become blocked on the decommissioning issue.</P>
    <P>Both the British Prime Minister and I have made clear on a number of occasions that we want a process of negotiation at which all relevant mandated parties will be present.  In that regard, yesterday's statement by Sinn Féin represents a most significant step. The commitments given underline the importance of the Mitchell report in the negotiations.  The Government believes all sides should now agree to pursue the different elements of the report in resolving the outstanding issues on decommissioning.  We hope the IRA will now build on this by reinstating the ceasefire.  That would ensure that the circumstances will be right, including as set down and agreed in the February communiqué, for the success of the fully inclusive all-party negotiations commencing on 10 June.</P>
    <P>Regarding constitutional change, the position of the two Governments on such change, including possible amendments to Articles 2 and 3, is set in the context of a wider constitutional balance to be agreed in an overall settlement. That position is given full expression in paragraphs 14 to 21 of the Joint Framework Document.  The ground rules for the all-party negotiations make clear that any participant will be free to raise any aspect of the three relationships, including constitutional issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if Sinn Féin's commitment to the Mitchell principles is a prelude to a renewed IRA ceasefire, we are on the verge of an historic breakthrough in the peace process?  Does he also agree, however, that a commitment to the principles is not a substitute for an IRA ceasefire and that in the absence of such a ceasefire Sinn Féin cannot be admitted to the all-party talks on 10 June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1463" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from my reply and from what the Government and others said last night that restoration of the ceasefire by the IRA is essential.  The relevant paragraph of the communiqué of 28 February states that both Governments are agreed that the resumption of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin and its participation in negotiations require the restoration of the August 1994 ceasefire.  In political terms, the Mitchell principles require an IRA ceasefire.  They commit those who agreed them to principles which, by their very meaning, are not consistent with anything other than an IRA ceasefire from Sinn Féin's point of view.  For that reason, I hope the logic of Sinn Féin commitment yesterday and the opportunity of holding all-inclusive negotiations on 10 June will require the IRA to restore the cessation of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Sinn Féin's commitment to the Mitchell principles alter in any way the ban on ministerial meetings with Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in the situation so far as this is concerned, but I have indicated on a number of occasions already that discussions between officials are continuing and are intensive and fruitful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that these discussions are being maintained and intensified to clarify some of the issues that need to be clarified.  They are crucially important at this stage.  I agree with the Taoiseach on the logic of following through, but there are some matters that need to be clarified.  One important one is how the Framework Document stands.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcomed the British Prime Minister's <i>Irish Times</i> article.  However, that article omits any mention of the Framework Document.  In the Taoiseach's Finglas speech he said that the whole basis of the discussion was the Framework Document.  The British Prime Minister noted the Finglas speech but <Col N="1464" /> did not endorse it.  Last week in the House the Taoiseach stated that he would be speaking on behalf of both himself and the British Prime Minister. To remove any ambiguity, what is the position of the Framework Document? Do both Governments remain fully committed to it, and will both Governments jointly table the Framework Document at the commencement of the discussions on 10 June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as I think the Deputy knows, is that the Framework Document is referred to where it really matters, that is in paragraph 4 of the ground rules paper for the talks where it is stated by both Governments that the Framework Document represents a shared understanding by the two Governments of the parameters of a possible outcome of the negotiations.  That is an agreed statement between the two Governments in the ground rules paper for the talks. That is a very firm and important commitment. It is important to stress that it is only in the context of a fixed date for all-party talks that the Framework Document can move from being simply a theoretical construct agreed between the two Governments to becoming something else, a working document out of which can come an agreement between all of the parties, not solely between the two Governments.  It is the setting of the fixed date for all-party talks, 10 June, that has given increased relevance and potential to the Framework Document which was absent as long as there was not a fixed date and procedure for all-party talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said in his reply that both Governments were agreed that the decommissioning issue would not be allowed to block all-party negotiations.  The Prime Minister made that clear in his <i>Irish Times</i> article.  That being the case, have the two Governments agreed to the establishment of a fourth strand to deal with the decommissioning issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1465" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Governments are working together on the best way of dealing with that matter in procedural terms.  We are agreed on our objective, which I have already referred to, that this issue will not be allowed to block the talks.  This is consistent with the approach we took in the 28 February communiqué where it is clear that, although this issue must be dealt with, it must be dealt with along with other issues, and assurances must be given to all of the participants that the issues which are of concern to them will be dealt with.  That is set out in the last paragraph of the 28 February communiqué. The detailed procedures and personnel arrangements for translating that into working arrangements after 10 June are being further developed between the Prime Minister and me and between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the basis of what we have already agreed, which is the ground rules paper, a detailed, very strong document in terms of giving direction and focus and assuring comprehensiveness in regard to the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it would be useful if the British Government made a clear statement on where it stands on the Framework Document?  Would he agree that, following the Downing Street Declaration and the original negotiation of the Framework Document and its presentation, the Irish Government should consider it a matter of public face that the British Government should make it clear, without shilly-shallying, where it stands?  There are several references to the belief of people who are important in this process that the omission of reference to the Framework Document in a number of statements and interviews is significant.  If it is not, will the Taoiseach ask the British Government to make the same clear statement he made in his Finglas speech about the Framework Document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1466" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension.  I do not believe there is any doubt in this area.  The British Government has agreed in the ground rules paper for these talks that the Framework Document, which is specifically referred to by name in the ground rules paper for the talks, represents a shared understanding on the part of the two Governments of the parameters of a possible outcome of the negotiations.  That is carrying forward into the ground rules for these talks the statement made when the Prime Minister and I launched the Framework Document.  In other words, the commitment of the two Governments to the Framework Document is not only the same now as it was when the Framework Document was launched but has been enhanced by being included specifically in paragraph 4 of the ground rules for these talks, and is further enhanced by the fact that we have agreed on a mechanism for starting talks on 10 June which gives the possibility of bringing the Framework Document from theory into reality.  That is there currently.  I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that he should not have the worries he seems to have on that point, nor should he encourage others to have them.  I believe the commitment of the British Government to the Framework Document in the ground rules document is as clear as can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach is so confident.  I would like to hear the British Government say exactly what he is saying.  I find it difficult to understand why it will not do that. Would the Taoiseach agree that Senator Mitchell's involvement in the process should not be confined to a strand IV relating to the decommissioning issue, but that he should also be the chairperson of the strand II process which is the North-South dimension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the personnel for the various roles to be fulfilled, the structure of their responsibilities etc., has yet to be settled <Col N="1467" /> between the two Governments and announced jointly by the two Governments. All discussions about how individuals might be involved should be conducted jointly by the two Governments, not individually by one Government. Having said that, I have to say very strongly that I believe Senator George Mitchell has an unrivalled capacity to make a valuable contribution in this area.</P>
      <P>Anybody who looks at the Mitchell report in the context of the passage of time will see that constantly people return to the original Mitchell-de Chastelain-Holkeri text as constituting the solution to problems as they arise.  It is a document of great durability in terms of the balance it strikes, which becomes ever more evident with the passage of time.  It is clear that, increasingly, various parties return to the Mitchell report as constituting the basis for future progress. That is a tribute to the subtlety, intelligence, balance and ability to understand various points of view, of Senator Mitchell in particular, but also of General de Chastelain and Mr. Holkeri in the report of the international body.  Clearly they have a very valuable potential role to play in the matter but any announcements or decisions are matters for joint action by the Governments rather than unilateral action by one Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the decommissioning process is qualitatively different from the other potential subject matters of talks, deserves different treatment &mdash; whether they be called &ldquo;fourth strand&rdquo; or whatever &mdash; and requires a different process, approach, in all likelihood, different participants and a less party political approach than might be required in the case of other issues? Will he agree, therefore, that decommissioning should not be viewed simply as a subcommittee of a political process but dealt with in a different, separate channel of its own?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1468" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I might agree with Deputy McDowell's conclusions, I would not necessarily agree with the entirety of the argumentation he advanced in favour of his conclusions. The truth of the matter is that undoubtedly the decommissioning issue involves specific technical aspects but also political ones.  For example, it is important to recognise that decommissioning will happen in practice only if progress is made on political matters.  Therefore, there is an inherent link between the technical and political aspects and it is in finding an appropriate way of making that link one must proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Taoiseach's comments on the subtlety and importance of the Mitchell report, something recognised by all sides but particularly by Members on these benches and accepted prior to its publication.  Since part of that report talked of the need for confidence-building measures &mdash; and while, of course, prisoners have played a vital role in the overall peace process &mdash; will the Taoiseach say whether he will make representations to the British Prime Minister to bring forward clear statements on their position?  While recognising what has been achieved this side of the Border and the role of prisoners generally, will the Taoiseach seek clarification about their future, with some early releases, as confidence-building measures, in an effort to bring about a reinstatement of the ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated in the House the view I and the Government take as to how we will approach the prisoner issue in the aftermath of an IRA ceasefire.  It is also fair to say that the transfer of prisoners' arrangement agreed with the British authorities indicates a willingness on their part to show humanitarian concern in regard to prisoner issues.  From the victims' perspective, clearly the possibility of such an occurrence would be greatly enhanced by a restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  It should be clear to <Col N="1469" /> those who must take the decision on a complete cessation of violence on the part of the IRA that it will have undoubted benefits for those who are imprisoned &mdash; and their families.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised the matter of confidence-building measures, a very important element of the Mitchell report &mdash; the treatment of prisoners being one issue referred to in it &mdash; as well as policing, targeting and punishment beatings.  There is a range of confidence-building measures that can be taken right across the spectrum to ensure the negotiations proceed in the best possible atmosphere.  I urge everybody to look at the Mitchell report as a whole, not merely to pick some of its confidence-building measures because they like them and are ones somebody else will have to implement but rather to look particularly at those to which they themselves can contribute.  That should be something that would influence comment on the matter as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is important that the British and Irish Governments quickly agree to the agenda and procedures for the all-party talks?  That being the case, does he intend to have a meeting with the British Prime Minister before 10 June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to make the point that the British Government and ourselves have made it clear we want to see an open agenda but, equally, we want participants to be able to place matters on the agenda.  Therefore, it would be a bit presumptuous for the two Governments to agree to set the agenda before the participants have met.  On the other hand, we must clarify to the greatest extent possible the procedures whereby the agenda items, including those we, as Governments, might wish to place on the agenda as well as items others might want to place on it, will be processed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question last week when I referred to the fact that there is a time limit of a year in the legislation, with a possible extension of one year.  I indicated I consider it might be useful if all the participants could agree a tighter timeframe on an indicative basis, without creating a cage within which everybody is confined, at least to assist us in goal-setting in the talks.  I have already said that but probably it is something best done by the talks' participants themselves, with the urging of the Governments, rather than by the Governments before the talks begin.  If everybody is to adhere to a timetable they must have ownership of it; therefore, the people concerned should set a timetable and agree it rather than have others do it for them before they meet.  I agree with Deputy Dermot Ahern &mdash; and indeed it is true that the Ulster Unionist Party in a statement also indicated it would like to see a concentrated period &mdash; that there be a relatively limited timeframe for negotiations. I do not think there is really a difference here but it is best that it be done in the talks rather than in advance of them.</P>

      <P>I meet with the President of Finland, Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, on Wednesday, 15 May.  The meeting was a most useful one in the context of preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  Our discussions were wide-ranging covering in particular the Irish Presidency of the European Union, the security situation in European, including that in former Yugoslavia, the future direction of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy and relations between the EU and Russia.</P>
      <P>I found President Ahtisaari's insight into the security situation in Europe and the situation in Russia of particular interest and value.  The meeting also helped to highlight the broad similarity of the position of both Finland and Ireland in regard to the future evolution of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy.</P>

      <P>The Finnish President explained to me in great detail about the zone of instability along his borders and the reason he believes his country should play a prominent role in the partnership for peace, which is a change from his traditional stance.  During the Taoiseach's discussions with the President, did he find that the President's views on NATO and the partnership for peace were different from the position of this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>I do not know that the Finnish President said to the Deputy so I cannot comment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> During the President's discussions with me we focused on points of agreement, in particular in regard to the joint Finnish-Swedish memorandum on links between the European Union and the Western European Union where the joint position of the Finns and Swedes, involving arrangements for the participation by neutral countries in Petersberg tasks peacekeeping type operations under the aegis of the Western European Union, at which we are already observers, was developed in some detail by the Finns and the Swedes and there is a close proximity of view in regard to that sort of matter.  In our discussions we did not dwell to any degree on the partnership for peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain how we would involve ourselves under the auspices of the Western European Union in the Petersberg tasks as we are merely observers and the Petersberg tasks specifically allow only full members of the Western European Union to participate with full forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the areas where change might be made to allow observers who are not committed under Article 5 to participate in peacekeeping operations.  The Irish Government has already indicated a willingness to move in that direction.  The Tánaiste did so, so did I and it has been set out in the White Paper.  As a country we are interested in being involved in peacekeeping, it is important to make the point &mdash; and one of President Ahtisaari's most memorable phrases while here was that &ldquo;Ireland and Finland are both world powers in terms of their commitment and involvement in peacekeeping operations&rdquo;.  That is an indication of the importance of the sort of peacekeeping type activity envisaged in the Petersberg tasks area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, he may be aware that while he and the Tánaiste were struggling to prepare the White Paper and <Col N="1473" /> agree a wording that would not be totally out of line with the Democratic Left policy, Fianna Fáil published a policy on this whole area and committed itself to extending the peacekeeping role past the UN into the EU.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that it would be the view of the Irish people generally that extending our peacekeeping role within Europe should be done as a neutral nation and not in association with NATO, the partnership for peace or the Western European Union but should be done by making our expertise available to the European Union without being involved as a member of any of the bodies just mentioned?</P>

      <P>We have indicated in our White Paper on Foreign Policy that we are willing to look at movement in the area of increased involvement in peacekeeping operations.  I believe the Government is willing to consider possibilities in the area of the partnership for peace.  As far as the Western European Union is concerned, we are already observers and there are tasks of a Petersberg task peacekeeping kind in which we could participate without jeopardising our neutral status or entering into any commitments.  The position is that we are indicating a willingness to participate on a case by case basis in possible Petersberg task operations of the Western European Union. I emphasise that it is case by case, in other words, the Irish Government will make an individual decision in respect of each operation and there would be no question of our being bound to participate in any range or type of operation. Each decision will be an individual separate decision and of course that approach is consistent with and is actually an expression of neutrality.  Nobody suggests that a neutral country does not take action to protect peace.  We do so already as neutrals under the United Nations but each decision is taken individually on its own merits and as we approach peacekeeping under the UN aegis so too would we approach peacekeeping under the Western European Union aegis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10, 35, 37 and 54 together.  It remains the objective of the Minister that work commences on the site of the proposed national conference centre by the end of the year.  The achievement of that objective, however, depends on a number of factors, including, whether a viable proposal acceptable to the Government finally emerges from current negotiations and the position to be taken by the European Commission whose formal approval is required for the associated European Regional Development Fund grant.  Following the termination of the open tendering competition late last year, the Minister asked Bord Fáilte to pursue an earlier proposal from the RDS to develop, in its Ballsbridge site, without generating voluntary society, a national conference centre for up to 2,000 delegates at its Ballsbridge site, without any annual operating subsidy.  That assessment process is now nearing finalisation and should be complete within the next few weeks.  As the Deputy can appreciate it is important that a project of this scale and complexity is properly planned and adequately assessed.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any formal legal action pending in relation to the open tendering competition which took place last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister had a meeting some months ago with representatives of SONAS, at its request, at which it gave a presentation of its proposals to develop a complex at the Phoenix Park racecourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's reply appears to indicate that the building of the conference centre will not commence by the end of the year, but I understood from his ministerial colleague, Deputy Kenny, that it would be up and running sometime after the end of this year.  Now we are told there is a delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the SONAS application to build a casino, will the Minister of State indicate if the Government is for or <Col N="1477" /> against that project in the light of planning permission granted for the development on the site of the former Phoenix Park racecourse?  Will the Government introduce legislation to provide for a casino?  Will the Minister amend the gaming and lotteries laws? Will the Minister of State indicate the direction the Government is going in this area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of amending the gaming and lotteries laws is a separate question.  I am informed that no decision has been taken on the SONAS proposal.  The proposal for the RDS is under consideration and discussions on the funding of the project are taking place in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Regarding the commencement of work on the proposed national conference centre, I refer the Deputy to my reply where I stated that it remains the Minister's objective that work will commence on the site by the end of the year. That is still the objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not a farce and a nightmare?  Given what the Minister of State said and what his senior Minister said, is it not the case that the conference centre will cause great difficulty for the Government?  The suggestion that the construction of the centre will commence by the end of the year might be a good election issue.  As in the case of 1916, people will ask what the coalition did about the conference centre. The proposed conference centre is to be sited in the middle of one of the most traffic congested areas in Dublin.  We have a relevant proposition in that regard to which the Minister of State might respond.  If the SONAS development in the Phoenix Park becomes a reality, an outstanding conference centre will be located there.  If the proposed conference centre in the RDS also proceeds, there will be a surplus of conference centres.  I suggest that the SONAS development might be a considerably better conference centre than the one proposed in the RDS.</P>

      <P>As the Minister, Deputy Kenny, outlined to the Deputy in response to a previous question in June 1995, the State export credit insurance scheme was restructured at the end of 1991.  In line with the restructuring, cover under the State scheme is offered to exporters on short-term political risk and on medium-term project risk, while cover on short-term commercial risk &mdash; which constitutes the bulk of demand from Irish exporters &mdash; is provided by the private sector.  The Government policy is that the scheme should be operated in a way that assists the development of exports while taking <Col N="1479" /> due account of the need to protect the interests of the taxpayer.

      <P>The first phase of the consideration of a brand image for Irish tourism was completed in the spring of 1995 with a presentation of initial consultancy findings to the Tourism Council. A partnership forum was organised by Bord Fáilte on 24 October 1995 to give leading figures in the tourism industry an opportunity to hear the results of research carried out in the interim on international consumer perspectives of Ireland and to debate further steps in the development of the brand image.  It was agreed that Bord Fáilte would continue, under the aegis of an advisory group led by Bord Fáilte's international marketing director, to develop brand positioning proposals and a communications strategy.</P>
      <P>In recent months Bord Fáilte has sought approaches from suitable advertising practitioners who would be capable of carrying out the strategic and creative development of a new branded advertising approach.  Advertising agencies have now been short-listed and will be making their final presentations at the end of May.  I also understand that initial assessments are currently in hand to select a design agency.  Bord Fáilte envisages that the new creative and design work will be completed during the summer and that the brand will be ready for launching in our international markets at the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The strong and substantial growth in tourism in recent years has led to reports of capacity problems during the peak season at some of the more popular tourist sites. The overall management of tourism flows is a matter primarily for the regional tourism authorities.  The regional tourism organisations, and SFADCo in the case of the mid-west, working closely with local tourism operators, and through their respective tourist information networks, play a critical role in maximising visitor awareness of the range and accessibility of attractions within their respective regions.</P>
      <P>This approach has been fully supported by the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93, a feature of which was the extent to which it achieved a good regional spread of investment and helped to build the tourism industry right across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> This is expected to continue under the current Operational Programme which covers the period 1994-99.  The latter programme also aims to concentrate a significant proportion of growth in the shoulder and off-peak period, that is outside the July-August period.  Grant assistance for marketing activities is weighted in favour of projects that aim to achieve this objective, while all tourism projects assisted under the programme are required to comply with the best environmental standards.</P>
    <P>In general, as I will indicate in a separate reply to Deputy Dermot Ahern, a balance must be struck between tourism development and preservation of the environment.  Ideally, the objective is to encourage investment which will facilitate enhancement of the physical environment and economic development while at the same time assisting the preservation of the historical and architectural heritage of cities and towns in a manner of interest to both the domestic and foreign visitor.</P>
    <P>As part of our policy to expand the range and accessibility of tourist attractions, the programme is also being complemented by planned investment under other EU co-funded programmes, for example, on directional signposting, improvements to certain key strategic tourism roads outside the national primary road system, improvements to sanitary services affecting or adjacent to important tourist areas and urban renewal projects.</P>

Has any person or group within his Department or Bord Fáilte been charged with responsibility for establishing the locations coming under development pressure as a result of the number of tourists visiting them; in other words, is anyone liaising with local authorities on this issue?  There is a concern on one side that spurious claims <Col N="1483" /> are made about pressure being put on the environment, but there is also a very real and justified fear that development and tourism pressure will damage the key areas we are trying to preserve.

Question No. 13 asks the Minister his views from a tourism point of view of the licensing of a casino in this State; whether he has studied the benefits for the tourism industry of the establishment of a casino; if so, the findings of these studies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  That is a straightforward question.  Question No. 57 asks the Minister the studies, if any, that have been carried out by his Department on the tourism benefits of a casino; and his views on the matter.

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the identifiable weaknesses, if any, that have been tackled in respect of the operational programme for tourism; and the weaknesses, if any, that are still prevalent in view of the fact that the mid-point of the operational programme for tourism has been reached.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10251/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government specifically identified two major weaknesses which could be addressed in the context of the current operational programme in order to capitalise on the benefits of a vibrant and expanding tourism sector.</P>
      <P>First, the Irish tourism product in terms of range, standards and facilities is still deficient compared to competitors. In short, there is a need for more leisure options to attract international visitors.  A strong focus on weather-independent tourism facilities is required.  Second, the tourism industry remains highly seasonal, necessitating the development of tourism products suitable for year-round business.</P>
      <P>The operational programme aimed to address these weaknesses by putting in place substantial investment, the strategic emphasis of which has been targeted at developing a new and improved product base, including weather-independent facilities, and expanded and more focused marketing and training.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is building on the partnership between the public and private sectors initiated under the last operational programme.  The strategy pursued under this programme will assist the further development of the tourism sector in Ireland by concentrating on a large expansion in marketing activities, further product development to meet specific market deficiencies, major improvements in the conference, angling and cultural tourism products, and an expansion in the range and scale of training to cater for anticipated employment growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the assessment and selection of projects for European Regional Development Fund support, the product development management boards are mindful of gaps in Ireland's tourism product portfolio which need to be filled as previously outlined.  In addition, the present operational programme for <Col N="1490" /> tourism will undergo a thorough evaluation by independent consultants later this year as part of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are the consultants? Are they Irish or are they part of the European gravy train?  I am not demeaning consultants, but there are too many consultancy reports on various matters.  Consultancy can be seen as a recipe for inactivity.  Will the Minister give more detail on the important point he made in the first part of his reply about more leisure options?  Will he comment on the failure of the Government to support the World Equestrian Games, which was a leisure option?  Can the Minister of State tell the House why RTE is not televising the Irish women's golf open, which is another leisure option?  This competition is supported by the Guardian insurance company and Bord Fáilte. Will the Minister of State explain why the Olympic Games are not being located in Ireland on the basis of large schemes and proposals in that regard? In the context of more leisure options, is it intended to construct a 50-metre swimming pool and to locate it in Dublin city or county?</P>

      <P>Monitoring of the scheme takes the form of reviews which are carried out approximately every three years.  When the scheme was last reviewed in 1992 figures showed that, while only about 20 per cent of initial projected exports were achieved, over two-thirds were new exports.

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 16, 41, 56 and 256 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22 February last I announced a special joint home holiday initiative for the tourism industry on the basis of a specific allocation of £500,000 which I <Col N="1496" /> secured from Government towards the implementation costs, with co-financing from the industry.  This initiative was in response to recommendations contained in the report on domestic tourism prepared for the Tourism Council.</P>
    <P>I sought and received the views of a wide range of interested parties on the recommendations in the domestic tourism report.  I subsequently set up a steering group, which I chair, to examine the report, its recommendations and the submissions received with a view to developing an advertising and promotion programme to stimulate and accelerate growth in the home holiday market, particularly in the shoulder and off season periods.  The work of this group is now almost completed and I expect to be able to announce details of a wide ranging domestic marketing programme shortly.</P>

      <P>I agree it is an impressive working group.  Did the working group consider the success of the Northern <Col N="1498" /> Ireland Tourist Board in attracting visitors from the Republic, particularly last year and the year before, and the relative lack of success in this country in terms of domestic tourism in areas which have shown minimal or no growth and in the shoulder season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This initiative was undertaken in an effort to check the decline in domestic tourist numbers.  We hope we will be able to encourage people to take holidays at home, particularly in the shoulder and off peak periods. I appreciate that arising from the ceasefire there was a fall off in business from the North.  We hope to address that problem and to encourage people to holiday at home, if possible.  The Government has given £0.5 million to initiate this programme which will be coupled with a contribution from the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

We must bear in mind that there will not be action on this programme before June. Some £0.5 million for half a year is a generous amount when matched with funds from the industry.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the number of persons who completed CERT courses since 1990; the estimated number of these participants who are now employed in the hotel, catering and tourism industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period 1990 to 1995, over 63,000 persons completed CERT training courses, of whom approximately 36,000 were on release from employment in the industry to participate in continuing training while the remaining 27,000 were recent school leavers or unemployed.</P>
      <P>The most recent surveys carried out by CERT covering the period between 1982 and 1994 indicate that 76 per cent of full-time trainees are still employed in the industry, while approximately 73 per cent of trainees from the ranks of the unemployed are still in employment or undertaking further training.</P>
      <P>The importance of providing high quality training for new entrants and the existing workforce in tourism has been fully recognised in the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99.  It is envisaged that a total of £110 million will be invested in tourism training over the life of the programme and that over 72,000 will be trained.  This almost doubles the number trained under the last operational programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people who already work in the industry and who have undergone a great deal of training come back to train in specialist areas of cooking, while others who are unemployed train for a short period and are <Col N="1500" /> given a certificate.  If people want to upgrade skills and enhance their chances of full-time employment, their option is open to them under the CERT system.  That is how it works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the employer does not attract customers, he will not employ these people.  Some 76 per cent of full-time trainees are still employed in the industry, while 73 per cent of those in short-term training come from the ranks of the unemployed.  That is a fair indication of the success of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other agencies to which the Deputy referred include the regional technical colleges and the Shannon College of Hotel Management. I imagine they have their system of measurement.  This question deals specifically with CERT courses, not the other agencies.  Given the reputation which the regional technical colleges and the Shannon College of Hotel Management have acquired, it is safe to say they are held in high esteem by the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anybody believes there is something wrong with CERT courses, I would like to make it clear that they have produced extremely good hotel people.  Young men and women have been advantaged as a result of their involvement with CERT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> From my perspective and little knowledge of the industry, we have very good hotels run by extremely good managers and helpful staff.  Without sounding sycophantic, CERT provides good courses and people emerging from them are very well trained.  It is to the advantage of our tourism industry that these courses continue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 21, 39 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade Ministers from the European Union, Canada, Japan and the United States held their 28th Quadrilateral Meeting in Kobe, Japan, on 19-21 April this year.  The EU was represented by <Col N="1502" /> Commission Vice-President, Sir Leon Britton.</P>
    <P>The Quad series of meetings is intended to provide a mechanism to facilitate the exchange of ideas among the major trading partners.  The purpose of this meeting was to review developments in international trade and to continue planning and preparation for the ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation due to be held in Singapore next December.  Many of the items currently on the multilateral trade agenda were discussed including the need for full implementation of the WTO agreements; the negotiation of an information technology agreement which is an initiative for trade liberalisation in the information technology industry; progress in the WTO services negotiations and the so-called &ldquo;new agenda&rdquo; issues due to be discussed at Singapore, including trade and investment.</P>
    <P>The meeting agreed that Quad members would seek the establishment of an informal WTO working group on trade and investment in Geneva with a view to establishing a formal WTO working group on the issue at the Singapore ministerial conference.  The European Union's input into such a group, if established, will be agreed by the EU Council at meetings at which all member states, including Ireland, will be represented.</P>
    <P>The meeting further underlined the partners' commitment to achieving a successful outcome to the Singapore ministerial conference and to strengthening the multilateral system of trade through increased opening of markets. As a small country dependent on trade, this is an approach from which Ireland will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the EU would be represented by the Commissioner at these talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern relates to Ireland's position and our input at such meetings through the relevant Commissioner, Sir Leon Britton.  The problems that beset Ireland in trade terms are different from <Col N="1503" /> those of some of our European partners. Will the Minister give an assurance that Ireland's position will be sufficiently considered in the EU context in these talks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 48 and 253 together.</P>
      <P>Recent developments in the Irish film industry, assisted by Government incentives to stimulate investment here in film making, have added to Ireland's image as a vibrant cultural centre and provide much needed employment both for highly skilled personnel in the industry and in the local communities where the films are shot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to availing of any publicity opportunities that arise in its overseas markets, Bord Fáilte, in the light of the large number of films now being made here, is currently preparing material for <Col N="1504" /> a possible future publication featuring films, including &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, and popular television series which have used an Irish theme.  Bord Fáilte will also consider the case for assisting any viable proposal to preserve sets where developers envisage making them into permanent sustainable tourism attractions.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, as the certifying authority for film and television projects under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, is anxious that the Irish element of production is highlighted both in terms of cast and crew in each production certified.  Accordingly, earlier this year he laid down an additional condition in each certificate providing that the end-credits of the production must state that the production was &ldquo;filmed on location in Ireland&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, however, was certified prior to the introduction of this condition.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, in relation to the &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; project specifically, that although largely filmed in Ireland, the film had a Scottish theme.  The opportunities for tourism will not therefore be as obvious as was the case with films such as &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;, and with more recent productions such as &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo;, &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Friend Joe&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it was obvious in advance of the Oscars that &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; would do well and that opportunities would be presented in production and so on and also in terms of tourism?  He rightly stated that the story behind &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; was set in Scotland, but it was filmed in Ireland. Will the Minister agree it is unfortunate and careless of the authorities here that Scotland should reap the benefits in terms of tourism since the scenery in the film is Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's disappointment that we cannot capitalise on &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, but unfortunately <Col N="1505" /> no provision was made in that regard at the time of filming.  That matter has been addressed since and I do not envisage a repetition of what happened in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the statement that we have not been able to capitalise on &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; as in areas where it was filmed there is an increase in tourism traffic.  Is the Minister aware that one of the sets in &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, Dunsoghly Castle in St. Margaret's, which was previously open to the public, has been closed since the film was made because it was overwhelmed with the number of people seeking entry?  Will the Minister ensure that where a location is used agreement is reached between the Office of Public Works and the owners beforehand so that we do not shoot ourselves in the foot in terms of attracting extra tourists?  We should be prepared for what happens as a result of filming so that benefits accrue to the local economy.  I understand negotiations are ongoing in this regard. Will the Minister say whether the problem has been resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Access to locations would be desirable but much depends on the good will of the owner of the property, be it public or private, as to whether they want to provide access to the set.  A problem arises in that many sets are made of plastic which does not weather well and is not durable.  It is not possible to make such sets available as ongoing tourist attractions.  The film with which I am most familiar is &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; where a village set on the Dingle Peninsula was demolished after filming.  At the time that would have been a tremendous tourist attraction, and to this day people visit that site to see where the film was made.  I will convey the Deputy's remarks to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>When the film &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; was being made I suggested that the film set be maintained as a tourist attraction.  During <Col N="1506" /> filming crowds of people visited that marvellous piece of modern art.  It is a great pity sets are removed by film companies after filming.  Where there is a decent historic set it would be to the advantage of the country, particularly in terms of tourism, that it be maintained, probably by the State.  I take the Minister's point that much of the material used in film sets is plastic and would not weather well, but if properly maintained it would meet the objectives we seek to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the owners of film sets as to whether they should be retained, and, perhaps, agreement could be reached with the authorities here in that regard.  Ashford Castle in Cong, County Mayo, was used for the making of a film and to this day it is a tourist attraction.  One of the items on sale there is a video of the film. Unfortunately, all film sets are not of such durable quality.  It is a matter for the film maker as to whether to leave a set in place and for the Government to decide if it is to our advantage to buy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind that I am referring to historic items supervised and managed by the Office of Public Works?  The roof of Dunsoghly Castle, which was built in the 1400s and has proved very durable, was used as a model for the repair of Bunratty Castle.  Will the Minister ensure agreements are made with the owners of film sets to make them available for the benefit of the local community afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy's Killeen's question about possible damage to the environment, I wish to state that some historic sites may be damaged by a large number of visitors. Even castles may be overpopulated by tourists.  I recently attended a conference at which it was stated that Mediterranean countries experience the problem of too many people visiting their historic sites.  For example, too many people visit the historic walkways <Col N="1507" /> in Britain, thereby posing a threat to the environment.  These matters must be taken into account when considering access to historic sites.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 42 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>One of the major changes arising from the Arthur D. Little consultancy review of Bord Fáilte was the outsourcing of certain of the board's inspection and associated functions in relation to the registration and grading of tourist accommodation under the Tourist Traffic Acts of 1939 and 1995 and the certification of restaurants under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 Tourist Traffic Act enabled Bord Fáilte to subcontract these functions to a third party but did not provide for changes in the existing registration conditions and standards.  Under the new arrangements, the board will retain ownership of the registration and grading standards, continue to set the criteria for registration and grading and prescribe the various fees involved by regulation made, with the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939-1995.  Bord Fáilte will also continue to retain responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the <Col N="1513" /> appeals mechanism provided for under the Acts, when applications for registration and renewal of registration are refused and in the case of cancellation of registration.  It will also be involved in the final stages of the appeals mechanism for grading accommodation.  Bord Fáilte will also monitor the performance of the contractor to ensure that operations are efficiently carried out and quality standards maintained.</P>
    <P>Following an open, publicly advertised tendering procedure conducted in accordance with EU rules, Tourism Quality Services (Ireland) Limited was selected to undertake the functions being outsourced.  A contract for a period of five years was signed between Bord Fáilte and Tourism Quality Services (Ireland) Limited, an Irish subsidiary established to carry out the work. The company, which is based in Dublin, has recruited locally.  Tourism Quality Services (Ireland) Limited will undertake inspections and related functions in relation to the registration and classification of hotels, guesthouses, caravan and camping sites, holiday cottages and holiday apartments &mdash; group schemes above eight units only &mdash; and the registration of holiday hostels, youth hostels and holiday camps.</P>
    <P>In the case of the bed and breakfast sector a number of industry associations have been formally recognised by Bord Fáilte as self-regulatory bodies for the purpose of approving bed and breakfast and other specialist accommodation and awarding the shamrock symbol subject to their complying with Bord Fáilte agreed standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister is acutely conscious of the importance of maintaining high quality standards for tourist accommodation. Providing a product of the highest quality is a fundamental objective of Government policy for the development of the tourism sector.  There is no reason to believe that the operational changes which have taken place will adversely affect standards.  The key roles being retained by Bord Fáilte in the registration, grading and certification process and in relation to the setting of the bed <Col N="1514" /> and breakfast standards will be critical in ensuring that the board maintains tight control on the standards and procedures to be used while being relieved of the more routine physical inspection procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council adopted directives for the negotiation of a comprehensive long-term agreement between the Union and South Africa in June 1995.  The directives provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that South Africa should be asked to initiate a process leading to progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade with a view to establishing a free trade area.  On 25 March this year, the General Affairs Council agreed the mandate for the Union's participation in negotiations on a free trade area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has enjoyed a healthy trade surplus with South Africa for many years and there are few products imported into the Union from South Africa which could be regarded as competing with Irish products.  As Ireland's exports to South Africa are generally subject to high access barriers, which restrict market opportunities, a free trade agreement would see a phased elimination of such barriers and would boost export opportunities for Irish companies.  An Bord Tráchtála is very active in the South African market and <Col N="1515" /> well placed to develop any opportunities that may arise.  A liberal free trade agreement with South Africa would be broadly supported by Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely, I understand, that an agreement with South Africa can be concluded during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I would, however, wish to see significant progress made on this issue during our Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 47 and 255 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade set out the Government's position on support for the World Equestrian Games when he spoke on an Adjournment debate in this House on 17 April. I think it would be useful in responding to the questions put by Deputies to reiterate some of the main points made in that debate.</P>
      <P>The allocation of the World Equestrian Games to Ireland and the organising of those games are matters in the first instance for the Federation Equestre International and World Equestrian Games Limited.  The policy of both this and the previous Government has been to encourage and assist the WEG in its work, where appropriate, to ensure commercially successful games that would reflect well on this country in equestrian and general promotional terms.  To this end WEG (Ireland) Limited was given, via Bord Fáilte, an initial grant of £250,000 in 1994 to assist with start-up costs, with no commitment to funding in later years.  That was made very clear, in writing, by the previous Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
      <P>However, deterioration in the WEG's financial perspectives became apparent to the Minister in early 1995 when the company confirmed escalation by £6.3 million in projected costs since the successful bid, including its revelation that provision had now to be made for a fee of £4.5 million which it had agreed to pay the FEI for hosting the games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At meetings in March 1995 with the chairman of the WEG, the Minister made plain his very serious concern at the manner in which the WEG had managed events, underlining the fact that the company had been told repeatedly that the Government would not underwrite the games.  On foot of certain assurances from the WEG chairman, including company optimism about prospects for generating up to £6 <Col N="1517" /> million in corporate sponsorship which would turn the games into profit, a further grant of £250,000, again with no future funding commitment, was provided by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>To allow the WEG retain the games at that point, Bord Fáilte also agreed to guarantee an undertaking, given by the company, to the FEI for payment in respect of hosting the games in this country of not more than £1.5 million from proceeds in 1998.  This guarantee is subject to the fulfilment of the terms of the contract governing the granting of the games.</P>
    <P>In December 1995 the WEG indicated to the Department that the FEI had still not put a TV strategy in place and that to meet cash flow requirements it would need a further grant of £500,000 in 1996 and a bankable commitment for a similar figure in 1997, otherwise it would be unable to continue trading.  Despite repeated indications that commercial sponsorship would be signed up, no contracts had been negotiated.  The WEG's only source of funding continued to be the Exchequer and the company was in deficit.  The Minister asked the company to reconsider its proposals, examine possible ways of reducing costs and to come up with hard evidence of adequate levels of sponsorship in the light of its £10.9 million cost projections for the event.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a satisfactory response to his request from the company, the Minister completed a review of the State's involvement in the games with particular reference to the financial exposure of the Exchequer and the credibility of the figures in the WEG's business plan.  He subsequently brought the matter to the attention of the Government following which the WEG was informed on 27 March that it had been decided to cease further State financial support for the games.</P>
    <P>While there have been numerous contacts with the WEG since that date, no substantial case has yet been put forward which the Minister believes would warrant a reversal of the Government's <Col N="1518" /> decision.  The Minister has had no contact with the FEI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be a good idea for the Minister to contact the FEI as a matter of urgency?  My information is that there may be a sponsor to rescue these games.  In those circumstances, will the Minister do the business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey the Deputy's wishes to the Minister on the basis of his comments regarding sponsorship. If there is a sponsor, we should try to find him.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement Amending the Fourth ACP-EC Convention of Lomé and the Protocol concerning the Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the Convention subsequent to the Enlargement of the European Union, signed in Mauritius on 4 November 1995, together with the related Internal Agreement on the financing of and administration of Community aid, signed in Brussels on 20 December 1995, copies of which have been laid before the Dáil on 15 May 1996.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring before the House this motion to approve the terms of an Agreement amending the Fourth Lomé Convention.</P>
      <P>The Lomé Convention is a framework of partnership and co-operation between the member states of the European Union and 70 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  It remains the most comprehensive collective agreement ever adopted between the countries of the north and those of the south.  It is probably the best known instrument of Community policy in the field of development co-operation, and it is certainly the most important.  As it deals with the concerns of some of the poorest farming communities in the world, I am sorry that Deputies Cowen and O'Keeffe are not here to hear it discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> The Fourth Lomé Convention has as its objective &ldquo;to promote and expand the economic, cultural and social development of the ACP states and to consolidate and diversify the relations between the community and the ACP states in a spirit of solidarity and mutual interest&rdquo;.  This objective continues to govern the terms of the agreement signed in Mauritius last November amending the Fourth Lomé Convention which I am commending to the House today.</P>
    <P>Unlike earlier conventions designed to cover a five year period, the Fourth Lomé Convention signed in Togo in December 1989, was concluded for a period of ten years.  However, the financial Protocol attached to the Convention was limited to an initial five year period with renegotiation to take place at the end of that time.  In addition, to provide greater flexibility in the implementation of the Convention, Lomé Four provided that either side could request at the end of this five year period a review of other clauses in the agreement should this prove necessary. It is the outcome of this mid-term review that is before the House today for its approval.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Lomé Convention contained strengthened provisions in respect of rural development and food security, and expanded the list of agricultural products free to enter the Community without duty.  It also liberated rules of origin for industrial goods and provided financial support to assist structural reform programmes as well as placing enhanced emphasis on preservation of the environment in ACP states.  The Convention also contained strengthened provisions on human rights and on the role of women in development.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Fourth Lomé Convention contains four essential features: it is a contract, negotiated to last for ten years, between equal partners; it respects each partner's freedom to choose its economic model and political system, subject to specific human rights <Col N="1743" /> provisions; it is a comprehensive agreement that combines a range of co-operation instruments; its institutions &mdash; ACP-EU Council of Ministers and Committee of Ambassadors and the ACP-EU Joint Assembly &mdash; allow for a permanent dialogue between Governments and with the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Without entering into unnecessary detail, I would like to outline to the House the background to the agreement signed last November revising the Fourth Lomé Convention together with its main provisions.  It was not intended that the process of review would involve a global negotiation of the Fourth Lomé Convention.  Instead, emphasis was placed on a new issues of mutual importance to EU member states and to the ACP partners.  During the first five years many momentuous events in world terms had taken place &mdash; the end of the Cold War, the transition to democracy in South Africa, the outbreak of war in the former Yugoslavia, to mention a few.  In terms of the developments in European and world history, together with the accession of the new states of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the European Union, the review was timely.</P>
    <P>The main conclusions of the review fall under four main headings: political, economic, sectoral and financial.  I will outline those briefly.  In regard to political and institutional issues, one of the most encouraging trends of recent years &mdash; something we perhaps register too lightly &mdash; is widespread acceptance today that breaches of human rights are the legitimate concern of the entire international community.  In the revised Convention, observers of human rights and the rule of law are made mandatory requirements.  In practice this means that if human rights principles are violated and if agreed mechanisms of consultation fail, there can be total or partial suspension of the Convention in respect of the state concerned.</P>
    <P>In the mid-term, both sides expressed interest in depending political dialogue <Col N="1744" /> between the European Union and our ACP partners.  The revised Convention now envisages an expansion of political dialogue within the framework of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers as well as at regional level.  It also provides for the future accession of South Africa to the Convention without further ratification by the signatories to the Convention.</P>
    <P>Despite free access for industrial exports and most agricultural products, the level of ACP exports to the EU has remained at a low level.  The ACP share of the EU market declined from 6.7 per cent in 1976 to 3.4 per cent in 1993 while, at the same time, non-ACP countries receiving less preferential treatment performed more successfully.  That is something which must be of concern to everybody, particularly in relation to sub-Sarahan Africa.</P>
    <P>In the negotiation of the revised convention, the focus of discussion lay for the first time, less on preferential access to EU markets than on developing a sectoral, integrated approach.  In this, the seeds for new co-operation arrangements to take account of enhanced globalisation and liberalisation in the international economy have been firmly laid.</P>
    <P>In respect of access for ACP products to the Community market, the final agreement arrived at included expansion of the preferential system to cover virtually all products originating in ACP countries.  In addition, rules governing origin of goods were relaxed to promote intra-regional trade between the ACP states and their non-ACP neighbours.</P>
    <P>The revised convention provides for increased industrial and cultural co-operation as well as explicitly including provisions to favour decentralised co-operation, including through greater financial support.  Some changes were also made in the operation of the Stabex system, including that transfers may be used to support reforms in line with agreed structural adjustment efforts.</P>
    <P>The European Development Fund &mdash; EDF &mdash; is the main financing instrument of the Lomé Convention and funds a range of economic and social <Col N="1745" /> projects in ACP countries.  European Development Funds are made up of <i>ad hoc</i> contributions by the EU member states and are not included in the Union budget.</P>
    <P>The 8th EDF &mdash; which will not come into force until the revised convention has been ratified &mdash; was perhaps the most difficult area of negotiations in the mid-term review.  At the European Council meeting in Cannes in June 1995, an offer of ECU 13.3 billion was made to ACP countries and this was subsequently accepted.  This represents an increase of 22 per cent in ECU terms <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 7th EDF applying in the first five years of Lomé IV.</P>
    <P>Ireland's share of the 8th EDF will be 80 million ECU or approximately £64 million.  This compares to 60 million ECU or approximately £50 million for the 7th EDF.</P>
    <P>Payments by member states to the EDF are made four times each year.  In 1995, Ireland's payment amounted to £7.3 million as against an estimate of £7.8 million.  For technical reasons, the implementation cycle of an EDF lasts longer than the five-year period of the relevant convention, and annual payments to the fund can vary somewhat from year to year.</P>
    <P>On 20 December 1995, the Government signed an internal EU agreement on the financing and administration of Community aid under the 8th EDF. This agreement lays down procedures for the programming and approval of aid and rules governing the disbursement of funds.</P>
    <P>Ireland has enjoyed a reasonable track record in receiving contracts awarded under previous EDFs. However, I would like to see this figure increase during the 8th EDF and will actively pursue how best this can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I recognise there is some disappointment among ACP countries that the total for the 8th EDF was not fixed at a higher level.  Nonetheless, the compromise figure agreed is a reasonable one and will enable project assistance to <Col N="1746" /> continue at a level equal to that of recent years.</P>
    <P>EU objectives and priorities for financial disbursements are explicitly stated in the Declaration annexed to the revised convention.  These objectives include sustainable economic and social development, poverty alleviation and respect for human rights and fundamental liberties.</P>
    <P>In relation to the European Investment Bank, the revised convention provides that the EIB will give each ACP country an overall indication of the specific resources and venture capital it can expect to receive during the five-year period covered by the second financial Protocol.</P>
    <P>In recent years, Ireland's Development Co-operation budget has increased dramatically.  This year it amounts to £106 million or .29 per cent of GNP, the highest ever total.  Inevitably, this increase has focused mainly on expansion of our bilateral aid budget and on targeting countries such as Zaire and Tanzania.  This is as it should be.  I have no doubt this trend is warmly supported by the overwhelming majority of this House.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless our aid policy must also focus on the multilateral aspects of development policy.  Our role in the Lomé Convention is an important dimension of that policy just as our contribution to the EDF is a significant portion of our Development Co-operation budget.</P>
    <P>Around the world today, the concept and practice of development co-operation is under appraisal and re-definition as never before.  I do not need to tell Members that many countries suffer from declining aid budgets, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;donor fatigue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, the members of the Development Assistance Committee &mdash; DAC &mdash; of the OECD &mdash; including Ireland &mdash; issued a statement of rededication and commitment to the goals of Development Co-operation over the coming years.  I propose to place a copy of this statement in the library of the House for the information of Members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> Nonetheless, it is fair to say there is today greater apprehension among developing countries regarding the future of development co-operation than perhaps every before, particularly when one talks not just about development issues but about the equally important ones of trade and debt.</P>
    <P>Economic developments in recent years have led to increased disparities between countries able to take advantage of changes in the global economy and those finding themselves facing increased marginalisation.  The internationalisation of technology and investment has already profoundly affected least developed countries.  The competition for markets is today harder than ever before.  Many developing countries &mdash; especially in Africa &mdash; experience continuing negative growth because of reliance on a small primary commodity base, poor infrastructure, high indebtedness, or weak technological capacities.</P>
    <P>It seems to me axiomatic that, for most developing counties, trade is increasingly the key issue that will determine whether they can achieve the economic growth needed to combat poverty. Development co-operation assistance will continue to be essential for such countries but it provides no substitute for economic self-capacity and growth.</P>
    <P>Establishing conditions for economic growth is not only a matter of developing an adequate domestic production structure.  It also requires establishing good governmental and administrative structures which facilitate industrial and commercial development.</P>
    <P>Growth in world trade is likely to be robust over the coming decade as a result of the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation. It is now incumbent on the developed world to ensure that least developed countries do not become the losers in this process.  Inevitably, some developing countries will suffer an erosion of tariff preferences in their export markets.  Agricultural liberalisation in the industrialised countries may also lead to a rise in world food prices which <Col N="1748" /> will have a net adverse effect on the trade patterns of least developed countries. It is necessary that the international community does all in its power to ensure that developing countries are given full opportunity to take advantage of the opportunities presented by global economic liberalisation.</P>
    <P>In the coming years, the decisive debate of our time will relate to development co-operation and on how, to paraphrase D'Israeli's phrase about two nations we can move to bridge the increasing gulf between two worlds that share one world.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland can and must play our part in this debate, not least by making steady progress in our Development Co-operation budget to the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  This is important but it is not enough.  We must also become increasingly active participants in the international debate on development co-operation in all its aspects: how to increase economic and social development for poor countries and population groups; how to establish conditions for greater participation by least developed countries in the global economy; how to safeguard the international environment; how to promote peace, reconciliation and respect for human rights as essential goals in their own right but also as preconditions for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Development co-operation policy today must relate not only to financial transfers but increasingly to a range of political, economic and social issues.  I am determined that Ireland will play its full part in the debate now taking place on how to bridge the growing barriers between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Lomé Convention is a framework of co-operation that has served its purpose well.  The agreement revising the Convention I am recommending to the House today will make its provisions even more flexible and responsive to the needs of the ACP countries in the remaining five-year life span.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, debate will now take place on the shape of future EU-ACP <Col N="1749" /> relations when the current convention lapses in the year 2000.  The European Commission will table a Green Paper on this issue later this year.  I hope this debate can be opened at the Development Council to be held next November during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>This debate will be of critical importance for the future of EU Development Co-operation policy.  Inevitably, there will be substantive changes in any successor Lomé framework that must take account, for example, of the impact of WTO rules on preferential imports from ACP countries to the EU.  It is already clear that the declining EU market share held by the ACP states requires an assessment of non-tariff barriers to trade.</P>
    <P>The debate on the future of Lomé must be conducted in a spirit of partnership and openness.  That it how the Irish Presidency will approach this important subject in the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>In the debate on Post-Lomé arrangements, Ireland will emphasise our view that the position of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa must be protected. We will be open as to precise options but we will not be flexible on this fundamental policy position.  We in Europe cannot continue to see Africa become poorer and more marginalised.</P>
    <P>The revised Lomé Convention strengthens EU-ACP relations and improves the effectiveness of our co-operation and partnership.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1995 Ministers from each of the member states of the European Union gathered in Mauritius, with representatives from an additional 70 countries for the purposes of formally renewing the trade and aid pact which has linked Europe and some European countries with its former colonies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Backtracking a number of decades, Lomé I was concluded in February 1975 and at that time 46 African.  Caribbean and Pacific states and the then nine member states of the European Community came together in the capital of <Col N="1750" /> Togo to sign the Lomé document which was the result of many months of negotiations. Since its inception just over 20 years ago, many factors on the political and economic horizon have evolved. The Lomé Convention has not, of course, been immune from the rapid changes the world has witnessed.  Lomé has been influenced by changing balances of power, and by evolving political and economic thinking.  The Uruguay Round negotiations, the changing face of the former Eastern Bloc, world economic recessions and the implications of trade trends on developing countries have all made their imprint on the various Lomé Conventions that have been renewed and revised since its inauguration in 1975.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the revised Lomé IV Convention was signed at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in Mauritius on 4 November 1995.  Foreign and development Ministers from the 15 EU states and 69 of the 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific (APC) countries were present at the signing.  The absentee was Somalia, a country which has not yet ratified Lomé IV.  South Africa, a country which may soom be a member of the convention, was an observer at that meeting.</P>
    <P>Revising the Lomé IV Convention took over 15 months, with negotiations overshadowed by a bitter squabble between EU countries over the size of their contributions to the aid budget. Britain, in fact, wanted to slash its aid budget by upwards of 30 per cent.  The meeting in Mauritius certainly provided the opportunity for delegations to begin dialogue on a matter of concern to all signatories, that is the future of the Lomé Convention itself.</P>
    <P>What does Lomé IV mean?  As the Minister of State said it is a convention that among other factors, includes provision for trade co-operation, stabilisation of export earnings from commodities, industrial co-operation and financial and technical assistance.  Lomé IV has a life span of ten years from 1 March 1990 to the year 2000.  On 1 March 1995 a financial Protocol which <Col N="1751" /> allows for the EU funding of the European Development Fund (EDF) to give effect to the Lomé Convention was due for renewal.  The share taken by Ireland of the eight EDF which was incorporated in a new financial Protocol means that Ireland will fund the EDF to a level of 80 million ECU, approximately £64 million, for the five year period 1995-2000. This represents approximately a 0.6 per cent of total funding.  While Ireland increased her aid by almost one quarter, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands refused any real increase.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by the Minister of State our funding of the EDF entitles Ireland to compete for contracts which derives from the disbursement of the EDF aid.  The value of contracts awarded to Ireland is more than the rate of contribution to the EDF.  Apart from the financial Protocol, a Protocol to the reviewed Lomé Convention was signed in Mauritius, which provide for the accession to the convention of the three new EU member states, namely Austria, Finland and Sweden.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that at the Mauritius meeting the ACP countries accepted a critical clause which enables the EU to suspend aid when Article 5 of the convention covering respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law is breached.  I place particular significance on that.</P>
    <P>In a brief speech to the Mauritius gathering, the EU Council President while recognising the debates on the future of Lomé that lie ahead stressed the symbolic value of ACP-EU co-operation. It is, he stated &ldquo;a unique model in the world of international co-operation&rdquo; and &ldquo;proof of commitment&rdquo; on the part of Europe to live in harmony in the world.  Acknowledging the sentiments expressed by Mr. Solana, it is important that Ireland contributes constructively and effectively to debates which will ensue on both the future and on the further direction of the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>As I noted earlier the revised Lomé Convention sees its term end in March <Col N="1752" /> 2000.  The EU Commission has already indicated that it aims to publish a Green Paper towards the end of the current year on possible options for the future of ACP-EU relations.  Fianna Fáil believes it is critical that there is a comprehensive debate on the direction of the Lomé Convention.  It cannot be ignored that while 69 of the 70 signatories of the Lomé Convention signed the Mauritius agreement at the end of last year, it undoubtedly was signed amid fears that it certainly might not last beyond the year 2000, when the convention expires.  Certainly as the EU turns its eyes in the direction of Eastern Europe the relationship between the ACP-EU countries will come under strain.  Yet we believe that, recognising global political changes and altered regional policies, the Lomé Convention must be judged positively.</P>
    <P>The benefits of Lomé must be judged positively but have they been properly articulated?  Certainly to date they have not.  To rectify this at the 20th session of the ACP-EU Assembly in January 1995 a joint declaration known as the Dakar Plan of Action was proposed and adopted.  The plan of actions stressed the need to &ldquo;highlight the achievements of the Convention&rdquo; and to &ldquo;identify the main bottlenecks to successful co-operation&rdquo;. The plan proposes that the best way to answer critics is for the bottlenecks to be addressed.</P>
    <P>As some of the EU member states appear to be looking away from Lomé members' interest, what do the ACP countries think?  Without a doubt the level of development assistance on offer under the Lomé Convention has been less than they had hoped for during the years.  Yet despite this, each new agreement witnessed an increase in real terms in the financial resources that have been made available, the recent financial Protocol being the exception.  This time funding has not gone up in real terms although the nominal amount has risen by 22 per cent in line with inflation. From the point of view of the ACP countries, the Lomé Convention has <Col N="1753" /> provided a partnership of stability and reliability during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a role and must continue to maintain it in striving to ensure that this partnership of stability and reliability does not expire.  As I stated in our policy document on Foreign Affairs published last November &ldquo;Our Place in the World&rdquo;, Ireland has long enjoyed a particular affinity and credibility with the countries of the developing world. Our standing owes much to our non-colonial past, our famine history and the contribution of thousands of Irish people, both missionaries and lay development workers, who have worked on development projects and humanitarian relief operations in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>While recognising the level of funding Ireland contributes to the EDF, we believe that it can and should play a greater role as a voice for the Third World in the chambers and corridors of power in Europe and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We assume the EU Presidency in a number of weeks.  The Government must ensure that it fully utilises every opportunity to promote the legitimate needs of developing nations.  The EU cannot abandon the ACP countries.  We should not stand for such dereliction of duty.  Among other factors, Ireland must support the call for a world conference on Third World debt during which the World Bank, the IMF and the regional development banks would focus on the issue of Third World indebtedness.</P>
    <P>In approving the motion before the House today, I call on the Government to place the issue of ACP nations and the developing world high on the EU Presidency agenda.  The ACP-EU relationship cannot and should not be let die due to a lack of a comprehensive debate.  The debate should begin in earnest in Dublin in the summer of 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support this motion to approve of the amendments made in Mauritius, the Protocol signed there and the subsequent <Col N="1754" /> internal agreement made in Brussels on 20 December last.  The changes made are not enormous and nobody could object to them.</P>
      <P>Two points arise from what the Minister of State said.  She said that the ACP share of the EU market declined from 6.7 per cent in 1976 to 3.4 per cent in 1993 whild at the same time non-ACP countries receiving less preferential treatment performed more successfully. That sums up a good deal of what is wrong with the EU's efforts to help some of the weaker countries.  It is frightening that the developing countries' share of the EU market should have been halved in percentage terms in 17 years.  I accept that the EU market expanded a great deal during that time and, undoubtedly, in cash terms the developing countries' share of its increased, but it is a distressing that their share of it halved in percentage terms.</P>
      <P>A realisation of why that is happening was indicated by the Minister of State when she said that many developing countries, especially in Africa, experience continuing negative growth because of reliance on a small primary commodity base, poor infrastructure, high indebtedness or weak technological capacity.  The Minister implied that they suffer possibly from one or other impediment, but many of them suffer from all four.  That is why their share of an enlarging and increasingly competitive European market is continually declining and it is becoming more difficult for them to get a share or maintain their existing share of that market.  It is distressing this should be the case not merely in a small number but in so many African countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of all the problems in Eastern Europe, its unhappy political history and its long affliction with communism, the standard of living even in what we consider the most backward countries bears no comparison with the standard of living in Africa.  Those Eastern European countries are light years ahead of the subsistence or sub-subsistence existence that operates in so many parts of <Col N="1755" /> Africa.  Offhand I can think of only three Asian countries, North Korea, Laos and Burma, with a very low standard of living and that has occurred because of political reasons.  Apart from those countries Asia appears to be able to look after itself very much better than Africa and I am not sure whether that can be attributed to climatic or other reasons.  Africa should be the focus of our attention and concern. While South and Central America are experiencing some problems, they are many steps ahead of Africa in standard of living terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that it seems axiomatic that for most developing countries trade is increasingly the key issue that will determine whether they can achieve the necessary economic growth to combat poverty.  I am not sure what she intended the words &ldquo;trade&rdquo; to cover, but I presume she meant trade in industrial and agricultural goods.  I would have thought that the best development opportunities open to many of those countries in the short-term is not through trade because many of them do not have anything and more of them have only commodities to trade.  In that regard they are in an impossible position as world commodity prices are extremely low.  I would have thought that in the short-term tourism offers many of them an opportunity to develop, but the great majority of them lack the necessary infrastructure.  The main difference between Kenya and Tanzania, two adjoining countries in equatorial Africa, is that Kenya has a relatively vibrant tourist trade and Tanzania has none and that makes a major difference to the two countries.  If Tanzania's initial tourism development could be intensively encouraged over two or three years, it could make a substantial difference to countries like it.</P>
    <P>Given that standards of health and education are very low in many African countries, nearly all of them suffer from the major drawback of a rapidly increasing population.  Unlike the provision of some other infrastructures, the cost of <Col N="1756" /> providing health or education infrastructure bears a ratio to population size.  If the population can be maintained at a reasonably steady level or increases at only a moderate rate, some control can be exercised over necessary health and education costs.  The doubling of population every 12 to 15 years in some countries is making it difficult for them to maintain existing levels of education and health care.</P>
    <P>A debate is needed on ensuring that an effective from of assistance is given to developing countries in the future. The absence of tariffs is not enough. That will be found to be increasingly the case irrespective of the influence of the Uruguay Round.  Something much more proactive than merely the almost total absence of tariffs must be devised and that matter must be addressed carefully.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see from the history of earlier Lomé conventions that virtually all loans have been converted into donations.  This is only correct and I presume it will happen under the Fourth Convention &mdash; I hope it happened under the first half of the convention; I regard this as Lomé four, mark two.  It was wrong that the Fourth Lomé Convention was signed for a ten year period. If it had been for a five year period like the earlier conventions it might have been better.  Things are changing rapidly and it is frightening to think that in the currency of the Fourth Lomé Convention many recipient states are becoming poorer in absolute terms and much poorer relative to other donor states or more developed countries.  This is a very serious matter.  If during the Irish Presidency a debate can be initiated on the reality of the problems facing these countries and the anxieties of the developed world to aid them, then we will have to ensure that other ways of helping them are devised and the traditional ways are recognised as inadequate and as no longer working.  This is a challenge which faces all of us.</P>
    <P>In talking about EU-ACP relations and the aid given since 1975 under successive Lomé conventions we have to <Col N="1757" /> realise this is a relatively small proportion of overall aid and assistance of different kinds, particularly loans and investments.  Unfortunately some institutions have not been as generous as the EU in writing off their former assistance, particularly loans.  Admittedly, the European Union figures are much smaller than those of many other institutions but it is appalling to look at those African countries where the servicing of debt annually is far and away the biggest annual outgoing.  In many of those countries the servicing of debt, not to mention the repayment of it, is much greater than the combined spending on health and education.  This is happening in countries where the life expectancy is as low as 40 or 45 years, the rate of illiteracy is often as high as 70-80 per cent and the needs are enormous. Yet huge proportions of the very limited hard currency earnings made by these countries are devoted to the repayment of interest on debt and in some cases to repay some small parts of the debt.  It is increasingly impossible for many of those countries to meet these repayments and this should be recognised by all concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to think the fifth Lomé convention will be more fundamental than the previous conventions, will take account of experience arising from them and will be greater in magnitude and effect.  It should be got across to the authorities of as many of these countries as possible that it is desirable for some control to be maintained over the extraordinary rate of increase in population in many of these countries which is compounding an already difficult problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion relates to the workings of my committee which fully supports the effort of the Minister in bringing the Agreement before the House for ratification.  On the Order of Business, what needs to be done was referred to, but the reality is that if we do not pass this motion all the work on the Protocol signed on our behalf last November, will be set at nought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention deals specifically with <Col N="1758" /> farming problems in the countries listed. It also includes provision for trade co-operation, the stabilisation of export earnings from commodities, industrial co-operation and financial and technical assistance.  It is pleasing to note that under the convention, which is intended to run to the end of the year 2000, Ireland's contribution will be increased from 60 million ECU under the seventh European development fund to be more than 80 million ECU.  This compares favourably with the contribution by some of the wealthier members of the EU.  I commend the Minister, Government and Tánaiste for their continuing efforts to ensure that our share of overseas development aid will continue to be increased within the scarce resources available to us, while all the time trying to meet the UN requirement of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  This matter has been discussed at length by the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I am sure its chairman, Deputy Pat Gallagher, shares the Minister's view that while making a contribution of £107 million we must also use our influence to ensure that the problem of the crippling debts of poor nations is addressed.</P>
    <P>Under the convention members will be able to transform into donations some of the special loans granted under previous conventions.  I was interested to note that under the last convention 15 million ECU were transferred into special loans, 150 million ECU were not allocated under previous European development funds and 142 million ECU were not utilised under the seventh fund.  We want to do everything possible to assist these countries &mdash; Ireland has led the way in this respect &mdash; and I would like to know why these funds cannot be drawn down and used for some of the purposes outlined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The convention provides that aid can be suspended in cases of violations of Article 5 of the Convention on Human Rights, democracy and the rule of law. We must ensure that aid is allocated to the right places and people, that it is <Col N="1759" /> used as efficiently as possible and that recipient countries comply with international law.  I am pleased a recommendation has been made that South Africa be added to the list of signatories to the convention.  I anticipate the House's approval for the convention, which confirms Ireland's commitment to overseas development aid, and I welcome that move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the revision of the Fourth Lomé Convention. The Minister referred to the new, difficult and complex challenges we face and it is important we move, as best we can, to provide for the measures in the convention.  The conflicts and famines in Africa and the war in the former Yugoslavia showed us the harsh realities of the problems facing the people in these countries, but there have also been political breakthroughs in Mozambique and South Africa.</P>
      <P>I hope the convention will address the issue of human rights.  The Minister referred to the observance of human rights and the rule of law and observed that these are mandatory requirements. If any human rights principles are violated, the convention could be partly or totally suspended in respect of the states concerned.</P>
      <P>My first worry relates to the ACP share of the EU market which declined from 6.7 per cent in 1976 to 3.4 per cent in 1993.  This issue was highlighted recently when representatives of the fair trade association referred to the problems it encounters securing markets and those experienced by people involved in the fair trade of bananas.  I am sure the Minister wants progress in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the sad fact that the poorest countries are repaying more money than they are receiving in development assistance.  I support the Deputy's call for a world conference on Third World debt to secure a once off write off of the debts of the countries most seriously affected.  At the same time some EU countries are supplying armaments to poor countries and this <Col N="1760" /> enables conflict which often arises in these countries to continue.  I am glad the Government is taking the issue of landmines seriously.  Much progress has been made on that matter, but a large number of EU countries and other continue to supply arms.  Ireland must use its influence &mdash; it has done so in the past and can do so in the future &mdash; to ensure an end is put to this once and for all.</P>
    <P>The revised convention provides that the European Investment Bank will give each ACP country an overall indication of the specific resources and venture capital it can expect to receive during the five-year period covered by the second financial Protocol.  This is most welcome.  It is a good idea to indicate the specific resources available.</P>
    <P>Regarding Ireland's policy, to which I referred at a committee meeting recently, I welcome the increase to £106 million, or 0.29 per cent of GNP.  Some NGOs have expressed concern about the growth path of the increase.  The Irish aid strategy plan envisaged a growth path of 0.05 per cent and if that was met, the figure would be 0.35 per cent of GNP in 1996.  Perhaps the Minister of State will refer to this aspect in her reply.</P>
    <P>The economy has done well and perhaps this is why we have neglected to meet our aid plan target.  This happens when economies are sucessful, but it was intended that the aid growth targets would accommodate changing national circumstances.  This has not taken place and this is the only criticism I have regarding the percentage of GNP.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline when the Government hopes to reach the 0.7 per cent level if the growth path is not as good as anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their supportive comments in relation to the Irish aid programme. In the context of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union, I recall a remark made by Mr. Jacques Delors in his last year as president of the Union.  He said that if Europe did <Col N="1761" /> not have a soul, it was about nothing. In many ways the test of whether the European Union has more to it than trade agreements and the liberalisation of trading capital, if it has a soul and is about people, is its relationship with the poorest countries in the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Burke said, the Lomé Convention arose from the traditional relationships between some European countries, particularly France and Britain, and their former colonies. Although they have been unsatisfactory in certain respects, the Lomé agreements have served as a benchmark of stability and co-operation.  They set down a marker in relation to Europe's continuing concern for less developed countries in the world.</P>
      <P>We face a changed world involving extraordinary liberalisation of trade and this will give rise to enormous problems for the poorest countries.  Deputy Ferris and Deputy O'Malley referred to the difficulties and Deputy Kitt mentioned the decline in the share of trade which ACP countries enjoy in terms of their participation in the European market.  This has reduced by almost a half over the period and people talk about parts of Africa experiencing an accelerated decline.  If we are to stop that, we must examine carefully the recent history of Africa.  A number of crises have engulfed countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Rwanda and Burundi.  Unfortunately, in all these crises we can identify large elements which could have been prevented if early action had been taken in relation to human rights and the protection and growth of democracy or alleviating food shortages and droughts when they occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we move towards a new Lomé agreement and a Green Paper, the Irish position should focus on the poorest countries covered by the agreement, those in Sub-Saharan Africa.  We should make this central point during the review process.  We need to look at the content of the Lomé agreement and, rather than paint with a broad brush, concentrate on the impact a future <Col N="1762" /> agreement may have on different regions of the world under specific headings.  When they held the Presidency of the European Union the Spanish, understandably, paid special attention to South America, the Germans focused on Eastern Europe while the French and the Spanish, focused on the relationship with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin and the Maghreb. It is appropriate, in terms of international policy that Ireland, because of its connections through its missionaries, NGOs and aid programme, should focus on Africa.  I am afraid that in the new round of world trade agreements it may be left out and the depressing statistic I read out of a reduction in its share of the European Union market may become worse.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the potential of the tourism industry to generate significant revenues.  In theory, it has potential but many countries in Africa lack the capacity to generate large scale revenues from it because of poor infrastructure and because many diseases, such as malaria, which are treatable, are rampant.  The result is that many tourists are increasingly fearful of travelling on holiday of relatively short duration to areas where there is a significant risk of catching a serious disease. We must address these realities.</P>
    <P>Above all, we must address in a comprehensive way the related issues of trade and debt.  As Deputy Bruke said, in the debates which took place at the Development Council in settling the eighth round of the EDF many countries, particularly Germany and Great Britain, expressed difficulty with increasing aid envelopes to developing countries under the EU budget.  They expressed a preference for bilateral aid which they considered more efficient and better targeted.  That is a point we also need to consider.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris asked what happened to the underspent in earlier rounds of the EDF.  Some are continuing and taking longer than originally planned.  In our case we have secured the permission of the Minister for Finance to reallocate <Col N="1763" /> any funds which remain unspent to the NGO co-financing element or other elements of the aid budget.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate which marks the ending of the review process on the Fourth Lomé agreement.  It also marks the opening of the debate on the next agreement which in many ways will determine the relationship between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa in particular over the next century.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Law Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is two-pronged. It will simplify the procedures in regard to search warrants and arrests and repeal some of the outdated laws on the Statute Book.  At a time when drug importers, dealers, pushers and couriers are operating with impunity I welcome the Minister's decision to simplify these procedures.  I hope, however that the increased powers being given to the Garda Síochána will be used responsibly. It is important that regular reviews are carried out to ensure that these measures will not necessarily militate against the civil liberties of individuals.</P>
      <P>Despite the recent drop in the crime figures nationwide crime continues to increase in inner city areas of Dublin at a phenomenal and frightening rate and there is increasing evidence that communities outside Dublin are being targeted by criminals based in the capital. This is an indication that the problem is not being defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of increasing public concern about crime levels there is a clear need to strike a balance between the rights of the individual and society as a whole.  As everybody is aware, Dublin is facing a drugs crisis unprecedented since the mid-1980s.  My constituency of <Col N="1764" /> Dublin South Central has been particularly hard hit by this scourge as have large areas of the north inner city.</P>
    <P>Last week in the south inner city I attended the funeral masses of two victims of the drugs plague, one was an addict and a former drug dealer who was hunted down and murdered by a mob and the other was a young man who had succumbed to a drugs overdose, a common occurence in the south inner city.  They were the latest in the roll call of people killed by drugs while the political establishment watched and went about its daily business.</P>
    <P>Last week I also attended the interde-nominational religious service of remembrance at St. Patrick's Cathedral, which was attended by President Robinson, at which the names of hundreds of AIDS victims were called.  The deaths of Josie Dwyer and Patrick Collins who was, as we are all aware, the son of a former Labour Lord Mayor of Dublin, have helped to place the drugs crisis where it belongs, at the top of the political agenda.  I intend to see that it stays there.</P>
    <P>The stark reality of life in urban areas, the south inner city of Dublin in particular, is that not alone are people dying of AIDS, but that there is an alarming increase in the number of drug addicts who have tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of heroin. One need only inquire of the medical staff at the accident and emergency department of the largest general hospital in the area, St. Jame's, to discover the number and the extent of the demand placed on expensive and costly services provided through the hospital network to try to keep them alive.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Government on introducing welcome new measures to deal with drug dealers which will be augmented by the measures dealing with the powers of search and arrest in this Bill. As regards some of the nonsense spoken by Opposition Deputies, particularly those in Fianna Fáil, I remind them that they presided over the growing drugs crisis in the 1980s and did <Col N="1765" /> little.  We must now confront a more virulent problem than that which existed in the mid-1980s because previous Governments sat back and did nothing.  I remind Opposition Deputies who attack this Government that it is serious about tackling crime, criminals and the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Bill, 1996, is the latest in a determined effort to ensure gardaí are not hamstrung by outdated procedures in the battle against lawlessness. Procedural reform will achieve little unless it is accompanied by policing reforms.  The drugs crisis and the resulting crime levels will not be solved by gardaí sitting in Garda stations, held up in squad cars or pursuing mad cows on the Border.  Everybody agrees, particularly those most affected by the epidemic in inner city Dublin, gardaí should be back on the streets and into flat complexes and housing estates whose residents are under seige from the drug barons, the peddlers and the pushers.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left will not tolerate people taking the law into their own hands and acting as judge, jury and executioner, as happened this week.  It will not tolerate a situation where drug importers, dealers and pushers rule unhindered over local communities.  If anybody wants to see the effect on a community, they should visit parts of my constituency where the social fabric has disintegrated.  We see scenes reminiscent of those we used to see on television programmes like &ldquo;Hill Street Bluses&rdquo;.  Raids are made by teams of gardaí on shooting galleries where people publicly inject and deal drugs and extract concealed drugs from their internal parts.  Nobody has fully come to terms with what is happening, particularly in the south inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for Justice for responding to our political demands in relation to a notorious part of the south inner city.  I will not name this area because the more one does so, the more a bad name sticks.  Nobody wants to stick a bad name on a community with thousands of respectable, hardworking <Col N="1766" /> and law abiding citizens.  It is a pleasure to see huge numbers of fully equipped uniformed and plain clothes gardaí in this part of the south inner which I represent to ensure the peddlers in death, the dealers, pushers and addicts, are taken off the streets.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental approach to the problem is urgently needed which would examine and implement options such as community policing squads, expanded community drugs teams, fast track treatment facilities and accessible drugs education programmes.  However, it should not stop there.  We urgently need extra resources for the forensic science laboratory to ensure that evidence collected in respect of drug charges can be processed without delay.  Suspects should not be released for up to six months pending examination of the evidence.</P>
    <P>There is nothing as frustrating and alienating for those living in crime and drug infested communities, particularly after hard work and co-operation between tenant organisations and the Garda Síochána, to see people caught in possession of illicit drugs released the next day.  The reason is that the illicit drug must be proven to be such.  The forensic science laboratories are overworked and insufficiently manned.  It takes as long as six months before the material found in dealers in death is analysed.  The Garda cannot bring these people to court with a charge which will stick until the analysis is complete.</P>
    <P>We must establish devolved policing structures which focus policing resources on the most vulnerable areas. Unfortunately, a centralised policing system is in operation, which need not be the case.  There are examples in continental Europe and in Britain where power has been developed to local structures. I appeal to the Minister to look at models which exist elsewhere with a view to devolving the policing structures downwards.</P>
    <P>We should examine, on a pilot basis, the possibility of establishing community policing councils in vulnerable flat complexes and estates to facilitate <Col N="1767" /> increased co-operation between local residents and the police.  There is a need in large public housing complexes, like St. Theresa's Gardens, Dolphin House and Fatima Mansions in my constituency, for a community policing council which would work with the community. At present the community feels so threatened that it is obliged to have its own street patrols in the complexes.</P>
    <P>If we do not devolve some of the policing structures we will continue to have a dangerous vacuum between the public and the police which will be filled, as it has been, by dangerous people living in our community who have an agenda which is not that which they present to the people.  They present themselves as protectors of the community, but they have another agenda.  Unless such measures are put in place without delay and unless the drugs crisis remains at the top of the political agenda, I fear we may see more people taking the law into their own hands.  If that happens, we will be substituting one brand of lawlessness for another.  Modern problems cannot be addressed with antiquated remedies.</P>
    <P>When the Criminal Law Bill, 1996, was published, it was pointed out that it abolished the outdated distinction between a felony and a misdemeanour, a change which is welcome and long overdue.  Sadly, our system of justice is still dominated by United Kingdom legislation enacted during the 18th and 19th centuries.  Introducing a new concept of &ldquo;diminished responsibility&rdquo; in respect of the criminally insane could require amendments to as many as five Acts published between 1800 and 1883. It is absurd that we had to wait until 1966 and the publication of this Bill to finally repeal the Sunday Observance Act, 1695, the Riot Act, 1787, and the South Australia Act, 1842.  Despite the repeals made by the Criminal Law Bill, some outdated legislation such as the Vagrancy Act, 1824, remain largely unaltered on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>We live in a world which is changing <Col N="1768" /> at a rate unimagined by our grandparents, a world where criminals communicate by mobile phone and use the latest computerised stock-taking programmes to log their deals.  It is a world which cannot be regulated with laws designed for the age of the horse and the buggy.</P>
    <P>Together with the UK we are the only European Union jurisdiction which operates according to a common law which has grown over the centuries.  Our legislation is a hotchpotch of old and new statutes.  Outdated legislation is only repealed or amended when new, relevant legislation is enacted.  I would argue strongly that rather than wait for relevant legislation such as the Criminal Law Bill, 1996, there should be a thorough review of all pre-1992 legislation with a view to repealing or appropriately amending those Acts which no longer serve a useful purpose.  There needs to be a thorough legislative spring cleaning with a view to ensuring that the legislation on the Statute Book reflects the needs of the 20th century rather than the 19th century.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Bill formally abolishes penal servitude, hard labour and divisions in prisons.  It also abolishes corporal punishment in a court or prison context.  In practice, hard labour and corporal punishment for offenders was abolished long ago.  I am delighted the Dickensian concept of penal servitude is finally being abolished, but I wish it was as easy to abolish the Dickensian conditions which, sadly, still exist in some of our prisons.  The recent leaked report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee is extremely disturbing, particularly as the committee has identified the same shortcomings year in and year out for the past decade.  When we impose a custodial sentence we are expressing society's abhorrence of certain actions by depriving the offender or his or her liberty.  Very often individuals are sentenced to serve their terms in overcrowded, antiquated facilities established at a time when penal servitude and hard labour were the order of the day and when prisoners could <Col N="1769" /> expect to be whipped for the most minor infringement.</P>
    <P>Some things have undoubtedly changed for the better.  In 1996, however, an offender sent to Mountjoy may be still denied access to the most basic medical, psychiatric, educational and rehabilitative services.  It appears the only thing to which prisoners in Mountjoy have ample access is drugs.  It is little wonder prisoners often leave Mountjoy as drug addicts, ready once again to prey on society in search of a quick deal.</P>

      <P>Everyone wants to see an end to crime which affects our cities in particular but has spread throughout the country.  We welcome this legislation even though there are faults in it.  Our spokesperson outlined some of the difficulties, particularly relating to sections 4 and 6, but they can be teased out and the Bill substantially improved on Committee Stage.  That is one of the values of the committee system.</P>
      <P>As various speakers have said, the Bill provides for a number of useful improvements such as abolishing the distinction between felony and misdemeanour &mdash; that has been sought for a number of years &mdash; clarifying and tidying up a number of issues and tackling the issue of arrest without warrant. Anyone who deals regularly with the Garda will be aware that it is particularly important that the Garda has the necessary powers to deal with crime as it occurs at the coalface.  It must have the support and backing it needs.  Sometimes a garda on the beat may see a person for whom there is a warrant in the station, but by the time he returns to the station for the warrant he has little chance of apprehending the person in question.  This Bill enables the gardaí to apprehend such people and present the warrant at the station subsequently.  The Bill provides for entry and search of premises to effect and arrest and for arrest without a warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister stated that the reforms set out in the criminal justice plan announced on 30 January <Col N="1770" /> last form part of the law and order response to today's crime.  She said there has been a good deal of comment in the media and elsewhere about the worrying development of gangland style murders or professional killings by so-called hit men.  She went on to state that the authorities are often depicted as powerless to respond to these sinister gangland murders and that they must be dealt with in accordance with the rule of law.  She said comments which characterise the authorities as powerless ignore the seriousness with which crime is regarded.  In those words the Minister highlighted one of the most serious problems facing us, the issue of gangland murders.  She admits there is a gangland culture, that there are warlords, people who organise crime, and that they must be dealt with.  That is one of our principal tasks, and this Bill contains measures to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of the year the Garda must have the finance and equipment to mount and sustain intensive surveillance and intelligence gathering by experienced detectives in specialised units.  If we are to tackle the organisers of crime, about whom Deputy Byrne spoke, we must match them with experienced and well supported Garda units that are in a position to take them on.  I also said at that time there is an urgent need to reform the law and give the Garda powers to deal with crime.  I said the Garda do not have the power to enter premises to search for evidence in cases involving murder, attempted murder, rape or malicious wounding and that without such search warrants their hands are tied behind their backs.</P>
    <P>The recovery of weapons in murder and wounding cases is vital to the success of an investigation.  Similarly, the recovery of clothing in rape, sexual assaults, murder and wounding cases is vital to the success of investigations. These issues should also be considered in the context of the Bill.  Section 6 provides for entry and search of premises but only to affect an arrest.  On Committee Stage I hope to explore further the <Col N="1771" /> provision of the powers needed by the gardaí to search premises to obtain the evidence they need in the cases to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The third point I made at the time concerned the need for co-operation and greater liaison between the various agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, financial institutions, specialised Garda units, the Department of Social Welfare and any other agencies or arms of the State who can contribute to tackling the drug barons and the warlords of crime.  I also talked about the urgent need to stop the laundering of stolen moneys and the need to reassess the bail laws in relation to habitual criminals.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the year the Minister said she wanted a programme to tackle crime.  We pointed out the issues that needed to be tackled but in her contribution the Minister highlighted the major problems still facing us.  I will make a suggestion in regard to one of those but, before doing so, I want to refer to comments in the media on the suggested decrease in crime.</P>
    <P>It was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that a figure for part of the year suggests that the national crime level has fallen by approximately 3 per cent since May of last year and that the decrease is continuing.  It was also reported that crime has moved from certain city centre areas to what is known as the Dublin rim area.  There is nothing new about that; the problems of crime and drug abuse have moved from the centre of the city and that is reflected on the ground.</P>
    <P>It is dangerous to become embroiled in these figures; it is more valuable to study what is happening.  Is life any better for ordinary people?  Is the fear of mugging, petty larceny and the fear experienced by elderly people decreasing? I do not believe that is the case. In fact, fears are increasing and that is possibly due to the recent spate of gangland-style murders by so-called hit men. There is also great fear of the major <Col N="1772" /> criminals who seem to be able to come and go as they please.</P>
    <P>In relation to the statistics released yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who is present, should remember Dublin West.  It is not so long since Deputies canvassed in that constituency and heard about the problems there. Many of us met people crying out for help from the State and the politicians to help them break the cycle of crime and drug abuse.  That is the reality, not only in Dublin West but in Dublin Central, on the north side of Dublin and in many other parts of our city.</P>
    <P>The reality is that crime exists and major criminals are free to do their work.  In regard to the north side of Dublin, I must protest at the recent move to take gardaí out of stations in that area because I know they are achieving success in controlling crime and the activities of criminals.  They have also helped to slow down the activities of drug pushers which is possible when gardaí are deployed in sufficient numbers and at the right times. That is also greatly appreciated by the community.</P>
    <P>Those gardaí are being transferred to Border duties as a result of the BSE problems and that is understandable.  A problem exists in that regard and it must be dealt with but where are all the Customs and Excise agents?  Where are the phytosanitary control officers of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  Phytosanitary control is the control of diseases which can spread across borders.  Those officers need backup but surely Customs and Excise officers and the Department's officers who deal with this area can provide that; the Army could be used for this purpose if necessary.</P>
    <P>Gardaí should not be taken away from critical areas.  Chief superintendents and superintendents are not in a position to protest about such transfers. How can they protest openly and say that they cannot approve such transfers because it will result in an increase in crime and people will be put at risk?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1773" /> I wish to protest also at the rise in vigilantism. Vigilantes are to be abhorred. People should not take the law into their own hands.  On many occasions we have had to explain to people in our constituencies that they have the right to be angry and to complain bitterly but that they must work in conjunction with the gardaí.  People should be encouraged to give information and support to the gardaí but nobody should be allowed to take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier I want to make a suggestion.  Through a committee of the House we have examined the whole issue of drug abuse and the need to control the problem.  The Government has set up a task force under the Garda Síochána which will carry out work in the background, but the Revenue Commissioners should have a major part to play on this task force.</P>
    <P>There are no more than 40 major drug barons and criminals.  They are all well known to the gardaí and their names have been listed in the newspapers. They have been portrayed as characters in our society but we must not forget that people are afraid of them.  The more we highlight the activities of these criminals and the professional killings referred to by the Minister, the more we are moving from the normal operation of law and order. That cannot be allowed.</P>
    <P>We must take on these criminals and to do that we need a special action force, not necessarily within the Garda Síochána.  A special action force under the control of the Attorney General might be more appropriate and would include representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise, the Department of Social Welfare and any other agency needed to tackle this problem.  The task force should be given the power to examine accounts, for example, and its representatives should be paid NTMA rates if necessary.  That agency is paid special rates for looking after our debt and it does an important job.  We need people to take on these drug barons. <Col N="1774" /> Whoever they are, they need our backing and support and to be well paid.  I do not know how they will be recruited. It may be done on a voluntary basis; some people may be prepared to do it voluntarily and they should be provided with all the background information.</P>
    <P>I am increasingly convinced the reason we are not tackling the accounts, the laundering of money and the obvious wealth of these people is fear. We cannot allow that to continue.  None of these gangland people or professional hitmen to whom the Minister referred should be allowed to operate in our society.  This is a small island with a relatively tiny population.  We can identify the people involved &mdash; the Garda know them all &mdash; but we need a means of putting them away and we need people who are prepared to do it.  It is a high risk business.</P>
    <P>It is likely these people could be put in jail by examining their accounts, but which accountant will do it?  Why has it not happened?  I am becoming increasingly convinced it is because of fear.  If that is the case, we need to set up a special action force under the Department of the Taoiseach and the Attorney General, give it all the powers and protection it needs and let it do its job.  The situation is serious and must be tackled in that way.</P>
    <P>I have attended a lot of committee meetings and listened to many Ministers over the years.  We have all talked about giving more powers to the Revenue, Customs etc., but nothing is happening. The reason is fear.  If there is a better solution, it should be put out on the table and we will find a way to deal with it.  Everyone in this House will support measures of that kind.  Nobody wants to see the law, the Oireachtas and the Government flouted by these wellknown people who hire hitmen to shoot whomever they want.  If that is not stopped now, there will be no end to it and they will continue killing.  That is why I am calling for action of this kind in support of the measures in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate of the Criminal Law Bill, 1996.  Because of my legal training, I am inclined to address the Bill as drafted, detail various faults I perceive to be in it and suggest improvements where appropriate.  I welcome the fact that this long awaited Bill has come before the House to allow us to participate in a constructive discussion.</P>
      <P>The principal stated purpose of the Bill is to abolish the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours.  Historically, felonies were the more serious offences and misdemeanours the less serious.  However, as Deputy O'Dea will agree, this distinction has become blurred with the passage of time and has given rise to a number of complex absurdities.</P>
      <P>The most commonly quoted example of such an absurdity is that the fraudulent conversion of £1 million is a misdemeanour by virtue of section 20 of the Larceny Act, 1916, as amended, while the simple larceny of a bar of chocolate is a felony by virtue of section 2 of the same Act.  When I was studying law, it gave me headaches trying to figure out these classifications.  It may be constructive to look briefly at the way in which crimes, particularly felonies, were classified historically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indictable offences were grouped into three classes &mdash; treasons, felonies and misdemeanours.  In misdemeanours, all persons who are concerned in any way are regarded as principals in the offence.  The punishment of persons who commit or are accessories to treason was provided for in the Treason Act, 1939.  There were four ways of committing a felony &mdash; principal in the first degree, principal in the second degree, accessory before the fact and accessory after the fact.  It was a complex area for a student to figure out.  The classification I used was that where a felony had been committed by anyone, who on reasonable grounds suspected any person of being the felon was permitted to arrest him or her forthwith. <Col N="1776" /> Common law never permitted a misdemeanant to be arrested without a warrant; some statutes now do so.  Practitioners, the Garda Síochána, students, people involved in the legal system and society in general will welcome the fact that this will now become a more simplified process, as opposed to the more complex and absurd one now in operation.</P>
    <P>That this area of the law is in need of reform has been long recognised.  A Bill to abolish the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours was first introduced in the late 1960s, but was withdrawn as a result of political controversy over separate sections of the Bill which dealt with forcible entry.  In Britain, the Criminal Law Act, 1967, introduced the concept of arrestable offences in terms identical to those set out in this Bill and that jurisdiction subsequently introduced changes by means of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill are unremarkable except for the definition of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo; contained in section 2.  By defining an arrestable offence as an offence for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may, under or by virtue of any enactment, be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty, the Bill introduces a potential area of confusion.</P>
    <P>Full capacity is not defined in the Bill. In general, it is understood to mean two things in criminal law &mdash; that the person is over 14 years of age and is legally sane.  The wording of the definition of &ldquo;arrestable offence&rdquo; may have the unintentional effect of rendering the criminally insane immune from prosecution other than by a warrant issued by a court.  It may be desirable to include a definition of full capacity on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 already abolishes all distinctions between felony and misdemeanour. Section 4 seeks to enact new statutory powers of arrest to replace the common law powers which attach to felonies.  Section 4 (2) is a cause of some concern as it gives any <Col N="1777" /> person a power of arrest if an arrestable offence has been committed and with reasonable cause to suspect a person of having committed the offence.  This power of arrest is too wide.  Under the provisions of section 4 (2) it is not necessary for the person to see the offence being committed; as long as they have a suspicion, based on reasonable cause, they are entitled to arrest.  It is difficult to envisage the practical situations where this power could be used for the benefit of society.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a sensible provision.  It permits the arrest of a person in respect of whom a warrant has been issued by any member of the Garda Síochána. Section 6 is probably the most controversial as it purports to permit the Garda to enter a dwelling house for the purpose of arresting for an arrestable offence.  Doubts have been raised about the constitutionality of the section.  The Constitution deals with the inviolability of the dwelling house in specific terms. Article 40.5 states: &ldquo;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The courts have interpreted that article of the Constitution in a specific manner.  Mr. Justice Walsh in The People <i>v.</i> O'Brien 1965 IR, at page 170, stated: &ldquo;In article 40 of the Constitution, the State has undertaken to defend and vindicate the inviolability of the dwelling of every citizen.  The defence, in vindication of the constitutional rights of the citizen, is a duty superior to that of trying such citizen for a criminal offence&rdquo;.  Inviolability of a dwelling house thus affords the status of a superior constitutional right.  From what Mr. Justice Walsh said, it would take precedence over the State's interest in bringing a person to trial for a criminal offence yet, the power of entry which the Bill seeks to give to the Garda for the purpose of bringing persons to trial on arrestable offences effectively repeals the constitutional guarantee of the inviolability of the dwelling house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> In 1987 in the case of Ryan <i>v.</i> O'Callaghan, Mr. Justice Barr upheld the constitutionality of the power of search granted by section 42 of the Larceny Act, 1916, because: &ldquo;It contained important elements for the protection of the public.  The investigation officer must swear on information that he has reasonable cause for suspecting that stolen property is to be found in the premises to be searched and he must satisfy a peace commissioner who is an independent person unconnected with criminal investigation <i>per se</i> that it is right and proper to issue a warrant&rdquo;. The problem I see is that section 6 does not make any reference to an independent person.  If this section is challenged it is possible that that safeguard may be found missing by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In my humble view the phrase &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo; as stated in article 40.5 of the Constitution has been interpreted by the courts as meaning more than authorised by Statute; it means in accordance with constitutional intention. Since 1765 the courts have prevented the Executive from claiming a general warrant to look through private premises.  Because of the farreaching consequences of this Bill it may lead to the Bill being challenged.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections are unremarkable in so far as they seek to establish rules for the trial and punishment of offenders in the post felony era.  In general I welcome the Bill as it gives us an opportunity to modernise the law and bring it into the new millennium.  I look forward to the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will contain provisions for more effective and efficient use of Garda time and resources and other proposals for the reform of the procedure in criminal cases which will come before the House in the not too distant future.  A substantial amount of work on the proposals for fundamental legislative reform is in train in a number of other areas and I encourage the Government to bring them forward as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have serious reservations about two or three sections of the Bill but as far as the rest is concerned I have no fundamental objection to it.  The kindest thing I can say is that it is relatively harmless.  What part is this Bill designed to play, or what part does the Government think it will play, in reducing the crime wave which is engulfing this country?  What contribution is the Bill intended to make towards making people feel safe and secure in their homes, on the streets, in their place of business or wherever? Any legislation which is introduced must be looked at in context.  The context in which this Bill is being introduced is a rising deluge of crime which is like a cancer eating into the core of society.  In the past day or two we have seen selective use of partial statistics in an attempt to create a mirage of a relatively crime free paradise on the western rim of Europe.  The reality is that the public has only to tune into the media to fully appreciate the diet of horror and brutality to which people are being subjected virtually on a daily basis.  Murder, rape, wounding, robbery with violence and every conceivable form of savagery have now become commonplace.  The Government's response to this cascade of crime can be summed up in two words: in decision and paralysis.  The Government's indecision seems final.  All its final decisions in this area are taken in a state of mind which does not last.  It is extraordinary to reflect that despite the depths of depravity to which the country has descended, the only anti-crime legislation introduced by this Government, apart from this relatively harmless measure, is the Drug Trafficking Act, which is nothing more, by common consent, not just from the Opposition side of the House, but of commentators outside the House than a pale, anaemic imitation of a much more robust measure proposed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal experts agree that the Government's minimalist legislation has already passed its sell by date, even <Col N="1780" /> though the ink on the presidential signature is hardly dry.  This minimalist legislation was the culmination of a titanic struggle in Cabinet between the left, the right and those who have not yet made up their minds and it was often fought out on the front pages of daily newspapers. Apparently the elephantine struggle has produced a gnat.  The Government has apparently decided on a strategy of producing a drip feed of harmless, incoherent measures to create the illusion of activity.  The reality is that nobody is deluded, nor should they be.</P>
    <P>Recent reports from the GRA conference have illustrated graphically the fact that the Garda is under strength in the context of modern day serious crime levels.  Statistics have been produced to show that among the ranks of the ordinary gardaí the figures have fallen by 1,000 in the past ten years.  That is the Government's response to the crime wave.  Replacements for those who retire are not sufficient to compensate for the numbers retiring.  There is no difficulty in filling vacancies at officer level but the soldier ranks are being depleted.</P>
    <P>The changes in rural policing have proved an unmitigated disaster &mdash; I say that even though I was on the Government side of the House when some of them were introduced.  At the recent GRA conference the rural community police service was colourfully described as not being fit to measure up to a pizza delivery service.  If this trend continues the future for the Garda will be as blue as its uniforms.  The Government does not have an appetite to tackle those fundamental problems and restore confidence in the Garda and, by extension, in the public.  Apparently it deems it more important to devote scarce parliamentary time and resources to amending such monumentarily important measures as the Forcible Entry Act, 1786 and the Riot Act, 1787.  The grossly inadequate, confused and even dangerous state of our insanity laws was graphically illustrated by recent events and in that regard the names O'Donnell. Ellis and Gallagher readily spring to mind.  It almost defies belief that our <Col N="1781" /> law in this vital area is still mainly based on the McNaughten Rules laid down by the British courts in the middle of the last century.  A century and a half of development in psychiatric medicine has passed by our insanity law.  The right of a person adjudged guilty but insane to be readmitted into society is uncertain and that uncertainty continues to cause widespread public angst and alarm.  Despite this, the Government does not appear to believe there is a urgency about the matter.  The dates for the introduction of promised amending legislation disappear further over the horizon each time a question on the matter is asked in this House.  In its wisdom the Government has decided to postpone indefinitely and prevaricate on amending our insanity laws and instead devote parliamentary time to the apparently much more important matter of amending the Slave Trade Act, 1824.</P>
    <P>While an ever increasing proportion of violent crime is committed by people on bail, our bail laws are arguably the most liberal in the civilised world.  The O'Callaghan decision of 1966 still prevents our courts from denying bail to a person who is virtually certain to reoffend &mdash; to rob, rape or even murder &mdash; while at large.  The Government's only response appears to be obfuscation, prevarication and indecision, all born out of ideological deadlock.  Yet we are here today devoting scarce departmental and parliamentary time and resources to dismantling the Whipping Act, 1820 and the Rescue Act, 1821.</P>
    <P>Directly related to the state of our bail laws is the question of the long delays in bringing to trial people charged with serious crimes.  In a disturbing number of recent cases such people have become targets for revenge at the hands of those acting for their alleged victims.  The combination of liberal bail laws and inordinate delays in bringing people to trial constitute a lethal cocktail for even more violence and it is not as if there has been an absence of proposals from outside and inside the House.  Proposals to fast track <Col N="1782" /> criminal trials were rejected out of hand by the Government.  The DPP, most unusually, went public and called for a unified prosecution service to make the system more efficient and cheaper but the Government greeted his call with a deafening silence.  Proposals have been advanced for fundamental reform of our laws of evidence.  All those proposals were made in response to public demand as the public believe the system has broken down.  The Government responded with all the energy and decisiveness of a latter day Pontius Pilate. Apparently it is far more important to devote time and effort to amending such monumental infamies as the Sunday Observance Act, 1695, and the Garrotters Act, 1863.</P>
    <P>In the past fortnight a person who had beaten an old person from my constituency almost to death received a sentence of 18 months.  A heroin importer &mdash; we all know the damage he or she can do &mdash; was sentenced to four years while a person who robbed £31 worth of food, without violence, to feed his family received a five year sentence.  It has been evident for some time that statutory sentencing guidelines, judicial education on sentencing policy and judicial access to information about sentencing has become vital but, obviously, the Government does not believe that to be the case.  There has not been a murmur about whether it intends to do anything in this regard.  Of course, it is too busy devoting time to amending section 2 of the Habeas Corpus Act, 1781 and section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824.</P>
    <P>The revolving door scandal continues unabated.  The recent Mountjoy visiting committee report demonstrates, if further demonstration were needed, that our prison system has become a sick joke.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> Our prison system has degenerated into a gigantic human warehouse which has converted many, who never even inhaled, into junkies and continues to churn people back into society who are more adept and skilled in the ways of crime than when they were sent to prison. Recidivism is rampant.  Our prisons have become universities of crime.  Even the most partisan Government supporter could hardly claim that such measures as amending the Hard Labour (Ireland) Act, 1826, the Civil Rights of Convicts Act, 1826 and the Whipping Act, 1820 constitutes even the beginning of an adequate response.</P>
    <P>Section 4 which deals with the question of arrest without warrant has been well ventilated.  The Minister appears to have taken a piece of common law which had degenerated into an indecipherable mess and repeated that mess in statutory form, leaving even more loopholes, technicalities for criminals to slip through.  I am sure this will be debated at some length on Committee Stage.  Section 6 appears to put the Government on a collision course with the Constitution because the Minister and her advisers must know that the words &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo; in the Constitution do not merely mean in accordance with any legislation or statute the Government wishes to introduce.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the meaning of section 8.  Deputy Currie and I were involved in a radio discussion some time ago about mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse.  He correctly made the point that there is a law which makes it an offence for people to fail to report a crime if they have knowledge of it.  I have news for the Deputy.  That will no longer be the case because section 8 will abolish that.  People will no longer be under a legal obligation to report a crime, irrespective of their knowledge of it, and they will not be penalised for not doing so.  The common law offence of misprision of felony for failing to report a crime will be abolished and if the Minister does not believe me she <Col N="1784" /> should peruse the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>

      <P>Page 5 of the memorandum states that the abolition of felony will mean that, &ldquo;The offence of misprison of felony and the offence of compounding a felony will disappear&rdquo;.  Perhaps my understanding of English is deficient, but the Minister's adviser has obviously advised her that this is what will happen</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 8 are incoherent. While it will no longer be illegal for a victim to fail to report a crime, the section compounds this by saying that reasonable compensation will also be a perfect defence for failing to report a crime.  As the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is a moveable feast, this provision will move from victim to victim and from case to case.  It constitutes a positive incentive for a victim not to report a crime in return for a payoff from the criminal and will encourage victims to collude with criminals escaping justice.  This is an indirect recognition of the pittance victims are allowed claim.  The victim will now be encouraged by Government legislation to top up that pittance by getting a few pounds from the criminal in return for not reporting a crime.  That is a rather strange contribution towards the notion that criminals should be brought to justice and punished for their crimes.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned at a number of developments arising from the first phase of the implementation plan of the review of the Defence Forces.  I am asking the House to consider carefully the issues involved so that a more satisfactory and comprehensive set of solutions can be found to meet these difficulties.</P>
      <P>Armies are looked at in a different light during peacetime.  Members of the public often believe that the peace they enjoy is of a permanent nature.  They can be lulled into a false sense of security which history, time after time, has shown can come home to haunt.  Peace is often fragile and delicate.  Ugly conflicts can arise in the most unexpected quarters.  None of us can be sure whether such conflict will be internal or external.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of a defence force is to be always in a state of readiness in terms <Col N="1786" /> of numbers, morale, equipment, training and education to deal effectively with any contingency.  No one doubts that this is a difficult task, one on which there is unanimity neither in the Oireachtas nor among the public generally as to the amount of financial resources, strategies and plans that should be permanently in place to provide maximum security at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are immensely proud of their Defence Forces.  Their involvement in peacekeeping missions with the United Nations has not only boosted morale in the Defence Forces but has instilled immense pride in the people of the country as a whole.  The Defence Forces perform many other functions in aid of the civil power.  One of their primary functions is to defend the State against armed aggression, and it is in this area that further debate is required so that when the reform process is completed the Defence Forces will be in a position to defend and protect our interests.  The face of aggression may have changed but it is still very real, and no Government can afford to ignore it.  It is not, therefore, viable to contemplate a reduction in manpower in the Defence Forces, and it is certainly not viable to proceed without a strategic plan, as the Government is bent on doing.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the review of the Defence Forces in so far as it recognises some of the problems affecting the ability of the forces to meet their commitments, I cannot agree with the thrust of what is going on.  No one disagrees that it is high time for change.  However, for change to be effective it must embrace all the vital elements, fit into a strategic plan which is out in the open, transparent and capable of being understood and managed by members of the Defence Forces, covering the full period of the reform programme.  Structures, personnel, equipment and infrastructure are the vital components, and a true sketch of changes proposed and their impact must be charted immediately. There can be no hidden agenda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> This Government is obviously not adopting an open approach.  There is clearly no detailed planning in the area of organisational structures and personnel models, even though these have to be married successfully to current realities if the reform process is to succeed.</P>
    <P>I accept that many of the underlying problems we face today did not grow up overnight.  Here I cite an extract from &ldquo;Defence '96&rdquo; prepared by a group of retired military officers:</P>
    <P>The failure of successive Governments to tackle the problem of defence in any meaningful way has led to many of the current problems in the Defence Forces.  These problems were caused by piecemeal decisions at Government or departmental level, for example, the cancellation of recruiting, reduction in strength of 30 per cent of establishment. These decisions in turn have had a knock on effect leading to the average age of soldiers being too high, soldiers on security duties working very long hours, inability to undertake sub-unit and unit collective training, lack of sufficient up-to-date equipment, the imbalance of 80:20 between pay and resources.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments stand indicted on the non-implementation of a constant recruitment drive.  This starvation has been disastrous for the Army in terms of age profile, career development, promotional opportunity, etc.  In fairness to the military personnel, many of the current problems were outlined by them but ignored by the Oireachtas. Fundamental problems such as age profile which is too high, organisational duplication, inadequate equipment and the imbalance between pay and non-pay at 80:20 which is far too high are undoubtedly all there.  Many of the matters which have been highlighted in the Price Waterhouse review were well known and documented by military commanders, but they had not the power to institute change when the <Col N="1788" /> requirement was first identified.  The old saying &ldquo;a stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; was not heeded.  The problems are now compounded, will take longer to resolve and may well cost more money.</P>
    <P>Some of the pressures would be eased if, in the first instance, the implementation group would clarify the type and nature of the force they believe is required for the future.  There is general agreement that the force should be a conventional all-arms one with a light infantry-based element and that it should have a high degree of mobility and a capacity for rapid deployment. However, huge questions remain to be answered as to what is actually involved in these terms.  Detailed information on these aspects is essential so that the working groups can do their work effectively. We must know at the outset the type and nature of the force in order to design a logistics system.  Equally, the team dealing with personnel needs to know the mix of unit types the force will have before it can determine proper personnel arrangements, the ranks and the skills required.</P>
    <P>Here we are in the first phase of implementation and a fleshed-out concept of the type of force which is intended has not been articulated. There is no plan, no mission, just a hotchpotch of stop-go measures which are the hallmark of past mistakes.  We have had leaks, statements, counter-statements, denials.  This House is entitled, and members of the Defence Forces have the right, to know the details of what is envisaged for them in the future.  For any review to be successful, it is vital that the Defence Forces take ownership of the change process and be fully committed to its success. We live in an age where consensus is the order of the day &mdash; great minds think alike.  Participation by those who must plan and implement decisions is vital. Not nearly enough is happening in this area, and this can lead to endless frustration.</P>
    <P>This is not only my view, it is the view of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers.  To prove my <Col N="1789" /> point let me quote from their presentation to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on 30 April last:</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Implementation Group carried out its work had an extremely negative effect on officers.  In the aftermath of the Goverment decision the previous July, officers had been optimistic and confident regarding the future of the Defence Forces and eager to participate in shaping the organisation of the future.  However, they now felt that the Implementation Group had excluded them from real involvement in the process and this had a major negative impact on the professional self-esteem of all officers.  To them it reflected a low evaluation by their military and civilian superiors of their professionalism, skills and commitment to Defence Forces.  The damage which this did to the morale of the Officer Corps should not be under estimated.</P>
    <P>This lack of communication and involvement was compounded by the continuous leaks to the media concerning elements of the review, which led to a great degree of uncertainty among the members of the Forces and had a serious negative effect upon their morale.  This resulted in a situation where officers became extremely suspicious of the motivation behind the process and where they began to view it as &ldquo;something which is being done to them&rdquo;, rather than something which is positive and with which they are intimately and vitally involved.  In short, the Implementation Group failed to achieve the single most important ingredient for successful change &mdash; i.e. ownership of the process by those who must implement it.</P>
    <P>The failure to produce an Overall Strategic Plan added greatly to the uncertainty felt by officers regarding the future of the Defence Forces.  The plan concentrates on the area of structure/personnel which will, in the <Col N="1790" /> main, impact negatively on members of the Forces and includes only brief references to the positive areas (for officers as professionals) of equipment and infrastructure/facilities. Officers consider that it will be difficult to maintain the momentum for charge beyond the first phase, particularly when the matters to be dealt with in the later phases involve additional expenditure, rather than overall savings as in phase one.  The experience of the period during which the Implementation Group was preparing its plan led to a high degree of scepticism among the members of the Officer Corps regarding the level of commitment to positive reform of the Defence Forces which exists outside the Forces and regarding what is the &ldquo;real agenda&rdquo; of the process.  The belief that the process had been hijacked by those who see it solely as an opportunity to achieve financial cuts and savings in the short-term and who have no interest in the long-term well being of the Defence Forces became widespread among officers.</P>
    <P>On the closure of barracks and lack of transparency in the Government in dealing with this vital issue.  I do not have time this evening to go into the importance of Army barracks, particularly in small towns, where householders have had an opportunity to integrate with local communities and become involved in their cultural, sporting and other activities.  Since it appears the Minister is under the impression that, whenever we raise this issue, we are endeavouring to cause problems and annoyance without any justification I will quote a further extract from the position paper of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security at its meeting held on 30 April last, page 16 under the heading &ldquo;Logistical Support &mdash; Existing Barracks/Facilities&rdquo;.  It reads:</P>
    <P>It is implicit in the Government's statement of 3 July 1995 on the matter of facilities that the Implementaton <Col N="1791" /> Group was required to ensure that the Plan put forward provided for the maintaining of all current facilities pending an eventual decision on the matter by Government.  However, RACO's analysis of the Implementation Group's plan for Phase 1 clearly indicates that it is based on the assumption that approximately eight of our existing barracks/posts will close.</P>
    <P>The logistics structures proposed by the Group are, we understand, designed to allow the operational units to operate independently in the field and to provide a barrack housekeeping structure which does not impair this ability.  The Group proposes a &ldquo;Camp Staff&rdquo; section in the Logistics Battalion of each Brigade to provide this structure.  This staff would provide personnel to support barracks and units in a number of areas including fuel, energy and utilities, clothing the soft ordnance, building maintenance and furnishings, and rations, cooking and dining.  However, it is clear that this Camp Staff element is insufficient to meet the needs of all existing barracks/posts.  Indeed, during a briefing by the Co-ordinating Committee of the Working Groups in December 1995, RACO was informed that this staff was designed to maintain only five barracks per Brigade, thus confirming the results of the Association's own analysis in this area.</P>
    <P>The association fully accepts that there is no mention of the closure of facilities in the Group's report. Equally we fully accept the assurances the Minister for Defence has personally given in this regard. However, the Association is absolutely satisfied that the Group's proposals in respect of &ldquo;Camp Staffs&rdquo; will, if implemented, mean that the review of facilities when it takes place will inevitably conclude that up to eight barracks cannot be supported. This, of course would provide a strong argument for their closure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> I want the Minister to clarify these matters this evening because it is not good enough to say closures will not take place during the first phase of the implementation plan.  I have said time and time again that such decisions are being put off in the hope of a future Government having to take them.</P>
    <P>This is a time for consensus, for being open and frank about what is proposed for the future of the Defence Forces. There is much cynicism about politicians, including Ministers, to which we add when we do not face up to realities. For example, the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, said in an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that there will be closures and 24 hours later he said the opposite, that there would not be closures during the implementation of the first phase.</P>
    <P>It is now time to call a spade a spade, to say exactly what will happen in the term of the plan, thus letting communities know whether barracks located in their areas will close.  It is clear from what commissioned officers have said &mdash; and they accept the Minister's word that nothing will happen during the first phase &mdash; that it will be impossible, on the basis of the staffing levels proposed, to maintain present numbers.</P>
    <P>There is no career structure for enlisted personnel in the Defence Forces.  It is crucial for the morale of the force that their terms of pay, conditions of service, career development and social needs be protected and developed.  Under the proposed manpower policy career development must be realistic, rewarding and capable of fulfilling the individual career aspirations of our soldiers.</P>
    <P>The criteria for promotion and extension of service have not been dealt with adequately either by the Gleeson report or in the implementation plan.  Because of the uncertainty it is very important that we deal with these issues now.</P>
    <P>Chapter Seven of the submission document of PDFORRA to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security dated 16 April 1996 under the heading &ldquo;Manpower Policy&rdquo; reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> PDFORRA considers that the Government's position that the age profile of all ranks of the Defence Forces is the overriding problem needing to be addressed under proposed manpower models is flawed and that it does not stand the test of in-depth analysis.</P>
    <P>Lack of proper performance appraisal particularly for the private soldier, a job description, physical, military and general education criteria for promotion and extension of service are more contributory to the perceived shortcomings of members of the Defence Forces than a rising age profile.</P>
    <P>To suggest that a soldier who does not reach the rank of corporal within 5 years or a sergeant within 12 years should be discontinued in service even though he has proved an excellent soldier is contradictory.  The emphasis on addressing the age profile has more relevance in the manpower models for enlisted infantry soldiers than for enlisted technicians and for commissioned officers.  The retention in service for longer periods of the latter two categories is based on a return for investment but is inconsistent and contradicts the stated necessity of letting infantry Privates go after five years and infantry Corporals after 12 years to avail of a recurrence of increasing the ageprofile. An officer it appears can serve in all cases to over 50 years of age while enlisted personnel who are technicians from Private up to Sergeant rank can serve for 21 years.</P>
    <P>PDFORRA's position is that once an individual can function satisfactorily based on a job description, age becomes secondary.</P>
    <P>Present members of the Defence Forces have served loyally and with distinction particularly whilst undergoing United Nations missions</P>
    <P>The criteria for promotion and continuance in service under which they enlisted has been met otherwise they would not be serving.</P>
    <P>The capping of service in the rank <Col N="1794" /> on future promotion for existing enlisted personnel is also a change in conditions of service and inconsistent with the Voluntary Early Retirement offer.</P>
    <P>Serving personnel should they not be selected or avail of VER may at a future date be faced with redundancy under these proposals.  PDFORRA has never been at any time consulted on this proposition prior to the release of the Government Implementation Plan.</P>
    <P>The so-called 1994 intake of contract soldiers who are three years into their term do not yet have a proper performance appraisal or criteria and will be interviewed before a board for selection for continuance in service.  It will be very difficult for such a board to be objective.  Under the present restrictions on promotion in an army undergoing troop cuts and reorganisation they do not have a reasonable expectation to be promoted in fair competition.</P>
    <P>Female infantry soldiers in operational units have their opportunities for promotions severely curtailed as they are prevented by a decision of the military authorities from serving below company HQ level whilst on service with the United Nations in South Lebanon.  A good overseas performance appraisal rating is essential for promotion.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I, as members of the Select Committee on Security and Legislation, have had a good opportunity to touch briefly on the five year contract.  While most people agree the contract is a good arrangement, it is presenting problems that need to be overcome.  It is very important that it is indicated at this stage what changes are possible in the five year contract.  It was argued in committee discussions that it takes up to three years to train a soldier and, whether it takes three years and six months or more, it is very important that the country has access to the most highly qualified and active soldiers in the Department of Defence.  For that <Col N="1795" /> reason I propose the following options; to indicate that it will be possible to increase the length of the planned period of contract or that significant numbers will be offered a second contract.</P>
    <P>Where the State has made an investment in the skills and training of highly motivated people who have served with the United Nations, it is important that they have better career opportunities than the proposed five year contract gives them.  No one wants to return to a situation where age profile difficulties will arise, however no one wants to frustrate the career opportunities for highly trained and motivated soldiers.  Fianna Fáil on its return to office intends to do something positive about this and will ensure that significantly greater numbers of those who have satisfactorily completed their contracts will have an opportunity to accept another contract.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing for an in-depth study of the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the Reserve Defence Forces, civilianisation, equipment and military accommodation.  Does he believe it is possible to implement the first phase of this plan successfully without knowing what the studies will throw up?  Does he intend to have these studies completed very quickly?  Will the plan be put in abeyance in some instances until the studies produce information which will enable him to proceed?  It is crucial that one or other of those options is taken.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service requires very special attention.  I suggest that the implementation plan for the Naval Service should be put in abeyance until the study has been completed.  It is important that the study must not be conditioned by the process that has developed so far.  The Naval Service was not represented on the study group and hence many of its special requirements were not even adverted to.  The Naval Service has no fear that an honest assessment of its special circumstances will not bring forward recommendations for increased personnel and equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> It is absolutely crucial that the implementation group in its endeavours to reduce numbers in the Defence Forces gives special consideration to the Naval Service.  It is clear that the defence role of the Naval Service should be enhanced and that better equipment should be available to it to discharge these functions.</P>
    <P>It is clear that its non military role creates the greater problems for the Naval Service.  As a maritime nation with a massive coastline to protect, including fishery protection, enforcement of maritime law, drug interdiction and rescue, the Naval Service is not equipped in terms of facilities or personnel to discharge these responsibilities and can only provide a fire brigade service for the area of 132,000 square miles.  It is unspeakable to think that the implementation group would further reduce these hopelessly inadequate resources.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs, and Finance are also involved in the context of the growing demands on the Naval Service in a number of vital areas.  An essential part of its work is combating and intercepting drug barons and intermediaries on their way to this country.  The resources are not adequate to do this job properly.  It is clear that the Naval Service will require much greater autonomy in these areas which have a token defence element in the traditional meaning of the word. Fianna Fáil will see to it that substantial changes are made with greater autonomy in management and more dedicated resources to meet those tasks. Recruitment and proper career development is vital to ensure that this capacity is developed.  Why are staff in the Naval Service leaving it faster than any other arm of the Defence Forces? Clearly because they are understaffed and badly equipped.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that up to two billion fish are raked from our seas each year as the Spanish and other fleets continue <Col N="1797" /> vacuuming our coastal waters because of inadequate supervision of logging.  It is clear that resources have to be provided in this area.  The introduction of the Casa aircraft, welcome as it is, is only throwing up how inadequate the Naval Service is to meet those demands. It is estimated that more than 20 per cent of the trawlers that are boarded are logging the fish species incorrectly and are driving a coach and four through EU fishery laws.  I am told that it can take up to two hours for the Naval Service to board and inspect a ship which means that it is not possible to board any more than two or three ships each day.  All of the surveillance and intelligence indicates that ships from other countries are raking the Irish box. Surely it is crucial in the context of the implementation of the first phase of this plan that we do not go down the road of reducing still further its capacity in the light of the problems in that area.</P>
    <P>The FCA has been virtually rubbished in the Price Waterhouse report which proposes to reduce the numbers from 16,000 to a little more than 7,000. The FCA reserves need to have meaningful involvement with the Minister and his Department on what will happen to them in the future.  Surely it is possible for the Minister to indicate to the FCA during its jubilee celebrations that he will not accept its virtual rubbishing. The reserves have been available to ensure an immediate supply of voluntary service throughout the country. The FCA has been able to continue to recruit young girls and boys in spite of all the difficulties they have had to overcome in recent times.  They have perpetuated the Force in remarkable circumstances.  It is critical that Fianna Fáil is in a position to say that it does not have any intention of accepting the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report to massively reduce the numbers in the Force, which is unacceptable and unnecessary.  I do not <Col N="1798" /> know if anybody has quantified in terms of financial resources the meagre amount provided for first and second line reserves over a long time against the benefits to the community gained from the voluntary service of young people who risk their health and take other risks to provide that service.  It is time we recognised that service and rejected the proposals in the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
    <P>We have heard welcome proposals about the Army Band and the Army Equitation School.  In the limited time available I want to deal briefly with some of the more pertinent problems concerning the five year contract, career development and the lack of promotional opportunities.  Fianna Fáil will produce a White Paper on Defence in the first year it is next in office.  This paper will charter a course for the Defence Forces well into the next century. It will be open and transparent.  It will focus on what a real army should be doing, training, education, equipment, infrastructure and the resources necessary to implement such a charter. Fianna Fáil will indicate that any savings made as a result of the proposed changes will be ploughed back into the Department of Defence and into facilities and equipment for Defence Forces personnel.  We will review the five year contract with a view to ensuring that greater numbers can avail of an extended contract.  I hope that the patriotic public service, loyalty and discipline which the State has enjoyed from the Defence Forces, on which it could depend in every crisis, will be recognised, that we will respond to their needs by solving some of the present problems and that we will not take that loyalty for granted at any stage in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Smith said, the review of the role and operation of the Defence Forces is vital and is to be welcomed.  The recommendations of the <Col N="1799" /> Price Waterhouse report are excessive and have created many problems.  The key question ultimately is one of credibility and trust between the Minister and the Army.  Anybody who has taken an interest in this issue will be aware that the present position has a negative effect on Army morale and is a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>I am pleased Deputy Smith has given an undertaking of what Fianna Fáil intends to do concerning the Defence Forces when it is next in Government. The White Paper will be helpful, will set out clearly what is intended and will give the Defence Forces a status they deserve but frequently do not receive.</P>
      <P>We must be aware that Army personnel, their wives and families are greatly concerned about the present position. Given the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report, they are concerned about whether there is a hidden agenda.  Anyone who heard them being interviewed on the radio today or on other occasions would be aware their concern is real.  They appear to be seeking fairly minimal undertakings which are not forthcoming.  That leads them to believe that there must be something more sinister afoot.  They are particularly concerned about the position of personnel who have health-related problems, the location and continued existence of barracks and a number of personnel have requested written confirmation that they have a future in the Army.  There would not seem to be any major difficulties concerning those requests but difficulties arise in that they have not been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is virtually impossible to ascertain the Government's intention concerning the location, closure and upgrading of barracks.  That is a cause of extreme concern among Defence Forces personnel. The representative bodies, PDFORRA and RACO were born out of unrest in the Defence Forces over a <Col N="1800" /> long period.  Some of that unrest came to light before the Minister came to office, but his handling of the matter, particularly in recent days, has been most unhelpful.  These bodies have a role to play and should be properly consulted. It is shocking that developments have taken place in recent weeks without consulting those bodies which have a mandate to represent their members. The refusal to give them access to what the Government has approved is a recipe for disaster.  Deputy Smith made a constructive contribution in that regard.  He outlined a large number of problems, some major but many of them relatively minor, which could be addressed to the satisfaction of the Department and Army personnel concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a misunderstanding and lack of appreciation among the public of the pride soldiers take in serving their country. That is understandable in times of peace but there are times when their service is required and their role is more obvious.  I am sure we all hope we will never see those times again.  Nevertheless, account must be taken of their role. We have become very sceptical and have a jaundiced view of virtually every other profession, and probably politicians suffer most.  Journalists, lawyers, teachers, farmers and others are misunderstood by every other group and soldiers are no different in that respect. They have served the country exceptionally well.  At every level there is pride in the role played by Irish UN peacekeepers in various locations.  They deserve recognition inside and outside this House.  Recognition of their contribution outside the House is commendable and is deserved, but it must also be recognised in their terms and conditions of service, rates of pay and the manner in which they are treated under this review.</P>
    <P>The numbers opting for early retirement are more than double the number <Col N="1801" /> required.  We must question that message. Does it reflect the morale in the Defence Forces?  This gives rise to a practical question of whether all those persons will be accommodated.  Financial provision is available to accommodate 500 people, but many more want to leave the Defence Forces.  They may wish to leave for constructive reasons, but I cannot help suspecting that they have taken a long-term view of the Government's attitude to the Defence Forces, decided there is not a role for them, that the career they entered, most likely for life, does not exist and the best option is to avail of what is on offer in the short-term and seek to make a living in a different milieu.</P>
    <P>If members of the representative bodies of the Defence Forces were to consider the manner in which the Government has handled the contract for the executive jet for the duration of the EU Presidency they would be concerned about a lack of transparency in the Department of Defence.  They would be extremely worried about the way this affair was handled.  If they were to judge from the experience of Westair, they would have every reason to be worried. When I gave the Minister of State an opportunity on a recent Adjournment Debate to answer specific questions, he gave a treatise on Ireland's role in the EU Presidency and particularly avoided the difficult questions about the shabby treatment of an Irish company and the handling of Government contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann,</P>
      <P>&mdash;commends the Government for its continuing support for the process of reforming the Defence Forces;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" />&mdash;supports the Government's policy of implementing the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group in a planned and phased manner; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;approves the approach adopted by the Minister for Defence in drawing up the implementation plan for the first three year phase of the reform programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This debate enables me to deal once again with some of the issues which have given rise to misconceptions and worries surrounding the Efficiency Audit Group process in so far as it affects the Defence Forces.  The Government has embarked on a major reform of the Defence Forces, aimed at increasing its efficiency and effectiveness and streamlining its structures and organisation.  Before dealing with the reform process which is now taking place, it is important to look at the need for the present review of the Defence Forces.  The report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson report, highlighted a number of shortcomings in the organisation and structure with excessive numbers employed in non-operational tasks. Similar structural problems were again highlighted by a subsequent review of military administration by the Efficiency Audit Group.</P>
    <P>Arising from a changed international environment, the then Government, in September 1993, adopted a revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces which placed greater emphasis on current operational roles as opposed to defence of the State against external aggression, hitherto the primary role. Furthermore, it had been apparent for some time to all concerned that the rising age profile of the Defence Forces would cause problems if it was not addressed in a co-ordinated and meaningful manner.</P>
    <P>Against a background of general <Col N="1803" /> acceptance, not least by the Defence Forces, that reform of the military organisation was necessary, it was decided to ask the Efficiency Audit Group to conduct a review of the structure and organisation.  External consultants were engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group to conduct the detailed work of the review.  To ensure that the consultants had the necessary military expertise, senior officers of the Defence Forces were involved at every stage of the selection process.  The selected firm, Price Waterhouse, provided a team which included Major-General Lewis Makenzie, retired, the ex-UN commander in the former Yugoslavia, and other Canadian military experts.  The Canadian military team was accepted by the Irish military authorities as having the necessary and appropriate military competance to conduct the review.  It is very important to emphasise that the review was not just carried out by management consultants but by a team of consultants which included vastly experienced military personnel who were regarded by our Defence Forces has having the expertise necessary to carry out the review.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government announced its response to the report of the Efficiency Audit Group and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.  The Government established an implementation group to draw up a fully costed development plan for the Defence Forces setting out the measures to be undertaken during the first three years of the reform process.  I expect the entire reform process to take about ten years to complete.</P>
    <P>The plan, with which the military authorities are in full agreement, was approved by the Government last March.  This plan is essentially strategic in nature and sets out the parameters and objectives within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place.  It <Col N="1804" /> does not go into the fine detail of the new organisation or structure, nor would it be appropriate to do so at this stage.</P>
    <P>At all stages throughout this process of reform I have been at pains to ensure that the representative associations and the personnel whom they represent are kept fully informed of all developments as they happen.  I have met representatives of both the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks' Representative Association PDFORRA, on six separate occasions in the last year, to hear their opinions and discuss with them my own views and those of the Government. I took the unusual step, on 3 July 1995, of coming straight from the Cabinet Room and meeting representatives of both associations to brief them on the specifics of the Government decision which had just been taken concerning the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies the need for urgent and real reform of the Defence Forces. The problems highlighted by the Efficiency Audit Group did not come as a surprise.  With the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission being implemented following its report in 1990, many thought then that the Defence Forces were going through their period of greatest change.  Now, with the implementation of the Efficiency Audit Group's recommendations, a period of even greater change is taking place.  While I have every confidence that the adaptability displayed by all personnel of the Permanent Defence Force to the initiatives of the Gleeson Commission will be continued in the way the organisation as a whole addresses and responds to the challenges of the new Efficiency Audit Group reforms, it is of great importance that the representative associations and personnel of the Defence Forces should take ownership of this process of reform <Col N="1805" /> rather than regard it as something which has been imposed on them.  Participation in the process of change by the representative associations, which represent the vast majority of personnel of the Defence Force, will guarantee its successful implementation.</P>
    <P>The representative associations have been repeatedly promised consultation on all aspects of the implementation plan.  Consultation and discussions have taken place under the auspices of the Defence Forces Conciliation Council, the most appropriate forum in which to deal with any issues which either side may wish to raise.  I have told the associations on a number of occasions that there is a certain degree of flexibility in the way the plan will be implemented, and I stand by this statement.  I have received position papers from the associations in which their views are clearly set out and these opinions are being given detailed consideration in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>While it would, of course, be preferable to reach agreement with the associations on every issue which is in contention at present, I am realistic enough to realise that such a scenario is unlikely. It would be disingenuous of me, therefore, to pretend, both sides having discussed an issue from every conceivable angle and been unable to reach a mutually acceptable compromise, that I can abdicate my responsibility to carry out plans and decisions made by Government that are in the national interest. There are hard decisions to be made and I will not shirk from my responsibilities where they are concerned.  That said, I am convinced that it will be possible to reach an accommodation with the representative associations on a wide range of issues.</P>
    <P>The seriously unbalanced age-rank profile of the PDF identified by the Gleeson Commission and, more recently, the subject of severe criticism by Price Waterhouse, the consultants engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group <Col N="1806" /> to carry out the detailed review of the Defence Forces, has also been of serious concern to the military authorities for a number of years.  In an effort to improve the situation, the previous Fianna Fáilled Government decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis.  Full implementation of the five year contract policy is central to the Government's plans for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very critical of that at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the Defence Forces exist to carry out specific tasks assigned by Government in a professional military manner. In turn, the Government will implement best practice procedures in relation to its manpower policy and act reasonably in the interests of those it employs while at the same time getting a square deal for the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>In deciding to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, careful consideration was given to the position of those personnel as well as to the requirements of the force.  The Permanent Defence Force requires a high turnover in the rank of private, particularly in infantry and other operational units.  Soldiering is, I am sure Deputies will accept, primarily a young persons' activity.  All who are taken in cannot expect to have a lifetime career and to pretend otherwise is dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it infinitely preferable for non-career personnel to be enlisted for a fixed period of five years in the knowledge that they will return to the job market at a time when they are still young and in a position to benefit from the skills, self-discipline and character formation associated with service in the Defence Forces than for them to eventually fail to meet fitness or job suitability criteria and be returned to the employment market at a time later in life, when they probably will have <Col N="1807" /> serious financial commitments, a family to support and they are less employable. I also intend to introduce short service commissions for some officers to prevent a recurrence of the current situation where there are too many senior and not enough junior officers.</P>
    <P>To facilitate turnover in the ranks and to open the possibility of recruitment to address the age profile, while at the same time catering for the need, following the Government decision, to reduce the size of the Defence Forces, a voluntary early retirement scheme has been introduced.  The scheme opened last month and can be regarded as an outstanding success as it is considerably oversubscribed already.  This scheme will allow the retirement of 2,300 Permanent Defence Force personnel over the next three years.  It is entirely voluntary and there is no obligation on anyone to either apply for or accept early retirement.  In the context of the superannuation arrangements which apply in the Permanent Defence Force, such as entitlement to pension and gratuity at a relatively young age, the terms of the scheme are commensurate with those offered in other areas of the public sector. Personnel who avail of the scheme will receive a pension and gratuity, if they are qualified to do so by the length of service, and will also receive a tax free severance gratuity.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive support system has been put in place for those considering voluntary early retirement to facilitate an easy transition to civilian life, whether in further employment or retirement.  Those who wish to take up further employment will be provided with assistance in identifying and marketing their skills in the labour market and helping them search for employment, if that is what they wish to do.  A firm of outside consultants, which specialises in this area, has been engaged by my Department to assist in the provision of these services.  This is <Col N="1808" /> another area where there were comprehensive consultations with the associations and where it proved possible to take some of their proposals on board.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of worry in the Defence Forces that if personnel do not take voluntary early retirement they will be made redundant.  I cannot over-emphasise that no serving member of the Permanent Defence Force will be made redundant by reason of manpower policy or a necessity to reduce numbers.  I repeat that the scheme is entirely voluntary.  There is no intention to change the manner of implementation of Defence Force regulations where continuance in service is concerned and paragraph 5.20 of the implementation plan will not be given effect as a means of reducing the manpower levels of the Permanent Defence Force at some future date.  I gave a commitment to both associations to this effect and I will adhere to it.</P>
    <P>I wish to address another manpower issue, capping service in the ranks.  The implementation plan contains a proposal that personnel should not be allowed serve longer than a particular fixed period in any one rank.  This is an important proposal which has implications for movement in the ranks and for reducing the age profile of all ranks. However, I understand the proposal is causing concern to certain personnel who see it as a diminution of their conditions of service.  Personnel serving in a particular rank at present will not suddenly be forced to retire earlier than they had anticipated because of the implementation of this proposal.  They will retain their posts in their present ranks and can serve to the retirement ages laid down now, subject to their meeting the normal criteria regarding health and conduct.</P>
    <P>In so far as serving personnel are concerned the proposal will only have an effect if they are offered and accept promotion with the concomitant increase in remuneration.  The specifics of these <Col N="1809" /> proposals have not yet been decided and the representative associations have been told they will be negotiated with them, with a view to reaching agreement, before a decision is taken.</P>
    <P>There has been an inordinate amount of speculation regarding the closure of barracks.  I reiterate that the Government has not decided to close any barracks and the subject is not on the Government agenda.  As well as having regard to the needs of the Defence Forces, the Government is conscious of the social and economic implications which the closure of a barracks would have for any area.  The redesigned structures will minimise the amount of administrative and housekeeping work to be done by the Permanent Defence Force and maximise the force's ability to carry out its operational tasks.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service and the Air Corps perform some of the tasks which are central to the redefined roles of the Defence Forces.  I have already given a firm commitment that I will not leave the Naval Service or the Air Corps in a position in which they would not have adequate manpower for the running and maintenance of ships and aircraft.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years a growing appreciation of the value of our marine resources has coincided with a period of growth and development for the Naval Service and Air Corps.  In particular, the extension of our exclusive fishery limit to 200 miles offshore marked a turning point in our appreciation of the importance of the sea as an economic asset.  As a result the Naval Service and the Air Corps have seen considerable growth and development.  With the new arrangements on fishery control measures introduced this year, the workload of the Naval Service and the Air Corps is increasing.  Some time ago we reached agreement on the new EU fisheries surveillance package which, for the first time, includes an element of funding for operational costs for Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> The continuing success of the Naval Service in fishery protection, in search and rescue and its important role in dealing with pollution threats and the illegal importation of drugs has resulted in a much more widespread appreciation of the outstanding work it performs. The Air Corps performs vitally important functions in search and rescue, air ambulance, security operations and, from time to time, it assists in nonmilitary operations, such as the relief of distress in emergencies arising from natural disasters.</P>
    <P>Recognising the diversity of tasks performed by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, the Government, on my recommendation, decided that, as an integral part of the process of implementing the recommendations of the efficiency audit group, separate in-depth studies should be carried out on their structure and organisation.  These studies will be undertaken by the efficiency audit group and I understand the group hopes to place a contract with consultants to carry out the detailed work within the next two weeks.  The consultants will be required to have experts in the maritime and aviation fields as part of their team.</P>
    <P>I wish to make special mention of the valuable role that the FCÁ and An Slua Muirí play in the life of the community. Their members are part of what are, in effect, voluntary organisations.  They must possess high levels of motivation and commitment as they pursue other careers while devoting their spare time at evenings and weekends to training. The contribution these personnel make to the life of our communities is considerable. It is recognised and valued throughout the country and by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Reserve Defence Forces will be subjected to examination by the efficiency audit group, but phase 1 of the implementation process is concentrating on the structure and organisation <Col N="1811" /> of the Permanent Defence Force.  The Reserve will be looked at in a later phase.  It would be incongruous to start looking at the organisation of the Reserve without first addressing the Permanent Defence Force structure which is inextricably linked to it. Deputy Killeen raised the question of reducing the strength of the FCÁ or Reserve to 7,000 as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, it is important to make the point that this recommendation has not been accepted by the Government or the implementation group.</P>
    <P>I have already met members of the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association and discussed aspects of the efficiency audit group's review with them.  As we progress in a later stage to a more detailed examination of the Reserve, there will be full consultation with the representative body, as has happened in the case of the associations representing members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>This review is not a cost cutting exercise. It is not being carried out in order to produce a programme of cut-backs and closures.  What I and the Government want at the end of this whole process is to have an organisation that is best suited for the discharge of the roles assigned to it.  A key objective in the exercise is to release more personnel for operational duties.  I know that this is what the military personnel themselves want.</P>
    <P>The military authorities have taken possession of this plan and are running with it.  They have seized the opportunity which has been presented to them to modernise and shape their own structure and organisation for the future. What will be achieved at the end of the exercise is a modern, efficient organisation, staffed, accommodated and equipped to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government in a manner which will provide value for money.  This objective is in the national interest; it is in the interest of the Defence Forces <Col N="1812" /> themselves and it is an objective which I am confident is supported by all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate.  In the limited time available I wish to highlight a number of points about which I feel very strongly as a former member of the Defence Forces in which I served at every rank for over 29 years.  Although everything may not be hunky-dory and there will always be problems in many barracks which have been neglected for over a decade, one can see the transformation which has taken place in the Defence Forces.  These changes were initiated by Paddy Donegan while I was a serving member at Dundalk Aiken Barracks at a time when the Defence Forces were in a far worse condition.  He provided more resources for the Defence Forces than any of his predecessors. The Minister is following in his footsteps.  I have no problem in saying that or supporting him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am horrified at the manner in which the negotiations are being conducted on this important and serious matter.  They are being conducted through the national media by leaks, innuendo and insults.  Serving members have insulted the Minister, the man responsible for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  This is due to a lack of knowledge, experience and negotiating skills at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national trade union official &mdash; I had that honour &mdash; would not insult his boss before entering negotiations with him.  On the contrary, he would wait until a deal had been negotiated before saying anything to his members or the media.  It seems the horse is being put <Col N="1813" /> before the cart every time.  I ask the representative bodies, PDFORRA in particular, to desist.  I do not think any Minister could sit back and consistently take the insults.  The Minister has been called on to resign in the middle of negotiations on a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, no one is being forced to accept the early retirement package.  All serving members of the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps can continue until they reach retirement age; they will not be forced out.  This is not an option open to most workers.  During the week over 300 people in Dundalk were told overnight that they were to lose their jobs without any chance to negotiate.  They will not be offered a package similar to the one on offer to members of the Defence Forces.  They will be lucky if they receive a pittance and certainly will not have a substantial pension.</P>
    <P>Most workers who are made redundant cannot avail of a pension scheme and will be lucky if they receive their statutory redundancy payments.  I have dealt with thousands of workers who had to claim these payments from the redundancy fund.  We should, therefore, call a halt and take a long hard look at what is happening.  Every worker should have the opportunity to decide whether to stay on whenever a redundancy or early retirement package is announced in the industrial and services sectors but the majority are not given that opportunity.</P>
    <P>This process was not initiated by the Minister or the Government but by Deputy Andrews who was followed by Brendan Daly, now a Senator, with whom I had many discussions as my party's spokesperson at the time, as I had with the late Brian Lenihan who pioneered the Bill through the Dáil.  A good job was done both by him and the Opposition.  This Minister did not dream it up.</P>
    <P>There is a most important point which <Col N="1814" /> seems to have been forgotten and ignored time and again by spokespersons of the Defence Forces.  The Price Waterhouse report set down three options.  Since the Minister has gone for the preferred option of the military, I do not know what people are talking about. It is almost as if somebody in the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and Democratic Left plucked this out of the sky.  However, it was carefully negotiated and submitted following consultation at every stage of the process on behalf of all members of the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>The people involved, the officers and senior ranks, did a good job because they recognise, like every section of the Defence Forces, the need for reorganisation. At some stage every organisation has to be reorganised and this presents problems.  It is for the people involved to negotiate with skill, patience and knowledge to resolve them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is flexible.  When a sub-committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party under my chairmanship made it clear to him that it would not be a party to barrack closures he had no hesitation in giving us that guarantee.</P>

      <P>It gives me and my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, great pleasure to put down this motion.  The Defence Forces have been under great <Col N="1815" /> scrutiny during the past few years. While some changes have taken place, greater change has yet to come.  We have not given defence matters the priority they deserve.  Even at Question Time we must divide time between the Marine and Defence which leaves little time to discuss the serious issues.</P>
      <P>I was born and reared in County Kildare, a county which has benefited enormously from the Army.  For many years members of the Defence Forces have played an important part in the social, cultural and sporting life of the county.  Their presence has also been of enormous benefit to the economy of County Kildare.  However, it is not the only county to have had this honour and privilege.  Many towns fortunate enough to have had an Army presence have also enjoyed these socio-economic benefits. This has helped to create an appreciation for the members of our Defence Forces.  I have always had the greatest respect for the Army; it could be depended on when the chips were down.  There could never be any doubt about its commitment, dedication and, above all, loyalty.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this loyalty was taken for granted.  Looking back to the late 1980s when there was a serious crisis in the Defence Forces, the Government did not realise there was a problem until the Army wives took to the streets in protest.  It took the participation of candidates in the general election at that time before the grievances were understood. It does not give me any pleasure to make this point, but it is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much progress has been made since. The setting up of the representative associations for members of the Defence Forces was a welcome move. For the first time members had a say in planning their futures.  I would like to pay tribute to the late Brian Lenihan for his enormous contribution to our Defence Forces.  He took over at a time when morale was low and he succeeded <Col N="1816" /> in providing major improvements in remuneration and conditions for members of the Defence Forces.  He also restored morale and gave members a new pride in their work.  We can all be grateful to Brian for his ingenuity in diffusing what was at that time a delicate situation.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 the Defence Forces have been scrutinised from every angle. Great keenness was shown in the Gleeson report because for many it was seen as providing the answers to the problems which existed at that time.  The review of the Defence Forces undertaken by the efficiency audit group has proved to be very different.  While nobody can doubt the widespread agreement on the need to restructure our Defence Forces, there is a fear in the forces that this process will become a cost cutting exercise.  That fear has been well founded.</P>
    <P>The review presented the Government with a wonderful opportunity to address many issues in the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps but that opportunity is being squandered. The redefinition of roles was necessary and reflected the changes not only on the international scene but on the home front.  I supported the review of the Defence Forces because it was necessary. In any business, it is always important to review operations and to look back to see where changes can be made.   I felt that a plan properly implemented and supported by the representative organisations would solve some of the problems which exist in the forces, namely, equipment, infrastructure, rising age profile, etc.</P>
    <P>The efficiency audit group engaged Price Waterhouse which drew up a plan for the Defence Forces with the help of military expertise.  This in turn led to the publication by the Government of the report of the implementation group. From the word go, this Government has not been honest about its real plans.  If <Col N="1817" /> we look back to one of the first interviews given by the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, it is easy to understand why members have become so sceptical of the process.  The former Minister was forced to go on air following the leaking of the Price Waterhouse report.  As other Deputies said, these leaks resulted in an unhealthy atmosphere and created a lot of the problems. During that interview the former Minister stated clearly that barracks would close.  Predictably, there was an outcry about the possibility of barrack closures. Within 24 hours his mind was changed and he issued a statement insisting that there would be no closure during the first three years of the reform process. One thing which annoys me about politicians is their inability to give bad news. Any Minister will accept that for every bit of good news they give, they must also give bad news.  The emphasis is now on public relations, perception has become more important than reality.</P>
    <P>Anyone who took the trouble to read the review of our Defence Forces will have recognised that the biggest political decision facing any Minister for Defence is the closure of barracks.  I wish to refer to the Minister's contribution to the Defence Estimates debate last week.  He said the efficiency audit group review was part of a process aimed at doing just that and that the objective of such an examination must be to enhance efficiency and effectiveness to ensure that in the years ahead the public continue to be served by professional, disciplined, well trained and appropriately organised and effective personnel.  Can this be achieved by keeping all barracks open?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Chief of Staff wrote to members.  He admitted that he is trying to defuse the morale problem in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>During last week's debate on the Estimates the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan is essentially strategic in nature and sets out the parameters and objectives within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place.  It does not attempt to go into the fine detail.  This will be worked out at a later stage when all <Col N="1819" /> current relevant factors can be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Surely there has been enough assessment of the Defence Forces to work out the fine detail or is it another case of paralysis from analysis?  Why must we wait for a later stage?  If the plan for the future of our Defence Forces is to be successfully implemented, it will require the support of all concerned.  How can we expect any of the representative bodies to support a plan when they are not sure what it contains?</P>
    <P>The accusation has been made from different quarters about the Army's reluctance to accept change.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Changes can only be made following negotiations with the representatives of the Defence Forces.  It is not good enough for the Minister to come into the House and to tell us about the number of meetings he and his officials have had with RACO, PDFORRA or anyone else if they are not prepared to listen.  These representative bodies were set up to give advice to their members and they should be listened to.  If that had been done the Minister would not be faced with the widespread anger and concern that exists in our Defence Forces today.</P>
    <P>I meet members of PDFORRA regularly and they are concerned about whether they have negotiating power and if their meetings with the Minister are simply a public relations exercise. There is no point in the Minister meeting these bodies if he will not listen to them.  It is important that they are consulted in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>An information meeting was organised in Kildare to which members of the Defence Forces were invited, as was the Minister's colleague, Deputy Dukes. The general secretary of PDFORRA was, however, instructed not to attend the meeting because it would constitute public agitation.  In the interests of good <Col N="1820" /> relations, the Minister should consider that matter.</P>

      <P>The changes that were made relate solely to personnel. Changes are badly needed in infrastructure and equipment.  The Minister will be very happy with the voluntary early <Col N="1821" /> retirement scheme, which is very much a self-financing scheme that will see a return for its money in a matter of four years.  There is no guarantee from the Minister that the savings will be reinvested in new and badly needed equipment or accommodation for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith referred to the FCA. From a small investment in this area we got tremendous value.  The FCA, which provides a voluntary service, plays a very important role in villages and towns, but it receives little recognition. I appeal to the Minister to be as generous as possible with the FCA.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's positive attitude to the Equitation School and particularly the Army bands.  I congratulate him on his recent visit to Lebanon. The members serving overseas sometimes have a difficult job and the Minister's visit was very helpful and much appreciated.  I pay tribute to all the members of the Defence Forces for their wonderful service and loyalty.  I appeal to the Minister to restore the pride and morale that previously existed in our Defence Forces.  He should ensure that the restructuring of the Defence Forces will be carried out after meaningful consultation with the representative bodies.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Power for sharing his time.  As a Deputy who represents a Border constituency, I pay tribute to the Army for its work at home and abroad, particularly in the last 25 years when it made a major contribution to the security of the State.  Its members worked very long hours in extremely difficult conditions.  They did an excellent job, working alongside the Garda whose conditions were better than those in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Smith dealt at length with structures, personnel, equipment and infrastructure and because of time constraints, I will not go into those matters in detail.  I would ask the Minister to <Col N="1822" /> ensure there is sufficient manpower in the Defence Forces so that nobody is required to work anti-social hours, as happens from time to time, particularly in the Border area.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Smith's views on the five year contract.  That is a matter that should be considered.  The conditions of Army personnel need to be addressed.  Officers who joined the Army before 1994 are entitled to serve their working career in the Army whereas under the five year contract if they do not get promotion they must leave after five years and if they get promotion they sign a further contract for seven years.  In many instances promotion is not available because of the embargo.  That is an unsatisfactory system. Will the Minister outline the rate of promotion in barracks throughout the country and say how the embargo affects promotions?</P>
    <P>I endorse the comments of Deputies Power and Smith on the need for consultation. It is unfair of the Minister and Deputy Flanagan to suggest that Deputy Power is &ldquo;whipping it up&rdquo;. There were calls for the Minister's resignation at the special delegate conference last week and Deputy Power had nothing to do with that.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the issues of barracks closures.  There is concern in every town in which there is an Army barracks about the statement that there would be no closures in the first phase. We are all aware of the social and economic implications of closures.  The needs of the Defence Forces can be equally well served in smaller as in larger towns. Successive Governments have had a policy of decentralisation, and the tendency at county level is to centralise services in the county town: this is undesirable. For example, in my constituency there was a very good Army barracks in Cootehill but that was closed and a new barracks built in Cavan town.  If only one barracks is necessary in County Cavan, the barracks in Cootehill should <Col N="1823" /> have been maintained.  The Minister should ensure that barracks are maintained and upgraded and proper facilities provided.  I would ask him to continue the building programme at Castleblayney barracks, where there is a very fine modern building.  Those actions would speak louder than words and would be a good way to show the people of the area and the officers and men in the barracks that the barracks will not be closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it clear at the outset that the plan for the outflow pipe attaching to the new sewage treatment plant proposal in Tramore, County Waterford, which exits at Sallins is unacceptable and in my view will not proceed.  The Minister may be aware that to date approximately 17,000 signatures have been collected on this issue. Those signatures were not sought; they were given voluntarily because concern about this issue has spread alarmingly throughout the greater area of Tramore, Waterford and Dunmore East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> I cannot understand the reason the Department of the Environment has not consulted Waterford County Council with regard to identifying an alternative location for this plant; alternative locations are available.  The Minister may be aware that for a number of years, since the beginning of this project, the Department of the Marine has considered the questions that arise with regard to the ecosystem in the area.  It is my understanding also that, on solid grounds, the technical staff in the Department is opposed to this proposal in the context of the outflow pipe at Sallins.</P>
    <P>Under EU Directive 92/43, which deals with habitat areas, and in the context of the area's ecosystem &mdash; it is also an SPA area &mdash; it is prohibited to locate such a development there.  Given all these factors it is surprising that the Minister for the Environment, as the guardian of the environment, has not taken a more forceful role in regard to this issue and accepted that the plan for the outflow pipe is not suitable and an alternative should be pursued.  Many people wonder why the existing pipeline is not being used, and extended, as the vehicle to convey the outflow from the new sewage treatment plant.  That seems to be a logical solution and one which would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I realise we do not have unlimited funding but if this is a matter of a small amount of money not being available, I would have expected the Minister for the Environment to put up a strong fight on the side of the environment as opposed to the financial practicalities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take note of what happened in regard to Mutton Island in Galway.  The position there may not be exactly the same as this but some of the principles involved are identical.  The Minister should learn from that, stop the prevarication and allow an extension of the old outfall pipe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The natural resources of <Col N="1825" /> Tramore are its beach, sand dunes, sand hills &mdash; better known as the Burrows &mdash; and its back strand.  We do not want the ecology of this beautiful area destroyed and this proposal may well result in that. The unanimous opinion of the people of Tramore, the area surrounding Sallins and the people of Waterford city, for whom it is a leisure area, do not want sewage to be disposed of in the area of Rinnashark Bay.  We want an extention of the old outfall pipe.</P>
      <P>We urgently need a sewerage scheme. Officials from the European Union, in particular the Commissioner in charge of the environment and ecology, should come to Tramore and see how the EU funding is being spent.  There has been a total outlay of £6.7 million and we are told it will cost a further £1.5 million if the route we are proposing is used.  I suggest it is worth that £1.5 million, and that is what should be done.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Cullen I appeal to the Minister to accept the unanimous view of the people and the environmentalists and give Tramore a first class sewage treatment plant.  He must ensure also that the amenity of the area in question is retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, is abroad on official business, and he has asked me to express his regret at being unable to respond to this motion personally.  He has asked me to reply on his behalf and to put on the record the current position, as far as the Minister is concerned, of the proposed sewerage scheme for Tramore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I should make it clear that it is incorrect to imply, as the text submitted by the Deputy appears to suggest, that the Department of the Environment is insisting on locating the outfall at a location that in some way threatens the environment.  Both the Department and Waterford County Council are fully aware of how vital it is to protect the environment at Tramore <Col N="1826" /> and the scheme as proposed by the council reflects this concern.</P>
    <P>To put the proposal and public concern about it into its correct perspective, it is important to point out that sewage in Tramore is currently collected and discharged, untreated, to the sea via a pipeline extending approximately 300 metres offshore of the main beach, which both Deputies want to protect. This is obviously unacceptable.  Besides, as the population of the town, both residential and tourist, exceeds the threshold limits of the urban waste water directive, there is now a legal obligation to provide secondary treatment.</P>
    <P>The scheme now envisaged involves the construction of a secondary treatment plant, sized to cater for a high season population of 15,000, with the final treated effluent being transferred via an 800mm storage pipeline along the northern margin of the Tramore burrow to a discharge point to the Rinnashark channel.  The proposed pipeline would run for approximately 1.5km of its 2km route beyond the high water mark with the control building buried in a sand dune.  The proposed discharge point into the Rinnashark channel is a location that is not frequented by bathers and has a fast flowing body of water on the ebb tide which would allow for good dispersion and rapid dilution. The final effluent would be clear and free from solids and other nuisances.</P>
    <P>An application for a foreshore licence to discharge at Rinnashark was made by Waterford County Council to the Department of the Marine in February 1993.  This discharge point was deemed environmentally and economically the best when an environmental impact statement was certified by the then Minister for the Environment in late 1992.  Deputy Cullen will accept the then Minister for the Environment was a member of his own party.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the EIS certification, reservations continued to be expressed about the location of the outfall and in the summer of last year, in an effort to overcome the reservations and to advance the scheme, Waterford County Council engaged consultants to undertake studies on the feasibility and desirability of adding ultraviolet disinfection facilities at the treatment works and to report back on the cost implications and possible environmental benefits if a decision were taken to proceed along these lines. Based on the consultant's report, the council decided to modify its proposal to allow for UV treatment to be added at a later stage if it were established through monitoring that it was desirable to do so.</P>
      <P>A revised foreshore licence application, including the proposal to allow for the addition of UV disinfection, was duly lodged with the Department of the Marine by Waterford County Council on 27 February last and a final decision on the application from the Minister for the Marine is awaited.</P>
      <P>Finally, I assure the House that the Minister for the Environment remains committed to seeing an environmentally acceptable sewage treatment plant provided for Tramore at the earliest possible date.  I will pass Deputy Cullen's and Deputy Deasy's strongly held views to the Minister for the Environment.  I listened to Deputy Deasy's comments about the possibility of the outfall being along the existing line.  Having read the Minister's report, the Department of the Environment and the EIS maintain that the line already agreed by the EIS appears to be the one favoured environmentally. However, I will pass on the Deputies' strongly held views to the Minister for the Environment and await the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaked Denham <Col N="1828" /> report which recommends a separate agency to manage the courts is welcome in principle, as is the statement issued by the Minister for Justice this afternoon. Separate management for the courts is a feature of other jurisdictions and has long been recommended here. A separate agency to manage the courts would undoubtedly be in a position to arrange court business far better than the Department of Justice.  It is now clear that the Department of Justice, no doubt motivated by political considerations, has avoided hard decisions in such matters as the rationalisation of court areas, the delimiting of court business, collection of fines, etc., which would have improved the efficiency of the system immeasurably.</P>
      <P>For historical reasons, the responsibility for the courts is spread over a number of different areas.  At present, the Department of Justice, the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High, Circuit and District Courts, the Office of Public Works and the local authorities are involved in court administration. This ludicrous situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>We, as a State, have allowed our court system to degenerate into a shambolic parody of a proper system.  This is particularly evident in the family law area.  For family law clients, justice is delayed and therefore denied virtually daily.  The average waiting period for a judicial separation is two years.  Family law clients are mostly women who suffer cruelly during their extended wait for justice.  Some are living in physical fear and others are suffering great mental cruelty and distress.  The damage caused to children in such relationships can be immense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the problem is not confined to the family law area.  The usual four to five year delay in non-family matters between a trial and facts which gave rise to it can result in witnesses having faulty recollection of the events on which the outcome of the trial will ultimately turn. This has undoubtedly led to a denial of justice in many cases.  I know also of many litigants who have had to avail of <Col N="1829" /> medical treatment because they were stressed out during these extended waiting periods.</P>
    <P>It would be an abuse of language to describe the physical condition of many courthouses outside Dublin as adequate or appropriate.  Most court venues outside Dublin do not have adequate space or facilities.  In many cases, opposing litigants are left sitting opposite each other on benches or in cold or draughty corridors.  Adequate facilities for consultation between lawyers and their clients are the exception rather than the rule. Many courthouses have insufficient lighting, leaking roofs, ill-fitting windows, inadequate heating and do not even have basic toilet facilities.  In many venues clients are forced to consult with their lawyers in the open air in all types of weather or, alternatively, in a crowded hallway a few feet from where the other party is consulting his or her lawyer about the same business.</P>
    <P>We must not, however, delude ourselves that a separate agency to manage the courts will of itself be a panacea. The introduction of a separate management agency for the courts, while welcome in itself, must be accompanied by a proper commitment of resources.  The creation of a separate agency to manage the Irish courts will do very little to lessen the hardship, trauma and misery which litigants are at present forced to endure unless accompanied by a proper and adequate commitment of resources.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government tonight to commit itself to provide those resources, otherwise it will continue to condemn those citizens who resort to its courts to continue to endure a situation which is not only blatantly unconstitutional but fundamentally unchristian.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Dea's favourable comments to my statement about the Government's decision, in principle, on the setting up of a courts service.  I also note with some amusement the Deputy's multiple amnesia &mdash; his party presided over <Col N="1830" /> many of the matters he raised.  The litany of conditions existing in our courthouses is one of self-blame.  The Deputy's party had the opportunity to do something about it.  I am now taking the opportunity to make some changes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts system has remained essentially the same since the foundation of the State.  The level of demands being made on it, however, has changed and increased and the system has failed in some respects to keep up with these changes.  Indeed, the ability of the courts to function as well as they have to date is due in great part to the hard work and dedication of the staff in the courts.  However, to enable the courts to meet the demands of modern litigation, I considered it necessary to have a root and branch examination of the existing system carried out to find ways to devise an overall strategy and approach for achieving a streamlined, modern, effective and economic court system.</P>
      <P>To this end, I established the Working group on a Courts Commission in November 1995 under the chairmanship of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham to review and report to me on the operation of the courts system.  The terms of reference of the working group specifically charged it to consider the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy, as envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government &mdash; A Government of Renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Working Group on a Courts Commission submitted its first report &mdash; Management and Financing of the Courts &mdash; recently.  I would like at this stage to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to Mrs. Justice Denham <Col N="1831" /> and her colleagues on the working group for their commitment and dedication in producing such a farreaching and radical report in such a short time. The report indicates serious defects in the administration of the courts and stresses the urgent need for a radical reappraisal of the administrative structures of the courts system.  I have today received Government approval for the publication of the first report and the Government has also approved in principle the primary recommendation of the report that an independent and permanent body be established to manage a unified court system; this body is to be known as the courts service and created by statute as an agency of the State.</P>
    <P>The function of the proposed courts service would be to manage the courts. It would comprise a board consisting of members of the Judiciary, representatives of those using or otherwise involved in the work of the courts and the chief executive.  The chief executive would be recruited through open public competition and will be responsible for the day to day administration of the courts and the implementation of the policy of the board.  The Minister for Justice would retain political accountability for the financial and administrative management of the courts service and the chief executive officer would prepare an annual report for the Oireachtas on financial and administrative matters and would be available to the committees of the Oireachtas on such matters.  The Minister for Justice would also retain responsibility for matters of overall policy in relation to the courts, including courts legislation, jurisdiction levels and the number and terms of appointment of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a new courts service would centralise the financial and management administration of the courts in a unified system which would focus on the provision of an efficient, effective and economic system capable <Col N="1832" /> of meeting the changing and ever increasing demands being placed on it. It would ensure that the necessary changes can be made in improving access to the courts and achieving greater flexibility in responding to the changing needs of court users.</P>
    <P>The proposed courts service complies with the principles of the separation of powers and the independence of the Judiciary.  The accountability which exists at present through the Minister for Justice to the Government and the Oireachtas will be maintained and the Government will, therefore, be in a position to ensure that public concerns in the way in which the service is operating are fully met and that the protections for the citizen, which are inherent in where there is direct ministerial accountability, are not diminished. Government control on overall budgetary allocation for the court service and Dáil scrutiny of expenditure would also be maintained.</P>
    <P>I will now be requesting the working group to submit further reports on how the establishment of the new courts service can be progressed.  The working group, of course, will continue its work in accordance with its terms of reference to review the day to day operation of the courts system and will submit further reports on various aspects of the court's operation.  This is a fundamental radical decision being taken by the Government, perhaps one that should have been taken many years ago.  There have been no changes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mobile phone coverage is at an all time low.  I ask the Minister to embark on a major upgrade of the service.  The coverage for mobile phone users has deteriorated significantly in the past six months and I wonder if the Minister and the Government are aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mobile phones are no longer the preserve of the yuppie.  They have become a tool for trades people, farmers and many other business people.  The imminent arrival of competition has had a dramatic impact on prices and mobile phones are now within the reach of many consumers.  Many new users have been disappointed at the level of service <Col N="1834" /> provided.  I have received many complaints in recent weeks concerning the delays in connection, the failure to set up the mobile messaging system and the actual coverage available.  Many of those who have complained to me and my colleagues believe there is a serious breakdown in the service, and in some areas a complete breakdown.  Coverage is extremely patchy.  Large tracts of some counties have no coverage while in many other areas the service fluctuates significantly.  Sometimes 087 users have a great subservice and at others they have no service.  For 088 users the service has also declined, particularly in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The new subscribers are the most impatient, because their telephones are not being &ldquo;switched on&rdquo;.  They went on radio recently and actively discouraged others from purchasing mobile phones because the service has deteriorated so much with a consequent effect on business.</P>
    <P>This new generation of mobile phone user has become a liability for Eircell. The recent push to make sales, without matching it with service has been counterproductive for the company. Existing customers and the new subscribers are, in short, fed up with the existing level of service and are demanding change.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to undertake an urgent review of the coverage for the mobile phone users, the extent of the coverage and the regular breakdowns, particularly in the 087 service. There is a need to ensure that the new operator coming into the market will offer good coverage and will match the supply with the service.  I also ask the Minister to examine the price of mobile phone telephone calls which, despite the eminence of competition, continue at an excessively high level for many small companies and individuals who use the service in their everyday lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for raising this matter.  The invitation for applications for the second GSM telephone licence identified a minimum coverage requirement which the successful applicant would have to achieve within four years of the issue of the licence; this minimum was set at 90 per cent of the population. Applicants for the licence were invited to submit proposals to exceed this minimum requirement.  In the case of the successful applicant &mdash; ESAT Digifone &mdash; proposals for coverage and rollout exceeded the target set by my Department both in terms of the extent of coverage and the time frame in which it was to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its application, ESAT Digifone also gave commitments in relation to the quality of the service to be provided which would ensure that the promise to achieve coverage was not of a minimal nature, but was one of substance and quality.  Coverage and service quality <Col N="1836" /> commitments included in the application have now been included in the licence signed last week.  Compliance with the licence will be monitored by the Department and, when appropriate, by the telecommunications regulator.</P>
    <P>I note the Deputy broadened slightly his case from that which had been put down on the Adjournment.  I realise I have answered only one part of the case he made here but I have answered in full the case listed on the Adjournment which was that the Deputy wanted to ensure that the second mobile telephone operator delivered good coverage. I hope I have answered that point specifically.  I will refer the other points directly to the Minister, Deputy Lowry.</P>

      <P>Total exports to Germany came to £3.2 billion in 1994, an increase of 22.7 per cent on 1993.  Provisional CSO figures for January-November 1995 indicate further growth in exports to Germany of more than 20 per cent over the same period in 1994.  An Bord Tráchtála estimates for 1995 indicate growth of 24 per cent in exports from the indigenous sector of the economy.</P>

    <P>While some products from Eastern Europe will undoubtedly compete with ours in parts of the Single Market, it must be borne in mind that in return Irish exporters will have access to the rapidly growing markets of Eastern Europe which offer excellent potential <Col N="1523" /> for our exporters for the future.  The EU has power, of course, to adopt appropriate safeguard measures, such as antidumping duties, against imports from Eastern Europe found to be competing unfairly with Community, including Irish, products.</P>

      <P>A total of £220,000 was made available through my Department's Vote for 1995 and 1996 towards the cost of transforming, by the year 2000, the national St. Patrick's Day parade, which takes place annually in Dublin, into a major international festival helping to attract increasing levels of overseas visitors to Ireland.  No other provision was made in the Vote specifically for St. Patrick's Day activities.</P>
      <P>This year's national St. Patrick's Day parade was the subject of widespread international media interest, including extended coverage on CNN and SKY worldwide networks.  Also in attendance were visiting crews from TV companies from Germany, Italy and Japan to cover St. Patrick's Day in Ireland generally and the event in particular.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is to encourage growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods and a range of specific policy measures and targets have been included in the programme towards that end.  The programme is geared towards the provision <Col N="1526" /> of new or improved tourism facilities and attractions capable of operating on a year round basis, with support for related marketing activities.  Many examples of such projects are contained in the annual reports of the management boards, copies of which are placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the number of off-peak tourists is estimated to have increased by 18 per cent, a full three percentage points ahead of overall tourist growth for the year.  The aim by the end of the programme is to have 75 per cent of visitors arriving in the off-peak periods.</P>
    <P>The special joint home holidays initiative for the tourism industry, which I announced on 22 February, also aims to encourage increased off-peak business from the domestic market.  Moreover, the new Tourism Council, which is chaired by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, has tabled an in-depth review of the seasonality issue for its next meeting in June when I look forward, in particular, to hearing the views of industry on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Development Plan 1994-99 set out the Government's intention to maintain a strategy of tourism co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland aimed at generating new business for the benefit of the tourism sector, North and South.  Central to this strategy was the development of cross-Border amenities and the joint marketing of the island of Ireland as a quality tourist destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy was subsequently embodied in the Community Support Framework 1994-99 and other EU Initiatives such as the Ireland/Northern <Col N="1527" /> Ireland INTERREG Programme 1994-99 and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 1995-99.</P>
    <P>The most important recent manifestation of the commitment to cross-Border co-operation is the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, OTMI, which in 1996 involves expenditure of £6.5 million.  The OTMI is a consumer advertising campaign involving a partnership between the tourism industry and the State sector, North and South, and promotes the island of Ireland as a single holiday destination in each of our four major markets, namely the US, Britain, France and Germany.</P>
    <P>Other smaller scale promotional activities involving close co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board include a joint marketing campaign in Holland and all island promotional stands at major trade and consumer shows around the world.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Operational Programme for Tourism and the EU Initiatives already mentioned afford opportunities for local product suppliers on both sides of the Border to initiate and develop a wide range of tourism products on a cross-Border basis.  Examples include walking and cycling routes, equestrian trails, waterways development and touring routes.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, happy that the commitment to cross-Border co-operation outlined in the National Development Plan is progressing at a significant pace and I can assure the Deputy that there will be no lack of willingness on our part to encourage and support further cooperative activities.  The development of closer working relationships between Ministers, Departments and tourism agencies, North and South, will be a continuing objective of mine for the future.  I believe that by co-operating together and through pooling our resources, we can help to increase our impact in the marketplace and thereby deliver substantial growth to the tourism industry in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The European Commission presented its market access discussion document entitled <i>The Global Challenge of International Trade: A Market Access Strategy for the European Union</i> in February of this year.  The document suggests a sharper focus on market access by the Union, with action being taken both bilaterally and multilaterally. It has been the subject of detailed discussion at trade official level in the context of meetings of the Article 113 Committee, composed of representatives from all member states, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>We welcome the document, particularly as it suggests what the Union should seek from the World Trade Organisation ministerial conference to be held in Singapore in December 1996 during our Presidency of the Union. More detailed papers on the various issues likely to figure on the Singapore agenda are expected from the Commission soon.</P>
      <P>The document signals the Commission's view that the Union's trade policy has not to consider the opening of markets, resulting from the Uruguay Round and other developments, as a threat which it has to defend itself against, but as an opportunity to seize. As a small country dependent on trade, I believe that Ireland stands to gain from such an approach.</P>

Other organisations with which contact is maintained include the Ireland-US Council for Commerce and Industry, the Irish-American Partnership, the Irish Chamber of Commerce in the US, the Irish Business Organisation of New York and numerous others which operate on a regional basis.</P>

      <P>Promotion of tourist use of marinas and harbour facilities is a matter for the operators of such facilities working with the relevant regional tourism body and with Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Since 1993 marinas have been actively promoted by the Sailing Product Marketing Group, one of 19 product marketing groups which Bord Fáilte helped to establish with the long-term aim of carrying out sustainable, effective marketing for its product sector.</P>
      <P>I understand that, with the assistance of European Regional Development Fund marketing funding from the Operational Programme for Tourism, the Sailing Product Marketing Group promote their facilities at major boat and yachting shows in London, Birmingham, Dusseldorf and Paris.  The marinas currently promoted by the group include: Howth and Malahide in County Dublin; Carlingford in County Louth; Castlepark, Crosshaven, Baltimore and Kinsale in County Cork and Kilrush in County Clare.</P>
      <P>Another product marketing group, Cruise Ireland, comprising port authorities, shipping agents and ground handlers, established in partnership with Bord Fáilte, promotes Irish ports and harbours to the cruise liner industry worldwide.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile the Minister continues to liaise on the problem with his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice, and will continue to do so as necessary.</P>

      <P>The recent White Paper <i>Challenges and Opportunities Abroad</i> contained a summary of our trade policy and characterised it as export led growth through:</P>
      <P>&mdash; improving and expanding access to markets through multilateral and bilateral negotiations,</P>
      <P>&mdash; supporting effective promotional programmes and structures for marketing,</P>
      <P>&mdash; ensuring the necessity for exporters to maintain competitiveness is factored into Government policies impacting on business cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numerous sources and studies testify to the strength of our trade performance in recent years based on this policy and the resultant employment growth.  EU <Col N="1536" /> co-funded expenditures of almost £450 million over the six year period 1994-99 under the sub-programme for market development on a range of promotional activities will serve to further underpin the success of this policy.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to publish a further, separate White Paper on trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 73, and 74 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the overall co-ordination of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99.  The operational programme for which the Minister for Local Development at this Department, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has special responsibility comprises three main sub-programmes &mdash; local enterprise, implemented by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas, implemented by Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd., and urban and village renewal, implemented by the Department of the Environment.  The following co-ordination structures are in place;</P>
      <P>My Department chairs a monitoring committee for the operational programme. This comprises representatives from the European Commission, Government Departments the social partners, the intermediary body &mdash; ADM and sectoral, voluntary and community bodies.  When the finalised urban operational programme is in place, a monitoring committee will be established for this also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering group on technical assistance, also chaired by my Department, meets regularly to co-ordinate technical assistance for the implementation of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.  This group comprises representatives of the <Col N="1541" /> Department of the Taoiseach, the implementing bodies for the operational programme and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department chairs an interdepartmental policy committee on local development, which meets on a monthly basis to review progress on the implementation of the Local Development Programme, to identify issues of common concern to Departments, to agree how they should be progressed and to ensure effective interdepartmental co-ordination on local development issues.</P>
    <P>County strategy groups have been established in each county to ensure effective co-ordination of these local development initiatives, as well as the Leader initiative.  These groups are supported by a liaison team based in my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to the operational programme, a number of other local development matters are co-ordinated by my Department.  Earlier this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, was asked to examine funding arrangements in the Border counties, an area which suffers from disadvantage.  I understand that a task force which the Minister of State chairs will report on this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister of State coordinates the Government's support for development of the western region, which includes:</P>
    <P>(i)  the co-ordination of the Government's response to the proposals made in the action plan of the Western Development Partnership Board;</P>
    <P>(ii)  chairing the interdepartmental policy committee on island development which was established to provide an integrated Government framework to support the development of an improvement of living conditions on offshore islands;</P>
    <P>(iii)  overseeing the work of the steering group established in my <Col N="1542" /> Department to review the development and implementation of a pilot programme for the provision of public services in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The number of area partnership boards operating under sub-programme 2 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development will be 38.  The locations of the 36 partnerships which have opened offices are shown at annex 1.  Two others, Galway County and Cavan, will open offices shortly.</P>
    <P>I am advised by ADM Ltd. that allocations have been made to 15 partnerships to date on the basis of plans submitted and approved.  As set out at annex 2, a total of £40,587,071 has been allocated to these partnership companies in respect of expenditure from 1995 to 1999.  It should be noted that the operational programme was not finalised until late 1994 and there were, therefore, no allocations for that year. The remaining 23 partnerships will submit plans for appraisal over the coming months.  A list of partnerships which have not yet had their action plans appraised but which have received technical assistance/interim funding is included at annex 2.</P>
    <P>The evaluation procedures followed by ADM in respect of plans submitted by partnerships can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>Each partnership produces a development plan for its area based on consultation with local communities and prioritising the specific needs of the locality. The plan must contain detailed costings of proposed actions.  It should also be specifically targeted towards the most disadvantaged groups within the area i.e. the unemployed, travellers, single parents, the disabled.  The plan is submitted for appraisal by ADM, which has available the services of independent evaluators.  It is evaluated by the appraisal sub-committee which makes a recommendation to the ADM board based on agreed criteria.  When an allocation is agreed by the board of ADM, <Col N="1543" /> the partnership's implementation programme is subject to ongoing monitoring, review and audit.  Furthermore, the external evaluator appointed to report on the entire operational programme, monitors progress on sub-programme 2.</P>
    <P>A revised operational programme for the URBAN Initiative has been submitted to the European Commission and it is expected that this will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The European Union URBAN Initiative is intended to help find solutions to the serious social problems caused by the crisis in many depressed urban areas.  This is to be achieved through supporting schemes for economic and social revitalisation, the renovation of facilities and infrastructures and environmental improvement.</P>
    <P>A sum of 15.5 million ECU, around £12.5 million, has been made available to Ireland under the initiative in the period to 1999.  Co-financing of approximately 5 million ECU, £4 million, will be provided by the Exchequer.  Agreement has been reached between the European Commission and Government that URBAN would apply in three areas &mdash; Cork northside and the Dublin areas of West Tallaght-Clondalkin and Finglas-Ballymun-Darndale.  No individual allocations have been made to date.</P>

      <P>This regulation is an important element in EU support for the promotion of environmentally sustainable development in the developing world and provides a legal basis for expenditure by the European Union on the sustainable management and conservation of tropical forests.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the regulation, the Union will provide financial support or technical expertise for operations which support and encourage the efforts of the developing countries and their regional organisations to conserve and sustainably manage their tropical forests, in the context of the sustainable development of those countries and regions.</P>
      <P>European Union policy on the development aspects of tropical forest management was set out in a Council Resolution of May 1990.  This regulation brings up to date elements of that Resolution in the light of subsequent developments, including the Conventions on Climate Change and Biodiversity and the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development.</P>

      <Col N="1551" /> The European Commission is currently undertaking an evaluation of the environmental aspects of Union development assistance and a draft Resolution on Environmental Impact Assessment in Development Co-operation is at present before the Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the terms of the regulation on tropical forests.  There are no direct policy implications for this country and actions financed under its terms will be complementary to the actions of member states in this area. Through participation on the management committees examining proposals for Union actions in this area, Ireland will monitor the implementation of the regulation and make, as appropriate, proposals for action.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent announcement by the British Home Secretary that evidence of contamination has been found at the Forensics Explosives Laboratory, at Fort Halstead, Kent.

      <P>I am aware of one Irish citizen who was recently refused permission to travel from Hong Kong to China because he did not have a visa.  The Chinese immigration authorities sometimes allow people to travel to China from Hong Kong and obtain visas at the airport on arrival.  In the case in question, however, the pages in the passport of the Irish citizen in which a visa would normally be stamped were full.  He sought the assistance of the Honorary Consul in Hong Kong who gave him a letter stating that a visa could be placed on the &ldquo;observations&rdquo; page of his passport. I understand, on that basis, he was allowed to travel to China.</P>

      <P>On my instructions, the matter of reopening that portion which lies in Northern Ireland was raised through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  I was informed that the delay in its reopening had occurred due to the wish of the landowner in question not to reopen this laneway and I understand that there were contacts regarding this crossing involving the British authorities, Derry City Council and the landowner.  We were advised through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat at the time that it was hoped to have bollards obstructing it removed and the crossing reopened within a few weeks.</P>
      <P>I have pursued the matter through the Secretariat and I am pleased to report that the crossing in question was in fact reopened on 7 May 1996.</P>
      <P>As regards the broader issue of re-opening Border crossings, the ongoing programme of reopenings in operation in both jurisdictions since the announcement of the lifting of all Border road closure orders in mid-October 1994 continues to make good progress.  The most recent information to hand indicates that this project is now almost 95 per cent complete.  I hope to see the remaining work completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Measure 1 is concerned with business and cultural linkages and is being administered on both sides of the Border by an intermediary funding body, Co-operation North, in association with IBEC and the CBI.

      <P>It is established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about an individual taxpayer's tax affairs, other than when the Deputy asking the question was acting on behalf of the taxpayer.  In this instance it is not clear that the Deputy is asking the question with the consent of the company concerned.  In the circumstances, therefore, I regret that I must accept the advice of the Revenue Commissioners that the information sought should not be divulged on grounds of confidentiality.  I should add that the case in question is still <i>sub judice</i> in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on the general issue, the Commissioners have confirmed to me that they do on occasions advance funds to liquidators in the winding up of companies. This is generally done in cases where preliminary inquiries by the liquidator suggest with some certainty that evasion of taxes may have occurred, e.g. through fraudulent trading or some other wrongful acts by the directors of the company, but where the funds remaining in the company are not sufficient to fund the cost of further inquiries by the liquidator.  Such funding is provided by Revenue in the expectation <Col N="1560" /> that proceedings by the liquidator against the directors or other agents of the company will realise a sum sufficient to meet any taxes evaded together with the liquidator's costs.  In these cases the amount of tax evaded will normally only be quantifiable when the liquidator has completed his investigation.</P>

    <P>A large number of rates apply to customs duties and an estimate of the yield to the Exchequer from applying a 1 per cent increase to each rate could be supplied only at disproportionate cost.  The budget estimate for customs duties in 1996 is £201 million and an increase of 1 per cent on this basis would produce a yield of £2 million.  However, as 90 per cent of the customs intake each year forms part of Ireland's contribution to EU own resources, only 10 per cent of this additional yield, about £0.2 million, would be retained by the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(1)  The figure of yield shown for income tax is based on increasing the current rates of 27 per cent and 48 per cent to 28 per cent and 49 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>(2)  The figure of yield for VAT is based on increasing the standard rate of 21 per cent to 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>(3)  The figure of yield for excise is based on an increase of 1 per cent in the specific duties per volume applicable to most excisable commodities together with an increase of 1 percentage point in the ad valorem rates applying to certain other goods such as cigarettes and for most of the vehicle registration tax categories.</P>
    <P>(4)  The figure of yield for corporation tax is based on increasing the standard rate of 38 per cent to 39 per cent.</P>

    <P>I stress that the figures relate only to cases where formal recourse to the relevant powers was necessary.  In this context the Commissioners' experience has been that, in most cases, co-operation from taxpayers as regards provision of information and access to records is forthcoming with the result that the Commissioners do not have to consider formally using the powers in question. In fact, between 1994 and 1995 the Commissioners undertook 51,762 tax audits of various kinds and as can be inferred from the statistics above, it was possible to resolve almost all of these cases with the co-operation of taxpayers and using only very basic powers as distinct from the non-routine powers referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Finally, the fact that these powers are available must be a consideration in Revenue's success in promoting voluntary compliance and, of course, they are essential for dealing with the small minority who seek to evade their obligations and do not wish to co-operate with Revenue requirements.</P>

      <P>The additional EU funding provided to support the Northern Ireland peace process covers the following broad themes:</P>
      <P>urban and rural regeneration employment cross-Border development social inclusion productive investment and industrial development</P>
      <P>The total EU funding available to the initiative is 300 million ECU over three years.  At least 20 per cent of this funding will be available for the six Border counties.  Funding over a further two year period will be subject to a review of the situation by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort has been made to ensure that, wherever possible, actions under the programme will be &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; and that local groups have the maximum <Col N="1570" /> input into the delivery of the programme. The bulk of the programme, therefore, is being delivered by intermediary bodies funded by way of global grants.  Sub-programme 2 &mdash; Urban and Rural Development &mdash; will be delivered by way of county council-led task forces. The programme will therefore be distinctively different from any of the other programmes and has but the minimum involvement of Government Departments in the direct allocation of funding to beneficiaries.  The Government is, of course, committed to providing any matching funding required and appropriate from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is responsible (jointly with the Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland) for the overall co-ordination and management of the programme.  It is directly responsible for funding provided under the technical assistance to support the intermediary funding bodies and other actions supporting the overall delivery of the programme. Total public funding available to Ireland under this provision is 1.248 million ECU (IR£0.9984).</P>
    <P>Measure five of the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation provides for subsidised loans to SMEs in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Sligo.  The fund is divided 80:20 between Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The scheme is expected to provide in the region of IR£30 million capital with a 4 per cent interest subsidy for up to five years to SMEs in the Border counties operating in the industrial, related services and tourism sectors.</P>
    <P>2.  The scheme is being administered by the European Investment Bank (EIB) operating through the following financial intermediaries: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank, ACC, ICC and Equity Bank.</P>
    <P>Agents have also been appointed on each side of the Border to review applications for compliance with the criteria and priorities of the scheme, to establish monitoring and reporting systems etc. <Col N="1571" /> KPMG has been appointed as Agent for the border counties of Ireland until April 1997.</P>
    <P>The scheme was negotiated by the Department of Finance (in view of its responsibility for Ireland's relations with the European Investment Bank) in close consultation with Enterprise and Employment.  It is now envisaged that the Department of Enterprise and Employment will take responsibility for the scheme in view of its responsibility for the SME sector.</P>
    <P>As of 15 May 1996, 86 applications had been received for a total interest subsidy of IR£3.4 million.  These applications are currently under examination by KPMG but the likelihood is that the vast majority will be approved.  This represents approximately 2/3 of the subsidy available and 64 per cent of applications <Col N="1572" /> are in the tourism sector, 33 per cent in industry and the remainder in industry related services.  It is envisaged that the investment supported will result in 966 jobs being created/secured.  If demand for the scheme continues as strongly as at present it is envisaged that the fund will be exhausted by the end of the summer.</P>

    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that £270,507 was expended in 1995 on various advertising campaigns which would form part of my Department's on-going health promotion activities. The bulk of this expenditure would relate to production costs and media. Details of this expenditure are: Dental Health, £12,500; Smoking Studies, £63,517; Aids Campaign, £194,490.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Eastern Health Board currently has the services of one consultant orthodontist who also provides services to the Dublin Dental Hospital.

The health board is also renewing efforts to recruit a third consultant orthodontist on a whole-time basis.</P>
      <P>The difficulties heretofore experienced by the Eastern Health Board in retaining the services of a consultant orthodontist on a whole-time basis has delayed the full development by the board of a consultant-led orthodontic service as outlined in the dental health action plan.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A number of developments have already taken place at the Breast Clinic in St. Vincent's Hospital and further improvements, both in the short-term and the long-term, are also planned.  Up to last year only one clinic per week was held each Friday morning. In response to the number of patients attending this clinic, a second clinic was introduced each Friday afternoon which has impacted favourably on waiting times.  In addition the hospital have been in contact with general practitioners as part of ongoing educational exchange of information to ensure that the level of inappropriate referrals to the clinic is reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short-term, I was also pleased to direct funds from the development moneys allocated to the hospital this year to allow the hospital to introduce a pilot scheme where a nurse led clinic would be held once a week to deal with return patients who would not necessarily require to be seen by a consultant. Having been in close contact with the <Col N="1581" /> hospital regarding developments at the clinic, I was pleased, last week, to allocate further funding to the hospital to allow additional consultant led clinics to be introduced in the near future.  Again it is intended that these clinics would be focused on return patients.  The additional clinics to be introduced this year will have a significant impact on waiting times for patients attending the hospital's Breast Clinic.</P>
    <P>I should stress, however, that my intention is that the St. Vincent's clinic should be a model for the development of breast clinics elsewhere but cannot substitute for the provision of these services on a regional basis.  The regional development of clinics would also ensure that the service would be close to the women who avail of them.  I am asking the hospital management and clinicians involved to use their experience to assist colleagues around the country to achieve this aim of a locally based service.</P>
    <P>In the long-term the Deputy will be aware that I visited the hospital last week to announce a major capital development at the hospital which will cost approximately £33 million.  This development will have a major impact on services in the hospital and, as part of this development, it is planned to restructure day care services, including those relating to the Breast Clinic.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures outlined above will significantly improve services at the Breast Clinic and I would also reiterate the point that the clinic at St. Vincent's is intended to operate on a regional basis and should not be viewed as a national referral centre as indicated in the Deputy's question.</P>

    <P>The hospital authorities have assured me that the complications to which the Deputy is referring did not arise as the result of under-funding but were due to administrative difficulties beyond the hospital's control in arranging for the <Col N="1583" /> rescheduling of consultant sessions between the Adelaide and a number of other agencies.</P>
    <P>This matter has now been resolved and the expectation is that the new consultant will take up his post at the hospital around July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): On March 4 1994 the then Minister for Health established an expert group with the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;I To examine and report to the Minister for Health on the following matters:</P>
      <P>(a) All the circumstances surrounding the infection of the Anti-D Immunoglobulin product manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board;</P>
      <P>(b) The systems and standards in place for donor selection, the manufacturing process and use of the Anti-D Immunoglobulin produced by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
      <P>II To make recommendations to the Minister for Health on the above matters and any other matters relating to the Blood Transfusion Service Board which the group consider necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group on the BTSB carried out its work by meeting relevant individuals and groups and by requesting relevant documentation.  It <Col N="1584" /> requested meetings with interested parties and, in a small number of instances, individuals approached the group for a meeting.  In addition, it wrote on a number of occasions to the then Chief Medical Consultant and the then Chief executive Officer of the BTSB for information on specific issues.  Where additional queries arose, the group invited individuals for further discussions. The expert group did not seek each and every document in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>The expert group held its meetings and examined documentation between March, 1994 and early January, 1995.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group was published by the Government on 5 April 1995.</P>

      <P>Funds totalling some £21 million have been approved or earmarked to date in respect of projects supported by Structural Funds under Measure I of the Sub Programme 1 (Natural/Cultural <Col N="1596" /> Tourism) of the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999. Included in this funding are developments of major regional cultural projects at Galway Theatre, Longford Theatre, the Hunt Museum in Limerick and the Crawford Gallery, Cork totalling some £5.3 million.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme operated under this measure, I have to date approved in principle the funding of eight projects which &mdash; will involve investments of almost £8 million and, subject to satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues, grant offers totalling just over £5.5 million in EU and Exchequer funding towards these projects will be made.  I expect to be in a position to approve in principle the bulk of the balance of the funding available under this particular scheme in the near future with the remainder to be allocated under a final call for applications to be announced later.</P>
      <P>The national cultural institutions will also benefit from allocations under this Measure.  In the case of the Chester Beatty Library, some £3 million has been expended in the restoration and extension of the Clock Tower at Dublin Castle to house these collections.  I have also given approval in principle for funds of £7.5 million in EU an allocation towards the construction of a major extension to the National Gallery of Ireland which is estimated to cost £12.5 million.  The balance of the cost will be raised by the gallery itself.</P>
      <P>I envisage that the remainder of the funds available under this measure will be allocated to major projects such as the National Museum at Collins Barracks, the National Library, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Concert Hall etc.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the provisions of traffic signs on the national road network is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for signposting on non-national roads is a matter for each local road authority; funding of such signs falls to be met from road authorities' own resources, which are supplemented by the annual discretionary grants provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>As a means of improving signposting in tourist areas, in particular, special grants totalling £650,000 were paid by my Department to local authorities between 1987 and 1994 to supplement their own expenditure on the provision of road signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a special grant of £150,000 was allocated in 1995 under the DTI traffic management grants scheme to improve directional signage <Col N="1607" /> related to Dublin Airport and the ferry-ports. The provisions of additional funding under this scheme in 1996 and future years is a matter for the Dublin Transportation Office to whom the administration of the scheme has been devolved.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive traffic signs manual, setting out the standards required for all types of road signs, is being prepared at present by my Department for use by road authorities.  This will help to ensure that there is uniformity of practice in the provision of signs on all classes of roads.  I intend to launch the manual as soon as possible and I am confident that it will lead to significant improvements in traffic signage througout the country.</P>

      <P>The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community recommended the establishment of an independent statutory Traveller Accommodation Agency.  As I indicated in my statement on the report in the Dáil on 23 April 1996, such an agency would conflict with Government policy on devolving functions to local authorities and, accordingly the Government decided on an alternative approach involving the establishment of a special traveller accommodation unit in the Department of the Environment.  The functions of the new unit, which has now been established, include the preparation and enactment of new and amending legislation; overseeing and monitoring the preparation and implementation of local traveller accommodation programmes and their co-ordination into a national programme for traveller accommodation; and servicing the proposed statutory national traveller accommodation consultative group.</P>

    <P>The increased incidence of fish kills recorded in 1995, which occurred despite intensive efforts at prevention undertaken by local authorities at my request, was contributed to by low river flows due to the prolonged spell of dry weather, together with high water temperatures. A fuller anlaysis of the factors responsible in that year is set out in the Marine Institute's report on &ldquo;Fish Kills in 1994 and 1995&rdquo;, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 114 of 8 May 1996 which indicated <Col N="1615" /> that the Environmental Protection Agency has commissioned a comprehensive project on waste statistics and on the creation of a national database on waste.  This will facilitate the updating and expansion of information on Irish wastes.  I understand that the project is at an advanced stage and that the agency expect to be in a position to publish a report in the near future.</P>
      <P>The most recent waste statistics available to my Department are contained in the strategy document <i>Recycling for Ireland</i> and indicate that 114,811 tonnes of plastic packaging waste and 31,286 tonnes of ferrous metal packaging waste arose in 1993.  The Environmental protection Agency report <i>State of the Environment in Ireland</i> (April 1996) estimates that approximately 500 million plastic bags per annum are used in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's Estimate for the current year provides for an expenditure of £6.5 million which will be cofinanced by the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties.</P>
      <P>This expenditure will be used to assist the improvement of national roads (£2.5 million &mdash; Aghalane Bridge and approaches); non-national roads (£0.5 million &mdash; applications for suitable projects from the relevant local authorities are being evaluated at present); and urban and rural regeneration (£3.5 million &mdash; projects will be selected by local authority led task forces).</P>
      <P>My Department will issue guidelines on eligible urban/rural regeneration projects to the task forces in the near future, and this will enable them to commence work.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the application referred to will be a matter for the Donegal task force.  My Department will forward the application to this task force when the guidelines are being issued.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>The Education Bill will provide, as one of its basic principles, that children with special needs are entitled to an education.  The boards will be charged with a statutory obligation to promote equality of access to and participation in education.  As part of this arrangement, the boards will be required to provide the necessary support services to schools, including the necessary technical aid and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also intended that education boards will be required to develop short-term and longer-term plans for their regions and that these plans will <Col N="1628" /> include a statement of objectives with respect to children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The above developments will be supported by a structure which envisages a continuum of provision to allow special needs children access to a full range of special support services in their own areas.  Services will range from special schools, through special classes, to full integration, if necessary on a supported basis.  As part of this arrangement, a number of ordinary primary schools will be designated by the education boards as centres where students with particular disabilities may be educated.  In addition, the existing special schools will fulfil an expanded role in dealing with a variety of disabilities and as regional resource centres.</P>
    <P>The measures set out in the White Paper and those proposed under the Education Bill are the product of a comprehensive consultation process which involved many groups and individuals, including representatives of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Many of the White Paper proposals concerning educational choice for children with disabilities were contained in the report of the Special Education Review Committee.  This committee received 186 submissions from organisations and individuals representing people with disabilities, their families and people working with special needs children.  I will arrange for my Department to forward to the Deputy a list of these organisations and individuals.</P>
    <P>The National Education Convention which took place in Dublin Castle from 11 to 21 October 1993 brought together representatives from various organisations to engage in structured and sustained discussion on key issues of education policy in Ireland.  The convention was a very significant element of the wide-ranging consultative process on the Green Paper, <i>Education For A Changing World.</i> In my closing address to the Covention, I stated that I would rely on its outcomes when determining the shape of the White Paper and the Education Act.</P>

      <P>The allocation of clerical staff in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme wide basis.  My Department has sanctioned a total of 19.5 clerical staff whole time equivalents for the County Donegal Vocational <Col N="1631" /> Education Committee.  It is a matter for the vocational education committee to redeploy existing staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of its schools.  In accordance with the Government decision of 6 June 1995 on Public Service employment, which also applies to the vocational education committees, no additional posts over and above those in place on the 6 June 1995 can be created.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of upgrading an officer from clerical officer, grade 3 to assistant staff officer, grade 4, the position is that the grading structure in schools and community colleges in the vocational education committee sector is a matter for determination under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for clerical and administrative staff.  In December 1995 IMPACT, which represents school secretaries, submitted a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the regrading of school secretaries nationally.  As agreed with the union this claim falls to be processed under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> As the claim is a matter for negotiation with the union concerned it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on any issue encompassed by the claim.</P>

      <P>The decision to refuse grant assistance towards the cost of providing parking facilities and a lay-by at the school referred to by the Deputy was made because the funds available this year for improvement works of this nature are fully committed.  However, <Col N="1632" /> my Department is introducing a new grant scheme in January 1997 to cater for improvement works and it is open to the school authorities to expend this grant on these works.  My Department has conveyed this option to the school authorities.</P>

    <P>I am not aware of schools paying examination entry fees on behalf of candidates. In this connection, my Department operates a scheme for alleviation of fees in the case of necessitous pupils. A total of £500,000 was allocated to schools for this purpose in respect of the 1996 examinations.  This was an increase of 25 per cent over 1995.</P>
    <P>School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of the scheme, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of: unemployment; prolonged illness of parent; large family with inadequate means; single parent; more than one child doing the certificate examinations, and other circumstances which would denote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
    <P>Fees are charged on the basis that it is not considered unreasonable that people should be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of running the certificate examinations.  In 1995 the total amount collected in examination entry fees was £6.325 million.  The total amount spent by the Department, mostly on the remuneration of examiners and superintendents was in excess of £13 million.</P>

      <P>The staffing schedule for national schools for the 1996-97 school year will be unchanged from the existing schedule.  However, I have indicated that no two teacher school which would have lost a teacher under the schedule will do so.</P>
      <P>Permanent teachers, who occupy posts which will be suppressed at the end of the current school year due to declining enrolments, will be deployed through the panel system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware of my record on, and commitment to, alleviating education disadvantage.  This year, I have decided that I will use surplus posts to implement the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre report on new measures to break the cycle of education disadvantage.  One very substantial recommendation which will be implementing is the allocation of additional teaching resources to most disadvantaged schools in the primary system, both urban and rural.</P>
      <P>Since the selection of schools has not yet commenced, it is not possible to identify accurately at this stage the number of posts required to implement these initiatives.</P>
      <P>In addition, surplus posts will be used to extend the substitute supply panel scheme.  This scheme, which I initiated in 1993, provides cover for teachers on absences of short duration.</P>
      <P>The pupil teacher ratio has been significantly improved since I came into office.  I am confident that the measures which I have detailed above will further assist this position for the 1996-97 school year.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached a high priority to improving the quality and level of support services available to children with special educational <Col N="1641" /> needs, including those who are integrated in mainstream schools.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that substantial progress has been achieved in this area. Measures which I have introduced include: the appointment of an additional 241 remedial teachers at primary level bringing the total now in place nationwide to 1,188 and the appointment of an additional 29 resource teachers in ordinary primary schools bringing the total number of resource teachers to 26.</P>
      <P>The remedial and resource teachers are a key support service for pupils with special needs who have been integrated into ordinary schools.  In addition, children with specific disabilities such as hearing impairment, visual impairment and Down's Syndrome also have access to the visiting teacher service.  There are 38 teachers employed in this service at present.</P>
      <P>The measures set out in the White Paper in relation to special needs pupils are intended to refine and develop the current range of responses.  A key objective will be to ensure that all children with special educational needs will have access to the necessary range of support services in their own areas.

    <P>In its report, the review committee put forward a series of principles to serve as basic guidelines for the future <Col N="1642" /> development of education services for special needs children.</P>
    <P>Among these principles was the view that a continuum of service should be provided for children with special eduational needs ranging from full-time education in ordinary classes, with additional supports as may be necessary, to full-time education in special schools. The committee also recommended that, except where individual circumstances make this impracticable, appropriate education for all children with special educational needs should be provided in ordinary schools.</P>
    <P>The measures set out in the White Paper concerning the education of special needs children, including those with Down's Syndrome, reflect the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee.  The Review Committee received 186 submissions from organisations and individuals representing people with disabilities.  Several of these submissions were from groups representing Down's Syndrome children.</P>

      <P>A total of 90 Irish prisoners in British prisons have applied for or expressed an interest in transferring to Ireland under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995.  Twenty-nine of these applications have been formally transmitted by the UK authorities to date.  Of this number, seven were transmitted on 21 December 1995, nine on 1 March 1996, five on 18 March 1996 and eight on 4 April 1996.  I have been in a position to give my formal consent to five of these applications.  The remaining applications are currently under examination in my Department, some in further consultation with the Home Office and others in consultation with various other offices here, including the Chief State Solicitor's office.  One of the applicants, whose transfer I consented to, arrived back in the State last week and another applicant is due to transfer today.  The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Convention the two States involved in processing a transfer request are required to exchange extensive information relating to the prisoner.  The information in question includes particulars of the offence, court warrants, sentence administration particulars, etc.  Owing to the complexity of documentation <Col N="1655" /> required and the fact that some of the documentation is old &mdash; in one case going back 20 years &mdash; the process of information exchange is not one which can always be completed quickly.</P>

      <P>The allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>The Rathcoole sub-district includes the villages of Saggart, Brittas and Newcastle as well as Rathcoole.  I understand that the Garda authorities are satisfied that the incorporation of the Rathcoole area in its present division provides adequate and effective policing for the area.  It is administered from the district headquarters at Naas, which is only eight miles away on the dual carriageway. They are not persuaded that the incorporation of the Rathcoole area into the DMA would offer any operational advantages and they do not, therefore, propose to take up the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <P>It might be of assistance to the Deputy and the person referred to if I outline the procedures involved in processing an application for naturalisation. Soon after the application is received, the documents submitted with each application (passport, birth certificate etc.) are examined, verified, and where all is in order, the original documents are returned to the applicant.  A report is sought from the Garda in relation to the applicant's financial circumstances, his-her character and any other information that is deemed appropriate in support, or otherwise, of the application. The Garda usually conduct an interview with the applicant to obtain this information.  Other inquiries related to work permits, tax affairs etc. may also be necessary.  Finally, when all this information is received, the application is submitted to me for a decision.  This process, because of all the elements involved, can take quite a while to complete.</P>
      <P>I will write to the Deputy and the person referred to as soon as I have made a decision in the matter.</P>

During the peak tourist period personnel from both stations in Rosslare combine for the purpose of carrying out joint patrols in the area and the detective unit and divisional traffic corps based at Wexford also perform additional patrols.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied with the current policing arrangements in Rosslare. I have been assured by them that these policing arrangements are kept under continual review and any adjustments necessary are made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>They have informed me that the Kilmuckridge-Morriscastle area is situated within the Blackwater sub-district of the Enniscorthy district.  The area is policed as part of the rural policing scheme with Blackwater station being the area headquarters for Blackwater, Oylegate and Oulart.  The Kilmuckridge-Morriscastle area is patrolled by members of the Garda Síochána attached to all three of the above Garda <Col N="1664" /> stations.  The combined current strength of the Garda personnel of the three stations now stands at seven with one mobile unit allocated to each station.</P>
    <P>In addition, patrolling of the Kilmuckridge-Morriscastle area is augmented by the district detective unit based at Enniscorthy and the divisional traffic corps unit based in Wexford. During the summer season and bank holiday weekends, the divisional officer at Wexford arranges for additional patrols to be provided in the area by these two units.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that, having regard to the policing requirements of Enniscorthy district and Wexford division generally, they are satisfied that optimum use is made of available personnel and resources in providing an adequate policing service throughout the entire division.  I am assured by them that current policing arrangements are kept under continual review and adjustments made as necessary.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answer I gave the House on Wednesday, 15 May 1996. I have not yet published the 1995 report from the Mountjoy Visiting Committee pending clarification of certain issues with them.  In doing this I have acted on advice received from the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have now completed their <Col N="1666" /> inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the application referred to in the question.  It has been established that an original warrant was in fact received by the Garda Síochána on 12 April 1996 but that a copy of the warrant rather than the original was endorsed for execution by the Garda and subsequently presented to the court.  An extensive search has failed to locate the original warrant.  The Garda authorities have concluded that the original warrant was mislaid by the Garda and that the only explanation is that the original warrant was destroyed accidentally when copies of the warrant were being made.  Because the photocopies of the original documents were of such high quality, it was not realised that the original warrant was missing until the court hearing on 13 April 1996.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for ensuring that the original documents transmitted by the requesting country seeking the extradition of a person are available to the court rests with the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>Extradition procedures involve the combined efforts of a number of agencies both here and in the requesting country.  A high degree of co-ordination is required between those agencies.  In the present case, the application arrived with the Garda Síochána at very short notice and it was necessary to process it within a very narrow time-frame &mdash; in effect within a matter of hours of the court hearing.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that an error of this sort has occurred.  In general, extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland work well. This is evidence from the most recent report on the operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965 which was laid before the House in December last.  The report, which is in respect of the year 1994, records that 15 persons were extradited in 1994, seven to England and eight to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House may be assured that the necessary lessons will be drawn from the difficulties experienced on this occasion. The Garda authorities are reviewing the procedures involved in processing the <Col N="1667" /> documents required in extradition cases. They will introduce any safeguards needed to ensure that the type of error they made on this occasion will not recur.  My Department and the Attorney General's office will participate in the review of procedures already under way.</P>
    <P>Having received the final report of the Garda Síochána I am satisfied that it was necessary to liaise with all the agencies that were involved in the proceedings in both jurisdictions in order to establish the full facts.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the failure of the extradition proceedings in court on 13 April 1996 does not preclude a further application being made for the extradition of the person in question, who is now in custody here, in connection with another matter.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to alter the role of or the services provided by the National Social Service Board which will continue to carry out its functions in accordance with the National Social Service Board Act, 1984.  The transfer of responsibility for the board to my Department since last June will not affect its status or its day to day functions in any way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware of my conviction of the need for all citizens to have access to an independent community information service operating independently from statutory or official information providers.

The role of the NSSB will be central in meeting that commitment.</P>
      <P>The funding provided to the board by my Department in 1995 was £903,047 (from June 1995) which included an additional £250,000 for a computerisation project.

      <P>As announced in the budget earlier this year, windows in receipt of pensions from my Department will receive an increase of £2 a week with effect from next month.  This will bring the weekly personal rate to £68.10 for contributory pensioners under age 80 and to £64.50 for non-contributory pensioners under age 80.</P>
      <P>In addition, widows, in common with all other people living in the State, automatically qualify for free travel on reaching 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes administered by my Department, such as free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance, are available to widows aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a pension from my Department and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes, retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department may also be eligible for rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  A fuel allowance, under the national fuel scheme, is available to widows who are dependent on a long-term payment from my Department and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. <Col N="1673" /> Finally, widows in receipt of a non-contributory pension from my Department are also entitled to butter vouchers.</P>
    <P>The question of further extending the range of benefits currently available to widows would have cost implications and would have to be examined in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been receiving a pension of £40.50 a week on the basis of his weekly means of £26.49 deriving from capital and British retirement pension.</P>
      <P>On review of this entitlement, the British pension and capital had both increased the value.  His means deriving from these sources are now assessed at £29.67 a week and this entitles him to a pension of £38.50 a week.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement to old age pension, these items must be taken into account in accordance with the relevant legislation which also specifies the manner in which the weekly value of capital is to be calculated.  The rate of pension in this case will be increased to £40.50 a week from 14 June 1996 when the 1996 budget increase is put into payment.</P>

      <P>The number of persons in receipt of either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance at the end of December 1995 was 272,541.  This total includes several categories of people who are not included in the live register, such as smallholders, systematic short-time workers and people over <Col N="1675" /> 65 years of age.  It also includes people, such as casual workers, who are only partially unemployed.</P>
      <P>The Labour Force Survey is conducted once a year.  It classifies people according to the individual respondent's own assessment of what is termed his or her usual &ldquo;Principal Economic Status&rdquo;. This classification is based on the question &ldquo;What is your usual situation with regard to employment?&rdquo;.  The most recent Labour Force Survey results are in respect of April 1995.  These indicated that 192,000 people considered their &ldquo;Principal Economic Status&rdquo; to be &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; at that time.</P>
      <P>The Labour Force Survey also classifies people according to criteria adopted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).  Under these criteria, a person is unemployed if, during the week before the survey, they were without work, currently available for work and had taken specific steps to find work in the preceding four weeks.  The results in relation to April 1995 will be published by the Central Statistics Office on Thursday, May 23 1996.</P>

      <P>These measures are: measures 3.4 which relates to cross-Border community reconciliation, measure 4.1 which relates to the development of grass roots capacities and promoting the inclusion of women and measure 4.4 which relates to the promotion of vulnerable groups and improving the accessibility and quality of services aimed at these groups.  Total funding for these measures for this year and for 1997 is of the order of 16 million ECUs (IR£12.5 million approx.).  The Irish Exchequer component of this is approximately 4 million ECUs (IR£3 million approx.).</P>

      <P>The total cost of foreign travel undertaken in 1995 by me and the two Ministers of State at my Department was £15,761.78.  The following tables give a breakdown of this cost. The costs given represent the costs borne to date by the Department; they do not take account of any EU refunds which may already have been received or are due in respect of the trips.  (In cases where the Government jet or the Beechcraft was used, the costs involved were not borne by the Department.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 265 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are no doubt aware, the price of petroleum products was decontrolled in September 1991 with the entry into force of the Competition Act, 1991.  Therefore there is no obligation on the oil companies or petrol retailers to advise me in advance of their intention to increase prices or margins. Similarly, the question of sanctioning increases by my Department does not arise.  According to information provided to me by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications the price of petrol at retail level has arisen by as much as 4.6p. per litre in the period since 1 January 1996.  The bulk of this increase is the result of the rise in crude oil prices on international markets.  The increase of 0.72p. per litre announced in the budget and the consequentially higher monetary amounts of applicable value added tax account for the remainder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has also informed me that the wholesale price of <Col N="1685" /> home heating oil has arisen by about 1p a litre since the beginning of the year also reflecting higher international energy prices.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of competition in the motor fuel market, I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record of the House the view expressed by the Competition Authority in their report, published 16 February, on the proposed Statoil/Conoco take-over:</P>
    <P>There has, in the past, been a considerable degree of concern that the level of competition in the motor fuel market was inadequate.  Since the removal of price controls and surveillance and the abolition of the Restrictive Practices Order in 1991, the indications are that competition has increased.

      <Quest>if he will provide additional funding to FÁS in 1996 in order to ensure that voluntary bodies in the north-west who are submitting new applications for community employment schemes will have an opportunity of commencing projects in 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Funding is being provided to FÁS which will provide for an average of 40,000 places on community employment during 1996.  This is the maximum level of funding available, given current resources constraints, and I am satisfied it will prove significant and be of considerable benefit to the long-term unemployed, at whom this programme is primarily targeted and <Col N="1686" /> also to voluntary and public bodies in improving the quality of life for their local communities.</P>
      <P>The level of funding allocated to the north-west region is a matter for FÁS as part of their day-to-day operational responsibilities for CE.</P>

      <P>I am not clear whether the Deputy is referring to the annual science budget or to the science and technology programme operated by my Department.  This latter programme has a budget of £25.113 million in 1996. This represents an increase of £4.413 million on 1995, including an additional £4 million to implement the priority actions rising out of the report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (STIAC).  The Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology announced details of the allocation of the £4 million on 19 March 1996.  These matters can be debated in the course of the annual Estimates and budget debates or indeed at any other time and, as the Deputy will be aware, we had a general debate on S &amp; T matters in this House in the last year.</P>
      <P>The science budget is a compilation of all the financial allocations by Government each year to institutions engaged in any activity related to science and technology.  This document is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology would expect to have the 1996 science budget so presented well before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Aer Lingus cabin crew employees are concerned at the company's proposed arrangements arising from its alliance agreement with Delta Airlines. However, this issue is an industrial relations matter which ultimately will have to be resolved between the cabin crew employees, their representatives and the company.</P>
      <P>The service of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court remain available to the parties to assist them in finding a resolution to the dispute.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate for me to intervene directly in disputes such as this.  The Government established the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to assist parties to industrial disputes to resolve their differences. It would, therefore, not be appropriate for Government to intervene in such industrial disputes, as this could only undermine the role of the dispute settling agencies of the State.  I would take this opportunity to urge the parties in this dispute to continue their efforts to seek a resolution.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, made under the charter of rights announced by him; the effect, if any, the embargo in the public service has had on progress to date; the effect, if any, it will have on new suggestions being made by the Department of Finance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>On my appointment as Minister, one of my top priorities was to improve the quality of services to farmers.  The launch of the Charter of Rights for Farmers in April 1995 reflected that priority.</P>
      <P>The charter envisaged a programme of substantially improved services for farmers to be implemented over a two year period.  The payment targets set for 1995 have been largely met or indeed exceeded and I am satisfied that a similar level of performance will be achieved this year.</P>
      <P>In June of last year an extensive advisory service was provided at local marts to help farmers minimise errors in completing application forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress was made on improving accommodation facilities in local offices during 1995 and this will continue during 1996 in line with my commitment to providing confidential office consultations for farmers and better accommodation for staff.  I am satisfied that the target date at the end of <Col N="1694" /> this year for the upgrading of the local office telephone system will also be met.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to say that the appeals unit promised in the charter is now in operation.  I have invited the farm and agricultural organisations to nominate representatives of the review group which is being established to monitor the implementation of the charter.</P>
    <P>The so-called embargo has not had a direct impact on the implementation of the charter.  Progress on implementing the charter commitment to having an information desk and improved opening hours for the public at local offices from 1 November 1995 was delayed because of industrial relations difficulties with the Civil and Public Service Union (CPSU).  Following the resolution of the Civil Service dispute on 20 May 1996, full implementation of all aspects of the charter will be put in place.</P>
    <P>It is not clear as to what the Deputy refers to as new suggestions from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>At the Emergency Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on 1-3 April, which was called to address the BSE crisis, it was agreed that compensatory measures would be put in place in addition to market support measures, if this was deemed necessary.  In this context, the Council agreed at its meeting on 29-30 April, on the urgency of short-term income support measures for producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> Arising from this the EU Commission have formulated proposals for a compensation package to assist producers. However, the details of this package have not been finalised and no decision has been taken by the Council of Minister.</P>
    <P>I might add that export refunds for live cattle and beef have been increased by 12.3 per cent with effect from 1 May.</P>

      <P>The matter of the conservation of individual wildlife species such as the corncrake is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The corncrake grant scheme, funded jointly by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, provides area based payments to farmers in three defined &ldquo;corncrake areas&rdquo; who farm in a corncrake-friendly way.</P>
      <P>REPS, as administered by my Department, provides assistance in the area of corncrake conservation through the supplementary measures dealing with the conservation of proposed natural heritage areas.  Under this supplementary measure, which is mandatory for REPS participants in such areas, farmers wishing to join REPS who have lands in a proposed NHA must comply with the requirements for the conservation of the proposed NHA site, as prescribed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The three &ldquo;corncrake areas&rdquo; are proposed NHAs and as such farmers in these areas can avail of the REPS supplementary measure.  Under this measure an additional payment of £30 per hectare is available on top of the basic REPS premium of £125 per hectare, subject to a maximum of 40 hectares.  In the light of the foregoing I have no plans to modify REPS as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 291, 292, 293 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>Under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes an applicant may not be paid premium on any animals in excess of 2 LUs per hectare on his or her holding.  Where the combined total of suckler cows and male cattle applied on under these schemes exceeds 2 LUs per hectare, therefore, no premium is payable on the excess animals.</P>
      <P>There is no maximum stocking density requirement under the EU ewe premium scheme.  An applicant under this scheme may be paid in respect of eligible ewes up to his/her quota. However, in calculating stocking density requirements under the EU extensification premium scheme, account is taken of the number of ewes applied on under the ewe premium scheme or the applicant's quota whichever is lesser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>On coming into office, I reviewed the operation of the scheme for the control of farm pollution in the light of the inadequate funding available.  Following negotiations with the Minister for Finance and the European Commission, revised funding arrangements were put in place to meet potential demand from applications on hand in April 1995.  These arrangements involved the use of the overall inflator under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, the transfer of some funds from other elements of the programme and the bringing forward of substantial funds, already available in the operational programme, into 1996 and 1997 from later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department was thereby enabled to expedite payments in 1995 and 1996 <Col N="1703" /> to existing approved applicants according as investment works were carried out and also to issue approvals to outstanding applicants on hands on the understanding that the grants in such cases would be paid in 1997 when further funds became available.  This represented a substantial improvement on the position which such applicants would otherwise have had to face.</P>
    <P>To date £37 million has been paid to applicants who have carried out work approved under the scheme.  All applications for payment received in my Department's payment section up to 3 May, 1996 have been paid and I am satisfied that there is no delay in the processing of these applications.</P>

      <Quest>whether acknowledgements of receipt of area aid applications will issue in 1996 within a fortnight of their receipt in order that farmers can either be reassured that area aid applications were received or, if there is no record of receipt of the application, they can reapply or provide proof of posting of applications.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 297 and 298 together.  The relevant EU regulations governing the receipt of area aid applications lay down a penalty of one per cent for each working day that an application is late during <Col N="1704" /> the 25 calendar days after the closing date.</P>
      <P>This means that all area-aid linked payments are reduced by one per cent for each working day an area aid application is received late after 15 May 1996 this year in Ireland and that where such an application is received over 25 calendar days late no 1996 area-aid linked payments at all can be made.</P>
      <P>My Department had proposed to issue receipts for 1996 area aid applications within a fortnight of receipt of each such application although the issue of such receipts is not required by the relevant EU regulations as a service to farmers.  However, the CPSU industrial action made this impossible.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, now that the industrial action is terminated, I am arranging for the issue of receipts by the end of June to all farmers who submitted 1996 area aid applications so that they will be reassured their livestock and arable aid payments can be made to them later in 1996.  Any applicant who does not receive such a receipt may then submit any proof of posting he/she has to the area aid unit of my Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the number of 1996 area aid applications lodged to date that there is no serious shortfall in the number of applications lodged.</P>

      <P>In relation to lands on which others have turbary rights the position under REPS is that the turbary area must be identified by the REPS planner and excluded from payment.

Under this measure a cross-Border anti-farm source pollution initiative &mdash; the Erne catchment nutrient management scheme &mdash; is being put in place by my Department and the Department for Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  I expect this scheme to be in operation in the near future.  The public funding provision for the southern Border counties is £0.666 million up to 1997 with an equivalent provision for Northern Ireland.  In addition other measures under the special support programme which are not the responsibility of my Department may assist agriculture related employment and training, tourism and small businesses.</P>

      <P>I would again refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to him of 26 March 1996 on this matter.  Details of the costs of foreign travel made by the Minister of State and I during 1995 are set out in the following schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All trips have been funded from the Department's budget other than where a refund of air fare is recoverable from the EU.  The total cost of such trips. which are indicated by an asterisk, takes account of the recoverable air fare.  I should add that the total cost of travel in December 1995 has yet to be finalised <Col N="1708" /> as hotel bills that are processed through the relevant Irish Embassy have yet to be received for payment in my Department.</P>

      <P>When I launched the public consultation process last December I stressed that the approach should be rigorous, transparently fair and fully open.  I specifically identified the vital role which elected representatives would have to play in the process both by contributing to the debate and by encouraging local people to participate fully and air their views.  I have repeated this message to CIÉ on a number of occasions since.  I am satisfied it would be misleading to suggest that CIÉ or its public relations consultants is pursuing a policy of excluding public representatives from meetings to discuss the proposed light rail network.  I have been assured by CIÉ that this is not the case and that everyone is welcome to attend public meetings arranged by them as part of the public consultation programme on light rail.</P>
      <P>The process will, however, also call for more specific meetings with smaller groups and I understand that the Deputy's question refers to such a meeting which is being specially convened by CIÉ at Heuston Station to facilitate discussion of matters, including matters of a personal nature, of concern to a particular group of residents.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question may arise from possible civilian employee concern or speculation about the impact of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan (Phase I), copies of which have been issued to all Deputies.</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat the content of my recent reply to an earlier parliamentary question where I drew attention to the fact that the review plan states in Chapter 6 on &ldquo;Building, Maintenance and Furnishing&rdquo; that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The maintenance of military installation buildings will continue to be undertaken by existing civilian employee maintenance staffs for the Barrack commander...  The evaluation of alternative means of maintaining barracks will be examined during Phase I.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of relevance also is the &ldquo;Civilianisation&rdquo; section of Chapter 8 (Special Studies) of the Implementation Plan which includes the statement that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a need for a detailed study to examine the role and deposition of all civilian personnel under the new arrangements.  This will be carried out during the phase one plan and will be undertaken in conjunction with a study to identify areas where tasks undertaken by military personnel under the new arrangements might be civilianised or contracted out.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any changes that the proposed study may recommend in relation to existing <Col N="1715" /> civilian employees will be notified to, and discussed with, all appropriate parties at as early a date as possible.  The civilianisation study, along with a number of other special studies identified in the implementation plan, will be carried out over the 3-year time-frame allowed for in Phase I of the plan.</P>
    <P>In the meanwhile, no civilian employee staff redundancies in the Western Command, or elsewhere, are contemplated and there are no plans for leaving any military post without maintenance services.</P>

      <P>Since the commencement of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services in late 1994 to the end of 1995, some £840,000 has been invested in coastal protection schemes in the following counties: County Kerry, £246,666; County Wexford, £100,000; County Galway, £175,000; County Mayo, £84,000; County Meath, £105,000; County Dublin, £113,333; County Wicklow, £16,666.</P>

    <P>Arising from the continuation of works commenced in County Dublin during 1995 there is a commitment to an additional expenditure of £116,000 during 1996.  In addition, grant aid approval was given during 1995 for a relatively minor protection scheme in County <Col N="1717" /> Cork.  This project commenced in early 1996 and will incur an expenditure of £26,235.  Final decisions remain to be taken on the nature of additional new schemes to be aided this year.</P>

      <P>The Government recently approved the drafting of legislation which will amend the Fisheries Acts, 1959 and 1980, to establish an enhanced regulatory and licensing process for aquaculture.  The new legislation will help to securely underpin the industry's development by providing a more effective framework for licensing decisions.</P>
      <P>A thoroughgoing overhaul of the existing legislation is agreed by all interests to be essential, not least to address the highlighted deficiencies of licensing procedures but also to take into account new thinking on planning and environmental issues as well as significant technical advances in aquaculture itself.  While there are many complex issues involved our objective is to strike the necessary balance between the essential development needs of the industry and the acknowledged interests of concerned parties to ensure that development is planned and regulated in a sustainable way.  The Department will continue to deploy the necessary resources, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, to finalise drafting of this major and complex piece of legislation at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>In 1995 a major study on the development of coastal zone management in Ireland was commissioned by the Ministers for the Marine, for the Environment and for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The study is being undertaken by a consultancy group headed by Brady, Shipman, Martin, Planning Consultants. A final report is expected shortly.  This report will be presented to the commissioning Ministers and will be followed by a round of public consultation. It is hoped that all interested individuals and groups will fully participate in this consultation process.</P>

      <P>All potential beneficiaries in the fisheries sector under the access to finance scheme must, in accordance with EU requirements, be certified by the Minister for the Marine as being in accordance with national and EU policies for the fisheries sector.</P>
      <P>The principal activities seeking funding in the fisheries sector are the upgrading of fish processing premises and to a much lesser extent aquaculture projects and the refurbishment of fishing vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to obtain approval, projects in these areas must not have benefited from funding under existing sub-measures of the Operational Programme for Fisheries.  In addition the Minister for the Marine would, in certifying a project, have regard to the possible impact on conservation objectives in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy and in particular the impact of the development on fleet policy objectives. While to date a limited number of <Col N="1725" /> fisheries related applications have been received, it has been possible to certify the vast majority of the projects.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will of course understand that the banks also assess the merits of proposals for funding in accordance with the normal commercial criteria and the commercial viability of some proposals may not be considered sufficient to justify the provision of loan finance. In addition, I understand that the participating banks have already received a large volume of applications for assistance under the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department has sought the payment of foreshore licences for only some of the developments that have taken place at the foreshore at Valentia Harbour, County Kerry; the circumstances, if any, under which certain developers are exempted from paying foreshore licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>All occupiers of State foreshore are required to first apply for and get a Foreshore Licence or Lease.  All leases and licences under the Foreshores Acts are subject to fee payments.  The allegations raised in the letter referred to by the Deputy in Question No. 175 on 15 May 1996 are being looked into.</P>
      <P>A permit was issued under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1956, to facilitate trials.  There is no charge raised for this type of permit.</P>
      <P>Such permits are not permanent permissions and the application for longterm licences under the Foreshore and Fisheries Acts must await the outcome of technical and scientific assessment and ultimately the Minister's decision on licensing in this case.</P>
