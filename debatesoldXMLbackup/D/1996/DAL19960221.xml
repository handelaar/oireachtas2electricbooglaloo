      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 13, 9, 14 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that (1) speeches on No. 9, which shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, shall be confined to an opening speech by a Minister or Minister of State, a speech by the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party and a speech in reply by a Minister or Minister of State and (2) Private Members' Business shall be No. 25, motion re cattle and beef industry, and the proceedings thereon should be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that all parties believe there is great merit in John Hume's suggestion to hold a referendum North and South.  From reports in today's newspapers the British Prime Minister appears to have a much broader concept of the referendum. Does the Taoiseach agree that such a referendum should not be divisive, but should be capable of being put North and South and centred on peace?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I am sure the Chair would agree that more than 20 questions on Northern Ireland were taken together yesterday.  That is an impossible way to deal with the subject.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach would reply to this one question.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach wishes, he may intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will be aware that when John Hume first put this proposal I and other members of the Government heartily welcomed it because we believe it is constructive. We believe that if all the people on the island voted unambiguously against the use of violence to solve our political problems it would be clear to those who still retain the option of using violence that they are rejected by all others on the island.  That would have considerable moral force.  Obviously, one must be concerned about the fact that apparently throughout the ceasefire IRA military structures were fully maintained in <Col N="2111" /> operational order.  Punishment beatings were undertaken, individuals were targeted and the entire organisation was kept on a military footing.  For peace to take hold there must be an internal rethinking and reorientation within the republican movement to recognise that if the strategy is one of peace only it is not necessary to maintain the military option and all those previously involved in military activity must understand and learn what is involved in pursuing the political path.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to me that that re-education and rethinking within the republican movement did not take place and was not led by the republican leadership during the ceasefire.  They had an obligation to institute not only a ceasefire but also a re-examination of their entire strategy, which I regret did not occur.  I hope a referendum along the lines suggested by John Hume, clearly expressing the will of the Irish people, would result not only in a ceasefire but also in what is necessary to ensure that the ceasefire is genuinely permanent and not tactical, that is a complete and radical rethinking by the republican movement of its methods, approach, political priorities and use of its talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have a referendum &mdash; I could not object to the proposal put forward by John Hume &mdash; then it is important to broaden its scope. It is clear there is no support for violence in this jurisdiction and perhaps we could broaden the scope of the referendum to ensure that the ground rules for negotiations are on the basis of consent, which is important.  The Taoiseach referred to the peace strategy but it has to be more than a strategy.  There has to be a commitment to peace which cannot be used when it suits and abandoned when it does not suit.  It should not be mere tactics or strategy, there has to be a clear commitment that peace is the only way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach state if the Government intends to hold referenda <Col N="2112" /> this year in relation to votes for emigrants and Cabinet confidentiality and when we will see the necessary legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree heartily with the Deputy that peace for a political party is never a tactic, it has to be a principle. There must be a full understanding by all political parties that one cannot don the mantle of peace occasionally and drop it when it suits to do otherwise.  Peace and the practice of peace have to be a permanent character of a movement.  It is for a movement itself to determine how that can be done and the republican movement must truly understand that pursuing a peace process means abandoning once and for all the option of violence.  Violence is not an option which can be retained by a legitimate political party for use whenever times get tough.  One is either in the peace process or one is not, there is no halfway house or limbo between peace and war.  It is very important that the republican movement, which I have no doubt is now deliberating on this matter, recognises this and knows it is the view of all parties in the House.</P>
      <P>The holding of a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality will depend on the completion of the drafting of the relevant legislation on which work is being done, the heads having been settled by the Cabinet.  The holding of a referendum on votes for emigrants will I expect be considered by a committee of the House on the basis of a paper prepared by the Government setting out the options and difficulties.  I do not expect the Government to be in a position to take the matter further until it has had an opportunity to hear the views of the committee on that paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and express my hope that any referendum is centred on peace. The building in of Article 10 of the Downing Street Declaration to a referendum would be divisive and open up arguments about having a vote on decommissioning and other issues, <Col N="2113" /> which is not the process envisaged by John Hume.</P>

    <Title>Domestic Violence Bill, 1995: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 4: In page 10, subsection (1) (a), line 5, &ldquo;and serious&rdquo; deleted.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is a drafting amendment in respect of section 4 (1) (a). Section 4 provides for the making by the court of an interim barring order pending the determination of an application for a barring order.  Section 4 (1) (a) specifies a main condition with which the court must be satisfied before granting the interim order &mdash; that is, that there is &ldquo;an immediate and serious risk of significant harm&rdquo; to the applicant or any dependent person if the order is not made immediately.  The granting of an interim barring order must be subject to strict conditions for the reason that it is an order made in the interim pending full determination of the case made for a barring order.</P>
      <P>The barring order remedy is draconian at any time and it is important to recognise there must be conditions and safeguards attached to the making of such orders by the courts, particularly so where the order is being made on an interim basis without a full hearing of the case and where the court must come to an early decision on the facts before it.  It must also be recognised that the interim order may in some cases be granted on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, that is to say in the absence of and without notice to the other party.  These circumstances must demand that conditions and safeguards of the kinds provided for in section 4 be in place to enable justice to be done to all parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is that the need as it stands in section 4 for the court to be satisfied that there is an &ldquo;immediate and serious risk of significant harm&rdquo; to the applicant, becomes a <Col N="2117" /> need only to be satisfied that there is an &ldquo;immediate risk of significant harm&rdquo;. On that basis the need to establish a serious risk as such will not arise.  I am satisfied the amendment will improve the drafting of section 4 (1) (a) without departing fundamentally from the conditions and safeguards contained in that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this will not substantially alter the position. We will not object to this change but we have reservations about it.  The section deals with the granting of an interim barring order and, traditionally, that has always been on the grounds that there was a serious risk.  There is a danger of confusing &ldquo;significant harm&rdquo; with &ldquo;immediate and serious risk&rdquo;&mdash; they are two separate things.  &ldquo;Significant harm&rdquo; concerns the violence or threat which may be involved.  The risk, as defined at present, must be immediate, and, therefore, has to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the level of the risk.  One can argue that any risk means there is a possibility of immediate harm.  However, there is a substantial difference between a serious risk and a risk.  For instance, a person who has had psychiatric treatment may be living in the community, as such people often do.  There is certainly a continuous and an immediate risk in such cases but there may not be a serious risk in that it may be an acceptable and accepted risk in normal community life.  This provision marks a departure from present practice, so that even where there is a low risk of violence or abuse, a husband can be barred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Groups like the Coolock Law Centre who made presentations to us wanted to keep a fair balance between the granting of a barring order &mdash; especially an interim barring order, which is an immediate arrangement &mdash; and the equilibrium between the two partners, whether they are husband and wife or cohabitants.  There is a danger that this balance would be upset.  A barring order or an application for one can also be <Col N="2118" /> used in the context of family breakdowns. From that point of view I have some concern about how open this makes the position and how the change from serious risk will apply in practice, because it is theoretically at least a substantial change from current practice and could lead to incidents which none of those involved in the area want to encourage.  We support the Minister's proposed change with this <i>caveat</i>&mdash; we are concerned that it tips the scales towards low risk areas.</P>
    <P>I had to examine this provision carefully to see what it would mean in practice. The question of significant harm is totally separate and one must be clear about that in logical terms.  It is defined separately and will be treated as such in court, as will a fear of such harm.  The other aspect is the immediate risk. Removing the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; element of the risk leaves scope for different interpretations in comparison with what happened previously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh tabled an amendment on Committee and Report Stages about the seriousness of the risk.  At that point the Minister was not disposed to accept the amendment.  Perhaps he could elaborate on his change of mind, as we went through lengthy discussions on Second, Committee and Report Stages and the Bill has now come back from the Seanad with this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is a question of being careful in the changes made.  We will go along with the Minister in making the change but we have a slight reservation about the practical implications which could arise from the reduction in the level of risk involved.  This could become a subjective area in any event and we would not want to see anyone placed at risk by having to prove it was so serious that it had gone too far by the time the interim barring order was granted.  The Bill also provides for a safety order, which improves the position.  That is our only concern and otherwise we are happy to accept the Minister's amendment, which echoes an amendment put forward by Deputy Keogh in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>This aspect of the Bill was discussed on Committee Stage when the Minister stressed that these are quite draconian measures and that we must have a balanced approach.  My view is that if we are to err, we should err on the side of being overprotective of women.  On one significant aspect of the Bill I disagree with the Minister. Throughout the Bill the Minister has been too cautious but, in fairness to him, he has tried to arrive at some degree of compromise on the question of the impact of the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not be criticised for erring on the side of women, and if this affords extra protection for women it is an amendment I would accept.  Although I understood the Minister's logic, I was disappointed that he did not accept my initial amendment which was directed towards the complete protection of women.  I noted the debate in the Seanad.  The Minister has tried to achieve a balance.  I accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the amendment in the Minister's name.  I agree with Deputy Woods on the need for balance. As somebody who has practised law, the Minister will be aware that it is no small thing to be barred from one's home.  With the Minister's amendment this provision will allow the court to grant an interim barring order if there is an immediate risk, however slight, that significant harm may occur to the applicant. The Minister has achieved the right balance because we are only talking about an interim barring order, a temporary measure, an emergency provision to prevent the possibility, however slight, that significant damage may occur to the unfortunate applicant. Therefore, I agree with the proposal as put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Woods, Keogh and O'Dea for their comments. Deputy Woods in particular gave a very detailed and erudite exposition and analysis of the factors involved in the <Col N="2120" /> deletion of those two words.  One has to bear in mind that at the end of the day the matter falls to the discretion of the judge hearing the application who will take a pragmatic and sensible approach to what is at stake.  I would refer the Members of the House to paragraph (b) where it is stated that, apart from any other consideration, the judge also has to be satisfied that a protection order would not be sufficient to protect the life and limb of the applicant or her family.  If the court came to the conclusion that a protection order would be sufficient, the question of an interim barring order would not arise.  The matter was considered on an amendment from Deputy Keogh in the Dáil, but that amendment was more extensive than what is proposed here.</P>

      <P>That would have been a more extensive amendment.  What is proposed here is more reasonable and balanced.  It is adequate to protect the position of an applicant who may be in danger of life or limb and, at the same time, reasonably protect the position of a respondent.  Proof would still have to be given and the court would still have to be satisfied that there was an immediate risk.  The court would have to assess that question.  If there is a risk and it is immediate &mdash; and we are talking about significant harm also &mdash; and the court comes to the conclusion that a protection order would not suffice to protect the applicant from assault and injury, then in those limited circumstances the court may make the interim barring order.  It is a departure from the existing legislation which makes no specific provision in any circumstances for interim barring orders, although it has been the practice in some of the district courts at least to grant interim barring orders if the court comes to the conclusion that nothing else would protect the bodily integrity of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On balance this is a reasonable <Col N="2121" /> compromise which meets the needs of both the applicant and the respondent. I thank the Members for their support for it.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to the Minister for my commitment to logic which stops me in my tracks at times. Hence my concern about the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.  When I looked at my notes and saw that the eminent lawyers and spokespersons of the Progressive Democrats at one stage also considered the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; to be important I had some concern about it.  I know the Minister means well and is trying to find a balance and, as Deputy O'Dea said, he has come close, but I am somewhat concerned about that area.  We will just have to see how it works in practice.  If it does not work well, it may have to be altered in the future.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 25: In page 20, before section 25, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>25. (1) Subject to subsection (2), this Act shall come into operation one month after the date of its passing.</P>
      <P>(2) Section 6 and so much of the other provisions of this Act as relate to that section shall come into operation on the 1st day of January 1997.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of amendment No. 2 is that section 6, which gives power to health boards to apply for barring, protection and safety orders on behalf of persons in certain circumstances, would not come into operation until several months later than other provisions of the Bill.  The operative date as proposed is not open-ended.  It is set down in the amendment in definite terms as 1 January 1997.  There are particular reasons as to why health boards might not be in a position to operate section 6 adequately <Col N="2122" /> if they were required to operate it immediately on enactment of the Bill. Considerable additional responsibilities have recently been placed on the health boards by the coming into operation of 44 sections of the Child Care Act.  The training and the recruitment of staff is being proceeded with to meet those new demands.  The Government is committed to implementing the Child Care Act in full this year which will involve further statutory responsibilities on the health boards.  Section 6 of the Domestic Violence Bill has further financial and staffing implications for the child care services of the health boards.  In addition necessary administrative arrangements will also have to be put in place so that health boards will be in a position properly to take on the new responsibilities placed upon them by section 6.</P>
    <P>I am advised that these arrangements might not be sufficiently in place by the expected time of enactment of this Bill. The proposed amendment is designed to meet the reality of the situation for health boards, not ignore it.  The interval will not be too great and I ask the House to appreciate that everything possible is being done to ensure the necessary administrative arrangements will be in place within the time frame allowed by this amendment.  I ask the House to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned about the time scale for implementation of the Bill.  It was stated in section 25 that it would come into operation one month after the date of its passing.  The amendment proposes to change that and states that most of the Act will come into operation one month after its passing but section 6 and the other provisions that relate to that section shall come into operation on the first day of January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the powers of health boards to apply for certain orders where a health board becomes aware of an incident or series of incidents which, in its opinion, puts the safety or welfare of a person in doubt.  This also applies <Col N="2123" /> to the safety of children and it is important that this section comes into operation at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that as a result of the Child Care Act the health board will be required to arrange for staff training.  Has a specified amount of money been allocated in the Estimates and is it not possible to go ahead until next year's Estimates?  Is that the problem or is it a question of staff training and preparation as the Minister stated? Obviously the question of staff training must be dealt with but it is important to bring this into operation as quickly as possible particularly as these powers relate to children.  Why not bring it in on 1 September?  Surely that would give adequate time for preparation?  There is a great deal of domestic violence, much more than people think, and much of it occurs in the period coming up to Christmas.  December tends to be a peak month for domestic violence so it seems a little silly to bring it in on 1 January. It should be brought in by 1 September or 1 October.  We spoke of the immediacy of the risk during the discussion on the last amendment.  The risks are real and urgent.</P>
    <P>The rest of the Bill will be implemented within a month and that is reasonable but delaying implementation of section 6 is questionable.  Has money been provided for it?  We know 1 January is the beginning of a new Estimates year and money will be provided then. If there is to be training it must be given this year and staff would need to be taken on board in advance.  If the money has been provided for this year I appeal to the Minister to set an administrative date.  We accept that health board staff need more time than one month to make arrangements but if the Minister brought in the provisions by 1 September or 1 October they would be up and running well in advance of December which is the peak month for domestic violence, as is evident from court cases.</P>
    <P>There are 14,000 cases on file at present and that shows the extent of the <Col N="2124" /> problem and how important it is to deal with the issue urgently.  I appeal to the Minister to bring the date forward.  It would be reasonable to give a period of six or seven months to the health board. That would allow for the provisions to be put in place before the peak period at the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the amendment.  I understand the Minister may be reluctant to bring in a provision for which he does not have financial backing.  However, there are two aspects to be considered.  When will finance be available?  Can the Minister give an absolute undertaking that finance is or will be available?  Why is there a delay in relation to that and to staff?  I know there are difficulties with the recruitment of social workers and so on and health boards have recruited staff in Britain.  I would have thought it possible to have new staff in place by September or October at the latest.  It must be a question of finance and it is disappointing that the Minister does not seem to have the support of his colleagues in other Departments, particularly the Department of Finance.  It is disappointing that it will be almost a year before these provisions will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will that mean a further delay? Does it mean all of the necessary resources and staff would be in place as and from 1 January 1997?  Will there be further delays in the recruitment of staff?  This has very grave implications for the implementation of this Bill in a very critical area.  The power of the health boards in relation to orders is a critical part of this Bill as they have an immense role to play.  It is very disappointing for women and children, in particular, that the health boards will be disqualified to a great extent from availing of this Bill. The Child Care Act, which was needed for a long time and has been gradually implemented, suffered from the same lack of resources.  Despite the crying need for such an Act, its implementation was very slow and gradual.  I am disappointed that the Minister has tabled an amendment which would <Col N="2125" /> delay implementation of some provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must have a balance in this and Deputy Woods has not been unreasonable. It is reasonable to expect a lead-in period for training and so on.  However, if a social worker goes through the normal recruitment process within the health boards, it is reasonable to expect him to be employed within a period of three months.  Allowing for the summer months, it is reasonable to expect this aspect of the Bill to be in place by 1 September, 1996.  It is very disappointing that it will not happen until next year.  I object to this amendment.  Will the Minister explain why it is necessary to delay this section of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues on this side of the House. Deputy Keogh was anxious to know if everything would be in place and ready to start at the push of a button on 1 January. Experience has indicated that will not be the case.  The power given to the health boards under this legislation to intervene in this area is a new departure. It has received a very broad welcome outside this House.  Those who were particularly effusive in their comments on this new departure will, no doubt, be gravely disappointed to see that its implementation has been postponed for almost a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that 44 sections of the Child Care Act have been brought into operation this year.  I could give a long dissertation on how funding has failed to keep pace with even the gradual implementation of the Child Care Act.  The Minister does not have to take my word for that, as every other day there are articles in newspapers pointing out the inadequacies in the system and the appalling lack of funding in this area.  There has not been a genuine attempt to fund the provisions of the legislation or to keep pace with the legislative changes.  We hear horror stories about social workers working out of cars, without access to even the basic technology and so on.  There is not much point in passing legislation and giving <Col N="2126" /> people rights on paper without adequate funding to give those rights some practical effect.  The Child Care Act is probably the most effective engine in any European country for the protection of children but an engine cannot travel without fuel and, unfortunately, the fuel is not being provided.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's logic.  The Child Care Act, which is being implemented this year, deals with the protection of children.  This section can also deal with the protection of children, as a child who has nobody to look after him or her can be the aggrieved party.  Why is one Act which protects children to be implemented before other legislation which is equally important in the protection of children? I do not understand that logic.  Some of the aggrieved children who would benefit from this section are in an equally vulnerable position because they live under a reign of terror or are uneducated and without access to the system. They cannot apply for a barring order or a protection order.  They are in pretty dire situations and the health boards have to make the application on their behalf.  While I understand what has been said about the recruitment of staff and so on, I can see no logical justification for putting this back for a full year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably trying to err on the side of caution.  However, he appreciates that domestic violence is a growing reality of Irish life.  A frightening survey on the levels of domestic violence recently published, showed that it is a serious and growing phenomenon not confined to any social class &mdash; all classes, from the well heeled to the down at heel, are affected by this phenomenon.</P>
    <P>Given that the Government is to implement the Child Care Act this year, I hope it will find sufficient funding to put it into practice in addition to putting it on the Statute Book.  The target date for bringing this section into effect should be 1 September.  Will the Minister look at this again as it is a critical and central part of this legislation?  I <Col N="2127" /> know the Minister is being cautious and wants to be sure he can implement it on the date he states.  However, to reassure those who will benefit from this section and those who welcomed this new departure, the implementation date should be 1 September as an indication of the Government's good intent in this area.  There is not a genuine justification for putting it back to next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware, as Deputy O'Dea pointed out, that, unfortunately and tragically, domestic violence is a major and increasing phenomenon in Irish life.  That is the reason I am bringing in this Bill.  This major legislation, which should possibly have been brought in many years ago, has many new and important remedies and provisions.  One of those is the power given to the health boards under section 6 in limited and very specialised circumstances. It has an important role to play which is why I included it.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill will not commence in its entirety on 1 January.  It will commence in all respects, save the particular limited power of the health boards under section 6, one month after it is passed.  All the new remedies, safety orders, powers of arrest of the Garda, the increases in jurisdiction and the other major changes will all come into operation immediately.</P>
      <P>In many Bills when commencement comes into play, the device used is to say that the measure will commence on such date as the Minister prescribes by order.  I could have done that in respect of section 6.  I could have assured the House that every effort would be made to bring it in on a given date.  However, I did not do that.  I am giving a specific date in this amendment and no ministerial order or regulation is required.  I am providing that section 6 will come into operation on 1 January next without any further ado or intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Keogh and O'Dea asked if I would give an undertaking that this section will be operable on 1 January. That is specifically provided for in this <Col N="2128" /> amendment.  The delay is proposed to ensure the necessary personnel and administrative arrangements are in place before the measure comes into operation, and I am assured by the Minister for Health that the arrangements will be in place by 1 January 1997. Rather than provide that a ministerial order will be required to bring the provision into operation, that date is specifically inserted in the Bill.  All other provisions will operate one month after the date of its final passing.  Negotiations are ongoing on the training and recruitment of necessary staff to operate the measure.  I am sure Members will agree there is no great merit in providing a measure such as section 6 if the necessary back-up staff and administrative arrangements to put it into operation are not provided for.  I want to ensure those arrangements are in place by the commencement date and that is the reason for this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and the health boards are deeply committed to providing assistance to the victims of domestic violence, even in the absence of the new power in section 6.  For example, approximately 90 per cent of funding for hospital facilities and women's refuges comes from health boards.  Additional resources continue to be provided.  In the last two years emergency accommodation has been provided in Navan, Letterkenny and Castlebar.  In addition, the Minister for Health has provided more than £500,000 to meet the running costs of the new Bray women's refuge and to provide capital grants towards the development of refuges in Dublin, Kerry, Galway and Dundalk.  Increased financial support has been made available for counselling and telephone help line services for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to accept that it is necessary that section 6 come into operation contemporaneously with the availability of skilled staff, resources and arrangements necessary for it to operate in an effective manner.  That is the reason for this amendment.</P>
    <Col N="2129" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ from the Minister on this issue.  These are important measures and they should be put into operation sooner than proposed.  The Minister obviously has a problem with administration.  He said he is making a firm commitment, and I accept that, but it is too far down the road.  This section gives health boards power to apply for barring orders, protection orders and safety orders on behalf of the victims of domestic violence.  That is a very special and urgently needed power.  It is important that where a health board believes there is a serious risk it should be able to intervene on behalf of the victim. We must be particularly concerned to ensure these measures come into operation quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister could take a different approach &mdash; for example, if there is an administrative problem he could give health boards power to deal with serious risk cases immediately and cases of less serious risk could be dealt with after 1 January next.  That would better meet the needs that arise.  Power is being given to health boards in cases where a dependent person has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, sexually abused or seriously neglected.  There have been some horrific cases of sexual abuses in recent times.  At present if a health board is aware of a case of sexual abuse it has no power to intervene.  In the recent past there were cases of children who suffered extremely serious neglect but health boards did not have power to intervene.  These measures are being introduced to provide such powers to health boards.  Obviously there may be cases of serious risk at any time, in the next month, two months or three months, and it is important that those powers be available to health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stressed that he and the Minister for Health are very concerned about and deeply committed to this matter, and we do not doubt that. People on all sides of the House are very concerned about it, but without these powers one is limited in taking action.  Health boards need these powers in cases where there is a serious risk <Col N="2130" /> of harm or, as is stated in the Bill, assault, ill-treatment, sexual abuse or neglect.</P>
    <P>We have no desire to delay the Bill but we are very concerned that this section should come into operation sooner than 1 January 1997.  We suggested a very reasonable compromise of 1 September.  That would allow sufficient time for health boards to make their holiday arrangements and be well prepared for the coming into operation of the measure at that time.  The Minister should consider such a change.  If the money is not available or there are other difficulties he should say so.  Even if we were to provide that the section should come into operation on 1 September that would be too much of a delay given that we are dealing with a problem so serious that the health and welfare of women and children are at stake.  I appeal to the Minister to bring forward from 1 January 1997 to 1 September 1996 the date for the implementation of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening address on Second Stage the Minister said that section 6 is a significant new provision, which it is.  We must remember that services provided by health boards play a vital role in providing women, in particular, with a safe environment in which to discuss abuse.  The facility provided in this section is critical and the Minister was correct to underline its significance. That is why I am disappointed about the postponement of its implementation for an inordinate time.  I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides in relation to this Bill.  It is good legislation although I disagree with the Minister on some aspects of it.  When introducing the Bill did the Minister know that the necessary resources to implement this section would not be available?  Who is responsible for that decision?  Has the Minister been told by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that the necessary resources will not be made available until 1 January 1997.  If that is the case, we cannot do much about it apart from <Col N="2131" /> expressing our disappointment and putting pressure on the Minister to provide for the earlier implementation of this section than the date stated in the amendment.  The Minister is correct in saying there is not much point in making provisions in the Bill if the necessary resources are not available to implement them.  It is wrong to fudge the issue by stating that the delay relates to training and so on.  It is reasonable to accept that there must be a delay in the implementation of certain provisions because of training, recruiting and so on.  However, many women and children may find that their first source of succour, people providing the service under the aegis of the health boards, will not be available under section 6, and that would be tragic.</P>
      <P>I praise the Minister for his work on the sections we dealt with.  I know Women's Aid praised him for his work on this section.  It stated in its submission that additional social workers should be assigned to refuges and other organisations which work with abused women as a result of the implementation of this section.  This section involves financial implications, but the safety of women and children is a matter of great concern.  I accept the Minister's bona fides, but he has been hamstrung by the Department of Finance regarding the implementation of this section, and he should state that openly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be repetitious. It is strange that a Progressive Democrats spokesperson has advocated more expenditure and more taxation while her party leader and Finance spokesperson criticised the Government for taxing and spending on issues such as this and their spokespersons on other issues have called for more expenditure on all services.  They cannot have it both ways.  This matter is not a question of resources.  This Bill will come into operation and the service will be available with the necessary skilled personnel and back-up facilities on 1 January 1997.  For that to happen Deputies must realise <Col N="2132" /> that the necessary resources are being provided this year and, if they were not, it would not be possible to commence this service on 1 January 1997.  The necessary resources are being provided this year because the Government considers this important.  Why did successive Governments, including one of which Deputy Keogh's party was a member, not introduce a domestic violence Bill or provide the necessary resources for the health board to provide this important service?  I am now introducing this Bill.  This year the necessary resources are being provided and recruitment and staff training for this specialised, expert and new activity will take place.  People must be trained properly to work in this sensitive and complex area.  Section 6 highlights that the reality of the matter is that necessary staff will not have completed their training before 1 January 1997.  I am satisfied that is the earliest possible date following consultation, not with the Minister for Finance who is not involved in this, but with the Minister for Health who has responsibility for the health boards.</P>
      <P>The other sections of the Bill will be implemented before that date.  This is a good Bill which, for the first time, will give major new protections, particularly to women and children who may be in difficulty.  The new powers of arrest being given to the Garda under section 18 will be effective immediately and they will provide immediate protection in serious cases.  The implementation of that section will not have to await the introduction of the new service which will be provided by the health boards on 1 January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will appreciate that it would have been easy for me to have inserted the provision that the commencement date would be made by order.  Everybody would have been happy with that. Frequently Ministers in various Governments have inserted commencement dates and there have been long delays in the coming into operation of Acts.  I am deliberately not doing that.  The date is fixed and the Bill, when enacted, will <Col N="2133" /> come into operation automatically.  I assure the House that the necessary arrangements, recruitment and training to operate this section will be in place from 1 January 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the principal reason for the delay in introducing this section is the time required for the necessary recruitment and training of staff.  If the finances are available, the necessary recruitment can proceed. The administrative point I made in the first instance is still relevant, given the upsurge in domestic violence in the latter part of the year, particularly in December.  The problem is that we are locking ourselves into a particular situation. Had an earlier enforcement date been set those urgent, immediate parts could have been implemented forthwith and others phased in thereafter but we are now specifying that they will not have the relevant powers until 1 January 1977.  Even if they managed to have even half the staff recruited and trained by, say, 1 September next, they could not be deployed without the relevant powers.  Although I know it is not the Minister's intention, we have created that impossible position.  Bearing in mind that in the meantime there may be little children put at considerable risk I am very disappointed that the administration cannot keep pace with the Minister and that the timescale specified is so long.  Perhaps it would have been better if we had stipulated &ldquo;not later than 1 January, 1997&rdquo;.  We are tying the hands of the Minister and the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could adopt an optimistic attitude and have some staff ready to be deployed.  For example, if a health board had, say, even three staff ready it would be of help to them when confronted by difficult circumstances, they must decide whether they need to intervene.  They will not have <Col N="2134" /> the power to do so before 1 January next.</P>
      <P>Had we the opportunity to progress to Report Stage the Minister might have been in a position to improve the amendment by stipulating that this provision should come into operation after one month but not later than 1 January 1997, thus leaving scope for more efficient administration and earlier preparedness on the part of health authorities. We should also bear in mind the many people, including those returning from abroad, seeking work.</P>
      <P>The Minister has locked himself into this position and, if we attempt to change it, he will have to revert to the Seanad.  We oppose the regrettable postponement of the implementation of this very important section to 1 January 1997 which we contend is too late.</P>

I propose that the board will retain responsibility for fisheries and angling development in the region as well as for licensing and fisheries rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1995 the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, was signed by the President.  This legislation was prompted by recurring allegations of activities of a corrupt nature which had been made against certain employees of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. Last week two officers of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board were charged with offences under the Prevention of <Col N="2136" /> Corruption Act, 1906.  For obvious reasons I do not intend to deal with matters which are now before the courts.  In any event, my immediate concern has been with the adequacy of the manner in which the Southern Regional Fisheries Board addressed these allegations when they arose.</P>
    <P>The boards are financed primarily by way of an annual Exchequer grant which now amounts to over £9 million. In recent years the boards have also had access to additional funding under the Structural Funds, INTERREG, Surveillance and other EU-funded programmes which has led to a considerable increase in their development and operational activities.</P>
    <P>Elections to the regional boards, membership of which ranges from 20 to 22 including seven ministerial appointments, take place every five years from panels representing various interests in the region.  Membership of the central board, which also has a five year fixed term, comprises 13 members, seven of whom are <i>ex-officio</i> chairpersons of the regional boards and the remainder, including the chairperson, appointed by the Minister.  Some 315 permanent staff are employed by the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The fisheries boards have a most difficult job and with present structures and resources, they are making a major contribution. Over the past year, I met representatives of all the boards and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the board members, their managers and their staff.</P>
    <P>When these allegations concerning the Southern Regional Fisheries Board were brought to my attention, I met the chairperson and the manager of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. Following these meetings and following an examination of the existing legislation and taking into consideration what steps had been taken concerning these allegations, it became clear that the existing legislative provision would be an inappropriate and cumbersome mechanism to deal with the issues arising. In particular, the legislation then <Col N="2137" /> existing did not provide for circumstances in which the Minister might be obliged to move quickly to restore public confidence in the proper functioning of the board, and without removing a board, to relieve that board of some or all of its functions.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, brought the 1995 Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to the Oireachtas last year to provide me with a means of intervening where it appeared that a fisheries board was failing to manage its affairs effectively.  As a norm, it is only in rare and exceptional cases that one would expect that central Government would have to intervene directly with possible serious difficulties in the management of a State board.  It is entirely reasonable, in the public interest, that the Minister should have such powers. However, this right of intervention must be carefully tailored to prevent arbitrary Ministerial intervention and to protect the legitimate rights of boards.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995 provides that the Minister may, by order, appoint a commission to perform some or all of the functions of a board where a board has so requested or after considering the report of a person appointed by the Minister to examine the management and organisation of a board and the performance by it of its functions generally or in particular.</P>
    <P>Within days of the Act being passed I appointed Mr. Dermot Rochford, a personnel consultant, under the provisions of section 2 of the 1995 Act to prepare a report for me in relation to the management and organisation of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.  Mr. Rochford reported to me on 12 December 1995.  He concluded that the affairs of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board were not being and, in the foreseeable future were not likely to be, managed in an effective manner and recommended that I should consider exercising my power to establish a commission under section 3 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995.  Having fully considered the report, I moved to establish a commission to carry out the protection, conservation and management <Col N="2138" /> functions of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.  I have noted that the report of Mr. Rochford emphasises &ldquo;the valuable commitment, knowledge, ideas and voluntary effort available within this Board&rdquo; and, accordingly, I propose that the board will retain responsibility for fisheries and angling development in the region as well as for licensing and fisheries rates.</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1996, I wrote to the chairman of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board on 13 January 1996 advising him of my proposal to appoint a commission to carry out certain functions of the board and giving that board 14 days to make representations to me as to why the order should not be made.  The chairman has since replied and indicated that he and his board welcomed the appointment of a commission and looked forward to a constructive working relationship with it.</P>
    <P>A draft version of an order entitled &ldquo;The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, (Southern Regional Fisheries Commission) Order, 1996&rdquo; was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 February 1996, as required by the 1995 Act.  I now propose to appoint a commission and, accordingly, I wish to move that the House approves the draft of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, (Southern Regional Fisheries Commission) Order, 1996.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the appointment of a commission will help to restore public confidence in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and address the management deficiencies which were identified by Mr. Rochford in this report.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no hesitation in supporting the Minister in taking the final steps to establishing the commission which follows from the passing of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995.  We know that inland fisheries are an extremely valuable resource, not only because of the availability of <Col N="2139" /> annual Exchequer funding and EU funds but also because of the employment and tourism potential.  We have an obligation to ensure the effective operation of all the boards.</P>
      <P>The regional fisheries boards, including the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, have done an excellent job in difficult circumstances.  However, the publicity attaching to certain incidents and the Garda investigation illustrated that the existing legislation was, as the Minister said, too cumbersome and unwieldy.  It was decided that the establishment of a commission, based on earlier legislation and experience, was the wisest course to take.  The Minister had the support of all parties in this House and in the Seanad in taking that action.  We were concerned to ensure it would be tightly focused, that there would be a strict time limit on its operations and that the specific regional board concerned, the southern board, could get back to its own work with its own management and board members.</P>
      <P>For years many of us have argued the principle of subsidiarity.  Local representatives and fishery organisations must operate with the greatest possible freedom and that is what we would like to achieve.  In this case the establishment of the commission will hopefully bring to an end the long saga of allegations. While we do not want to get involved in the court developments, injure the rights of any individual or prejudice the normal legal process, we all want to see it ended as conclusively as possible at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that during my Second Stage speech I interpreted a paragraph as indicating that he appeared to intend a wider remit than just the establishment of a commission to deal specifically with the problems which have developed in the southern fisheries board.  I was concerned that this statement appeared to indicate that he had more than just this in mind.  I was assured, in his reply to Second Stage, that this was not the position.  Since then it has come to my notice &mdash; I hope the <Col N="2140" /> Minister will be able to clarify the situation &mdash; that allegations contained in anonymous letters sent to the Department have been included in letters sent to certain board members in both the northern and southern part of the country.</P>
    <P>In light of the difficulties experienced in the southern fisheries board, the last thing we want is to create a lack of confidence among the fisheries boards with developments of that kind.  We certainly do not want a trial by anonymous letters. Will the Minister indicate to the House whether he is proposing, is involved in or has knowledge of these developments which have been reported to me and which indicate a willingness on the part of his officials or himself to become involved in these circumstances again.  We witnessed a saga last year which related to a response to anonymous letters.  If people do not have the courage to put their names to the accusations they are levelling at individuals, those letters should be discarded.</P>
    <P>We have recognised for a long time the value of our inland fisheries.  We also know of the difficulties, constraints and conflicts between fishery interests. It is not an easy task.  It is crucially important that we achieve two things.  It should be possible for the regional boards and their officers to protect the resource and to do it as independently and with the maximum freedom possible. We should not embroil them unnecessarily in controversies of this kind without having absolute, credible evidence to hand.  It is because of my concern on those two fronts that I was worried that there was, in some people's minds, a potentially more extended remit than the current one.</P>
    <P>I accept that the legislation is not specifically designed to deal with one particular problem.  This would be unwise if another problem should arise. However, we should not generate a feeling that all is not well and that the Department of the Marine has a total lack of confidence in the operations of the fisheries boards and that confidence <Col N="2141" /> is so lacking that information conveyed to it, which does not even bear a signature, becomes vital.  I want the Minister to clarify those circumstances to ensure that, as we grapple with one set of circumstances and seek a satisfactory solution to it, we do not become embroiled very quickly in another potentially hazardous and difficult set of circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this motion to approve this draft order is before the House.  I agree with and support it.  I understand that the commission will be appointed from next Monday and I hope it will take up its functions immediately.  Incidentally, the draft order states that it will come into operation on 19 February which was two days ago.  That will have to be amended.</P>
      <P>I hope that the commissioner, or whoever he employs, will be there on a full-time basis to deal with the problems in this fisheries board.  If not, the whole process would be unsatisfactory.  As the Minister stated, two individuals attached to this board have been charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act.  The surprise in the area and among people who have known about these matters for many years is that only two people have been charged. Will the Minister deal with that aspect of the matter when he is replying?  It would seem appropriate that at least one other individual should be charged under this Act and, perhaps, some other legislation also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me as strange that after these two individuals were charged, many years after the first complaints were made against them, they are suspended from duty but on full pay and are allowed to retain their warrants of office, the board's motor cars and mobile telephones.  They are in no way penalised because of the situation in which they now find themselves.  I find that remarkable and I compare it to the manner in which another employee of the board has been treated because he had the temerity over a number of years <Col N="2142" /> to provide evidence to the Garda and others about what was going on.  He was seriously injured in the course of his duties.  His back was broken with an iron bar by people he was endeavouring to arrest.  He is crippled for life and is in constant pain.  He is effectively on social welfare and has had great difficulty in the past two years and more trying to keep body and soul together.  It is remarkable that somebody who upheld the law should be treated so badly by a fisheries board or any public body while people who were charged with serious offences have all the presumptions in their favour.</P>
    <P>The commissioner will have a difficult job unless he can manage all the activities of the board other than minor matters, such as fisheries rates and angling development which are of no consequence and are left to the board.  The commissioner must assume full control &mdash; including day to day control &mdash; of what goes on.  It will not be possible for the commissioner to operate side by side with the existing management.  It must be one or the other.  This should be made clear to the commissioner before he starts and he should take steps accordingly.</P>
    <P>This problem arose because certain individuals wanted to act in a particular way.  There are difficulties in all the fisheries boards, not related to corruption, but in terms of doing the job properly and protecting salmon and sea trout stocks.  Many of the problems arise from the structure of the boards.  The Minister described boards as constituting 22 people but I understood there were 25 people on each.  There is not much difference between the two, but, in either event, it is a huge number of people and they all represent conflicting interests. In most cases each member is only there to plead his own case or that of the economic interest group he represents. This is entirely unsatisfactory and one of the reasons there is such a bad situation in the regional fisheries boards and the entire structure.</P>
    <P>The relationship with the Central Fisheries Board is, apparently, not very <Col N="2143" /> good and there is no direct relationship between the Department and the regional boards.  This is why the Act was introduced last year.  However, the Act is only minor legislation which deals with a problem in a particular place.  A review of all the legislation, beginning with the 1980 Act, is required.  Things will never be put right while the 1980 Act remains the principal legislation.</P>
    <P>It is a great disappointment to people interested in angling and tourism that our wild salmon stocks, which are one of this country's most valuable assets, are treated as they are.  At best, they are ignored and at worst, they have been damaged and destroyed for years.  No country would allow the vast bulk of its salmon to be taken for commercial purposes at sea to the detriment of angling in its rivers.  It is gravely disappointing that this is occurring.</P>
    <P>I understand a predecessor of the Minister tried to do something about it. A report produced in 1994 by a firm of management consultants made some sensible recommendations.  However, apparently, there was uproar when a meeting of all members of the various boards was held in Dublin.  They did not even discuss the recommendations or suggestions because it interfered with all the vested interests.  I understand the firm concerned tried to water it down subsequently to see whether there was any possibility of reaching agreement.  It appears there was no possibility and the then Minister abandoned it as a hopeless task.  However, it cannot be abandoned. The current situation is totally unsatisfactory.  Whatever the difficulties and whatever problems may arise, this is one case the Minister must pursue and get right because what is happening now cannot and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the limited number of board members and staff who, despite enormous pressures to do otherwise tried to rectify what was going wrong in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. It has taken many long and painful years for this day to arrive and I am glad <Col N="2144" /> it has arrived.  I want the Minister of State to deal with the case where somebody who, perhaps more than anybody else, tried to clean up the situation is so heavily penalised, while those who were charged with criminal offences are not penalised and are allowed to retain, not only their full pay, but also all their various perks and rights.</P>
    <P>As we are constrained in discussing in detail the situation in the southern fisheries board, I ask the Minister in his reply to deal with the general situation throughout the country.  What does he think he will be able to do in the next number of months with a view to amending the 1980 Act and subsequent legislation amending the boards' structure and trying to introduce something which is more workable?</P>
    <P>From what I gather, virtually nobody who thinks about this matter or looks at it regards the current situation as satisfactory. I was heartened to discover recently that one of the principal bodies seeking radical change in the current set up is the principal trade union involved, SIPTU.  It states that the current system is abysmal and appalling and must be changed.  It is right as are all the various people who have endeavoured to do something about the matter.  Even if there was failure in 1994, I hope there will be some progress in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time.  I welcome the motion and compliment the Minister for the action he has taken.  We should recall that a number of his predecessors were made aware of irregularities with regard to the Southern Regional Fisheries Board area and they did not take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole matter is concerned with corruption.  Corrupt activities in State agencies are much more serious than elsewhere.  Deputy O'Malley referred to <Col N="2145" /> the fishery officer who made a statement in court approximately 15 months ago and which gave rise to the present investigation.  It should not be forgotten that I made a public statement in September 1990 along the same lines on foot of information provided to me, not only by drift net salmon fishermen but also by an employee of the Southern Fishery Board.  This statement was widely publicised, mainly in <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> I sent copies of it to Ministers in Government and the Garda Commissioner among others but no action was taken.</P>
    <P>All those who were notified of the seriousness of the situation at that time stand indicted of complicity, inaction or whatever.  Corruption should not be tolerated at any level but, regrettably, it has been.  I ask the Minister, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions to look into the matter in an overall context, and not merely in the context of what has hapened in the past 15 months because it has been well known among the fishing fraternity in southern fishery districts that corruption has been rife over the past ten to 15 years.  Nobody who has been aware of it, no matter how high their position or their office, should be exempt from prosecution or examination.</P>
    <P>A number of people who might have given evidence have not done so because they felt that nobody would ever be prosecuted because of a culture in this State which amounts to the old pals' act whereby those in positions of trust or authority will never be answerable to charges for which they should stand trial.  Deputy O'Malley referred to one other official who should be charged.  A series of people should be charged.  Some of them are political figures or in high places in the Garda Síochána.  They were made aware of corrupt activities but did not bother to investigate.  I made an allegation on foot of good evidence and information but I was never even interviewed on the basis of what I stated.  How can the public have confidence in the institutions of <Col N="2146" /> the State if matters which are well documented and extraordinarily serious are not investigated?</P>
    <P>How many people will constitute the commission?  What will be their authority? When do they expect to complete their work?  When will new elections to the board be held?  Will the Minister act on the statements made by Deputy O'Malley and ensure that those under investigation or being prosecuted should have no influence on the day to day workings of a board under investigation? This is the position at present as they still have access to premises, vehicles and craft and continue to hold positions, which should not be the case until the court cases and all the legal proceedings have been finalised.</P>

      <P>I thank Members on all sides of the House for the co-operation I have received both in introducing the legislation to enable the appointment of a commission to the Southern Fishery Board, and with regard to the motion before the House for the appointment of a commission. With regard to Deputy Deasy's inquiries, it is my intention to appoint one individual as a commissioner.  The appointment will be made immediately following the motion, which must also be put to the Seanad later today.  The commissioner will be full-time, based in the Southern Regional Board office at Clonmel and will have responsibility for the full management of and for the protection and conservation functions of the board.  The appointment is initially for a period of six months but under the legislation it can be extended up to a maximum of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Malley and Deasy raised the issue about the number of people charged.  This is a matter for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment.  When the Bill was before the House I said that if there had never been a Garda investigation or if there had never been a situation in which somebody had been charged, allegations <Col N="2147" /> of this serious nature, which were made over a period of time, required a response from the board and its management. This response did not come and the report I received from Mr. Dermot Rochford confirmed this position when he concluded that the board was not being managed effectively and that it was unlikely in the foreseeable future that it would be managed effectively. Consequently, it has been necessary for us to appoint a commissioner to take over the management, protection and conservation functions of the board, which is what we are now doing.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Michael Smith's remarks, I repeat what I said when the Bill was before the House in that I do not want the impression to be created that all is not well in the fishery boards, I wish to dispel this.  The regional fishery boards &mdash; the board members, management and staff &mdash; do a very good job in difficult circumstances. Their job is very difficult and has traditionally been very contentious, giving rise to much passion and high feelings in local communities.  I have met them all and have the greatest of respect for them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have had to take action with regard to one board but it should not be assumed that a problem which exists in one board is, by implication, extended to the other boards. That is certainly not the case.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand Deputy Smith's comments about anonymous letters.  I do not generally take any notice of anonymous letters other than accepting that they are anonymous.  If Deputy Smith wishes to bring to my attention the particulars of the case he has in mind I will be happy to examine them and will respond directly to him.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the wider issue of the future of the inland fisheries service.  A review is at present under way in the Department of the Marine of the fisheries service which includes the inland fisheries service.  The Minister and I expect to receive shortly a report from a team of consultants that has <Col N="2148" /> been looking at the fisheries service, including the inland fisheries.  Arising out of that report we may have to consider some reforms of existing inland fisheries structures.  That does not in any way reflect on the competence, integrity or commitment of those involved, far from it.  It is inevitable, however, that after almost two decades of operating the 1980 Act, the structures and management of our inland fisheries need to be looked at afresh.  Policy issues that need to be addressed concerning inland fisheries are also being examined.</P>
    <P>In addition, a group is reviewing the management of our wild salmon resource and is due to report within the next couple of months.  I expect we will be addressing afresh the way wild salmon stocks are managed.  I anticipate some changes in the inland fisheries both in relation to structures and policy. They are required to face the new challenges in the management of our inland fisheries.  That process has been under way as a separate exercise from that which we are engaged in today.</P>
    <P>I do not want the unfortunate set of circumstances that has arisen in one fisheries board to be regarded as typical or symptomatic of a wider problem of that type in other fisheries boards because that clearly is not the case.</P>

      <P>When these allegations were brought to my attention, I met with the manager and chairperson of the fisheries board, as I stated in my contribution. Following that, action was taken.  One of the problems has been that under the Fisheries Act, 1980 the only recourse open either to ministerial or departmental involvement in a fisheries board was the institution of a formal public inquiry.  Until the Oireachtas passed the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1955 there was no mechanism, short of a full-scale public inquiry, by which the Minister could intervene in the affairs of a fisheries board.  That was why we had to introduce that legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House. It is long overdue.  There may be a problem with it, concerning young people who may not be able to work after 10 p.m. If that is the case it should be looked at on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill, and I do not think anyone can object to it as it protects young people who should be allowed to work to supplement their income.  It is useful <Col N="2150" /> for them to learn the value of money and, through their work, to learn the important quality of self-reliance.  We should not encourage people who are able to support themselves to become too dependent on the State for support. At the same time we must ensure that young people are not exploited.</P>
      <P>If I go to a chip shop at 2 a.m. it annoys me to see young people of 14 or 15 years of age whose faces are white from fatigue working there.  They may have been on duty since 10 a.m.  This has to be stopped and I am glad the Minister has put restrictions on such exploitation of young people.</P>
      <P>Late night work is often poorly paid. One often finds people from working class areas working in chippers and discos to supplement their income, they depend on it.  The son of a bank manager will never be found doing such work because he will probably get a summer job opening the door of the bank.  He will never be found working in a disco or &ldquo;chipper&rdquo; at 2 a.m.  The station master's job or the bank manager's job is kept for the son or daughter of the station master or bank manager.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because those it aims to protect need protection.  I hope legislation will be introduced to protect the rights of people living beside &ldquo;chippers&rdquo; which pose a major problem in every town and village.</P>
      <P>People should enjoy their youth and should not feel they have to work.  Many low paid workers whose children attend third level colleges have to give them money for digs and other living expenses.  We must also give them money for food and entertainment. Although some may qualify for exemption from fees, it is a drain on any family to sent a child to third level education and children also feel the pressure.  It is far more important that young people are educated so that they can get a good job and then support their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this legislation young workers will have much needed redress against employers who seek to take advantage of them.  It will afford them protection against those who seek to exploit their <Col N="2151" /> youth.  I am glad there are ways in which they may appeal against such employers &mdash; through a rights commissioner and the Labour Court.  However, I am worried about who will police the legislation and how it will be policed.  There is no point bringing legislation to the House if its implementation will not be policed. There must be prosecutions so people will know the legislation has teeth and that if people do not obey the law, they will be brought before the courts.  We must not tolerate the exploitation of young people.</P>
    <P>The income of each family member is important, particularly for families who are struggling.  We are in a consumer society and there are many demands on parents who must buy uniforms when children go to school.  For many parents it is important that their children making their confirmation and first communion have the best possible clothes. This puts pressure on their resources.  A simple law should be passed so that children making their confirmation or first communion must wear their school uniforms. Many parents would object but it would save some a great deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision requiring school children working during the summer months to have at least three weeks holidays before they return to school.  It is wrong for children to work until the Sunday night before they go back.  Some parents will say the Minister is trying to stop young people from subsidising their income, but that is not what this Bill is about &mdash; it is to protect young people.</P>
    <P>I hope the people who will implement the legislation will go to discos and chip shops and take on those exploiting young people.  Young people have been exploited for many years and it is time legislation was introduced to protect them.  While I do not believe the restrictions are too severe, 10 p.m. may be a little early and perhaps the Minister will look at this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I support young people going out to work as it is important that they learn how to handle money and that the State <Col N="2152" /> will not always provide for them.  They should get an honest day's wages for an honest day's work and should not be abused by having to work 12 or 14 hours per day.  Such abuse could work against them by giving them the wrong impression about life.  It is great that young people can work for a few hours as it will give them experience of handling money and of helping their parents.</P>
    <P>Any problems with the Bill may be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Much thought was put into it and I hope it will be implemented.  The Minister and Members do not want to stop young people from supplementing their incomes for third level education but this Bill will ensure they are not abused and are properly paid.  It is wrong for young people to work at 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. in discos or chip shops.  Perhaps the State could assist young people who cannot find summer work.  The summer job scheme has worked well.  This Bill will not affect those taking on young people during the summer months because 90 per cent of such employers are decent and honourable people, but there are always some who will take advangage and treat them like skivvies and that must be stopped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  However, the Minister has gone slightly overboard and is using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  She is being too draconian and heavy handed in relation to young people who take up part-time work.  The Minister and the Government are clearly out of touch with reality.  Thousands of young people must work and earn money to support themselves.  Parents whose only income is social welfare cannot afford to provide clothes, footwear, books, pocket money, examination fees and travelling costs for their children in second level education, not to mention those attending third level institutions, such as regional technical colleges or universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will prohibit a 17 year old student from working after 10 p.m. Many 17 year olds are already in third <Col N="2153" /> level education.  The majority of them work part-time in bars, restaurants, hotels, petrol stations, late night shops and supermarkets, particularly in tourist resorts, at weekends and during the holiday periods.  I support the need to ensure that young people are not exploited but I am convinced this legislation should allow for flexibility, in relation to 16 to 18 years olds involved in part-time or holiday work.</P>
    <P>It is important to provide for serious and meaningful consultations with trade unions and employers in relation to exemptions.  I welcome the sections which provide for exemptions in the implementation of the Bill.  There is provision for young people to go to a rights commissioner, an appeals tribunal and even to the High Court.  A question which must be asked is how can the son or daughter in a family where the only income is social welfare afford to do this?</P>
    <P>The tax code will also cause a problem in the enforcement of this legislation. How can a PAYE worker in the lower middle income group afford to educate his or her family without financial assistance from them?  Working parents pay PAYE income tax at 27 per cent or, in most cases, 48 per cent in addition to PRSI.  The tax code will add to the problems in enforcing this legislation.</P>
    <P>How much money has the Minister of State provided in this year's Estimates for the operation of this legislation? How many inspectors are required to enforce it?  Will the Minister of State set up a new section within her Department to oversee the operation and enforcement of the legislation?  Will the Minister of State say how much it will cost the State and the taxpayer per annum to implement this Bill?  I want answers to my questions and I hope the Minister of State will offer them in her reply.</P>
    <P>Part-time and full-time holiday work can provide valuable work experience for 17 year olds.  This has been proven over the years.  It provides them with an <Col N="2154" /> insight into the happenings, the potential dangers and pitfalls of the real world.  Young students learn the value of money at an early age.  All of this is an education in itself and will help them in later life.</P>
    <P>I welcome certain parts of the Bill, especially section 7 where the Minister is empowered to permit by licence the employment of young people on terms other than those specified in the previous section, provided that the terms of the licence comply with the directive, that the health, welfare and safety of the employee is not in danger and in circumstances where compliance with the terms of section 6 would be impractical for technical or organisational reasons. I strongly encourage the Minister of State to be lenient in granting applications for permits and to take into account family circumstances, the category of employer and the type of employment whether it be in hotels, bars or restaurants &mdash; in short all non-industrial work.  I accept that it will be important for the Minister to be strict with regard to industrial work as it is different from the other categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that it will be a defence to proceedings taken against an employer for a breach of the Act to show that the breach was the result of an emergency.  Many busy employers, particularly in the tourism sector, will find it a burden to keep additional records, particularly for at least three years, to show that they are complying with the Act.  This adds to the cost of running a business and it will be time consuming bureaucracy for small business people.</P>
    <P>Has each of the EU member states implemented Directive 94/33/EC, 22 June 1994, on the protection of young people at work?  If not, how many countries have implemented it?  Often directives implemented in this country are not being fully implemented in other member states.  This is true in other areas of administration outside the Department of Enterprise and Employment; It seems to apply across the <Col N="2155" /> administration.  I often wonder why we must move before other member states. If other countries within the EU have not implemented this directive, why are we rushing into it now?</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions in this Bill are already contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Acts and in the 1977 Act.  I believe &mdash; although I am open to correction &mdash; that the 1977 Act was introduced by the then Minister for Labour prior to the 1977 general election.  Perhaps the Minister of State could tell me if the provisions of the 1977 Act were ever enforced.  I can envisage inspectors popping in and out of various businesses &mdash; hotels, restaurants, bars, petrol stations &mdash; without prior notice and causing the employment of young people to be stopped.  There must be a close relationship between employers and inspectors before this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister of State enlighten me as to how this legislation applies to the farming community?  Are young people and 17 year olds employed in farm work during summer holidays confined to certain working hours and not permitted to work later than 10 p.m.? This will cause severe hardship for farmers and their employees, especially during the busy harvest season when the schools and colleges are closed and when the money earned by young people working on farms &mdash; which is a healthy lifestyle &mdash; helps to pay for their further education.  Young people enjoy working on the land and being involved in activities such as saving the harvest, looking after sheep and cattle and general farm work.  It is a good, healthy lifestyle for young people, particularly when they enjoy doing such work.  I ask the Minister of State to grant an exemption for general farming activities.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister of State give more information about the inspectors? When are these inspectors likely to be appointed after the Bill is passed?  I welcome the thrust of the Bill &mdash; the protection of young people in employment &mdash; but I advise the Minister of State to be extremely careful in implementing <Col N="2156" /> the legislation.  She must obtain the co-operation of the trade unions and employers before the Bill becomes law. I will listen with interest to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that it will go some way towards regularising the position and prevent the possible abuse of young people in employment.  I also welcome the Minister of State's statement that:</P>
      <P>The new legislation does not seek to impose a ban on the employment of young people on the labour market but simply to prevent abuse in the way young people's labour is utilised. It supports measures which are designed to give young people the chance to obtain a certificate or diploma without having to leave the school system or an appropriate training course prematurely and at the same time boosts their chances on the labour market.</P>
      <P>It is also important that the Bill will not interfere with the opportunities of young people aged 15 to participate in approved training or work experience schemes which offer valuable training or worth-while work experience skills that will enhance their job prospects.</P>
      <P>While it is important to give our young people an education &mdash; and many of our young people receive third level education &mdash; we still have a problem in the skills area.  One of Monaghan's furniture industries had to advertise in a number of newspapers, north and south of the Border, to try to find suitable workers.  Many people have marvellous educational qualifications but they do not necessarily have the skills that are acquired as a result of being involved at a young age in the industries in which their fathers and forefathers were engaged.  The points made by the Minister of State in that regard are important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children's health and physical development are very important, as is the education and development of young people.  Reasonable pay for those <Col N="2157" /> in employment is also of paramount importance to the Minister of State.  She wishes to encourage people to work and to be reasonably paid for their work. The minimum age limit of 16 for normal employment is quite reasonable.  The facts show clearly that not only do people in high unemployment blackspots have a lack of education, those are also the black spots for serious crime.  It is easy to demand the building of institutions but we must start at the beginning and ensure they have a proper education which will lead to full time and better employment, so raising the age for full time employment to 16 is an important step forward.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers suggested the time limit of 10 p.m. should be reconsidered in certain types of employment.  Provided the young person does not have to work continuously after 10 p.m. on four or five days, it may be possible to work late in the hotel and bar industry one night a week.  There should be some flexibility because if the structure is not reasonable, the law is not adhered to and many difficulties arise.  The number of inspections rose from 121 in 1993 to 486 in 1994 and 686 in 1995, which shows there is a problem to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rights commissioners' service.  It is important that people can go somewhere which is easily accessible. I hope it will not be abused and only used where necessary.  A person has a right to appeal from rights commissioners to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ring, about the provision that the young person must have 21 days away from work before going back to school. I grew up on a farm and worked hard on it.  We did not always get 21 days off but we got some relief from farm work before going back to school.  If a student does not get some rest, his ability to learn and to be educated is affected.</P>
    <P>Part-time work is important in rural areas, expecially in the summer &mdash; one thinks of poultry farmers, mushroom production, etc.  It gives much needed pocket money and in some cases finance <Col N="2158" /> to allow students to continue in second level education which can be a heavy burden on people in small farms and in poorer areas.  The pocket money from this work is important and in the legislation the Minister has allowed people to get that employment.  People who live in cities may not realise that in rural areas, there are bus fares and other expenses.  Young people who want to go to musical events must be driven to the local town by their parents.  These all add to the costs, which are hard to meet from after tax income.</P>
    <P>The wider matter is full-time employment, including in agriculture, for those under 16.  While it is necessary to be over 16 and to have a licence to drive a tractor on roads, that has not been the case for using tractors on one's home farm, or even to use dangerous, heavy machinery.  I am always scared by farmers who allow their children, nephews, nieces or other relations to drive and use heavy machinery when they are not capable of using the controls in an emergency.  Over the last few years there have been serious accidents arising from this.  The accident section of the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the farm organisations are working together and using every opportunity to highlight the dangers on farms and at sea, because young people are not capable of using and working the machines they are sometimes allowed to run.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the need perhaps to allow young people extra work time in hotels, bars, etc.  However, we must prevent them working every night in places like pubs and chip shops until 3 a.m.  Those in this position are vulnerable. This work can lead to serious ill health and it may mean these people go on the dole queue forever, because they are fed up being abused at work.</P>
    <P>Another speaker praised the summer job scheme.  It has been a good scheme but it contains anomalies.  Those who do not get a college place through failing an exam are not eligible for the scheme. There should be some leeway so that <Col N="2159" /> those people can be included.  It is sometimes difficult for those people to get the dole.  They will be annoyed about failing the exam and further handicapped by not being eligible for the scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  As a Member of the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, I note that more inspectors will be calling as a result of the legislation.  We must ensure the inspectorate takes a reasonable attitude because people should not be charged if an inspector finds a child or a nephew of the owner working on a once-off basis.  The Bill aims to ensure there is not abuse but small industries are often set up by a husband and wife who are completely bogged down with paperwork and legislative requirements. I hope the Minister of State and her representatives take a reasonable attitude in implementing the Bill, so that it is seen to have been introduced for the right reasons and that those who blatantly abuse the system will be brought to heel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise there had been legislation in this area for many years.  I thought the Bill as presented was daft but if a provision has been in place for some time there is no harm examining and revising it.  My initial reaction, not knowing the law, was that it would be fine for well-to-do Dublin suburban families, with two parents working and an income between £60,000 and £120,000.  Such people probably have the ideal number of children, which is two, and are sending them for second and third level education and further to take post-graduate degrees and doctorates.  They are rearing their children in a sheltered world in which they are not expected to earn a penny before the age of 25.  The Bill struck me as a little daft originally.  Well-to-do parents can afford to send their children to summer camps and keep them through all levels of education without the children having to dirty their hands or earn a penny.  However, many other parents <Col N="2160" /> cannot do so and I wonder if this legislation is geared for the real world which involves them.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to find out there has been legislation in this regard for the past 20 years.  Perhaps we will carry on as before and ignore the Bill when it is passed.  However, I am against the idea of passing legislation without enforcing it; we may have become too fond of doing that in the past.  Our job is to pass the legislation and it is for others to enforce it, but I do not believe in passing legislation which we know will not be enforced.</P>
      <P>For many families the few pounds earned by children under 18 years is a necessary part of the family income.  It can give independence to the young persons during their teenage years, allowing them to look after themselves to a degree.  The children can make a worth-while contribution to the family income while at the same time relieving pressure on the parents to give them money.</P>
      <P>Obviously, children have to be protected. I do not advocate slave labour or the mistreatment of children, as takes place in other countries.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment is well aware of mistreatment as it is involved in implementing quota systems and approving applications for the import of goods, such as textiles and footwear, from low cost producer countries. The Minister of State mentioned instilling a work ethic in children early in life and is saying the right things, but I wonder if the balance is right.  We want children to be educated and we do not want to put extra pressure on them when they are doing their homework and study.  However, the balance is not right in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the children who go out to work are better adjusted in many cases. They manage to have a good deal of free time in any event as they are not doing homework from 4 p.m. to the time they start school the next morning. If it was a choice between children playing videos, hanging around drinking, taking drugs, misbehaving or earning a <Col N="2161" /> few pounds, I would choose the latter. The young people involved in work and sport are out of harm's way.  Idleness is a big problem where young people are concerned because they will fill the time in some way and it is often those who are idle who end up in most trouble.</P>
    <P>With the transition year concept schools are trying to introduce more enterprise oriented training.  They are not trying to get away from academic achievements but are trying to instil an enterprise attitude in pupils.  During the transition year the schools encourage pupils to get part-time or weekend jobs to earn a few pounds.  When the children go on to the next year, parents may find it difficult to get them to give up the job and get down to their studies.</P>
    <P>If a young person works as lounge staff in a pub he or she may be considered for apprenticeship in the pub at a later date.  The advantage of the job may not just be the few pounds earned but that it may lead to something more permanent.  It is not every parent's aim that his child gets a PhD.  Many children are simply trying to get their leaving certificates and then hope to get a job. We can sometimes get a little carried away with ideas of access to education. Sending everybody to school and college to get doctorates is not the be all and end all.  Many of the young people who work are developing a curriculum vitae.  It can create a good impression on an employer if an 18 or 19 year old who goes for an interview can point to experience in part-time or summer jobs. It is about getting the balance right and children must be given time to concentrate on their studies.</P>
    <P>I wonder how this legislation will affect some family businesses.  I think of one family known to me who run a small shop and the children do their bit to help from an early age, even if it is only standing behind the counter to call their parents when a customer comes in. How will such cases be affected?  I was surprised to hear Deputy Crawford, who is from the farming community, giving his whole hearted support to the Bill.  I would have thought that children <Col N="2162" /> from farming or shop owning backgrounds would do their bit in the family business from their early teenage years. Will this legislation provide a means for children to avoid working?  The legislation primarily relates to a work situation in which somebody is paid but how will it affect cases where people are not paid?</P>
    <P>It is expensive to be a teenager now-adays, which is all right if one has wealthy parents.  Teenagers seem to want expensive designer labelled clothes.  It never ceases to amaze me when I hear of children buying £70 and £80 shoes &mdash; what I would have called &ldquo;runners&rdquo; in the old days.  Many children earn a few pounds and spend it.  It gives them a sense of independence and is good for them.</P>
    <P>It was said that the number of inspections done has gone up and there are cases in which children have been taken advantage of.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Devolution Commission is working on an interim report to the Cabinet committee and <Col N="2163" /> hopes to finalise this before mid March. The Devolution Commission was established to recommend a renewed system of local government in accordance with the principles and specific mandate set out in the statement on local government reform on 4 July 1995.  Copies of this statement have been laid before both Houses.</P>
    <P>The commission has been asked to develop statements on the specific steps, including legislative and financial provisions and transitional arrangements, recommended to renew the local government system and to do so in a series of phases.  These statements are to be considered in the first instance by the Cabinet committee and then put to Government for consideration and decision.  The report or statements will be published when this process is complete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that there will be an interim report in mid-March which will leave about 12 months between its publication and the termination of the life of this Government.  Is there any real political will in this Government to drive the devolution process forward?  If so, will there be a substantial transfer of powers from central to local government during the lifetime of this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely because there is a political will to deal with this matter that we have not simply set up a body to prepare a report but have committed ourselves to setting up a Cabinet subcommittee to deal with it and make decisions and recommendations thereon. That is an indication of the Government's political will in the matter. Obviously, there are many problems involved with the devolution of power. We want the best available expert advice in order to ensure we overcome those problems, which is why we established this commission to assist us.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that there is going to be another interim <Col N="2164" /> report.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the disappointment expressed by voluntary and community groups at their lack of representation on the commission? Could they be included at this stage?  If they cannot be included, could they make a submission or presentation to the commission?</P>

      <P>Voluntary groups are represented on the body &mdash; a number of people involved in voluntary activity are on it.  Obviously, those practically involved in local government are also represented on the body, including a councillor from the Deputy's party.  We have to have a blend of practitioners of local government and voluntary organisations without having a body which is too large.  There are also representatives of different aspects of public administration such as county council administration and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The transfer of powers from officials to elected people is a separate issue from the devolution of powers from central to local government. However, it is an issue upon which the Minister for the Environment is taking action and it is a course which I strongly favour.  We have a very sophisticated electorate and elected representatives and they should be given greater responsibility for decision-making in the local government process.</P>
      <P>It is my firm intention that there will be action on devolution during the term of office of this Government.  However, we have first to get the report which will outline precise proposals and how to overcome difficulties before we can make decisions on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment is always looking at possibilities for devolution and he will not delay any proposals which he can make in this area simply because the commission is sitting.  The commission is looking at a wider range of Government activities, apart from those which come directly within the purview of the Minister for the Environment and the existing local authority structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take account of what the Deputy said about voluntary organisations. There is a difficulty in that the body is probably big enough already and we tried to achieve political balance and balance between the different aspects of local government and central administration.  Gender balance is also important.  However, I note what Deputy Kitt said about various groups wishing to make submissions and I am <Col N="2166" /> more than happy to ask the chairman, Mr. Phil Flynn, to advise on how best that can be done.</P>

      <P>There is a timeframe in that we expect the first report from the body in March and we expect the Cabinet sub-committee will meet immediately thereafter with a view to making decisions on it.  I have already told the Deputy that I expect decisions to be taken and implemented within the Government's term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see a lot of merit in going any further than that and saying that X will have happened by May, something else by July and something else by September. Those sorts of timeframes frequently lead to cynicism because, often for reasons which are entirely understandable, they cannot be implemented immediately or fully.  I do not see any point in being any more specific.  There is a political commitment to achieve a significant measure of devolution and that is what is important.  This process will not end with the presentation of the first report in March.  The commission will continue in being and will produce further reports on other aspects of Government, each of which will be <Col N="2167" /> presented in turn to the Cabinet sub-committee. Both the Cabinet sub-committee and the commission will remain in being until the entire range of Government has been reviewed with a view to establishing maximum opportunities for devolution.  That is a pretty concrete political commitment and the best that could be expected, bearing in mind the difficulties with which the Deputy is all too familiar.</P>

Comparing, for example, the degree of centralisation in Ireland with that of Germany is meaningless because Germany has a population of 90 million and Ireland has a population of 3 million. One is not comparing like with like.</P>
      <P>I accept that Ireland is over-centralised but I do not think we should advance bogus international comparisons to bolster that case.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I established two small high level groups to advise me on the future development and expansion of the IFSC.  The group to which the Deputy refers in his question, the Long-Term Review Group, consists of senior figures in the Department of Finance, IDA <Col N="2170" /> Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency and my own Department under my chairmanship.  This group is focusing on the structures, legislative and regulatory, needed to maintain a pro-business environment and the centre's competitive position.  It is also monitoring developments within the European Union, especially at Commission level, in the form of draft directives and other proposals.  The group has met three times and is due to meet again on 7 March.  It is intended that the group will consider the findings of the IFSC International Advisory Group, which I established last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Advisory Group, which was established primarily to obtain the benefit of objective overseas expertise in the international financial services area, includes a small number of individuals from leading overseas financial institutions.  I have asked this group to advise me on realisable targets for the IFSC in terms of the volume of funds under management and on levels of activity in the banking, asset finance, treasury, insurance and life assurance areas that might be achieved within a specified time frame to assist in setting long-term targets for the next stage of the IFSC development.  It has also been asked to recommend (a) any administrative, regulatory or legislative changes or (b) any new products or services or (c) any other measures which might improve the competitive position of Dublin <i>vis-à-vis</i> the more traditional financial centres, and to make any other recommendations it considers will enhance the development potential of the IFSC.  It is intended that the work of this international group will be completed within the next couple of months with the submission to the Taoiseach of a report based on the above terms of reference.I feel this industry input is essential since, while the public sector will create the right conditions for growth, it is of course those in the industry itself who create success through product development, quality service, high standards and, of course, hard work.  The group has met twice and its <Col N="2171" /> next meeting is scheduled for 29 February in Boston.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply.  I could not help thinking after the last question, when the Taoiseach discounted international reports, that the Minister of State has gone outside to get an international body to try to assist him. However, it is still a good idea.</P>
      <P>The main issue, as the Minister of State will be aware whether it is an international or local body, is that the financial world wants the Minister to make a decision as to whether the Government will seek an extension of the 10 per cent tax rate which is due to run out in 2004.  That is the key issue.  Is the Minister of State in a position to give the House a reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give a definitive reply at present. Obviously it is one of the considerations which has made the IFSC a great success. The IFSC has passed its critical mass stage and is now internationally accepted as a major player.  It will be my job to build on that success.  I recognise that the tax rate is one part of the formula which attracted people to the centre. The other parts of that formula include a good communications system, access to Government, a pro-business attitude on the part of Government and a constant supply of well educated young people.</P>
      <P>These matters are all under review, including the implications of the tax regime.  They will be kept under review by the Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware that it will take some time to try to achieve agreement on the tax rate because it is not the Government's responsibility, it is that of the European Union.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy should take no such inference from my replies.  Several Irish people serve on the international group in addition to people from other countries.  We wish to benefit from the experience of such outside influences.  The group's job is to advise me as to the priorities of continuing the success of the IFSC.  When its report becomes available it will be submitted to the Taoiseach and considered by the Government in due course. However, I am chairman of a cross-departmental and multi-agency committee which will consider the matter from a domestic standpoint.  Government policy will follow from what that committee decides is necessary and desirable in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the key issues the European Commission will consider, when examining whether Ireland should obtain an extension of the 10 per cent tax rate, is the number of firms situated &ldquo;off site&rdquo; from the Financial Services Centre.  Many of these firms agreed to move on site within a short period and are receiving a tax incentive but not complying with the conditions involved.  How many firms are in breach of the guidelines of the Government and the European Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 180, almost 50 per cent of the total number. Plans have been put in place to extend construction on the Custom House <Col N="2173" /> Docks site.  There are in the region of 11 cranes on site at present.  The difficulty arises from the great demand for incoming business.  We could fill the site with that business and leave aside those firms situated off site at present. However, the Government's objective remains to have all players on site at the earliest opportunity.  We will continue to pursue this objective.  It is good that, with plans to extend the site, we may need to make much of the existing space available to incoming firms.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct, it is unacceptable that firms should remain off site.  It remains an objective, as it was during his time as Minister for Finance, to encourage all licensed firms to move on site in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter.  The companies in receipt of this major tax break have several billions of pounds under fund management in this city.  I am not criticising the Minister because I had to deal with this matter during my time as Minister for Finance. The reality is that these companies are in receipt of massive tax breaks and are not complying with EU or Irish law. Will the Minister give a clear indication of a deadline for such firms to move on site?  Many people in the construction industry are unemployed and I do not accept that this matter is a question of space or the speed with which office blocks can be built.  Many of the firms involved do not want to move on site and I support the Minister's efforts and endeavours to do so.  These firms are saving millions of pounds by not moving on to the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State inform the House if there is a deadline for their moving on site?  If they do not we will not obtain the extension.  I am sure the Minister of State will inform the House that the reason he could not obtain sanction from the EU for the extension is due to the fact that 50 per cent of the <Col N="2174" /> beneficiaries are not in the location approved when I was Minister for Finance. It will be a scandal of huge proportions if they do not move on site in the short-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I have shared this problem, as a former Minister for Finance he understands the background to it.  Deputy Ahern is aware that when I became Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach I was given overall responsibility for the IFSC.  There was only one builder on site at that time and progress had become sluggish.  Competition from other construction firms, which should be the order of the day, has been introduced and, in due course, I hope this will help to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>The main obligation of any Presidency is to ensure an efficient, effective and impartial approach to the discharge of the business of the European Union.  With the timely and careful preparation made, Ireland's Presidency will put us in a position to move the agenda of the Union forward in important respects.  A major preoccupation in 1996 for the <Col N="2178" /> European Union and the Irish Presidency will be the Intergovernmental Conference which will be convened by the Italian presidency in Turin on 29 March and is likely to continue through our Presidency.  Ongoing preparations for the move to the third stage of European Monetary Union will be a major element of the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Dublin European Council in December 1996 will also consider the annual report on employment policy in the European Union.  The issue of employment will be a major concern for our presidency, as it is at the top of the EU agenda.  Other important issues expected to be part of the Union's agenda during our Presidency include a range of third pillar issues such as drugs, immigration and organised crime.  Matters likely to be on the external relations agenda include the reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, the strengthening of relations with the US and deepening of relations with Russia, as well as the further development of relations with the countries of central and eastern Europe and with the Mediterranean states in the wake of the Barcelona conference. There might be some movement on the Syria-Israeli peace track during our term.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned that as we approach the launch of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin on 29 March there is no agreement on its agenda?  Mr. Jean Monnet, the father of Europe, and his associates have clearly stated there will be major problems with the Intergovernmental Conference.  As Ireland is taking over the EU Presidency in a few months, does the Minister or the Taoiseach know how they will organise the conference? Our Italian partners are in no position to do so at present.  During the last Intergovernmental Conference in 1986 the Single European Act was on the agenda.  In 1990 it was Maastricht and economic and monetary union. However, we do not know its agenda this time, although enlargement and restructuring have been mentioned.  It is <Col N="2179" /> called the absent agenda in many international newspapers.  In what way will the Irish Presidency try to deal with this shambles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair to describe it as a shambles.  It would be useful if the House debated the reflection group report.  I represented Ireland on the reflection group for six months last year and we presented what was called an annotated agenda &mdash; a term devised by the Irish.  That annotated agenda sets out the alternatives.  In addition, the Western European Union made some proposals in relation to its role as its Treaty expires in 1998.  Since the publication of the reflection group report, which was noted by the European Council at Madrid, a number of countries have taken different approaches to the Intergovernmental Conference issue.  They have raised many different issues and how they might be approached.  The reflection group was not a negotiating forum; our job was to identify the issues and how to approach those on which we did not unanimously agree.  We were unanimous in some areas, for example, the Maastricht Treaty criteria for European Monetary Union and planning an analysis unit in the second pillar.  Otherwise, we outlined the issues and a number of possible approaches to them.</P>
      <P>That is the basis of the agenda in addition to whatever input different member states and different organs of the Union &mdash; for example, the Commission &mdash; wish to make.  Far from being a shambles, we have an agenda from which to work during the Intergovernmental Conference.  It will depend on how far the Intergovernmental Conference wants to go in the context of enlargement and of making the existing Union more efficient, effective, transparent and relevant to the citizens by dealing with such issues as employment and drugs as best it can.</P>

      <P>This is the first time an action plan of this kind has been attempted.  It has been a progressive step in tackling the serious problems affecting western communities as a result of declining populations.  In the preparation of the action plan there was <Col N="2183" /> considerable commitment from board members to ensure it was of a high quality. As a consequence, it deserves full examination from each Department.  I expect that when their observations are complete, the Government will give due consideration to all the proposals contained therein.  There has been no prevarication or delay.  The Deputy seems to think there has been no movement. There certainly has been movement according to the programme I have been given.  We set a deadline for the completion of the report which was the end of September or early October and it was finished in November.  I am quite satisfied that everything is up to date.</P>

If reports could solve the problems of the west, there would be no problems there because we have had so many reports. What is needed is action.

      <P>Funding for Border counties under my Department is through the local development programme.  The sub-programme to the operational programme for local, urban and rural development is implemented through ADM Limited.  It allocates funding to area partnership companies on the basis of the local development plans.  There are nine partnership companies in the Border counties, one of which, Dundalk, has had its local development plan appraised; £2.546 million has been allocated to the partnership to the end of 1999.  When plans have been received from the other partnerships, they will be appraised and funding allocated.</P>
      <P>Under the special local development grant scheme, £10,000 was allocated to the Ardara Methodist community for the development of a community centre and Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann, a voluntary representative association which includes islands off County Donegal and the north of Ireland, received £32,000.  The issue of refocusing the operational programme, required as a consequence of the EU initiative to support peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties, is being kept under review by the monitoring committee of the operational programme, particularly in view of its importance and relevance to the local development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ADM Limited will take account of the possibility of refocusing to provide additional support for development in the Border counties when allocating financial support to partnerships and selected organisations.  ADM Limited, together with the Combat Poverty Agency, is an intermediary for a number of measures under the peace and reconciliation initiative.  As announced recently by the Taoiseach, I am reviewing existing arrangements in order to ensure that funds for the development of the Border regions are <Col N="2187" /> maximised for the benefit of these regions and to ensure that the maximum effectiveness of the funding is achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>It should be clear by now that I share the public concern that our bail laws are being abused.  Examination of the Law Reform Commission report on the law of bail has proceeded as a matter of priority in my Department and is being finalised in the context of putting proposals before Government in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue raises the question of whether it would be appropriate for a referendum to be held, which would enable judges to take into account the background and character of people charged with serious offences in determining whether they should be allowed bail pending trial.  The Deputy will be aware that the background and character of the accused, in so far as they are relevant to the present criteria on which bail may be refused, are matters that would already be taken into account by a court.  I assume therefore that, in referring to this matter, the Deputy has in mind circumstances where the Constitution would be changed to widen the grounds on which bail might be refused.  Clearly, in any consideration of this matter, regard would have to be had, not only to what <Col N="2191" /> those new grounds might be, but also to the criteria which the courts would take into account in establishing whether these grounds exist.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House that in devising proposals I am considering whether some combination of legislative and constitutional change would be the most effective way to proceed. These are among the issues being addressed in the context of the examination to which I have referred and the House will appreciate that a definitive response must await the Government's consideration of these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1995, the Minister announced publicly that she favoured a constitutional referendum on bail.  We understand the Law Reform Commission report was presented to the Attorney General in August 1995.  In autumn 1995, the Minister published the report and it is still under consideration. At no stage was the Law Reform Commission requested to make a recommendation on whether there should be a referendum.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister is committed to a referendum on bail.  Is she committed to a referendum which would provide that, if a court is satisfied an accused person is likely to commit an offence while on bail, and if the offence is indictable, the judge should be entitled to refuse bail for that reason alone?  If she is so committed could she please state categorically whether she is having difficulties with the leaders of the Labour Party and Democratic Left in pursuing her commitment to having a referendum?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has asked me this question on numerous occasions but no matter how many times he asks it he gives me a history lesson of the last year.  The examination of the Law Reform Commission report is coming to an end in my Department. The issues raised are very complex.  It took 18 months for the commission to <Col N="2192" /> publish its report and it is appropriate that I would give it every consideration.</P>
      <P>When I bring my proposals to Government the Deputy need have no worries that I will have to convince one or other member of the Cabinet.  I do not know from where the Deputy is getting his information.  The Government is determined to crack down on criminal activities.  We have shown that determination in the actions we have taken against the criminal in all areas.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is concerned as he appears to be &mdash; I believe him to be sincere &mdash; it gets back to why, when his party was in office for seven years, it did not bring forward a referendum.  The Ministers in those Governments knew how complex this matter was.  The Deputy may be assured that, in a very short time, his patience will be rewarded and he will know the Government's proposals on this issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that the number of detected or recorded offences committed while a person was on bail doubled between 1990 and 1994 and that she received the Garda Commissioner's report on crime in June 1995 confirming these figures.  It is conservatively estimated that in excess of 12,000 indictable offences are now committed by people while on bail. Since the Minister is so confident of the support of the leaders of the Labour Party and of Democratic Left, will she give a commitment that not only is she, but the entire Government committed to a referendum on bail at this time?</P>

He will, therefore, <Col N="2193" /> not get the type of answer he expects from me before I bring my proposals to Government for consideration and decision.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to indictable crimes and the number of detected offences committed by people while on bail.  He quoted the years 1990 to 1994, when those figures doubled.  I was not in Government at that time, rather his party was in Government and it could have taken action if it was considered to be so seriously needed.  I am now taking action.  I am examining the Law Reform Commission report and have given a commitment, as has the Taoiseach, that the proposals will be discussed at Cabinet within a few weeks.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>whether she has received the IBEC submission on the reform of the criminal justice system; the measures, if any, she intends to introduce with a view to implementing any or all of the recommendations contained in the submission.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3893/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>IBEC presented me with a copy of its submission on the reform of the criminal justice system.  Its recommendations are receiving consideration in my Department.  Deputies will be aware, however, that work was already under way in my Department before I received the IBEC document, which will meet many of its recommendations.  For example, IBEC has called for changes in the bail law and I have already set out my position in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The submission expresses concern about the imposition of concurrent as opposed to consecutive sentences and calls for a change in the law which would, in effect, abolish the upper limit on the aggregate term of imprisonment <Col N="2194" /> which the District Court could impose through use of consecutive sentences.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, some time ago, the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper on sentencing policy and a report from the commission is awaited.  I will consider what IBEC has to say with regard to sentencing in the context of this report, but I should sound a note of caution. The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, already makes provision for the imposition of consecutive sentences up to a maximum of 24 months.  This limit was imposed because, constitutionally, there is a limit to the sentencing powers which can be given to a court of summary jurisdiction and it would not be possible to allow the District Court to impose consecutive sentences without some upper maximum in operation.  This matter would be best addressed in the context of the overall view of sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>IBEC also called for additional resources for the courts.  The House will be aware that on 30 January, I received approval from Government to appoint 15 additional judges, three to the Supreme Court, two the High Court, seven to the Circuit Court and three to the District Court.  I am confident that the appointment of these additional judges, together with the necessary support staff which will be appointed as the judges are appointed, will provide the courts with the resources they require to effectively tackle the current arrears of court business and will assist in the prompt disposal of cases in the future.</P>
    <P>Specifically with regard to the hearing of criminal cases, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, does away with the automatic right of transfer of criminal cases from the provincial Circuit Court to Dublin.  Such transfers had exacerbated the delays in the hearing of criminal cases in Dublin and were also very costly in terms of transporting gardaí and witnesses.</P>
    <P>I am committed to providing an effective and efficient court system.  To this end I have set up a working group on a courts commission which is vigorously pressing ahead with a major reappraisal <Col N="2195" /> of the organisation and structure of the courts, including examination of a proposal to establish an independent body with financial and managerial autonomy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendation on offenders contained in the IBEC submission, I would refer the Deputy to the document entitled, <i>The Management of Offenders</i>&mdash;<i>A Five Year Plan.</i> This document, which was published in 1994, contains in chapter five a review of the current temporary release arrangements together with a number of specific proposals for the future.  In brief, these proposals provide for a reduction in the number of unsupervised releases in favour of a system where the majority of releases would be closely supervised by the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    <P>The plan also provides for an increase in the number of prison places which I announced on 30 January 1996.  The establishment of a prisons board and a parole board are among a number of options being actively examined at present in accordance with the commitment contained in paragraph 119 of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, published in December 1994.  The outcome of this examination will, in the first instance, be brought before Government for its consideration as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a general feeling that the small trader's outlet has become the chosen target of criminal gangs and individuals in preference to larger institutions where security is better?  IBEC is concerned about the ability and capacity of the legal system to provide the type of deterrent required.  Concern has been expressed about early releases.  Does the Minister believe the stage has been reached where victims of crime should have a consultative role in the release of prisoners, and that legislation should be enacted to provide for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have read the IBEC report which highlights the fact <Col N="2196" /> that in recent years small business retailers and wholesalers have increasingly become the target of petty criminals looking for small sums of money to feed their drug habits.  I met representatives of RGDATA and received a number of submissions on the issue from that organisation.  There is a suggestion that victims of crime should have a consultative role in regard to the release of prisoners.  I do not know of any jurisdiction where that happens apart from New Zealand where victims of crimes committed by juvenile offenders are given a consultative role.  Under that system, teenage offenders are confronted by their victims.  Given that about 10,000 people go through our prisons every year, it would not be practical to allow victims of crime to be involved in a consultative capacity every time a person is being considered for early or temporary release.</P>
      <P>I have expressed my concern about the early and temporary release system which over the past three to four years has steadily come to rely more on emptying places for other people rather than on some of the other reasons for granting temporary releases, although they form part of the decision.  I do not think there is a future in looking at a consultative role for victims in the early release process, but victims have a role to play in many other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past the Prison Officers' Association was strongly critical of the fact that sentences handed down by a court set up under the 1937 Constitution can subsequently be shortened by administrative decisions rather than judicial ones.  In this context, would the Minister consider it useful and fruitful to have an independent parole system to control and monitor all releases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The last part of that question forms part of another question on today's Order Paper so I feel I should not go into it in any detail.  The Prison Officers' Association is well aware that since 1960 there has been a system of <Col N="2197" /> temporary and early releases and paroles, as the Deputy calls them, in our penal system.  It is slightly unusual for the prison officers to suddenly say there should not be early or temporary releases, since they have been part and parcel of managing the system for many years.  There is no doubt that early and temporary releases have been a growing feature of our prison system &mdash; not just in the past year or two, but in the past four to five years &mdash; as more people are convicted in the courts, and as new places are not coming on stream.  I hope that with my prison programme there will be a reduction of those decisions.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 11 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Individual prisoners' medical files are confidential in the context of the doctor-patient relationship and, therefore, the information requested in respect of specific treatment received by prisoners is not available.  All prisoners, including those who are suffering from drug addiction, have daily access to the prison medical officer who may arrange for appropriate treatment in each case either within the institution or, as required, in an outside hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2198" /> The testing of prisoners for drugs of addiction is currently carried out on a very limited voluntary basis usually in conjunction with a course of treatment aimed at enabling the individual to control and eventually eliminate their dependency on drugs.  Plans which are currently at an advanced stage for the new treatment facility and the drug-free unit at Mountjoy Prison complex include a comprehensive testing programme for those availing of both facilities. Prisoners will not be allowed access to these places if they do not consent to, and comply with, urine tests on site on a very frequent basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard the provision of five part-time doctors assigned on a sessional basis to Mountjoy to meet the needs of up to 600 male prisoners &mdash; many of whom are chronic drug addicts &mdash; as an adequate response to the problems posed by drug addiction offenders? Does the Minister believe the provision of one part-time doctor to St. Patrick's Institution to deal with as many as 2,000 young people committed there every year, is an adequate response to this chronic drug addiction problem?  Is there a comprehensive methadone maintenance programme in Mountjoy with counselling to stabilise chaotic drug abusers, or with random drug testing of urine which is part and parcel of such a regime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comprehensive methadone treatment facility in Mountjoy Prison and that is precisely why, having discovered such deficiencies in the prison system when taking office, I was determined to do something about it.  I will be opening a 96-cell unit in March so that prisoners who wish to serve their sentences in a drug-free atmosphere will be able to do so.  I am turning the health care unit into a proper drug treatment unit so people can receive more targeted and co-ordinated drug treatment whilst they are, as it were, a captive audience inside our prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2199" /> The current medical service provided in Mountjoy has been there for more than 20 years and I am not satisfied with it.  Discussions are taking place with the Irish Medical Organisation to try to finalise a contract for doctors in the prison. It should have been done many years ago.  There was a sort of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement in providing the medical service.</P>
    <P>While I am determined to do something about it, I am not saying that individual doctors are inadequate. However, the changing pattern of prisoners going into Mountjoy has necessitated a change in the medical service we provide.  I am making those changes by providing proper drug treatment facilities and a drug-free unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister referred to a 96-cell unit which will be drug-free did she mean that the rest of the prison will be left awash with drugs? It is notable that the drug free unit is significantly smaller than the rest of Mountjoy.  How many full-time doctors will be assigned to the new drug detoxification unit to which the Minister referred?  Will they be full-time specialists in the area?  Is the Minister aware that prison spending has increased by 50 per cent in the past five years, yet the prison population has only increased by 7 per cent?  Is the Minister aware that £4 million was spent on a medical centre in Mountjoy which has not been used? Will the Minister comment on that misallocation of funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical centre in Mountjoy has been used.  Unfortunately, there was a fire in the health care unit before Christmas which is the reason for the delay until April in bringing forward the drug treatment centre. The place needs to be rewired and redecorated.  I understand the treatment facility has 52 beds &mdash; I will correct this if it is not accurate &mdash; and it will have a full-time doctor.  I hope nursing facilities <Col N="2200" /> will also be available, but this is still subject to discussions with the prison officers and other staff members.</P>
      <P>The drug free unit is for prisoners who come into prison free of drugs and for those who opt to get treatment and agree to undergo a certain regime while in prison.  Allied to that, I am making treatment more widely available to all prisoners.  Approximately 40 per cent of prisoners entering Mountjoy each year are drug abusers or have had some serious problems with drugs.  I would be wrong to claim that I will be 100 per cent successful in turning all these drug addicts into decent law abiding citizens while in prison for some months or years.  A start is being made by providing them with a facility so they may begin to tackle their habit while in prisons. For the greater good and security of people, this is the way forward.  As the project gets under way, I will expand it as much as possible into the main prison so that it will eventually be drug free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Patrick's institution deals primarily with young offenders.  Will the Minister improve medical facilities there for young men among whom there is a very high incidence of drug addiction?  At present, one part time doctor is assigned to St. Patrick's.  Will she improve on this rather pathetic response to their medical needs?</P>

      <P>The discussions taking place with the IMO as regards the issue of contracts for doctors in hospitals will include all doctors.  I hope when those negotiations are complete we will be able to establish a better medical service. By and large, prisoners who require medical treatment get it.  Every day many prisoners receive treatment in hospitals outside the prison service.  It is not true that prisoners are lying around waiting for medical treatment.  Medical treatment is provided, but it was not adequately developed as the prison population has changed in recent years. <Col N="2201" /> I am glad that I am taking steps to make those changes.</P>

      <P>I shall answer the two Private Notice Questions about the Civil and Public Servants Union dispute together.  In recent years the number of civil servants has increased by an average of 550 per year. Last June it came to the attention of the Government that in the preceding six months an even greater increase had occurred and, if the trend was not arrested, numbers could increase by over 1,500.  During the latter half of last year the Government made a number of decisions designed to curtail an accelerating rate of increase in the numbers employed in the Civil Service and, indeed, in the wider public service.  In the Civil Service those decisions involved restricting the creation of new posts to those made necessary by the EU Presidency later in the year, decentralisation and other identifiable but important &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; tasks.  It was also decided that two in every three vacancies which would occur in 1996 would remain unfilled.  This latter restriction is likely to affect only a very small number of posts out of a Civil Service of more than 29,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2202" /> To ensure that the restrictions did not fall disproportionately on members of lower grades, such as those represented by the Civil and Public Services Union. I have directed departmental secretaries to operate them equitably.  I should add that promotional outlets for the grades involved in today's action have improved in recent years as the numbers balance has shifted in favour of the Higher Executive Officer and Clerical Officer groupings.  Proposals on a restructuring package designed to address further the perceived shortcomings in the career structures of the lower clerical grades have been put to the union.  In the circumstances I have outlined, I suggest that the action being taken is out of proportion to the impact of this Government's policy on the staff involved.  Discussions on the restrictions and the reasons underlying them have already taken place with the Civil Service unions at general council, under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. Further such discussions are scheduled for the next meeting of the council which is to take place next week.  I have always felt that matters of concern to Civil Service unions should be discussed at that forum and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Civil and Public Servants Union members to refrain from any further industrial action.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is difficult to ask the Civil and Public Servants' Union to abide by the Government's decision given that a newspaper article today stated that Democratic Left Ministers and Ministers of State have taken on 21 additional advisers at a cost of over £1,500 per day? Is it not a bit much to ask the union which looks after the lowest grade of civil servants who receive the lowest rates of pay to abide by the Government's embargo which was announced in breach of the conditions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> particularly when his colleagues in Democratic Left have taken <Col N="2203" /> on an additional 21 staff advisers at a cost of over £400,000 to the State?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the problems he faces is that in the past four years public service pay has increased by £1.3 billion or 36 per cent compared with total inflation in that period of 10 per cent? Will the Minister agree that another problem he faces is that the pay of a departmental secretary increased by 42 per cent since 1990 compared with a lower increase for clerical assistants of 19 per cent which compares with an 18 per cent increase in the average industrial wage?</P>
      <P>Is it not the problem that there has been a huge imbalance in the growth in public sector pay and that those on the lowest rung of the ladder are not getting the same proportionate increase as those on the highest rung?  Is it not the problem with this stop-go embargo driven public employment policy that this and previous Governments have failed to stand up to the demands of some people for an ever increasing public sector pay bill and at the same time have failed to conclude reasonable deals with the unions which concentrate on take home pay, about which most people in the public sector, particularly those at the bottom of the ladder, are most concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with some of which I would agree.  The main point is that when the Government saw the rate of growth in public service numbers, it felt it had a duty to curtail it in some respects.  That is the issue and the only answer I can give.  The Deputy raised many other issues but they are extraneous to this question.</P>
      <P>The growth in numbers in the public service was such that the Government did not feel it could sustain that growth in the context of controlling public expenditure.  It put a brake on the growth; that is prudent and sensible action for any Government to take.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the Government chose to impose its bludgeon-like policy on the lowest paid sector?  When the Government did not meet its financial targets, it chose to take it out on the lowest grades in the Civil Service.  That is what is behind this issue.  Does the Minister of State feel it sits uneasily with the Taoiseach's commitment to reform of the public service, to openness and to better accessibility for consumers to public services, that he and the Government by this action have demoralised the lowest grades within the Civil Service and the public service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that <Col N="2205" /> Department Secretaries have been asked to look at how this impacts in the Departments to avoid what the Deputy has mentioned.  It is obviously more of a problem in a small Department than in a large one.  However, the instruction has been given that care should be taken that it does not impact on the lower paid.  That is certainly the view of the Minister and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that a blanket embargo is a blunt instrument?  It would be more appropriate to have a more streamlined, localised approach at departmental level where one could assess the human resources needed.  I am referring to members of clerical staff, 400 of them in Garda stations so that gardaí can be released to go on the beat, people in tax offices looking after headage payments for farmers and people who look after the unemployed.  The staff in the service areas are in the front line and we should consider a more localised, departmental approach.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State confirm that this issue is unrelated to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> in that the embargo is not a pay issue?  Does the Minister of State appreciate that 70 per cent of these workers are female, that the traditional route out of low paid work is by promotion and that, by using this blunt embargo, the Government is cutting off this option for thousands of women in Government Departments and public offices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. However, the most effective way of containing the growth in numbers is <Col N="2206" /> through this type of measure.  While the sophisticated method the Deputy refers to sounds attractive, the reality is that it has not proved to be as effective.  When the Government saw the rate of growth accelerating so quickly &mdash; and Opposition Members were quite critical about it &mdash; the measure was taken.  That was prudent and sensible and put a brake on the problem.  It was done with an intended sensitivity which will have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not always achieve 100 per cent performance. However, the intent of the Government is to ensure that it is done with reasonable sensitivity so as not to impact on the lower paid.  It is not true to say that if one wants to effectively slow down the growth of the public service there is a better way than this.  There might be a more esoteric and pleasant way to do it, as the Deputy has said, but even the Deputy's party in Government dealt with it effectively in earlier years in a similar manner to this Government.</P>

      <P>What effect does the <Col N="2207" /> Minister of State expect this to have on future negotiations for a national wage agreement, considering that the Government has broken the current wage agreement within the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> in that it imposed this embargo without consultation? The Minister of State, being a practical man with business experience, will surely agree this embargo will yield little or no savings in Government expenditure.  This evening staff who are currently picketing on the streets will be back doing overtime in the relevant Departments.  Given that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has set the headline by paying overtime before it is even worked, the result of this embargo will be that overtime will become part of the system and there will be no overall saving to the State. Anybody who knows about the workings of Government Departments realises that people working at these levels will have to do overtime.  There will be no net saving to the public purse. This is not the way to achieve savings in public sector pay.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when it runs out, as any Government should be.  The estimated savings are about £2 million.  The overtime issue is a matter for the management in each Department.  It does not follow that because somebody withdraws service for an afternoon he automatically must make it up on overtime. It is possible to make up the time during normal working time and good management would try to ensure that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government regrets that this action is taking place and believes it is somewhat disproportionate to the issues involved. Clearly, management in each Department will try to ensure that it contains its costs and does not automatically involve itself in overtime because of a withdrawal of labour.  There might be some exceptions to that but, by and large, that is what I expect managers will try to achieve.</P>

      <P>The real issue is that the Government, confronted with such a problem had to take a draconian and arbitrary measure to stop it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right to say the public service pay bill is a large problem for every Government and always will be but this was not a panic measure.  When the Government saw the rate of increase in the numbers, it took a sensible and prudent course to contain them.  It is not all that crude an instrument &mdash; it is effective and that has been demonstrated in the past.  Deputy McDowell would be one of the first to criticise the Government if it had not taken action of this kind.  He is correct to allude to the difficulties facing all Governments concerning the total cost of the public service &mdash; it is a large <Col N="2209" /> amount of money in relation to the total cost of Government.</P>
      <P>All Governments have worked assiduously since the beginning of the 1990s on reducing the levels of taxation and all have reduced them somewhat, perhaps not quickly enough.  We all move in that direction, that is not the province of the Deputy's party only.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter of public probity but of panic.  The Minister for Finance made the announcement a week prior to the budget, when leaks were proliferating.  It was a macho measure.  He decided to cut public service numbers by having an embargo and ensuring there were no promotions. This was to balance the view, which continues to grow, that the smallest of the coalition parties has a disproportionate weight in the current Government's actions, programmes and objectives.  It was used for a political pursuit, to cast a patina of rigid probity across the preparations for the 1996 budget.  I am not being fanciful &mdash; I remember the headlines on the day it was leaked and the joy with which it was greeted by the far right economists and commentators.

I reiterate that this was a fairly minimalist, sensible approach when public service numbers were escalating.  The cost of the public service pay bill is more affected by numbers than any other single factor &mdash; it has a much greater effect than wage levels.  If the numbers cannot be contained, the bill will escalate out of control, ultimately.  I think it was a responsible thing for the Government to do.</P>

Finally, rather than having a meeting of the general council, the Minister of State or the Minister for Finance should meet the union involved.

How will the Bill be policed and is it enforceable?  There are provisions and clauses to that end but how will they work out in practice?  I am concerned, now that it has been enshrined in legislation, and I hope it does not lead to some young people who may be employed against the law taking actions against their employers.</P>
      <P>I do not support the compensation culture which is rife in society.

I hope there is not an ulterior motive in this Bill whereby the children will be <Col N="2306" /> sent home and housewives or the unemployed will take their jobs.  The unemployed have always been free to go for these jobs if they so wished and if they have not taken them to date there is no reason to believe they will take them in the future.</P>
    <P>Many families need the few pounds a young person may earn to supplement the family budget.  In recent years access to second and third level education has been extended and become available to families who might not have considered it previously.  Although second and third level fees are free there are many other costs involved in full-time education. Many families need the support of the extra few pounds the child may earn and the Government cannot replace the money overnight.</P>
    <P>I fear some of the jobs involved may enter the black economy and the young people may be paid out of the till rather than be registered for PRSI and tax.  In recent years advances have been made in having people employed legitimately and this legislation should not reverse those advances.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that school drop-outs are potential candidates for long-term unemployment.  In my constituency many people drop out of school at second-level and some have even dropped out at primary-level.  A gang of children who hang around a certain area get a bowl of soup and sandwiches at lunch time from the health board.  However, those who drop out of school will not take up the jobs targeted by this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is the intention of the EU directive to which this Bill gives effect.  Is it the intention that there should be a legislative framework to control and avoid the abuse of children?  Does it state when the working day should start or end?  I do not understand why a 16 or 17 year old cannot work after 10 p.m. on a Friday or Saturday night.  In Irish cultural life 10 p.m. has a different meaning to 10 p.m. in Germany &mdash; the Germans may all go to bed after the evening news and get up at 5 a.m.  Who came up with the 10 p.m. limit?  I would <Col N="2307" /> be more worried about my teenagers getting up at 5 a.m. to go to work than if they worked until 11.30 p.m. on a Saturday night.  Are we setting this 10 p.m. limit on ourselves?  It would be more damaging for teenagers to get up at 5 a.m.  That may affect their development, health and concentration during the day, yet it would be permissible under the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced about the three weeks annual leave provision.  A change is often as good as a rest.  The Minister of State talked about children being refreshed when they go back to school but no matter what a person does while away from one's usual occupation that person is refreshed on return to it.  Getting away from the usual routine and doing something different can be equally refreshing.  I am not convinced three weeks is needed; a week or ten days would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines &ldquo;light work&rdquo; as work which &ldquo;is not likely to be harmful to the safety, health or development of children&rdquo;.  I do not know what is meant exactly by &ldquo;light work&rdquo;.  Perhaps I may have been damaged because I worked when I was a teenager and it was not all light work.  I am worried we might reach a stage where young people will reach 20 years of age and will never have had any more exertion than playing video games.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is either brilliant or crazy and whoever concocted it should be seconded to the Department of Justice. Subsection (3) states that the parent or guardian of an employee, presumably a young person, who aids or abets an employer shall be guilty of an offence. If I conspire, co-operate or give approval to my 16 year old to work until 11 p.m. on a Saturday night I will be guilty of an offence.  However, in the context of the juvenile justice Bill, I have heard many advance the view that parents should be responsible for their children's behaviour.  The do-gooders always reply that one could not legislate on that basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> If we can legislate to make it an offence to allow one's teenager to work on a Saturday night I hope the Government will be consistent and include in the long awaited juvenile justice Bill similar provisions of responsibility.</P>
    <P>If I commit an offence by co-operating in my child doing something useful I should be responsible and liable for prosecution if I permit my children to run wild.  Parents should be responsible not just for their children's good work but their damage and misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine some of these issues, particularly the provision with regard to working on Friday and Saturday nights when the following day is not a school day.  It does not damage a child's health or educational prospects if they work to 11 p.m. or midnight because they would not be going to bed or doing their homework at that time on a weekend night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I imagine most of the contributors to date were unaware of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  In my last job I used to give talks and training courses on that legislation to young people in schools and it was always a source of amazement to them to discover the legislation.  It was the experience of many of them that its provisions were not implemented.</P>
      <P>I welcome any legislation introduced under the provisions of the social chapter of the European Union.  The European Union is very remote from many people and relates to the market, finance, economies and other abstract matters. However, the partnership of the European Community, now the European Union, has been an important force in improving working conditions, the position of women in society and environmental standards.  While this Bill is welcome in its own right, it is also welcome in the context of part of our obligations as signatories of the social chapter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> In addition to our EU obligations, this Bill also updates our legislation.  It updates the 1977 Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act and sections of the Conditions of Employment Act which date back to 1936.  I welcome the fact that instead of piecemeal amendment of prior legislation, the Minister has presented a new Bill.  I recommended such action during debates on previous legislation.  It is much easier for those who use the legislation if it is all available in one Act rather than having to refer to three or more prior Acts.</P>
    <P>Part of what we are amending dates back to 1936.  From listening to some of the debate, one would think that the Minister was introducing something radically new or different.  Some of the obligations which we are trying to meet through this legislation stretch back as far as 1919 and the decisions of the International Labour Organisation. Further decisions were taken by the International Labour Organisation in 1946 which were only brought into effect by the 1977 Act.  We cannot be accused of going ahead of the posse on this one.</P>
    <P>The Bill forces us to look at the conditions and terms under which children and young people are often expected to work in our society.  I worked for seven years in a centre which provided education and training and encouraged work for early school leavers.  Nobody has anything to fear from good legislation which is intended to promote their welfare.  It does not remove the incentive to work but states that we, as a society, recognise that children and young people cannot be expected to work under the same terms and conditions as fully grown and mature people.</P>
    <P>This debate dates back to the last century and the time of Dickens.  In the early days of the 19th century, when people tried to introduce restrictions on child labour following the industrial revolution, many of the arguments and much of the ill informed comment which has taken place &mdash; mostly outside <Col N="2310" /> this House &mdash; since this Bill was published were also trotted out.  One would swear that there were thousands of lovely jobs for young people to take.  I worked with young people for many years and good jobs were damn hard to come by.  Many low grade and low quality jobs were available but I did not encourage them to take such jobs.  If their first experience of the world of work when they are 16 and 17 years of age was a low grade and low paid job with unsocial hours, they were not given an incentive to continue to participate in the world of work.  When they signed on at the age of 18 years they did not try for further employment and stayed on the unemployment register as long-term unemployed because their first experience of the world of work was so bad.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about preventing young people from working but severely restricting children at work, for which we should make no apology.  Within those provisions we are still allowing them to do certain types of work and to work during school holidays.  Children and young people must be employed in a responsible way and in a fashion which genuinely contributes to their general development and welfare, shows them that work is worthwhile and should be followed up, and gives them an incentive to participate as adults in the world of work.  There has been a great deal of ill informed criticism of this Bill.  I recognise that, as many Deputies stated, the legislation we pass in this House must be good legislation capable of being enforced.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general prohibition on night work for young people. However, within that general parameter and in compliance with the European directive, we can try to build in as much flexibility as possible.  There is a choice in the directive between banning night work between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. or between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  One could say that there is not much difference.  If we can ban night work but still allow for some measure of flexibility, we can take account of many of the concerns <Col N="2311" /> expressed by Deputies.  However, in my experience of my first job and my schooldays, many of those who, against the advice of their parents and teachers, persisted in long hours of night work did not do well at school.  According to teachers and those who work in organisations such as FÁS, the evidence shows that over emphasis at a young age on work and earning money when young people should be trying &mdash; for their long-term benefit &mdash; to get the best education they can, can be detrimental.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about enforcement. The fact that many speakers in this debate and outside the House did not know that a law was passed on this issue in 1977 shows that the public is not aware of this legislation and many other areas of labour law, particularly many of the laws which were passed in the 1970s. We have relied too much on the inquisitorial approach to enforcement &mdash; that if somebody does not comply with the legislation they are immediately visited by an inspector.  I would like to see a much more co-operative approach to the dissemination of this information and the enforcement of the legislation on the ground.</P>
    <P>In other European countries, organisations such as trade unions, employers' organisations and chambers of commerce take a much greater responsibility for informing their members about such legislation and putting it into practice on the ground in a co-operative rather than confrontational fashion.  Too often in this country, we make regulations which are policed by inspectors who land people in court before they know what has happened.  I would welcome a much more co-operative approach.</P>
    <P>Trade unions do their best to make their members and the communities in which they operate more aware of such legislation.  They also facilitate those who seek redress because their rights have been infringed.  I would like to see a greater involvement of employers' organisations as this legislation benefits them as much as anybody else.  We <Col N="2312" /> should ensure that a young person's first taste of work is a good experience which shows them that work is worthwhile and rewarding and gives them an incentive to participate in the world of work as they get older.</P>
    <P>Employers' and business organisations are well organised and represented at national level.  While they may express reservations about pieces of labour law, at the end of the day they generally go along with them.  However, employers' organisations and chambers of commerce are very badly organised at local level.  I want them to play a much fuller role in, first, making their members aware of this type of legislation, second, explaining to their members why it is in their interests to go along with it, and third, co-operating in some type of local mechanism of redress where that is possible.  While I welcome the fact that redress, where, for example, somebody has been discriminated against in respect of this legislation, is now being made available through the rights commissioner and the employment appeals tribunal, I and other Deputies know that many people do not know how to gain access to it.  If one lives in a town or village away from where these people are located, it is hard to find out where they are, it can be hard to get to see them and the whole mechanism, whereby documentation goes back and forth and one must appear at a hearing and make a submission, has become complicated over the years.  This latter point is evident, in particular, in relation to the tribunal where one would nearly be afraid to advise anybody now about going to a tribunal without having first consulted a solicitor.  The method of redress can be inaccessible and bureaucratic and I want the Government, the trade union and the employer organisations to examine methods of investigating complaints under this type of legislation at local level in a non-confrontational way as far as possible which may lead to a better result.</P>
    <P>Often, under this type of legislation. if people make a complaint, they get a <Col N="2313" /> bad name in an area and employers decide not to employ them because they went to the tribunal or the rights commissioner. The confrontational way should be the last resort.  Will the Minister examine how redress under labour legislation, including this Bill, can be effected in a more accessible, understanding, less confrontational and more effective way?</P>
    <P>In general, the objective of the Bill is to ensure that young people and children are encouraged as much as possible to stay in school and, where work is available to them, to take it up under conditions which ensure they will not be exploited.  We can congratulate ourselves on the fact that more and more young people are remaining in education but, in dealing with legislation, we must be cognisant of the fact that many young people are not staying in school.  We do not want to put them in a situation where they are being forced into unsuitable employment and find they or their employer are breaking the law.</P>
    <P>More attention needs to be given to the sector of our school-going population which is likely to drop out and end up in casual or low-grade employment and who will not have the protection of a trade union.  I agree in principle that responsibility for that group should lie within the education sector but schools clearly cannot do the work for everybody.  The Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Education need to refocus on the needs of potential early school leavers &mdash; and early school leavers &mdash; to ensure they are given as much education and work experience as possible and that effective measures are taken to encourage and assist them into the world of work.</P>
    <P>I worked in this area for seven years before I became a Deputy and when the social guarantee for young people was introduced in 1986 and the National Manpower Service had initial responsibility for its implementation and monitoring, there was a good local liaison unit in my area which brought the school principals, manpower, social <Col N="2314" /> workers, probation officers and providers such as myself together to identify who was dropping out of school, to pick up on what they were doing and to try to get them into suitable education and training programmes.  I regret such an arrangement is not available in my area at present.  On paper, more young people are being catered for but the quality of the monitoring of those young people needs further examination.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister of State and with the Minister for Education and will continue to address it because many of these young people end up doing the type of jobs in the conditions which the legislation is attempting to curb.  If they are being forced to do that through having no other option or forced to earn between £20 and £25 per week because they cannot get anything else and their families need it, there is an obligation on us and the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Education to ensure these young people are identified early, monitored at an early stage after leaving school and offered a worth-while programme of education or training which has an allowance which will not oblige them to take up much of this low-paid work.  There is also an obligation to ensure the same type of resources, attention and value which other school leavers will get during their further two to three years in the secondary sector and, perhaps, two, three or four years in the third-level sector is given to the early school-leaver or the potential early school-leaver.  While, as I said, much attention in terms of policy has been given to this matter, there is a dearth of attention and lack of priority given by many of the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>A special programme needs to be put in place for these young people.  Reports and experts have identified this need but the problem still exists.  While we can congratulate ourselves on the overall standard of our education sector, it has been clearly shown that this group ends up as the long-term unemployed. National and European resources and <Col N="2315" /> policy exist to ensure these young people can and should be helped and redirected from much of the undesirable work which this legislation attempts to combat.</P>
    <P>We can all identify young people who are in undesirable types of work during unsocial hours.  Maybe we can examine including as much flexibility as possible in the Bill while still meeting the aim of protecting young people in particular, in night work.  We should examine weekend work and the evenings of Friday and Saturday, in particular.  Again, it is not desirable for young people to work long hours at weekends but we must have something which is workable, which people will respect, which people will not fear and which they will see as being in their own interests.  Unfortunately, the portrayal of this legislation outside, and sometimes, inside the House has not done this.</P>
    <P>Going back to my first job, which was in the hotel and catering trade, at the age of 15; I should not have been there at all &mdash; the type of hours which we were expected to work were such that I would have been glad if somebody had told my employer I had to finish by 11 p.m. and could not be expected to work until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. on a Friday or Sunday night.</P>
    <P>The impression may have been given that we were out to stop people working. We are not trying to discourage people from working but to ensure that where they work, they do so in a controlled and beneficial fashion.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has considered Deputies' comments on the Bill and it is passed.  I ask her to consider some sort of programme to disseminate information on it.  I was engaged in that type or process in my last job.  It was interesting and rewarding because it was the first time many of the young people I met had ever heard of any protection under the law.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear Deputy Ahern refer to transition years as &ldquo;doss&rdquo; years. I do not regard them as &ldquo;doss&rdquo; years. The work completed in transition years <Col N="2316" /> is very beneficial in encouraging young people to enter the world of employment. Transition years, the new civic, social and political programme and the work carried out by youth organisations, training workshops, Youthreach programmes and FÁS programmes provide young people with the ideal opportunity to discover what is available for the future.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State for introducing this legislation and urge her to proceed with it as quickly as possible. She is assured of my support.  I commend the Bill to the House and the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read the title of the Bill I realised there was a danger that a person criticising any aspect of it needed to be careful in the choice of words.  I would not care to be accused of being against the protection of young persons or persons of any age. I am deeply concerned that the welfare of children and young people remains paramount.</P>
      <P>Documentaries are occasionally shown on television which depict the appalling treatment of very young children in sweatshops around the world. Such documentaries usually involve what is called the &ldquo;rag trade&rdquo;.  The pay and conditions endured by these unfortunate children enable unscrupulous employers to sell their products at rock bottom prices to chain stores in countries that are regarded as some of the most civilised.  This is child slavery at its worst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thankfully, Ireland does not have to deal with this issue.  However, we must guard against the possible removal of the time honoured rights of young people in the 16 to 18 age group to earn money, subvent low family incomes or provide funds for extracurricular activities such as sport or the arts.  Consider, for example, the number of successful people who worked their way through school and college.  As a Fianna Fáil Deputy, I am proud of my party's achievement in providing secondary <Col N="2317" /> education to virtually the entire population and third-level education to an ever increasing number of people.  I am aware that the taxpayer cannot provide every item required, at least until we strike oil or some other resource in very large quantities.  This applies to the area of third-level education in particular which, it must be remembered, most students enter between the ages of 16 and 18.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State acknowledged that most young people derive part-time earnings by working as unskilled persons in licensed premises, hotels or discos. The main part of the work in such places is undertaken after 10 p.m., by which time it is illegal under the provisions of the Bill and existing legislation. I see nothing wrong with young people carrying out this type of work provided that certain specific conditions are laid down.  There is no reference in the Bill to the wages that should be paid to young people, a part from section 12, which deals with the preservation of existing wage agreements at the time of enactment.  Other conditions such as maximum hours and rest periods are dealt with under the Bill.  Some mechanisms should be enshrined in law to ensure that rogue employers cannot take advantage of prevailing conditions by offering excessively low wages to young people desperate to obtain a job of any kind, if only on a part-time basis. Perhaps this issue might be addressed in the wider area of employment.</P>
    <P>To return to the employment of young people in nightclubs and hotels, I have inquired in various quarters as to what happens in this regard.  The Minister of State is rightly concerned about the need to ensure that, as far as possible, part-time employment does not harm the educational development of young students.  The reality is that very few students are harmed in this way, apart from those who come from families whose parents do not take the necessary care of their children in the first instance.  Many parents arrange employment for their children with employers they know personally.  In these cases, <Col N="2318" /> the parents or employers make arrangements for the safe return of people to their homes.  Meanwhile, many of their schoolmates are attending discos as customers or roaming the streets without any parental or other supervision. Which of these groups of young people is in the more desirable situation?</P>
    <P>We must rely on the good sense of parents to ensure that their children are in the right place at the right time and are not unfairly exploited if engaged in part-time employment.  I agree with the condition that, during school terms, young people should not be permitted to work, except at weekends.  Even then they should have proper rest periods.  I was informed by a nightclub owner that he employed several children from many families.  He was not aware that any of the children's educations had suffered. He believed that the opposite was the case, that the young people involved seemed to benefit from the discipline of work and placed proper value on the money they earned.  I appeal to the Minister of State to bear these points in mind before finalising her proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for a very constructive and positive debate.  Good points have been made on all sides of the House.  It was not surprising that the main Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Kitt and Quill, come from a teaching background.  I believe they agree that this legislation involves the transition from school to employment and that it works for young people in the context of obtaining a good education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address a number of specific points that arose during the debate.  Deputy Gallagher emphasised that much of the content of the legislation is not new.  I decided to repeal and re-enact aspects of the Protection of Employment Act, 1936, and the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  The most controversial provisions in the Bill are not the newer <Col N="2319" /> ones but those that have been law for the past 18 years.</P>
    <P>When considering enforcement and resources for enforcement, we are faced with a situation where legislation is already in place and an inspectorate is responsible for enforcing existing law. The resources are already present.  I take Deputy Gallagher's point in relation to establishing a co-operative approach, in terms of information, which will involve local people, employers and trade unions.  A co-operative rather than a draconian approach to enforcement is the positive way to proceed.  My Department issues a series of guides to labour law.  A composite guide is also available.  There is an excellent information section in the Department but its expertise is probably not available this afternoon, for obvious reasons.  It is important that this legislation is enforced in a positive way.  The Department is informing employers, young people and their representatives of what is contained in the legislation and their rights.  The Department also has available to it the services of its labour inspectorate.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this is a sledge-hammer approach, it is realistic and balanced. There is broad support across the House to limit young people's working hours during term time.  It is important, given the age groups dealt with by the Bill, to emphasise what is under discussion. Working hours during term time are limited to seven hours per week in the case of 14 year olds and eight hours per week in the case of 15 year olds.  Restrictions are not placed on 16 or 17 year olds because they are entitled to leave school.  I am glad of the support I received in terms of raising the minimum age for regular work to 16 years.  This is a new aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the number of cases that had been prosecuted.  During my opening speech I provided figures relating to the number of inspections taking place which have increased substantially in recent years in line with the <Col N="2320" /> number of complaints received under existing law.  Since 1977, 19 cases have been referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office for enforcement.  That office proceeded with ten cases, nine of which were successfully prosecuted.  Fines were imposed in six of these cases and the Probation Act was applied in two. We are not bringing in the big guns, but we will encourage employers to meet their legal obligations under existing law.  As regards the new protections for young people in this Bill, the same positive attitude towards enforcement will apply.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kitt and Quill expressed concern about third level students in part-time jobs.  However, I disagree with Deputy Edward O'Keeffe who said that most third level students are 16 years old.  If a child starts school on their fourth birthday and does a transition year, they will be 18 years of age when entering third level education.  Most 16 and 17 year olds are in fifth and sixth year at school, a minority either do not do a transition year or leave school earlier and then enter third level education later.  However, the restrictions in this Bill do not apply to third level students. Deputy Tom Kitt is concerned about third level students and their need to earn money.  I commend the action of the Minister of Education in abolishing third level fees because that has lifted a huge financial burden off young people.</P>
    <P>The most controversial aspect of the legislation is not new but restates the law since 1977 &mdash; the ban on 16 and 17 year olds from working after 10 p.m. There is broad support across the House for the proposition that young people should not work late at night during the normal school week.  Views were expressed that young people could work in bars or elsewhere on a Friday or Saturday night when they do not have to get up for school the following morning. However, in 1946, as part of our international obligations, the ILO signed a resolution which stated that children under 18 years of age could not work after 10 p.m.  In 1977 we enacted that into our law.  Part of the provisions of <Col N="2321" /> the social chapter which we signed and of the directive on which this Bill is primarily based and which Deputy O'Rourke negotiated as my predecessor state that by implementing that directive we cannot lessen the protection already offered to people.  It is not open to us to review the position in relation to Friday and Saturday nights for 16 and 17 year olds.  Under the terms of the directive we cannot lessen the protection offered to young people which is incorporated in existing law.</P>
    <P>Deputies Tom Kitt and Quill mentioned people working in family businesses. Under the 1977 Act regulations were made to exclude close relatives from certain provisions of the Act.  I intend to continue that on a common-sense basis because we need to apply reasonable flexibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill expressed concern about the requirement for a three week break in the summer.  This applies to 14 and 15 year olds; we do not have such restrictions for 16 year olds because they are allowed to leave school.  As a parent, I feel it is reasonable that young people have such a break.  I am sure Deputy Tom Kitt, as a former teacher, believes that a child needs time not only for the family holiday but also to kick a football around the streets.  A child needs unstructured time so that when they go back to school they can enjoy and avail of their school time.  A young person who works for the school holidays or within two weeks of going back to school is not refreshed when school restarts.  We are talking about 14 and 15 year olds who are not fully grown and who need to enjoy their youth.  This is an important protection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill raised the issue of costs. There are no extra costs associated with this Bill because our labour inspectorate is already in place monitoring existing protection for young people in this area. It is also not expected that the legislation will involve any significant or extra costs for employers.  The majority of young people are covered by the existing rules.  There are some technical changes to those rules in that we are <Col N="2322" /> raising the age to 16 and giving a new avenue of redress to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Where licences are required, for example, for young people to work in films, it is not proposed to charge for them.  We will issue a simple guide for employers because it is important in this area of labour law and protection to have laws which are user friendly for both sides so that young people, their parents, the trade unions and employers know their rights.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment has a good track record in user friendly guides in this area and I will do anything I can to disseminate that more widely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford mentioned people working in agriculture.  There is a provision in the Bill which allows the Minister to make regulations to exempt any group or category of employers from a particular provision or provisions of the legislation if they are causing problems. The Deputy asked if a person working late on the harvest in mid-summer can work after 10 p.m.  Regulations were made under the 1977 Act for agricultural workers and we propose to apply a common-sense and flexible approach in this area.  The Minister may also, by licence, allow an individual employer to employ young people on terms other than those specified where compliance with the terms of the Bill would be impractical.  We would look for <i>pro rata</i> protection for young people in this regard.</P>
    <P>I expect that the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas and the publicity given to our debate today will heighten awareness of the existing law and the new provisions being enacted. That increased awareness is important in terms of looking at how people operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill mentioned baby-sitting which is not covered in this Bill because it is not employment under a contract of service or as an agency worker; it is usually a private arrangement with a next door neighbour.  We do not have an army of labour inspectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2323" /> Deputy Quill made a good point about ensuring that our existing laws on school attendance are enforced.  Deputy Gallagher <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i> made an excellent contribution during which he spoke about his own experience of dealing with early school leavers and of the conflict between low grade exploitative work and the type of opportunities faced by young people.  Deputy Gallagher made a number of points which are not on this agenda but which I accept in this regard.  I am anxious that the National Economic and Social Forum should look at the issue of early school leaving and try to co-ordinate action.  The practical points made by Deputy Gallagher will be brought to the attention of the forum at our meeting next Tuesday afternoon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring made a thoughful contribution. He asked if it would be possible to extend the working hours for 16 and 17 year olds to 12 a.m. and Deputy Gallagher asked if they could be extended to 11 p.m.  I have explained our legal constraints in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary asked if there would be costs for people who go to the rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the High Court. There is no cost for the rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal but I accept the point made by Deputy Gallagher that people might feel it is difficult to gain access to them. They are meant to be simple avenues of redress.  We have given people an alternative to going to court on these issues. The appeal to the High Court is included in all legislation regardless of whether we write it in because anyone is entitled to go to the High Court on a point of law.  However, it is a hypothetical right.  In practice, people will go to a rights commissioner and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which are free.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Gallagher's point about making the Employment Appeals Tribunal more user friendly.  I am working on that with the chairperson of the tribunal, Ms Mary Faherty, who has <Col N="2324" /> done an excellent job since her appointment. The tribunal has been improved and this has resulted in more people using it.  There are delays in taking cases before it but my Department is working to change that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary asked about young people who are working illegally and being paid under the counter.  That is something to which our inspectorate must be alert.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked also about the position of other EU member states.  All EU member states signed this directive in 1994 and must enact the legislation by 22 June 1996.  As far as I am aware, all other countries are, like ourselves, on track to meet that deadline.  This directive is not unique to Ireland; it is part of our European citizenship.  The Deputy also mentioned the importance of consulting employers and unions.  I had consultations with the employers, trade unions and the National Youth Council before finalising the proposals in the Bill.  However, if employers or unions have further points they wish to make, my door is always open.  We make progress in consultation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford raised the question of tractor safety and young people working on farms.  There are health and safety provisions in the directive which are not being implemented in this Bill but rather by regulations which I will make under the health and safety legislation. On Monday I launched the Health and Safety Authority's work programme for the year which has a particular focus on farming and the involvement of farming organisations in training youngsters to use tractors safely.  It is an important programme aimed at saving lives.  The Deputy talked about small businesses and about inspectors having a reasonable attitude. I hope my Department inspectors have a reasonable attitude.  This is constructive legislation which we want to see operated in a user friendly way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern asked if this Bill is for the well to do and will protect only those who can afford to choose whether to work.  It is about protecting everyone, <Col N="2325" /> advantaged and disadvantaged.  There is a particular focus on the early school leaver.  It is not in anyone's interest that young people be encouraged to leave school early.  Many of those who do not complete their education end up on the dole at the age of 18 or 19 and may remain unemployed for the rest of their days.  Members smiled when Deputy Ahern mentioned the cost of teenage gear.  Those of us who are parents are well aware that sometimes our youngsters work to pay for Nike runners that can cost up to £96.  I suppose that is part of our consumer society.</P>
    <P>The lounge trade is probably the biggest single problem area in the context of existing prohibitive legislation. The 1988 Intoxicating Liquor Act forbids youngsters under the age of 18 being in pubs without their parents.  It also forbids young people working in pubs.  I have a problem with young people working not just until 10 p.m., 11 p.m. or closing time, but staying on through drinking-up and cleaning-up time and walking home at 2 a.m.  That is not good for their health or safety, and we are not protecting them in that respect.  I recognise there is a need for flexibility concerning weekend and holiday work and I have explained to Deputy Quill the legal restrictions in that regard.  However, we cannot allow the licensed trade to exploit youngsters of 16 and 17 and have them going home at 2 a.m.  We will look at the issue of family businesses again.  A point was made about the working hours of bar apprentices who are under the age of 18. I will look at that issue on Committee Stage where we can tease out the problems.</P>
    <P>I want legislation that is workable, balanced and flexible which gives priority to young people's health, safety, education and protection from exploitation first.  This Bill has been welcomed across the House and I look forward to teasing out the sections constructively on Committee Stage.  I am sure with co-operation we will have the legislation on the Statute Book by our 22 June deadline.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the House, following its passage last week in Seanad Éireann.  It is a small but significant Bill, the primary purpose of which is to permit the Environmental Protection Agency to establish its permanent headquarters on a site at Johnstown Estate, Wexford.  This estate is currently vested in Teagasc but, under existing legislation, a suitable site cannot be sold or leased to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Bill proposes to amend the legislation governing the use of the estate in order to give Teagasc the necessary powers to lease a site to the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In association with the decentralisation programme announced in June 1991, the Government decided to locate the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency in Wexford.  The possibility of using Johnstown Castle as the agency headquarters was considered by the Government but, following a detailed survey of the building by the Office of Public Works in 1993, it became clear that its internal dimensions would not accommodate the agency's requirements.  The five directors of <Col N="2327" /> the agency and up to 80 staff will be based at headquarters, but the castle would only accommodate a maximum of 50 people.  Having reviewed all the alternatives, the Government decided in June 1995 that new purpose-built accommodation on a site in Johnstown Estate was the best option.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Estate is situated about four miles south west of Wexford town. It comprises the fine 19th century Gothic revival castle and a demesne of approximately 1,000 acres of land, including ornamental grounds, gardens, lakes and woodland.  The estate, as we know it today, remained in private ownership up to 1944 when the then owners, Dorothy Violet Jefferies and Maurice Victor Larkin, made a gift of it to the nation.  By any standards, this was a generous gift for which we are indebted to the donors and their family. The agreement under which the gift was accepted is incorporated in the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act, 1945.  The property was to be used as a lay agricultural college; the ornamental nature of the gardens and pleasure ground were not to be altered; ornamental timber was not to be felled, and sporting rights and rights of way were reserved to the donors and their heirs.</P>
    <P>In 1959, amending legislation was enacted to transfer ownership of the entire estate from the Minister for Agriculture to An Foras Talúntais and to extend its use as a lay agricultural college to include the conduct of agricultural research.  The Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act, 1959 also included a provision which precluded An Foras Talúntais from disposing of any part of the estate and introduced additional caveats regarding any proposed alteration, demolition or construction works in or around the castle.  During the 1970s, it was recognised that this absolute statutory prohibition on any disposal had proved to be unduly restrictive and that no response could be made by An Foras Talúntais to locally desirable initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Johnstown Castle Agricultural <Col N="2328" /> College (Amendment) Act, 1980 made provision for the disposal by An Foras Talúntais of a number of small, designated areas of land to meet requests from various local interests, including Wexford County Council.  It also included a general provision for the leasing of part of the estate by the State. However, this general provision does not permit the leasing of a site to the Environmental Protection Agency nor can a valid sub-lease be provided from the State.  Remaining areas from the land designated for disposal under the Act are not suitable for purposes of the agency headquarters.</P>
    <P>In 1988, An Foras Talúntais was dissolved and Teagasc was established. Under the provisions of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, ownership of the Johnstown Estate transferred to Teagasc, subject to the same conditions of use and limitations on disposal.  The estate is currently used by Teagasc as a research and development centre specialising in soils and environmental research. The environmental programme at Johnstown is concerned with the creation of a scientific and technical basis for good farm practice and is aimed at the protection and sustainable management of soil and water, two of our key natural resources.  The work carried out by Teagasc at Johnstown and the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency will complement each other and confirm Johnstown as a centre of environmental and agricultural excellence.</P>
    <P>This Bill is straightforward.  It provides that the existing use of the estate may be extended to enable Teagasc to lease a site to the Environmental Protection Agency and to dispose of a limited area for use for environmental, heritage, amenity or recreational purposes.  It also eases the restriction on Teagasc with regard to disposal of land under section 27 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, to enable the extended uses to be undertaken.  In preparing the legislation, the Attorney <Col N="2329" /> General has carefully considered the legal issues arising from the special status of Johnstown Estate and the special status afforded to it under various legislation since 1945.  Both original donors are now dead, but I have notified the legal representatives of their heirs of the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm to the House that the rights reserved to the donors in perpetuity in the original agreement, that is, the sporting rights and rights-of-way, have been recognised from the outset in preparing my proposals.  These rights, and the additional caveats to which I referred, will be respected by Teagasc in any proposed sale or lease of part of the estate under the provisions of the Bill.  I have assured the legal representatives of the donors' heirs that they will be consulted in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Estate is a prestigious and impressive setting and the unspoilt beauty and quality of its grounds is the epitome of environmental excellence. Location of the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters there will underpin the status and visibility of the agency as the guardian of our environment. The enactment of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the establishment of the agency in July 1993 are widely recognised as milestones in the development of our environmental management and protection capabilities.</P>
    <P>A progressive build-up of its resources has ensured that after two and a half years in existence, it is fully operational in terms of the range of functions assigned to it under the 1992 Act. This year, the agency's overall budget will be almost £8 million.  It will intensify its integrated pollution control licensing function, publish its first comprehensive state of the environment report and take on substantial new functions under the Waste Management Bill, when enacted.  In addition, the agency is increasingly active in the monitoring of environmental quality, advising on environmental issues and sound practices, co-ordination of environmental <Col N="2330" /> research and supervision of the performance by local authorities of their environmental protection functions.</P>
    <P>There are now regional environmental units of the Environmental Protection Agency in Castlebar, Cork, Dublin, Kilkenny and Monaghan, it is time to reinforce the overall development of the organisation by establishing prestigious permanent headquarters in Wexford. There is a strong association between the county and the agency, which has operated from temporary accommodation in Ardcavan, just outside Wexford town, since 1994, and I am satisfied this Bill will enable the right decision on the agency's permanent location to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity presented by the Bill to propose a new provision to ease the statutory prohibition on the disposal of any part of the estate which was introduced in 1959.  The limited disposal provision which was made in the 1980 amendment Act worked well in terms of a number of specific initiatives and requirements which were known when that legislation was drafted. However, other than by way of lease to the State, the existing provisions lack flexibility as was seen over time.  There is no basis upon which Teagasc can accommodate locally desirable activities and proposals, which could bring the estate into a beneficial relationship with the local community.  Teagasc has received requests from local interest groups &mdash; this will be known to the Deputy opposite &mdash; for some limited access to land in Johnstown, which would have broad public support in the locality, but, under existing legislation, it has had no option but to refuse.</P>
    <P>To overcome this, a modest, more general disposal provision has been included in the Bill.  This is purely an enabling measure and it will be a matter for Teagasc to determine individual cases.  Disposals under the proposed provision will be restricted to environmental, heritage, recreational or amenity uses, and subject to an overall threshold of 5 per cent of the area of the estate at the commencement of the <Col N="2331" /> legislation.  In addition to these specific conditions, Teagasc is required, under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, to obtain the approval of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for all disposals of land.  This requirement will apply to any disposals at Johnstown under the provision now proposed.</P>
    <P>The significance of the Bill should not be judged by its limited size.  Its enactment is an important step in finalising the operational framework of one of the State's most important structures, the Environmental Protection Agency.  The agency is entrusted with the protection of our natural environment, not only for our benefit, but for the benefit of future generations, and it is now widely recognised as one of our most important national bodies.  As such, the House will agree with the provisions of the Bill which will provide suitable headquarters accommodation in the appropriate setting for the agency.</P>
    <P>Enactment of the Bill is also important for Johnstown Estate and the people of Wexford.  The existing and proposed new uses will complement each other and the enhanced use of the estate in the key areas of agricultural development and environmental protection will elevate the already high standing of Johnstown, both locally, nationally and internationally.  I heartily commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to contribute on what must be regarded as a happy day for County Wexford.  It is interesting and coincidental that my constituency colleague is delivering the good news.  Like everybody in County Wexford and beyond, I heartily welcome the Bill for the many reasons mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The siting of the Environment Protection Agency in Johnstown Castle is not a coincidence for the many reasons outlined and others I will mention.  Johnstown Castle and its grounds are beautiful and, without repeating the points made by the Minister, one would have <Col N="2332" /> to travel far to find a castle and grounds more beautiful.  I also commend the owners, Dorothy Violet Jefferies and Maurice Victor Lakin, for their gift to the nation in the 1940s.  I like to think their aims at that time have been achieved and that the Department has never gone overboard.</P>
    <P>In common with my colleague. Deputy Browne, I welcome the Environmental Protection Agency to County Wexford.  It is not a coincidence that it has remained in the county and will move to Johnstown Estate where it should have been sited in the first place. The suggestion at the time was that it should move to the castle but the cost of refurbishing it was approximately £5 million.  This may not be an accurate figure, but it would not be much less and this would deter any Department from making an immediate move to it.  The best possible use of the castle is as a tourist attraction.  Under the agreement it was stipulated that the grounds would not be altered and would be maintained and I am happy to say that is the case. Each year approximately 1.5 million tourists pass by the gates of Johnstown Castle on the way to their destination but it has never been sold as a tourist attraction.  Perhaps it should be.</P>
    <P>I commend the Environmental Protection Agency for the work it has done to date and there is no finer place to continue this work than Johnstown Castle.  Teagasc staff have been engaged in environmental research work and Marie Sherwood, a person before her time, has done absolutely wonderful work under Tom Walsh, Pierce Ryan and John Lee.  Many people work in Johnstown Castle, including the Minister's brother who is now Mayor of Wexford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot claim credit for getting him the job because he has been working there for quite some time.  They do wonderful work at Johnstown Castle and as a farmer I have learned a great deal about <Col N="2333" /> soil tests.  The proposed activities are complementary to the work already carried out and it is no coincidence that Johnstown Castle will house the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>The Bill was passed by the Seanad and I know it will have the full support of this side of the House.  I too am anxious that the Environmental Protection Agency is established in Johnstown Castle as soon as possible.  This will bring additional permanent employment to the area, which is most welcome. I am glad also that under the decentralisation programme officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will move to Wexford.</P>
      <P>As the Johnstown Estate is so beautiful it is essential that any new buildings are in keeping with the grounds and the castle.  Often the aesthetics are forgotten. When An Foras Talúntais was established in Johnstown Castle the same care was not taken with the building as I would have expected.  It will, of course, cost a little extra but I ask the Minister to ensure that these buildings not alone complement the site but enhance it.</P>
      <P>Great efforts are made to promote the heritage of County Wexford and Johnstown Castle should play a major role in that.  Will the Minister take a more active role in the refurbishment of the castle?  I accept that it will not all be done at one time but organisations in County Wexford are restoring other buildings and we could take a leaf out of their book as to how this might be achieved.  The Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry should not be expected to pay the full cost of refurbishment of £5 million but work could be carried out on a phased basis with the support of voluntary bodies such as WORD &mdash; the Wexford Organisation for Rural Development &mdash; which is located near Johnstown Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is essential to County Wexford because of the decline in agricultural employment.  It has been said that 80 per cent of the country's heritage is <Col N="2334" /> in County Wexford and 80 per cent of Wexford's heritage is in South Wexford. Heritage is being taken very seriously. Hook lighthouse dating from the 14th century is the oldest in Europe and one of the four oldest in the world.  It has been handed over to the local community and from April this year people will be able to go to the top of the lighthouse. One could not do this heretofore. The original tower dates from the 11th to the 14th century and prior to that monks lit bush fires there to warn ships. This is linked to the heritage of Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to allow part of the estate to be sold on to local interests.  I too have been contacted by St. Martin's GAA club.  The club does a good job &mdash; George O'Connor is a household name in County Wexford and in Ireland &mdash; and most of the people involved in it work in Johnstown Castle. I commend the Minister for making provision in the Bill to accommodate the wishes of local people.</P>
    <P>The Opposition is expected to criticise the Government's proposed legislation but I have no criticism of this Bill. Will the Minister ensure that the buildings put in place to accommodate the Environmental Protection Agency will enhance the grounds and the buildings in the Johnstown Estate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This is simple, but highly significant enabling legislation to which for a number of reasons, my party and I give full and unqualified support.  In locating the national headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency outside the capital city, in County Wexford, the Minister is endorsing the principle of decentralisation which I support. For this reason alone he should be commended and applauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker that Johnstown Castle is a suitable location for the headquarters of such a prestigious body.  The agency has been of importance since its inception because of the tasks entrusted to it under the Act.  Additional duties will be placed on it under the provisions of the waste <Col N="2335" /> management legislation.  As it is the primary custodian of our natural environment, it is of fundamental importance that its headquarters be located in such a prestigious location as Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>Listening to the dialogue across the floor between the two Deputies from Wexford I felt I was only an eavesdropper and was expecting it to be put to the music of &ldquo;The Boys of Wexford&rdquo; at any moment.  I do not, however, consider myself to be an outsider so far as this matter is concerned.  The Act under which the agency was established was steered through the House by the leader of my party, Deputy Mary Harney. While no member of my party had the unique privilege of being born in County Wexford we can claim credit for putting the legislation in place.  In this connection Deputy Harney identified Johnstown Castle as a suitable location for the national headquarters of the agency.</P>
    <P>I wish to express the gratitude of the people to the donors who left a significant gift to the nation.  I have never visited the castle, but I am happy to hear that it is being well looked after both in law and practice.  I support the request by Deputy Byrne that the architecture of the new purpose built building should not alone complement, but enhance, the existing buildings and add to the overall atmosphere of what appears to be a beautiful demesne.  The Minister is well positioned to ensure this.</P>
    <P>I also wish to express my appreciation of the work being done by the agency. While I acknowledge that it has a budget of £8 million this year the Minister should be constantly aware of the need to provide adequate and sufficient resources to enable it carry out all its functions fully.  A range of additional functions will be placed on it under the Waste Management Bill.  If the provisions of that legislation are to be implemented in full, it is of fundamental importance that the agency be adequately resourced to enable it carry <Col N="2336" /> out its duties in overseeing its objectives. That should be the primary objective not alone of the Minister but of successive Ministers.  The agency is one of the most important public bodies to be established in my lifetime.</P>
    <P>Currently, the agency has five regional units.  This should be welcomed. The fact that we locate the national headquarters of a body outside the capital city does not necessarily mean that there is no scope for further decentralisation.  I am glad that is happening in this case.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that a unit of the agency is located in Cork which has a mixed history of controversy in regard to economic development on the one hand and the preservation and protection of the environment on the other. It was a source of reassurance to those who were concerned about the environment to know that there was a unit of the agency in the area.  This enabled further economic development to take place, once an assurance was given that it would not impinge on the quality of the environment, particularly air quality.</P>
    <P>It is a happy coincidence that Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency will be located side by side, cheek by jowl.  Teagasc plays an important role in providing information to the agricultural community.  People have concerns and anxieties, particularly about water quality.  In this connection Teagasc has provided good and solid advice to the agricultural community on best practice to ensure water quality is not endangered by agricultural practices.  Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency are key Government agencies involved in environmental protection.</P>
    <P>I give the Bill my unstinting approval and hope that it will pass through the House quickly.  There is no legitimate reason for delaying its passage.  The Minister can then proceed to provide for the relocation of the Environmental Protection Agency in Johnstown Castle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for ensuring that his Department would be in a position to introduce this legislation expeditiously.  Considerable background work has been done in providing the legal basis for the utilisation in the public interest of the land at Johnstown Castle.  Discussions have taken place with the Office of the Attorney General, departmental officials, the local authorities and many interested groups.  I pay tribute to all concerned.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see Johnstown Castle becoming the focus of attention for major investment.  The primary purpose of the Bill, as outlined by the Minister for the Environment, is to make provision for the Environmental Protection Agency to establish its permanent headquarters in Johnstown Castle.  I welcome this provision.  I also welcome the provision whereby Teagasc may dispose of part of the estate, not exceeding 5 per cent of the land comprised therein, for environmental, heritage, recreational or amenity uses.  This is an important provision as Teagasc has during the years received requests from local interests for limited access to land in Johnstown.  In addition to these specific conditions, under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc is required to obtain my approval for all land disposals.  This requirement will apply to disposals at Johnstown under the provision proposed in this amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Johnstown Castle Estate will become the focus of attention with the establishment of the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency.  A total of 350 staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will decentralise to Johnstown Castle in the summer of 1998.  The Government made this decision last year and I am pleased to inform the House that this project is continuing apace.  A site has been selected in Johnstown Castle Estate and the necessary tendering and planning process is under way.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and I <Col N="2338" /> met on the site last Saturday and I thank officials from the Office of Public Works, my Department and those managing the estate who attended at rather unsocial hours to select a suitable site.  I am pleased we have short-circuited this process and an excellent 17 acre field site facing the lake and St. Martin's GAA club has been selected.  It has all the necessary facets.  It will have a separate independent access for the staff of the Department, spacious car parking facilities and will not interfere with the tourism aspects of the museum or castle. At the same time, it is ideally located to be part of the central campus.  It is within walking distance of the castle and its beautiful and important features.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I are anxious that a campus-type development is put in place because between Teagasc, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry the number of staff involved will be almost 500, one of the largest decentralisation units. This is a terrific example of the Government's commitment to decentralisation. Up to now Wexford was somewhat neglected in terms of the decentralisation programme.  I thank officials for their help in selecting the site.</P>
    <P>The technical phases will be dealt with next.  This will mean assessment for drainage, discussions on a planning process with the local authority and so on. The Department's staff is due to move in autumn 1998.  We have set out a provisional timetable for the design stage, the selection of tenders and construction phase which will suit staff relocation requirements.  We have a blueprint in skeletal form which I hope our officials will be able to implement.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act, 1980, from time to time land may be leased by Teagasc to the State. This provision will enable the Office of Public Works to proceed with the provision of purpose built accommodation for the 350 civil servants concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2339" /> Areas selected as locations for decentralisation benefit greatly from the programme. The local economy of Wexford and neighbouring towns and villages, such as Piercetown, Murntown, Rosslare, New Ross, Enniscorthy, Blackwater and so on will receive a considerable economic boost from the injection of 430 salaries, that is the wages of the 350 plus 80 staff that will be involved.  It will have major spin-of effects for local business, shopkeepers, house builders and so on, but the benefits are not confined to economics.</P>

      <P>That goes without saying. There are also important social effects which will impact on the region.  The influx of 350 people to an area will play an important role in the regeneration of the area and will contribute in no small way to the future development and vitality of the county.  The McCarthy Cup could end up in Wexford as a result of this development.</P>

      <P>I am proud to be a member of a Government which selected Wexford as a location for decentralisation. As a rural Deputy I cannot place enough emphasis on the importance of the decentralisation programme.  It gives <Col N="2340" /> a substantial number of people an opportunity to return permanently to their local areas.  It also helps maintain and expand employment in the building industry, both in private housing and public buildings.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the transfer to Johnstown Castle will mean that more than 82 per cent of the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be located outside Dublin. The bulk of the Department is already decentralised.  Three-quarters of the Department's staff are already situated in some 30 locations throughout the country.  Those offices provide a comprehensive range of services to farmers. Through the Charter of Rights for Farmers we are providing 27 district livestock and veterinary offices.  I am confident this further decentralisation will not diminish the quality of service to farmers and industry.  It will represent an opportunity for change within the Department which will involve reviewing and improving our methods of dealing with farmers, upgrading technology and seeking better ways of carrying out the many functions of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government's decision to decentralise 350 staff to Johnstown Castle, an initial survey of all officers in the Department was undertaken to ascertain the level of interest among staff in relocating to Wexford.  Some 130 officers expressed an interest in transferring in their current grades.  To achieve the Government's announced target of 350, I intend to request my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to issue a circular seeking further volunteers from other Government Departments and I am confident of a successful response.  However, if the target is not met it may be necessary to arrange promotional competitions or to recruit direct through the Civil Service Commission to fill the remaining positions. A further number of people in my Department indicated they would be interested in moving to Wexford under those circumstances.  I am confident that with the assistance of the Minister for <Col N="2341" /> Finance, the co-operation of staff and trade union agreement we will achieve our target in the time set out.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle is approximately four miles from Wexford town.  It comprises a fine 19th century gothic revival castle and a demesne of approximately 1,000 acres of land which includes ornamental grounds, gardens, lakes and woodland.  The estate remained in private ownership until 1944 when the owners, Dorothy Violet Jefferies and Maurice Victor Larkin, made a gift of it to the nation.  The nation will be always grateful for this generous gift which has been put to good use.  In that regard credit is due to all political parties.  In 1945 we lacked educational facilities for the agricultural community.  Great progress has been made since then through the work of dedicated people in Johnstown Castle.  That castle is an extremely valuable asset and 50 years later the wide and courageous programme of research and development undertaken at Johnstown stands as a monument to all those dedicated people, particularly the donors who had a vision for the estate.</P>
    <P>The research programme is ongoing at Johnstown Castle through Teagasc and has rapidly developed as a world renowned soils research centre.  In recent years it developed a strong environmental research programme, designed to ensure that modern farming developments are compatible with high standards of environmental care.  It would be difficult to imagine a more suitable setting for this work and the location of the Environmental Protection Agency on the campus adds a further dimension.  Each of the two institutions will gain from the presence of the other and together they will help create a strong focus on the scientific and environmental expertise.</P>
    <P>The strategic goal of Teagasc Johnstown Castle Soils and Environmental Research Centre is to generate information that will enable preparation of codes of good practice for all aspects of farming to ensure that agriculture will not cause pollution of soil, water and air <Col N="2342" /> and a basis for cost effective fertiliser and trace element usage for crop and animal production.  The programme of work at the centre encompasses sustainable farming systems, environmental impact of nitrogen, waste management, land use management, soil fertility and analytical services on a nation-wide basis.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle Estate is also a major tourist attraction and more than 30,000 people visit the grounds every year. Twenty years ago the Irish Agricultural Museum was founded and registered as a non-trading co-operative. The general rules of the co-op were expanded to cover the specialised objective of an agricultural museum.  This type of basic organisation was considered appropriate in a country where so many agricultural activities are cooperatively organised.  The setting up of an organisation independent of the institute was deemed necessary for the rapid development of the museum and it enabled it to receive grant moneys which might otherwise have been denied it.  I hope the Teagasc commemoration of the Famine will be displayed permanently in this museum.  It may go on tour for a while and there was a reference to displaying it in the National Museum and Collins Barracks.  Given that it has 30,000 visitors Johnstown Agricultural Museum is the fitting home for this commemoration.  I am involved in discussions with interested parties to ensure this happens and I hope my officials can fully honour that commitment.</P>
    <P>The museum, which was opened in June 1979 by President Hillery, is located in the old farmyard building complex within the ornamental grounds of the castle estate.  It covers a timespan from the 1600s up to the last generation. This is being done by way of an informal arrangement with the heritage park at Ferrycarrig which focuses on earlier times.  The museum contains the largest collection of restored farm tools, machines and house furnishings in the country.  The display areas have been <Col N="2343" /> converted and restored from derelict farm buildings and the entire complex on display is a credit to all the dedicated staff and those people who lent and donated items to the museum.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle, which is now the focus of attention, will be a hive of activity in the future.  Enactment of the Bill will enable the Environmental Protection Agency to build on the Johnstown Castle estate and this, with the decentralisation of 350 staff from my Department, will enhance the standing of Johnstown locally, nationally and internationally.  I am confident that the two projects will have shared facilities in many areas during and after construction of the buildings.  County Wexford and the south east will benefit from these developments and I am satisfied that Wexford people will extend a warm and hearty welcome to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed within my Department about the decision to move out of Agriculture House and to relocate the offices in Dublin and Wexford. Senior management in the Department and I are anxious to ensure that there is minimum disruption and we have reached agreement with the Office of Public Works on sites in Dublin which will facilitate interaction with other Departments and the Parliament and retain as far as possible the homogenous working of the Department.  I hope any difficulties can be dealt with satisfactorily through dialogue with the appropriate unions.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment on the introduction of the Bill and thank him for his assistance in earmarking the site and ensuring that problems in regard to infrastructure etc., will be dealt with in co-operation with the local authorities.  Many opportunities exist for a slip between cup and lip but the decision has been taken by the Government and the timeframe is set in stone.  We are now seeking the co-operation of all officials to move ahead.</P>
    <P>This will be the single biggest economic development in the history of County Wexford.  By the turn of the <Col N="2344" /> century we will be talking about a permanent public facility which can generate £10 million in wages per annum and maintain ancillary services such as security guards, canteen facilities, etc. People as far away as Enniscorthy and New Ross will benefit from this development, the significance of which will only be seen in retrospect, as happened in the case of many of the developments put in place by Neil Blaney.</P>
    <P>I hope these proposals will receive the support of everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the introduction of the Bill and the proposed developments in Johnstown Castle.  As usual, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, proclaimed himself as the saviour of County Wexford.  However, this kind of statement is now wearing this among the public, particularly farmers, in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister for the Environment put much work into the preparation of the Bill.  When I was in the Department in July 1993 I was very involved in setting up the Environmental Protection Agency on a temporary basis in Ardcavan.  At that time it was intended to locate the Environmental Protection Agency in Johnstown Castle but in view of the exorbitant costs involved in renovating the castle the Cabinet decided not to proceed with the proposal.  I discussed the matter on numerous occasions with the Minister. Deputy Howlin, who was also at the Cabinet table at that time in an effort to <Col N="2345" /> ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency would be located in Wexford. Some members of Fianna Fáil and Labour believed that the agency should be located in Dublin while many Fine Gael Deputies, including Deputy Barry, believed it should be located in Cork. Thankfully, it was eventually decided to locate the agency in Wexford.</P>
    <P>As an independent body and custodian of the environment, the Environmental Protection Agency must have the confidence of the public.  The fact that it has been able to achieve this in such a short time is due to the decision of the previous Government and this Government to allocate substantial funding to it.  There was little point in setting up the agency if adequate finance was not made available.  A significant number of staff are employed in Wexford while the five regional centres play a major part in the protection and enhancement of the environment.</P>
    <P>Johnstown Castle has always been dear to the hearts of Wexford people and those involved in the agricultural industry.  The late Dr. Tom Walsh pioneered agricultural research and development in the estate long before it was popular.  Johnstown Castle, which is in the heart of agricultural Wexford, has played a significant role in the development of agriculture and it is only correct that the Environmental Protection Agency and the proposed developments should be located there permanently.</P>
    <P>All too often in the past new developments took a long time to come on stream.  However, the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have clearly given priority to the new buildings.  It is important that they fit in with the castle and the existing buildings.  Johnstown Castle is a major tourism centre but it has not been fully exploited from the point of view of the tourism industry. The castle should be developed even further and I am sure the Ministers, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Yates, will ensure further tourism growth there.  It was suggested some years ago that the <Col N="2346" /> castle should be developed as a rural heritage and tourism centre.  The Office of Public Works looked into that possibility at one stage and it should be reconsidered.  Perhaps the Minister could think about the further development of the castle.  The attractions include the castle itself, the grounds and the lakes.  There are currently 30,000 visitors a year and we should build on that tourism potential, not alone for Wexford but for the south-east region.  We should ensure it is exploited to its full extent.  The local authorities in Wexford have developed the heritage park, the Westgate heritage centre and other amenities.  If the castle was blended into those developments it could become part of a tourist trail which could be expanded and encourage many more visitors to the south east.  Currently 1 million people per year come through Rosslare, going to the west, the south and other areas.  We need something to hold them for a night or two in Wexford. If the castle was developed along the lines of Bunratty we could keep them in Wexford for an extra few days to spend their money.</P>
    <P>I am glad that for other purposes the Minister has included the development of the lands at Johnstown Castle.  Like Deputy Byrne and himself.  I was approached last year by St. Martin's GAA club and it is important that such community groups should be considered for extra land should it become available. That club has pioneered many ventures for young people, not alone in hurling and football but other sports, a community centre and further facilities. It needs extra lands for playing pitches. When the Bill passes, discussions can take place between the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the club to ensure it is facilited as much as possible in land development.</P>
    <P>It was important that the Minister, Deputy Yates, clarified the staffing of the new development.  Many people working in Dublin in other Departments are under the impression they cannot go to Johnstown Castle.  It <Col N="2347" /> should be spelled out that people in the Department of the Environment, the Department of Social Welfare and other Departments, especially those from Wexford, have the opportunity to apply and be selected to go to Wexford.  The Minister will not get the numbers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Those from the south east, Wexford in particular, should be given a chance to return home.</P>
    <P>When the Minister announced the plans for the castle and the transfer of the Department I welcomed them because any development of that magnitude has to be good for the overall economy of the county.  It will generate extra expenditure in Wexford town and other towns in the hinterland.  People will also be looking for houses.  I am glad the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is coming to Wexford and the Environmental Protection Agency will be centred on a permanent basis in Johnstown Castle.  It is the pioneering centre of agricultural development and, having expanded into specific environmental areas, the Environmental Protection Agency will supplement and complement that development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will be passed as quickly as possible.  The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be building new offices at Johnstown Castle and I am sure both Ministers will insist that they blend in with the castle and other existing buildings. The Minister said it would be ready for opening in 1998.</P>

Oakpark research station is set in a lovely old house, with a similar history to Wexford. I am serious about bringing some section of Government to Carlow.  I thought the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry might come.  Unfortunately it has gone to the next county but we hope for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important legislation because the Environmental Protection Agency should have proper facilities and a new building.  For the sake of everyone, the <Col N="2350" /> best brains must be involved in the agency, they must have the best facilities and they should work in a nice environment.  I have to admit Johnstown Castle is a lovely building in nice surroundings and anyone who is lucky enough to work there should live to a ripe old age, even after retirement.  I was fascinated by the Minister's account of the history of Johnstown Castle and his description of the estate which comprises 1,000 acres including ornamental grounds etc.  For many years it was undisturbed.  Then, probably to take account of changing times, an Act was introduced in 1945 followed by other Acts in1959, 1980 and 1988.  Now, in 1996, we have another.</P>
    <P>Change is part and parcel of life, and this Bill is to meet the need to set up the Environmental Protection Agency at Johnstown Castle.  The 1945 Act provided that the property was to be used as an agricultural college; the ornamental nature of the gardens and pleasure grounds were to be left as they were, and ornamental timber was not to be felled.  One might have thought that in 1945 people would have taken the attitude that timber was there to be used, but credit is due to the legislators at the time who saw in advance the need to protect this beautiful demesne and provided for the preservation of the timber, sporting rights and rights of way.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais acquired Johnstown Castle in 1959.  Permission had to be given for some of the land to be sold off.  I note the present plan includes an amendment to allow the sale of certain parts.  The representatives of football clubs in the area will arrive at politicians clinics in droves looking for a bit of land.  It is as well that there is a 5 per cent limit on the amount that can be given away.  Otherwise there would be applications to build all sorts of sports arenas and even, eventually, an Olympic stadium.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It is <Col N="2351" /> a pity he does not have facilities like these because he would use them well.</P>
      <P>It is important that agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency should be decentralised, although some people complain that too many Departments are leaving Dublin &mdash; I am sure the civil servants who have set up home here would prefer to stay here. However, it is far better that independent sections of Departments should be located in the country where people can see that the people working in them are normal, rather than thinking that everybody in Dublin or in the Civil Service is out to touch with reality.  Because people working in the Environmental Protection Agency at Johnstown Castle will be very much in touch with nature and their surroundings, they will know exactly what should be done.  There is not enough decentralisation.  That is why I said earlier that Carlow, which is so convenient to Dublin and has such modern facilities, should be seriously considered in the context of decentralisation, and that is something for which I will lobby.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Bill provides for the transfer of land.  The politicians must have had a great night when they arrived at unsocial hours, even after pub closing time, to mark out the site &mdash; I hope they were all perfectly sober when they marked out the site and they picked a spot that will afford a perfect view to everybody working there.</P>
      <P>There is not much more one can say on the Bill without reading what has been said by many others.  I genuinely welcome the Bill and congratulate the people of Wexford on this marvellous facility which will continue to expand.  I welcome the setting up of the Environmental Protection Agency in a place as pleasant as this and wish every success to those who will work there.  It is important from the nation's point of view to have the best facility available and to have the best brains available to run it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate, particularly my Wexford colleagues.  There is enthusiasm throughout the House for the Environmental Protection Agency, the concept for which took a long time to formulate.  A very detailed Bill establishing the agency passed thorugh this House some years ago.  The agency is now up and running as an important engine for environmental protection, and I am delighted to be in a position, as Minister for the Environment with responsibility for environmental protection, to propose such a beautiful, prestigious location for the permanent headquarters of this significant agency.  That it is in my constituency makes it of double benefit to me.  I cannot claim credit for the initial idea because I was not Minister for the Environment at the time it was suggested, but I will certainly claim credit for holding it at that location when others wanted to move it. It will be to the benefit of all concerned, those who work in the agency and those who visit our country to see the agency, that it is not in a building in the middle of a congested city but in a pristine beautiful environment that will inspire anyone who works there or visits.</P>
      <P>Many comments have been made with which I will deal briefly.  The future of the castle was mentioned by Deputy Hugh Byrne.  It is an important issue. The agency will be on site in the demesne but not in the castle.  The castle, historic buildings, and ornamental grounds will be untouched by this development or by the development proposed for the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is most important that that beautiful facility kept intact for the last 50 years remains so.  That is my intention and the intention of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of the House the site immediately behind the existing car park has been chosen.  It will look onto a lovely open area directly opposite the castle but sufficiently secluded from the castle not to impact on it.  The building will also be constructed so as not to <Col N="2353" /> detract from the beautiful built environment currently in Johnstown.  The location, heights etc, have been carefully taken into account.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work went into the preparation of this short Bill not only in the context of consultations but also in the context of the legal advice, because I was aware there had been a number of Bills that amended the uses of this estate.  It will be some time before there will be a requirement for a future Bill. Not only does this Bill provide a facility for the Environmental Protection Agency, it contains an enabling provision for the disposal of up to 5 per cent of the estate generally for other purposes.  Future needs should, therefore, be accommodated without having to have recourse to further legislation.  I am delighted that, with the help of the legal terms in the Attorney General's office I was able to do in this Bill what was not possible previously.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and its decentralisation, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, has given a detailed outline of that.  I look forward to four or five years from now when up to 600 people will work on the Johnstown site.  It will be a magnificent campus.  I make no secret that it has been a passion of mine for many years to have the Environmental Protection Agency there as a centre of environmental excellence and research. The soil division of Teagasc will do superb work and will complement the Environmental Protection Agency in monitoring soil pollution, carrying out analyses and planning the way ahead. We will have a number of other initiatives in the environmental sphere.  I will not spell them out as they sometimes evaporate when aired.</P>
    <P>It is a major bonus not only for Wexford but the entire country to have such a synergy of environmental excellence. I will pay personal attention to the quality of the building.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Byrne in congratulating Teagasc on its work to date.  There were <Col N="2354" /> dark days when there was rationalisation in Teagasc but Dr. John Lee and his staff endured those hard times and made progress.  It is now established on a firm financial footing and has a secure future.  I pay tribute to Dr. Austin O'Sullivan for the National Agricultural Museum.  He created a magnificent museum virtually single handedly which attracts up to 30,000 people per year. There are plans for its future expansion and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry mentioned some of them. There is no room in the National Museum for some of the exhibitions and these will be decentralised to the National Agricultural Museum.  It has great tourism potential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill welcomed the Bill and spoke about decentralisation.  We cannot allow the capital city, which has one-third of the population, to keep growing nor can we put more and more environmental pressure on it.  It is important to decentralise State agencies to regional centres and this has been the policy of successive Governments.  This Government is carrying out as much decentralisation as is proper.</P>
    <P>She mentioned the role of the Environmental Protection Agency and the resources required.  Some £8 million is available to the Environmental Protection Agency this year.  I had discussions with the employees.  The board of management and the five directors are excited by the plans to develop their functions.  Under the waste Bill they will have a new function in monitoring land-fill and will also be involved when the integrated pollution control licensing process is extended to further activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry outlined its importance for Wexford.  Not only will it be of immense value in itself but will attract further development, research and education opportunities.  This is an important time for Wexford.  Deputy Browne who represents Carlow/Kilkenny will forgive us if we are delighted.  I acknowledge the role played by my constituency colleague, Deputy Browne, who was Minister of State in the Department of the <Col N="2355" /> Environment.  When we were in Government we were anxious to ensure that everything on the agency came to pass.</P>
    <P>Senators dealt at some length with the historic role of Johnstown in the development of agriculture.  Following the war and in the early 1950s when agricultural education was limited, places like Johnstown Castle provided farmers with skills that were not available elsewhere.  It is important to recognise that as we map out a future role for the estate which will serve the nation into the next millennium.  The future of the castle must be worked out in some detail.  It will not be affected by the Environmental Protection Agency or decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It has great potential.  We look to a new functional role for the castle in the campus we are creating on that site.  Deputy Browne lamented the fact that this infrastructure is not going to his constituency. That is understandable but he will acknowledge that this will be an asset not only for Wexford and the south-east, including Carlow, but also for the nation.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for giving such a warm welcome to the Bill.  The Office of Public Works will issue tenders when the Bill is enacted.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Cowen on Tuesday, 20 February 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's neglect of the cattle and beef industry and calls on the Minister for Agriculture to restore both competitiveness in the food industry and cattle farmers' incomes by securing the restoration in full of export refunds and calls on the Minister to fulfill his long standing commitment to institute a package of measures to sustain the sector in the face of unrelenting pressure resulting from the strength of the punt against sterling.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the measures which have already been taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the difficulties being experienced by beef producers, commends efforts by the Minister to secure a full restoration of export refunds and welcomes the measures contained in the Structural Fund Food Sub-Programme and in the recent budget to improve the competitiveness of the beef industry.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  As the whole agricultural sector knows, the beef crisis which has been festering for some time has reached the point where farmers, particularly beef farmers, are very angry at the lack of action by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Government.  Fianna Fáil has consistently outlined the crisis in the beef industry to this Government and the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has reneged on his responsibilities to the farmers and has now resorted to the ploy of blaming the European Commission and bureaucrats for problems which were well signposted as far back as August and September. Since last September export refuds have been cut by over 30 per cent.  This is causing severe hardship for farmers, particularly those in the beef sector.  On Friday, 2 February, the Minister showed a complete lack of concern for beef farmers by accepting an entirely unsatisfactory solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>Last June the Minister promised to implement a special package to help the processing sector survive the pressure of the sterling crisis but we are still awaiting that package.  Sterling has fluctuated in value over the past number of weeks, averaging between £1.03 and £1.04 to the Irish punt.  This is creating severe problems for those involved in the beef processing sector and all other Irish food manufacturers who export to the UK and further afield.  Sterling has recently stabilised and rallied a little but commentators suggest that this is only a temporary reprieve as far as Irish food manufacturers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in export refunds for cattle has had devastating results, particularly for farmers who bought during last September and October at prices of £1.05 and £1.06 per pound and now, four months later, have to sell at 98p per pound.  Independent analysis suggests that farmers who have been caught in this situation will lose between £70 and £100 per beast.  Teagasc figures show that a price of £1.05 or £1.06 is required <Col N="2358" /> by beef producers to break even.  A loss at £70 per head on 460,000 steers over the spring period will show a loss of £32 million to Irish beef producers.</P>
    <P>Farmers are furious at the apparent lack of concern by this Minister and Government.  The indifference shown by the Minister to the escalating problem is staggering.  Some 40,000 beef farmers were left out of the CAP reforms three years ago and now have to survive on incomes of less than £4,000 per year.  The Minister has failed miserably to convince the beef management committee in Brussels of the plight of Irish beef producers.  Winter finishers are facing a nightmare scenario.  The Minister failed to deliver on his June promise to implement a special package to help the processing sector survive the pressure of the sterling crisis.  Farmers who were hoping that matters would improve have been holding back on stock, awaiting an improvement.  Now with the lower export refunds in operation and no competition from the live trade there is a realistic fear that prices will fall even further.</P>
    <P>What started some time ago as a problem has now become a disaster for beef producers.  We on this side of the House have outlined over a number of weeks the concerns of the beef farm sector. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the problem lies with bureaucrats in Brussels.  The recent unseemly public row with the Commissioner for Agriculture did nothing to enhance the standing of Irish agriculture or that of the Minister within the Council of Ministers.  If this is the best that the Minister can do, the Taoiseach should look seriously at what is happening in the agriculture sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion calls on the Government to restore confidence in the cattle trade and the income of cattle farmers by restoring in full the export refunds.  In mid November 1995 the export refunds were reduced by a staggering 25 per cent.  By the beginning of December 14 per cent was restored and a further 5 per cent was restored at the <Col N="2359" /> beginning of this month.  However, it is still 6 or 7 per cent short of the 100 per cent refund which we had in November 1995.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of misunderstanding in relation to farmers' incomes. The simple fact is that 50 per cent of Irish farmers have an annual income of less than £5,000, which is less than £100 per week.  People on social welfare who do not have any land get more than that. We must bear in mind the size of farmers' incomes.  Farmers are also criticised for paying less income tax than the PAYE sector.  They would be delighted to pay income tax if their incomes warranted it but they cannot pay very much tax on incomes of £100 per week.  There are very few farmers with 100 cattle or 500 acres of tillage.</P>
      <P>In Ireland 15.4 per cent of the workforce is engaged in agriculture compared with 6.8 per cent in the rest of Europe and 2.2 per cent in the United Kingdom.  Cuts in refunds and subsidies mean little to the English farmer but they mean a great deal to our farmers. Some 41 per cent of the income of the average farmer comes from subsidies &mdash; 72 per cent of the income of cattle farmers and 92 per cent of the income of sheep farmers comes from subsidies. That emphasises the importance of achieving the maximum subsidies and export refunds.  In today's newspaper farmers are criticised for using illegal drugs in the production of beef.  It is stated that the use of illegal drugs is at a ridiculously high level.  However, that has been refuted by scientists who say that of 60,590 samples taken last year, a very small percentage was found to contain drugs.  Admittedly, we should not be satisfied until their use is eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparing the performance of our farmers with that of farmers in other European countries, we are the second on the scale of those not using illegal drugs &mdash; Denmark has a clean sheet in that respect.  With the continuing vigilance of the Department we too should achieve that goal in the near future.  Will the Minister say what has happened to <Col N="2360" /> farmers who were found guilty of using illegal drugs, particularly angel dust? We produce excellent beef and lamb and it is important that a quality product be produced without the aid of illegal drugs.</P>

      <P>Having read and listened to the contributions of the Opposition it seems its sole motive in proposing this motion is to place the blame on the Minister's shoulders.  That is of no benefit to beef farmers who experience serious difficulties.  We approached this debate in a much more positive light.  In a crisis such as this, it is imperative that parties from all sides of the House co-operate in finding solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not the cause of the problem and any <Col N="2361" /> attempt to place the blame on him is indicative of a lack of understanding of the beef industry and, worse still, a lack of determination and ability to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>One would think from listerning to contributions such as that of Deputy Nolan that in the beef industry we are our own masters.  It took everybody involved in agriculture a long time to realise that we can no longer have complete control over the direction of the industry.  We are influenced by decisions in Brussels, as we learned many years ago, and that should not be news to the Opposition.  Sadly, in a debate such as this, it is very easy for the Opposition to play politics on the backs of beef farmers. This motion will be worthwhile only if positive and realistic proposals are put forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister has worked tirelessly on behalf of beef farmers, as he did successfully on behalf of other sectors that experienced difficulty during the past year.  He is as concerned as all of us with the enormous reduction in price for beef.  He has not yet succeeded in finding a solution to the difficulties faced by producers and nobody is satisfied with the degree of progress made, but it deserves acknowledgment.  The Minister is determined not to cease his work on behalf of beef farmers until he has succeeded in getting a realistic and sustainable price for beef.  He gave a commitment that he will press extremely hard the case for the restoration of refunds to a level that will render Irish beef competitive on the international market, thereby providing producers with an acceptable return on their investment and effort.</P>
      <P>Cattle producers are an essential part of the agricultural industry.  Their livelihoods must be protected.  Looking back on 1995, irrespective of which side of the House we sit on, we must accept it was a good year for agriculture in general. It was good for dairying and tillage, and it is sad that on this occasion it is the beef producer who is suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased with the efforts of the Minister on behalf of beef farmers.  He <Col N="2362" /> intends to visit Paris in the next few days to seek support for our case.  It is essential if we are to win the case for beef producers that we have the support of other beef producing states.  People with experience and knowledge of the agricultural industry are aware that we cannot fight a lone case in Brussels, particularly on this issue given that the Commission believes the price for beef in the vast majority of countries is relatively high.  We are more or less alone in our difficulties in this regard.  It is very prudent of the Minister therefore to try to get the support of other member states who are sympathetic to our cause. As Deputy Foxe said, it is important that farmers' incomes be considered realistically.  I hope we do not hear criticism in this debate of the level of income tax paid by farmers.  Farmers who have a taxable income are happy to pay income tax.  Beef farmers who have made major financial investments in the industry cannot be expected to continue to sustain enormous losses.  I hope the Minister will be as successful in arguing their case as he was in the case of sheep farmers and other sectors in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to deal with all the problems in the beef sector in the four or five minutes at my disposal because of the way business is organised.  I hope I do not skip some important points due to the time constraints.</P>
      <P>There are some undeniable facts about the beef crisis which have been raised in the House on three of four occasions during recent months.  Those with winter fatteners are experiencing a dreadful time.  They have sheds full of expensive cattle which were bought when cattle prices were at their highest. To make matters worse meal prices have begun to escalate and, furthermore, factories have decided to reduce their prices.  Taken together, that means that many farmers, particularly those with winter fatteners, have major problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is agonising that in other European <Col N="2363" /> Union countries most farmers with winter fatteners fare well and across the Community the price of steers is high. That weakens our case immeasurably. It means that ours is the only country suffering as a result of this price decline. We are on our own.  The Minister's counterparts in Europe have not encountered the same problems and they will not support our case.  Our only hope lies with the French who are also experiencing some problems.  I am glad the Minister will be meeting his French counterpart in Paris next week.  That is a welcome move because we do not have enough friends where we need them.  It is useful to set the problem in that context.</P>
    <P>Another major problem that confronted us at the wrong time related to our shipment of live cattle.  Our share of the Egyptian market has been eroded. We have been caught out by the Australians and others.  Last November members of the European beef management committee must have known that a dramatic cut in export refunds would cause major problems for a country like Ireland.  I do not know the principles to which members of that committee adhere, but we, like other member states of the European Union, must abide by European laws and rules.  It is not fair to pick out 13,000 or 14,000 Irish farmers for rough treatment.  That matter must be addressed at a higher level.</P>
    <P>We are net exporters of meat and live cattle.  It was never intended that any country would be forced to lose its beef market share through developments that took place last November.  As if we did not have enough problems, the meat factories behaved like they behaved through the years.  Since 1 January 1996 all meat factories owe farmers with whom they did business an additional 2p per pound of beef.  Had a proper level of competition prevailed in the market-place, farmers would not have any trouble in getting an extra 2p per pound for beef.  I do not know what strictures can be placed on meat factories, but through the years it appears that as soon <Col N="2364" /> as the demand for live cattle fell at marts invariably the factories reduced their prices.</P>
    <P>In the short-term only one avenue of redress is open to farmers.  The Minister is exploring this avenue and many others are helping him in that regard. Whatever hope we have of convincing the beef management committee, the Council of Ministers and the Commission that a grave wrong has been done to our live cattle trade, in the short-term we must press hard for increased export refunds for live cattle. That would mean that on the day of a sale there would be competition among factory buyers.  That is the only hope those with winter fatteners have of securing price stability or a price increase for the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>I have always been told, and accepted, that strategic planning is necessary and very important.  It is a type of an eleventh commandant issued from Brussels on occasions such as this. The Commission and the beef management committee have broken that.  How could they expect orderly marketing if they allowed Irish farmers to buy the most expensive store cattle last August and September and a month later when those farmers' sheds were full they decided to change the ground rules overnight?  Given that background to this crisis, our 13,000 or 14,000 winter beef fatteners should feel very aggrieved.  I hope when the Minister meets his French and other counterparts next week he will be able to set up a machanism to create more competition. That will be difficult to achieve, but the creation of more competition in the marketplace is the only hope of redress for our farmers in the short-term.  If the factories want cattle, they will pay for them.  That has been the bottom line down the years.  It is difficult to predict the level of beef prices in the long-term. At present we are caught in a catch 22 situation.  There should be equality among EU countries, but our EU partners decided to change the ground rules. They will have an opportunity in the next week or two to address that <Col N="2365" /> inequality to some degree through the creation of more competition in the marketplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion. Coming from County Westmeath and as a former agricultural consultant, I cannot but be aware of the acute problems being experienced by beef producers. Coming from one of the largest beef producing counties, I am aware that farmers have sheds full of cattle which were bought when cattle prices were high in the autumn and now prices have gone in the wrong direction for producers at the wrong time.  Westmeath has a significant number of farmers with winter fatteners.  This segment of beef producers has felt the effects of various reductions in export refunds during recent months, particularly since September 1995.  Those who have a shred of knowledge about the beef sector would be acutely aware of the role played by that group of producers in the overall beef trade.  They would be particularly aware of the important contribution played by beef farmers in ensuring an orderly flow of cattle in the beef sector, particularly in dealing with the peak and valley ratios which were important in 1979 when I undertook a study of them. Those with winter fatteners have played a significant role in ensuring a steady supply of cattle for factories at a particular crucial juncture.  They also played an important role in employment creation at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of cuts in export refunds on beef and live cattle exports to third country markets has meant losses in this sector of between £65 and £70 per head. It is well recognised that winter fatteners incur significant feeding and housing costs.  In normal circumstances cattle prices would increase at this time of the year and farmers should be compensated for those additional and variable costs.  Some decisions taken at European Union level undoubtedly relate to difficulties encountered in the implementation of the GATT and restrictions on export licences issued <Col N="2366" /> rather than to actual physical exports, which apparently led the Commission to take a number of restrictive steps.  These included cuts in export refunds and a substantial increase in the rate of security for export licences, followed by an unbelievable cut of 25 per cent in export refunds in November last, although there was a subsequent partial reveral of those cuts.  I know the Minister made strong representations to Commissioners Fischler, requesting an immediate increase in export refunds and that he raised the matter with the beef management committee and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>While increases of up to 7.5 per cent in refunds were announced on 2 February, they were inadequate to compensate our producers &mdash; the bottom line &mdash; because of the destabilisation of the market and the impact on cattle prices, both of which can be traced back to the magnitude of the initial cuts in export refunds.</P>
    <P>Some of our European counterparts do not appear to adequately understand our very heavy dependence on the beef industry; we export over 70 per cent of our steer beef to world markets, making us much more vulnerable to cuts in export refunds than any other member state.  For example, approximately 4 per cent only of German beef is exported, another clear illustration of how any cut in export refunds has a much greater effect on us.</P>
    <P>We must insist on the immediate restoration of export refunds to levels which will underpin an acceptable price level for our producers, one that will provide them with a reasonable return on their investments and efforts.  In this endeavour I urge the Minister to secure the support of one or two other beef-producing member states, particularly France, and welcome the fact that he appears to be taking that route because any attempt to fight such a case in isolation will be particularly difficult.</P>
    <P>Since we shall hold the Presidency of the European Union in the latter half of this year, our case must be argued strongly, clearly understood and result <Col N="2367" /> in positive action.  At a recent Irish Farmers' Association information seminar a very strong, convincing argument was advanced on the qualification limit used in calculating figures to trigger eligibility for the winter slaughter premia.  The 40 per cent rate set for September to November to trigger eligibility for this premium must be reduced to 35 per cent which, based on figures for the same period in 1995, will ensure that Ireland will qualify for a £60 per head premium in 1997, worth approximately £60 million per annum to our farmers.</P>
    <P>While fully appreciating that the premium system has made a significant contribution to the income of our beef farmers, the reality for winter fatteners is that premia will already have been claimed for many of the cattle they had purchased to fatten, which means those farmers will not derive full benefit from these special beef premia.</P>
    <P>While appreciating that the Minister has firmly and properly outlined the obstacles and background, at technical and political levels, to his efforts to secure progress to overcome the problems being encountered by farmers engaged in winter fattening at this time, I urge him to continue to press our case that export refunds be increased to a more effective, realistic level to give some hope, especially to winter fatteners, in overcoming the very severe problems they have encountered over the past six months or so.</P>

      <P>I have every sympathy with the plight of the Fianna Fáil party because it must be tiresome to find oneself relegated to the Opposition benches without anything to oppose.  Its plight became abundantly clear during the recent budget debate when the Soldiers of Destiny searched desperately for a single measure they could credibly criticise and, instead, resorted to incoherent and, in the case of Deputy Joe Walsh, innumerable bleeps about ministerial advisers.

      <P>Judging by the motion before us, obviously Fianna Fáil has decided to abandon the struggle and return to its roots but what about the farmers?  Notwithstanding the difficulties faced by some producers &mdash; which I fully acknowledge &mdash; large farmers have never had it so good.  As an urban Deputy, representing PAYE workers and those without work, I am constantly bemused by the extent to which the farming sector can benefit from a variety of grants, perks, tax breaks and the like.</P>
      <P>A short two weeks ago, in reply to a parliamentary question, the House was informed that in 1995 the average income tax take from a PAYE worker was £4,087 while that from a farmer was £1,031, clearly demonstrating that PAYE workers pay through the nose in terms of taxes and higher food prices to support an agricultural system long out of control.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>My quarrel is not with the Minister's handling of the system, which has been outstanding, but with the system itself.  While thousands of small farmers are barely able to eke out a living from their land and are forced to engage in part-time work to make ends meet, the country's large farmers are feather-bedded by the last bastion of centralised intervention within the European Union, the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

Haughey, to kick-start the infamous beef development plan, the exclusive responsibility of the then <Col N="2370" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh.  The Hamilton report demonstrated conclusively that the largest industrial development plan in the history of this State &mdash; the £260 million beef development plan, of which £100 million was comprised of taxpayers' money &mdash; was no more than a mirage.</P>

      <P>Past bungling should not obscure the real problem inherent in the EU agricultural policy.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to address some of the problems particularly those surrounding the export refund scheme.  It is a scheme which demands close scrutiny.  Export refunds are essentially a subsidy paid to farmers to compensate for fluctuations in the market price for their product.  The export refund system is surely the ultimate in intervention, designed to cushion farmers against the demolition of trade barriers in the wake of GATT. The more one examines it, the more bizarre the system appears.  In recent years the level of export refunds of compensation bore little or no relation to the market price level.  The result is that some large farmers have been able to pocket compensation for purely imaginary losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current issue is the minimal effect on farmers of a reduction in export <Col N="2372" /> refunds imposed by the European Commission. I understand the reduction in export refunds is not yet impacting on farmers because licences in use were taken out at a higher rate of refunds. The licences held by Irish processors should cover their requirements until the end of this month.  This is panic in advance.</P>

The European Commission points out that refunds were increased by 14 per cent in December 1995, there were further increases in beef and live animal refunds at the beef management committee meeting on 2 February 1996 and cattle prices in the EU are already relatively high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Ahearn, I said she had great foresight in asking speakers not to attack the Minister.  Obviously she had Deputy Lynch and the Democratic Left Party in mind from whom we had the facile incorrect statements about the agricultural industry and the decent hardworking farming community.  Farmers who have lost considerable income, <Col N="2374" /> are not impressed with this nonsense from a party in Government.  If Fine Gael has the interest of the farming community at heart it will disown those comments tonight.</P>
      <P>Farmers, particularly those in the beef sector, have for some time highlighted the urgent need for the Minister to take a strong political initiative with the Commission and with his colleagues in the Council of Agriculture Ministers and have export refunds restored to their proper level.  An issue such as this, which is of vital importance to our agricultural industry and to the economy, should not be left to officials alone for decision.  It should be decided by the most senior agriculture decision making body in the EU Commission, namely the Council of Agriculture Ministers.</P>
      <P>The protection of our livestock products and the level of livestock is crucially dependent on increased export refunds.  The Minister's recent reference to the need for greater efficiency, presumably meaning in part the need for extra production, could not be contemplated without the restoration of a more favourable export refunds regime.  In seeking improvements for the beef sector, we are conscious of the valuable contribution the processing sector makes and we are aware of the severe difficulties facing many factories throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The value of the cattle industry in 1995 is reckoned to have been worth £1.36 billion to the economy.  Deputy Cowen last night graphically illustrated the need to have export refunds restored to pre-November 1995 levels. The purchase price of cattle last September, their selling price now, the cost of winter feeding and housing combined, created a crisis for many farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of decisions taken at the European Union beef management committee have not been counteracted by the Minister.  That political ineptitude is causing many farmers substantial <Col N="2375" /> losses and an income drop they cannot afford.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion before the House is of particular importance and concern to my constituency.  In counties Cavan and Monaghan we have an intensive agricultural industry with dairying, poultry and mushrooms as key components.  Those excellent industries have been built up, due to the foresight of a small number of individuals and the diligence, hard work and commitment of many.  New markets were sought out, new products were developed and markets were honoured.</P>
    <P>In my constituency 30 mushroom producers ceased production in the past 12 months, due to the punt-sterling currency differential and the inadequate prices being paid by the UK multiples. People in that industry state there is a real possibility of other growers ceasing production.  For some time the growers association has sought action from the Government but this has not been forthcoming. The problems and the pressure in the industry have been building up for some time and the price fixing measures for the industry, which were introduced in 1990 and which are based on the 1989 exchange rate, present them with particular difficulties concerning the current exchange rate.  I understand the pricing structure was based on an exchange rate which valued the punt at 89p against the pound sterling and now the punt is valued at 103p against the pound sterling.  Furthermore, the association is losing 5p on every pound weight of mushrooms which are produced and this means a substantial cut in their profit margins.</P>
    <P>The poultry industry faces similar problems.  This Government's promise to introduce a special package to assist the food industry, which faces serious problems due to the currency differential, has not been honoured.  Thousands of jobs depend on the Minister and the Government taking appropriate action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2376" /> In the recent budget, the Government had the opportunity to make meaningful reductions in PRSI levels but did not take it.  In 1992 the Government was willing to assist industry affected by currency differentials and special support mechanisms were introduced.  The major processors in the mushroom industry estimate that their price returns have fallen by about 15 per cent in the last 12 months.  I appeal to the Government and the Minister to take the necessary action to ensure that those industries do not decline further and that the very valuable on farm and off farm employment created by the poultry and mushroom industries is protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time with me.  My colleague, Deputy Brian Cowen, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture made a damning indictment of the performance of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, especially in relation to the beef trade and competitiveness in the food industry. Nobody needs to be reminded of the importance of our greatest indigenous industry based primarily on the family farm.  It costs at least £12,500 to £15,000 to create a new job in industry.  Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that we assist agriculture to keep our people on the land and that we do not increase the dole queues.  To do that we must create a stable environment for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers do not work a 39 hour week. They have many variable situations to contend with such as the growth of grass and cereals, problems relating to disease, the price of cattle, sheep and food products in addition to the differential between the punt and sterling.  As if matters were not bad enough, the Minister gets bogged down in Europe in regard to export refunds and premia payments.  It takes skill and diplomacy, not confrontation, to deal with the bureaucrats in Brussels.  Photocalls in <Col N="2377" /> Brussels, farmers' charters or empty promises do not impress farmers.  A ministerial diary in <i>The Western People</i> is of little use to farmers either.  Farmers want resolutions to the problems they currently face and in that regard the Minister is not delivering the goods.</P>
    <P>Farmers do not only have difficulties at EU level but also at home in relation to the TB problem which is proving to be more divisive by the day because the ordinary farmer has not been consulted on the matter.  Whatever agreements have been made may suit the owners of large farms but small farm owners will have to pay on the double, particularly in regard to export certificates.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; or should I say a Minister for Photocalls &mdash; who blames farmers for poor productivity.  The EU is unresponsive to his plight and we cannot excuse him because it is unlikely that BSE, or jungle juice, is a causative factor in his poor performance to date in regard to the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleagues for putting this motion before the House which highlights the real crisis in agriculture, particularly in the cattle and beef industry.  Only a short time has passed since we last addressed the problems besetting the sheep sector. I hope this debate will prompt the Minister to take even the limited action he took on that occasion.</P>
      <P>An ongoing element of the current situation which is likely to become more severe in the medium term is the pressure resulting from the strength of the punt against sterling.  Traders and economic experts have been pointing to political and other factors which are likely to push the punt to £1.04 or £1.05 sterling. This could be sustained for a period of months and would have disastrous consequences for trade with the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must get together with his colleague, the Minister for Tourism <Col N="2378" /> and Trade, and others involved in that area and institute a package of measures to sustain Irish trade and exports generally but particularly beef and other food industry products.</P>
    <P>It is a source of considerable anger and frustration for Irish exporters that this Government has consistently shirked its responsibilities in this area. The days when EU and other international constraints were quoted are long gone.  This country has a special case to make and the Government must come up with initiatives to address what is clearly an untenable situation.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Minister to initiate and advance the debate on the direction of agriculture at the stage where premium payments are discontinued or restructured.  We all understand the difficulties the Minister has with some of his colleagues in Government, and anyone who has been present in the Chamber in the past 15 minutes has an acute understanding of the severity of those difficulties.  Some of the Minister's colleagues are clearly hell bent on undermining EU payments to farmers and are interested only in cheap political point-scoring.  The Minister's own trite comment about cheques in the post has done little to advance the debate.</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, or any of the other State bodies involved, have not put forward a worthwhile policy document on how the various elements of agriculture, and the food industries dependent on it, can be best supported at EU level and in the GATT framework.  Almost all of the worthwhile analysis has come from the farming organisations and, too often, their warnings have been ignored or passed off as alarmist, but the fact is that one crisis follows another in quick succession.</P>
    <P>Ireland's unique position is not being adequately catered for or even recognised. We export more than 70 per cent <Col N="2379" /> of our steer beef to world markets and, as a result, Irish prices are much more dependent on export refunds than any of our EU partners.  In general, the price paid to Irish farmers is a mix of third country prices and export refunds.  In Ireland's case, the export refunds do not apply only to a small spare capacity, as is the case with producers on the continent. They account for a huge proportion of Irish beef and are the key factor in setting the price paid to the producer.  That is the reason for the urgency in restoring full export refunds without further delay.</P>
    <P>The Irish Cattle Traders and Stockholders Association has pointed to deficiencies in premia payments which militate against its members.  Their special case must be examined and, if it is found to have merit, action must be taken.  It is easy to dismiss those in a particular sector and seek to represent them as high flyers.  Their plight must be made clear to the beef management committee in Brussels and if additional payments to those envisaged under CAP reform are required, the Minister must make the case for that additional funding.  These people have said that even a full return to last September's level of export refunds will not adequately protect their interests.  If that is so, the Minister must establish what is required and fight for it.</P>
    <P>Dry stock farming is the main enterprise of almost 40,000 farmers. Their ongoing viability is fundamental to the survival of rural communities. Too many sectors in agriculture have cause to seriously examine their ongoing viability and to doubt their ability to remain in rural Ireland.  This element of agriculture is fundamental to farmers continuing to live and work in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is totally unrealistic to represent most farmers as wealthy businessmen, as has been done here.  The vast majority of farmers struggle to provide <Col N="2380" /> for their families.  They look to the Minister to represent their case, and we recognise the difficulties he faces in Government which were so graphically illustrated by the comments made by Deputy Lynch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is along much the same lines as the motion but it is set out in somewhat more detail.</P>
      <P>The purchase of store cattle to be fattened for slaughter or for live export has been a traditional part of Irish farming for generations.  It has been the foundation of an immensely important national industry, it represents a significant proportion of our national exports and is the sole source of income for a very large number of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 70,000 farmers derive all or most of their incomes from dry stock and their situation is very precarious.  According to the Teagasc national farm survey, their average income in 1994 was £4,000 from beef cattle.  The family farm income from beef in 1994 was £87 per acre.  Speaking in the Seanad on 7 February last, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry said that 50 per cent of total net farm incomes now comes from subsidies.  This underlines dramatically the vulnerability of the modest agricultural incomes to decisions made in Brussels.  That is why the unilateral decisions taken by the Commission's beef management committee to cut export refunds by a massive 45 per cent between September and December of last year had such profound implications for Irish farmers.  An <Col N="2381" /> increase of 14 per cent in December and 5 per cent on live cattle and male carcase beef, coupled to a non-cumulative 7.5 per cent increase for boneless beef in February, does not go nearly far enough to rectify the damage that had already been caused.  Were these cuts by the Commission a cynical move to undermine market prices, designed to bring them to a level below those originally indicated by the MacSharry reform package or were they a device to lower prices when part of the package agreed at the time was to compensate farmers for price cuts which would arise from the CAP reform?  I have referred already to the narrow profit margins from beef production and winter fattening.</P>
    <P>The real inequity of the Commission's move on export refunds was that many farmers had already bought in cattle for winter fattening when the most severe cuts were imposed.  Investment decisions made in good faith were totally undermined by the unilateral decisions of the beef management committee. In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Peader Clohessy, on 15 February, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, said he had &ldquo;done everything possible to get refunds back to levels which would provide reasonable returns to beef producers and in particular to winter fatteners.&rdquo;  The facts show that the Minister has totally failed in his efforts &mdash; not for the first time has he talked tough and acted soft.  Where is the tangible evidence that his much used lexicon of commitment and priority is backed up by success in Brussels? In the same reply the Minister emphasised the importance of the £60 steer deseasonalisation slaughter premium in maintaining the returns of winter fatteners.  Surely he and the European Commission must see the contradiction and the incompatibility between payment of the £60 premium designed to reduce the problem of seasonality and the cutting of the refunds which will have precisely the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>The deseasonalisation premium is at <Col N="2382" /> risk in Ireland.  What action is being taken to maintain it in full?  As things stand, according to Teagasc, the break even price on winter fattening is £1.05 to £1.06 per pound.  This leaves winter fatteners facing significant losses and a potential loss to the economy of up to £160 million.  The loss of all or part of the deseasonalisation premium on top of the export refund cuts will lead to additional losses again next season. What we are seeing is the unravelling of the CAP and the abandonment of the commitment given under the CAP reform package to maintain farm incomes.  The Minister needs to remind his European colleagues of their obligations to fulfil commitments and that under the rules we are entitled to support from export refunds, which is being removed.  This is not a special pleading for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats amendment to this motion also highlights the fact that substantial numbers of Irish farmers were excluded from the CAP reform package; as many as 40,000 farmers have no quota because they do not produce their own calves.  They have also missed out on a big proportion of the £170 million a year coming to Ireland by way of special beef premiums. Producers of quality beef heifers, the suppliers of top grade meat to Irish consumers, were also left out of the compensation package.  The Minister's suggestion, in columns 788-89 of the Official Report of 16 November 1995, to extend existing premia to heifers could not be accommodated &ldquo;other than by a significant reduction in the rates of payment under existing schemes and further major and permanent reductions in market support, especially export refunds,&rdquo;.  That represents a remarkably defeatist attitude and it means that these farmers effectively have been abandoned.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's reaction to the views of an eminent agricultural consultant, Dick Collins of the Farm Business Advisers in Fermoy, who recently <Col N="2383" /> advocated the introduction of one simplified area aid premium rather than the multiplicy of existing and often contraditory schemes?  The Minister will be aware of the need to market Irish beef effectively on export markets and of the opportunity presented by our record on BSE.  Can he assure the House that An Bord Bia is being provided with the necessary back-up by his Department to do the job effectively?  In recent weeks the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, have stressed the need to increase productivity in Irish agriculture and food production as a means of countering the difficulties caused by the strength of the punt against sterling.</P>
    <P>Good advice and research is central to maintaining this productive and competitive edge.  Yet I am told that in County Meath there is a single adviser for 4,500 beef farmers.  Teagasc resources need to be devoted to where they are needed most, assisting the producers of meat, milk and crops.  Why does Teagasc not have an overriding commitment to efficient production? Will we become content with social welfare type income in the future rather than relying on production related income?  In an environment where the market is becoming dominant any industry which lacks the basic technical support to increase productivity while controlling costs cannot hope to survive the systematic dismantling of the supports hitherto afforded by the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Cowen on his efforts to try to create a situation where we would have a public debate that would concentrate the minds of Members and members of the Government on what has to be done in this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is crucially important in the context of the Minister's work at EU level that elected representatives present a united <Col N="2384" /> front on their concern as to what is happening in the cattle industry, with the loss of income and the potential damage to family farms because of the downturn in cattle prices.</P>
    <P>When we want to present a united front from Ireland to the EU to try to change some of these circumstances is it not ludicrous that the Government had deliberately trotted in Democratic Left to cut the CAP policy to ribbons during agriculture debates?  Is it not bad enough to see the CAP being systematically dismantled in Brussels without the consequence of 19 advisers from a party in Government at a cost of £500,000 to the taxpayers being paid to produce speeches which undermine the Government's efforts?  I know Deputy Ivan Yates wants his public relations machine to have him in the newspaper every day but I sympathise with him when he and his Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, go to Europe because the bureaucrats are able to produce speeches by members of the Government which systematically dismantle their policy.  What Fianna Fáil is trying to do &mdash; especially Deputies Cowen and Hugh Byrne &mdash; is to show a united face and demonstrate that Ireland will not take this.  That is support for the Government because the Minister can then go out and fight pointing out what is happening behind him. How can he do it with Democratic Left trailing along and deliberately creating a situation where part of the Government is totally against the Common Agricultural Policy?  This is not the first time we have heard such a litany from Democratic Left; we have been hearing it consistently.  This may be used against us as we try to rescue the situation in the European Union.  I plead with the Minister who has the support of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to ensure his own backbenchers support <Col N="2385" /> the efforts of the Government to present a united front in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary statistics released by the Central Statistics Office show that agricultural output exceeded £2 billion for the first time in 1995 and that agricultural incomes rose by over 7 per cent.  It was a very good year for the dairy sector, the pig sector, the beef sector despite the difficulties experienced by the winter fatteners, the cereal sector and the potato sector.  It is not all doom and gloom.  Listening to Members across the floor one would swear the agriculture industry was in crisis; it is not, although there are difficulties which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have always been experienced in the industry.  In recent times sheep were forced through the doors of Agriculture House while beef and pig farmers protested out on the street.  We resolved those problems and now we will try to resolve the problems of winter fatteners.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to dwell on the background to the difficulties being faced by beef producers, particularly winter fatteners, since the beginning of the year.  The difficulties have arisen mainly because of the cuts in export refunds implemented by the EU Commission to control the level of subsidised beef exports in this the first year of the GATT.  Last night the Minister, Deputy Yates, outlined the situation in some detail and explained the efforts being made to restore the refunds to levels which would underpin the incomes of beef producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are extremely unhappy with the approach the Commission has adopted in managing the beef market since last September.  The 35 per cent cut in refunds between September and November was unwarranted, but since then, mainly due to pressure exerted by the Minister and the Department, they have been partially restored.  For example, <Col N="2386" /> last December refunds were increased by 14 per cent and by between 5 and 7.5 per cent on 2 February last, the latter increase after a special meeting of the Beef Management Committee convened in response to pressure exerted by both us and the French.</P>
    <P>While these increases are not a full solution to the price difficulties faced by producers, they represent substantial progress on an issue on which we received little support initially.  The Minister will continue to seek to have the refunds restored to levels which would make Irish beef and cattle competitive in international markets and underpin the income of producers.</P>
    <P>The live trade will be an important element in the maintenance of reasonable returns to producers.  A certain amount of live exports are necessary to maintain strong competition in the marketplace. It is widely accepted that the live trade is not capable of providing a sufficient degree of competition because of the cumulative effect of the reduction in refunds in recent months.</P>
    <P>The Minister who is fighting a lone battle will do everything possible in the European Union to protect winter fatteners. In that connection we should present a united front in this House.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should be in no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Yates, will have the full support of Members on this side of the House in making a genuine and sincere effort to improve the lot of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil makes no apology for tabling this motion.  It was essential to <Col N="2387" /> do so because, despite what the Minister and the Minister of State said, this matter has been mismanaged.  The bottom line is that beef farmers are on the breadline.  They do not know what the future holds for them.  The motion has exposed the views of some Members about farmers, particularly those who find themselves in difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State informed us that 1995 was a great year for farmers.  It was undoubtedly one of the best we ever had due to a combination of good weather and the excellent work done by the Minister's predecessors.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil tabled this motion to focus the attention of the Minister on the deteriorating position in the beef sector.  As he apportioned blame, like snuff at a wake, it was clear that the Minister's only concern was to put as much distance as possible between the Government and cattle farmers.</P>
    <P>On 10 February, Matt Dempsey, the editor of the <i>Farmers Journal</i>, who has been kind to the Minister in the past, stated in an editorial:</P>
    <P>So, we have had the increase in export refunds.</P>
    <P>Clearly, five per cent and 7.5 per cent is better than nothing.  But, that said, little has happened to beef prices, except new warnings from the meat factories of more serious declines as the spring advances.  [In other words, the factories are putting down a marker]</P>
    <P>But, why should beef farmers feel so aggrieved?  It is quite clear that the Commission in Brussels feel that yet another sector of the Irish industry is crying wolf yet again.  They point out that the price of cattle cannot be looked at in isolation, that the special beef premium and the slaughter premium must also be taken into the equation.  Nobody can dispute that. But, we have in Ireland a special beef <Col N="2388" /> sector who normally do not qualify for either of the special beef premia, as mature store cattle are bought in the autumn and sold fat in the spring.</P>
    <P>This essential point seems to have escaped the policy makers.  It is not the absolute price that matters to this sector, but the price difference between buying and selling...  The next issue is, should finishers simply be told that these are the vagaries of the market and must be lived with. This does not wash.  Ireland has been pushed by deliberate EU policy into a reliance on Third Country markets. In 1995, somewhat over 80 per cent of our steers went to Third Countries, and even taking the full mix of beef producers &mdash; steers, heifers and cows &mdash; as Bord Bia has pointed out, Russia was our most important individual market in 1995, then the UK, France (mostly cows), followed by Saudia Arabia, Egypt and Iran.</P>
    <P>The price paid to the farmer is a direct mix of Third Country prices and export refunds.  These refunds are not in the Irish case simply applying to a residual quantity of product, as is the case with Continental producers, but account for a huge proportion of the total sales of the Irish industry and are by far the most important component in setting prices to producers.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that we have not seen any sensible policy paper put forward by the Department of Agriculture, the meat factory bodies or Teagasc as to how the essential and different features of the Irish industry can be dealt with at EU level &mdash; especially in a GATT framework.</P>
    <P>That would happen if we had proper leadership.  I do not expect movement from the Department, the meat factory bodies or Teagasc unless the Minister sets the pace.  I am sure Matt Dempsey, <Col N="2389" /> in common with farmers and the Opposition, is discovering that the Minister is not as effective as he was made out to be in newspaper reports at the beginning of his term in office.  After 14 months his flash Harry approach is not working.  Notwithstanding that the majority of commentators were aware of this serious crisis in the beef sector since last autumn, the Minister was blinded by the flashbulbs of his interminable photo calls.  It is a tribute to his handlers, however, that even he has started to believe his own press releases.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion, Deputy Cowen illustrated the extent of the Minister's culpability in this growing fiasco.  He repeatedly dismissed the threat to cattle prices from cuts in export refunds.  As recently as last December he said he did not expect the new level of refunds to have an immediate effect on cattle prices.  Last night in the House he said he had some difficulty remembering what he said then.  If by now his press office has not dug out statement No. 257 of 1995 from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry he can obtain a copy from the Fianna Fáil press office or from me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only the most recently recorded false assurance from the Minister to beef farmers.  The cuts in export refunds have had a disastrous effect on cattle prices.  Since last autumn the Minister presided over a reduction of 35 per cent in those refunds.  Cattle farmers are devastated as cattle bought last September at 106p and 107p per pound are being sold at 98p per pound. After months of winter feeding this represents a loss of up to £70 per head of cattle and even that may be an understatement. Teagasc figures shows that a price of approximately 106p per pound would be required to break even.  To <Col N="2390" /> make a profit of £30 per head, it is estimated that farmers need a price of approximately 109p per pound.  Spread over the spring, a loss of £70 per head on 460,000 steers will amount to more than £32 million, assuming the position does not deteriorate.  We have reason to believe cattle prices have not yet reached their lowest level.</P>
      <P>This is a man-made crisis and the Minister is responsible for a huge political oversight.  Many people believe he should have seen the writing on the wall last July.  He compounded his error by engaging in a slagging match with the Commissioner.  It appears the Minister has not heard the adage, &ldquo;when you are in a hole, stop digging&rdquo;.  Despite the Minister's height, he is up to his neck in it this time.</P>
      <P>At a time when cattle prices are plummeting, last week we were told that we are on the verge of losing the slaughter premium.  In addition, a lower qualification rate of 40 per cent for that premium will be paid for by a cut in the 22 month premium as well as reducing the slaughter premium by £15.  It would be difficult to imagine a more damaging set of proposals for farmers.  Once again, the Minister did not see the juggernaut coming.  Irish farmers need a Minister who can cope in Brussels.  We need a Minister on the inside track, this Minister is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a unique cattle system and, consequently, a unique problem that deserves a unique solution.  The Minister of State confirmed that the Minister is alone on this issue.  He asked members of the Government to seek solutions rather than criticisms on this matter.  The Minister spoke last night as if he were defeated on this issue.  We do not want him going to Brussels with a defeatist attitude, although he cannot be blamed for that because even his team mates are playing against him.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who was a fine corner back in his day, would probably relegate the Minister to <Col N="2391" /> the substitution line and definitely would not have a Democratic Left member on the team.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is excellent.  My preference was the other Minister but I have no doubt my points will be efficiently conveyed to the Government and the Minister directly involved.  I want the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to extend the powers and functions of the Radiological Protection Institute to cover matters pertaining to non-ionising radiation.  He can do this by way of order under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 but he has not chosen to do so and I ask him to now.  I ask this because recently published studies claim a strong connection between radon and electricity transmission installations, which has given rise to high levels of anxiety among the public.  Added to that is the anxiety arising from the proliferation of communications masts &mdash; there are already 210 mast applications from Telecom and a high number from ESAT.  There will, therefore, be a huge proliferation of such masts up and down <Col N="2397" /> the country in the years ahead, and this is adding to the disquiet among the general public.  I stress the urgent need for a baseline study to establish scientifically existing levels of radiation, and that must be done before approval is given for new and additional installations.</P>
      <P>The protection of public health and safety must be the primary concern of any government.  Citizens have a right to be assured that public bodies are acutely aware of any health risk that might accrue from their operations, and minimisation of such health risks must be an essential requirement of all public bodies.</P>
      <P>Professor Henshaw of Bristol University recently published a study claiming that cancers, including leukaemia, can be caused by the trigger effect of electromagnetic radiation on radioactive gas, on radon, and radon is a factor in this country.</P>
      <P>There is great public confusion as to which regulatory body is responsible for monitoring and investigating the cumulative effect of electromagnetic radiation and radon, and their effects on human health.  It appears that there is no official body responsible for monitoring this situation.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland can only investigate and advise on radon.  It has no jurisdiction over the effects of electromagnetic radiation generated by power lines and the effect that has not alone on health but also the trigger effect it can have on radon.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to make a ministerial order, as allowed in the Act, to confer these responsibilities on the institute.  He must give it strong enforcement powers or, alternatively, create a separate non-ionising radiological protection board with powers of intervention and enforcement.  I further call on the Minister to commission a full investigation of the effects of electromagnetic radiation on radon and health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2398" /> The Minister cannot ignore the grave public disquiet caused by Professor Henshaw's report.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has already confirmed that high levels of radon have been found in Irish homes, and it has confirmed that about 4 per cent of all Irish homes are above the risk level.  This must be a matter of concern to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Given that Ireland has a naturally high incidence of radon, Professor Henshaw's findings and the proximity of electromagnetic radiation generated by power lines is extremely worrying.  High pylons and power lines are now running across the face of the landscape.  People living close to lines erected in connection with electricity or communications, are now deeply worried, and if these lines happen to be in close proximity to residential areas or schools, there is a very high level of concern as to their long-term impact on the health of our citizens.  I am asking essentially that the powers already outlined in the Act are conferred on the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to enable it to carry out a study and to exercise enforcement powers on all future electromagnetic installations with a view to protecting health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Quill for raising this issue.  I realise from her remarks that she expected the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to be here to reply.  In effect, some of the questions she has put are more appropriate to the Minister for Energy than to the Minister for Health. I will ask my office to forward the transcript of Deputy Quill's remarks to my colleague so that he may reply by letter to the points she raised.  I presume it was because the question links an abnormally high incidence of illness with proximity to overhead electrical cables that the Ceann Comhairle's office <Col N="2399" /> throught it was an appropriate matter for the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy suggests that there may be a link between the incidence of certain types of cancer and increased exposure to radon gas particles caused by electromagnetic radiation from power lines.  It has attracted considerable attention and, in particular, has attracted critical comment from a wide range of authoritative scientific experts, including the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  These experts have cast considerable doubt on the conclusions of the study.</P>
      <P>Indeed, scientists researching the effects of radon have gone so far as to argue that the effects of electromagnetic fields appear to be to lessen the risk associated with radon &mdash; in other words, the opposite conclusion to that of the study.  I draw the attention of the Deputy to a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today from Dr. James P. McLaughlin of the Radon Research Group in the Department of Experimental Physics in University College, Dublin.  He refers to research carried out in UCD which supports other well established evidence that the presence of electrical fields in a house helps to deposit radon decay products on surfaces, thereby reducing the probability that these substances will be inhaled.  He also describes ongoing research in this area which UCD is co-ordinating with support from the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Professor Henshaw's study is specifically about the effect of power lines on radon and thus, indirectly, on health. There is also, of course, an ongoing scientific debate as to whether electromagnetic fields have a direct impact on health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All significant research in this area is monitored here by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Electricity Supply Board and, where ionising radiation is involved, the <Col N="2400" /> Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The medical officers in my Department keep themselves informed of developments in this area and my Department liaises with these agencies in relation to the human health aspects.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has pointed out that power line voltages and concentrations of power lines in Ireland are well below those in most industrialised countries.  In 1988 and 1992 that Department published major reports on this issue, covering the latest research developments and the assessments of this research by recognised international health advisory organisations. A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally over the years into possible adverse health effects from the electromagnetic fields surrounding power lines.  The general body of scientific evidence has not conclusively established a definite link between this form or radiation and ill health.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, while it has not been possible to determine a definite link, neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship.  For this reason it is prudent to take all such reports very seriously and continue to carefully examine them.  I am advised that this latest study will be incorporated in the existing body of scientific literature and assessed by the broad scientific community. Furthermore, research and studies in this area are carried out on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to research within my own direct area of responsibility, the National Cancer Registry began full registration of cancer incidence and mortality in Ireland in January 1994.  Its first national report will be published later this year.  This data will be of immense importance to research into the epidemiology of the disease in Ireland, and cross-referencing with any available data on relevant risk factors <Col N="2401" /> will be a significant aspect of such research.</P>
    <P>Should conclusive evidence emerge that electromagnetic radiation is causing an unacceptable public health risk then appropriate remedial measures will have to be put in place.  This would primarily be a matter for Government Departments and agencies with direct responsibility in the area, but I will seek to ensure that there is an appropriate response if any health risk is established.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Public Indemnity Insurance for Transition and PLC Students.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this issue which is of vital importance to transition and VPT students in community and comprehensive schools.  The withdrawal of indemnity insurance from companies who give work experience to students was disappointing in the extreme.  It was discriminatory as students at vocational education committee and secondary schools did not suffer the same fate.  I understand there may have been difficulties with the previous scheme but another scheme should have been put in place to give continuity to the programme which was worthwhile for students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards, local authorities and private companies notified the principals of community and comprehensive schools that they would no longer co-operate in the scheme and there is now serious doubt that they will give students work experience.  Approximately 6,000 students are affected.  The cost of the scheme is not excessive.  The 73 schools involved are at their wits end and do not know how to regain the confidence of employers.  The new scheme introduced by the Minister last week is not employer friendly.  Employers are required to have a health and safety <Col N="2402" /> statement.  The principals and course organisers must satisfy themsleves as to the general suitability of the employer's premises prior to any placement.  Companies take the view that this is an intrusion into their affairs.  Is the Minister saying that this policy will not cover small businesses that do not have a health and safety statement?</P>
    <P>There is one school with 160 pupils in transition year or on VPT courses. Under the terms of the indemnity insurance scheme the principal or course organiser must visit 160 premises to vet their suitability.  Surely the Minister accepts that is impossible.  How can a teacher engaged in teaching duties comply with such a demand?</P>
    <P>I understand that certain activities would be excluded from public indemnity insurance but excluding the operation of machinery in engineering, woodwork and joinery denies the student practical training in the work-place. In effect the Minister is saying it is all right to cover woodwork, engineering and joinery in the school but students cannot continue to be trained by a possible future employer.  Is that not what work experience is about?  I ask the Minister to review some of the nonsensical aspects of this cover and renegotiate an employer friendly scheme which will be advantageous to students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The State provides a general indemnity to community and comprehensive school authorities in lieu of their taking out commercial insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.  The scale and extent of this indemnity facilitates the provision of a full academic programme and a range of other school activities in community and comprehensive schools similar to that enjoyed by other sectors who make their own private insurance arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the restructuring the senior <Col N="2403" /> cycle and the introduction of school programmes which involve attendance by pupils at a place of employment to gain experience of a work station, employers agreed to add the pupils to their public and employer liability policies, any additional cost being recouped from the schools.</P>
    <P>This arrangement worked satisfactorily for a number of years.  Recently, however, some employers on the advice of their insurance companies withdrew from this arrangement on the basis that they now require full indemnity from the school against any claims arising in respect of pupils engaged on work experience.</P>
    <P>To resolve this difficulty, my Department with the assistance of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, the relevant representative management body for the sector, invited quotations from a number of insurance companies regarding appropriate insurance cover for the pupils concerned. I am happy to report to the House that a policy has recently been negotiated which will provide the required indemnity in respect of any claims against employers by pupils while attending at work stations.</P>
    <P>My Department will monitor the new arrangements closely to ensure that they are adequate to meet the needs of pupils of community and comprehensive schools who wish to participate in work experience programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter.  In 1995 Cavan received £20,000 out of a total allocation of £1.5 million for new projects under the recreational facilities scheme.  I tabled a question to the Minister seeking a breakdown of the allocation and was surprised that allocations ranged from £10,000 for one county to <Col N="2404" /> £419,000 for another.  This is a very good scheme and many groups apply for funding under it, for example, boxing clubs, karate clubs and so on.  I was disappointed to see that the six Border counties received £152,000 while their counterparts in the South received £500,000.  That imbalance concerns me. Normally my county would receive 2 per cent of the national allocation for housing or other funding.  In this case we received 0.75 per cent which is one-third of our normal entitlement of a national allocation.</P>
      <P>As it turned out, there was much worse to come.  Last night, the Minister of State allocated £150,000 to a community centre in a small village in south County Meath.  We got £2,000 more than that for six counties from the Irish Sea to the west coast.  It would be great if that amount could be given to every village but we cannot afford to do that. A sum of £10 million would not have covered all the requests but some semblance of balance should be introduced to those allocations.  There is no justification for allocating £150,000 to a small hamlet close to Dublin city where there are adequate recreation facilities.  Discretionary grants must be dealt with in an even handed way.  If that case was brought to court, justice would be done. What happened is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fund is the subject of many representations from groups and voluntary organisations.  I often told Ministers in my party that the fund should be evenly allocated.  I would not give more than £5,000 to any community group.  Such groups have told me that if they could get £2,000 or £3,000 they could buy materials.  My view may be contrary to that of many public representatives but I feel modest community centres should be provided.  They are essential if we want to keep communities alive.  I opposed a £250,000 facility in my area. Instead we extended the parochial hall which is a hive of activity.  That project <Col N="2405" /> received £5,000 during its early stages many years ago.</P>
    <P>For a number of years, county council officials examined such projects.  If they approved them, the Department paid for them.  Why was that function removed from the local authorities and given to the Department of Education? The county councils ensured an even handed spread of funds, which is all that any public representative should seek. Every area is entitled to a balanced allocation of the funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to this debate on the matter of my Department's recreational facilities scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware, this scheme assists voluntary community organisations to provide, improve or equip recreational, leisure and community facilities. The maximum grant is limited to £50,000.  Environment works, swimming pool projects and the purchase of sites are not eligible under it.  This scheme has been administered by my Department since the late 1970s but since the introduction of the national lottery it has gained very wide publicity and is now accepted as the main source of funding for such projects.</P>
      <P>The level of demand for assistance under this scheme has increased significantly in recent years.  In 1995 I had £1.5 million to allocate to new projects.  A total of 1,300 applications were received in my Department and the total grant aid sought was more than £60 million in respect of proposed developments estimated to cost a total of some £450 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late 1995, I announced the allocation of the £1.5 million to 240 projects. The reason it was so late is that when I came into office I discovered there were commitments of £10.5 million but only £4 million was available to fund them.  These allocations were made <Col N="2406" /> in accordance with the criteria published in the advertisement seeking applications in 1994.</P>
    <P>The criteria for the selection of projects included the priority of the proposed project in relation to the organisation's existing facilities, the ability of the organisation to undertake the project, the amount of local funds available, the availability of other facilities in the area and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds.  I also had to achieve an equitable spread of funds among the different sports clubs and community groups.  Some adjustments were also made to take account of allocations in previous years under this scheme and the major facilities programme.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy these allocations are made in a fair and transparent manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>These capital grants have been the subject of scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by the Committee of Public Accounts and have been found to be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Due to the very high demand and the relatively limited funds available the average grant was about £6,000 in that scheme.  The provision of grants under these schemes has proved to be very beneficial in assisting the construction of new facilities and in the refurbishment and improvement of existing facilities.</P>
      <P>In the course of the year I met numerous deputations and visited many facilities throughout the country and I have seen the benefits of these grants at first hand.  I am satisfied that the funds provided are very well spent and are instrumental in generating substantial funds at local level to provide facilities which would not otherwise be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demands for assistance from all sports clubs and community groups are continuing to increase.  Excluding the projects which I assisted in 1995, there <Col N="2407" /> is still up to 1,000 applications on hands seeking grant assistance of some £50 million.  This is clear evidence of the public perception of these schemes and of the expectation that national lottery funds will be available for their projects.</P>
    <P>I would expect further funding will be available in 1996 and I would hope to make further inroads in the demands for assistance under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Although the matter raised did not specifically relate to County Monaghan, I have to hand the figures for that county.  County Monaghan has 1.45 per cent of the total population.  The total allocation under the recreational facilities scheme to County Monaghan projects from 1988-95, inclusive, was £110,456&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which represents 1.05 per cent of the funds available.  The total allocation under the major facilities programme to County Monaghan in 1988-95 was £500,000 or 1.6 per cent of the available funds.  Overall, the total allocated to County Monaghan was £610,456 or 1.88 per cent of the funds available for both capital schemes.  The 1995 allocations to County Monaghan were: £6,000 for Aghabog Gaelic football club, £3,000 for Bawn rural development association, £4,000 for Inniskeen Gaelic football club and £6,000 for Inniskeen social club.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important topic.  As much as 80 per cent of crime in Ireland is drug related.  The hard drug problem, which until recently was confined to Dublin, has shown worrying signs of extending to other urban areas and is getting steadily <Col N="2408" /> worse.  For example, the Garda Síochána's annual report for 1994 shows a dramatic increase in seizures of practically all categories of drugs.  Seizures of heroin increased by 262 per cent in 1994 over the 1993 figure and seizures of ecstasy increased by a staggering 1,323 per cent over the 1993 figure.  The internal Garda report to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security states that the figure for drug arrests and seizures for 1994 was about quadruple that in 1987.  It also states that in one six week period last summer 12 young people died from drug abuse in Dublin's north inner city.</P>
      <P>The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 17 February 1996 revealed that in recent weeks in Dublin there has been a number of seizures of the drug known as crack cocaine. That is a deeply sinister and dangerous development.  In its internal report the Garda states that crack cocaine is not on the market in Ireland currently, and that there was only one recorded seizure of a minuscule amount from a personal user in early 1994.  Sadly, that position appears to have changed.  The quantities seized show that the problem is still embryonic.  However, the head of the Garda national drugs unit was quoted in The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> as describing the development as &ldquo;ominous&rdquo;.  A number of community leaders in Dublin's inner city were reported to be &ldquo;deeply distressed&rdquo;. They have good reason to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no substance that induces such an instant violent reaction in the user as does crack cocaine, which is a mixture of cocaine and sodium bicarbonate, usually in the form of some apparently innocuous substance such as baking powder.  I understand from Garda sources that it is being produced at a certain location in the north inner city by the use of microwave ovens.  It can currently be purchased for £20 a deal, which is cheap.  It has long been synonymous with instant mindless violence of a most extreme nature.  It is <Col N="2409" /> much more likely to cause fatalities in young people as a result of strokes or heart attacks.  There is an increased risk to users of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.  Its effect is instant and comparable to that obtained by intravenous injection.</P>
    <P>The most sinister and worrying aspect of this drug is its effect on users.  Psychologically it induces paranoia and tends to make the user psychotic, hence the violence.  There have been reports of cases in the United States where people who were high on crack cocaine shot dead anybody with whom they came into contact, even children who happened to be on the same street.  The irresistible impulse to use extreme mindless violence is a typical reaction to the drug.  Last year the introduction of crack cocaine in certain local authority housing estates in Liverpool and Birmingham caused these estates to be turned into virtual no-go areas within a period of three months.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of this sinister development and what plans has she to deal with it?  Has the Government proposals to tackle long waiting lists at detoxification clinics in Dublin?  Has it proposals to speed up implementation of the methadone Protocol, which is being introduced at present on a piecemeal basis?  Has it proposals for changes in policing policy to enable the Garda to effectively tackle the hard drug problem and particularly to deal with this recent sinsiter development?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, sends her apologies for her absence.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I understand that a small number of seizures of crack cocaine has been made in Dublin in recent months.  While the number of seizures is relatively small, there is no room for complacency.  This is a most dangerous and addictive type of cocaine.  It occurs to me that there may be some confusion in the public mind as <Col N="2410" /> to the difference between cocaine and crack cocaine.  In this regard, I do not believe that it would serve the public interest if I were to set out here, for the information of the House, how precisely crack cocaine is made.  Suffice to say it is, as I have already stated, an extremely dangerous and addictive drug.</P>
      <P>We must not, of course, overstate the dimensions of the problem.  The number of cases which has come to the attention of the authorities is very small, especially when put in the context of the wider drugs problem.  Heroin and ecstasy remain the most pressing problems we face when it comes to drug abuse.  Cocaine has not been a particular problem in terms of numbers of users or amounts seized, and this remains the case.  However, we must not overlook the possibility of crack cocaine becoming more widely available.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that they are taking all possible steps to seize the drug and apprehend those who are dealing and using it.  The recent seizures made by Garda are proof of this.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have made the drugs problem a matter of the highest priority for my Department and the Garda authorities.  The package of anti-drugs measures announced by the Government last year is being implemented and much has already been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda national drugs unit has been established.  The memorandum of understanding between the customs and excise service and the Garda has been signed.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill has been published. The position regarding the licensing of pubs and dance halls has been reviewed and the relevant legislation is being updated.  The problem of drugs in our prisons is being tackled.  The National Co-ordinating Committee has been re-established. Two new sub-committees have been set up, dealing respectively with the demand and supply aspects of the problem.  I believe that all of these <Col N="2411" /> measures, and others which I have not been able to go into in the time available, will make a major impact on the drugs problem.</P>

      <P>As I announced recently, the development of the Castlerea Prison project will have two dimensions.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I propose to construct a special secure unit to house 25 offenders.  Work on this project commenced immediately after the Government decision of 30 January 1996. Design work is already at a very advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to invite tenders for this work very shortly.  This additional accommodation will become available in the summer of this year.</P>
      <P>The original plan for the main prison at Castlerea envisaged significant dependence on the provision of new purpose-designed buildings, together with the use of the existing hospital buildings.  I have directed that a review of these plans be undertaken with a view to maximising the use of the hospital buildings and confining new buildings largely to cellular accommodation. The existing hospital buildings are not deemed suitable for adaptation to provide cellular accommodation.</P>
      <P>Planning and design work for this proposed facility is under way.  While I am unable, at this stage, to confirm the number of places to be provided, I can say that the overall number will be of the approximate order envisaged in the original plan.</P>
      <P>With regard to the new women's prison, arrangements for the resumption of planning and design work have already been made and it is my intention to have construction work started as early as feasible.  It is not possible to put a completion date on the projects at this stage.</P>

      <P>Following the robbery at the Brink's-Allied premises last year, I requested officials in my Department to carry out a review of the issues involved in the possible statutory regulation of the private security industry and to report to me whether regulation might be reasonably expected to reduce the possibility of further such robberies at commercial premises and, in general, result in an improved service to the public.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the security industry covers a large area of commercial activity, providing security for the storage and transit of cash, commercial security, the supply and installation of intruder-fire alarms, sales and other security equipment, the provision of a 24 hour monitoring and answering service for alarm-call and emergency call-out facilities, providing security for individuals and their homes, and private investigations &mdash; these are just some of the areas covered by this industry.</P>
      <P>The industry has a number of representative groups including the Irish Security Industry Association, the International Professional Security Association, the Security Institute of Ireland and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association and a certain amount of self-regulation already takes place in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This review is nearing completion and it has involved an examination of a number of important issues in the private security industry.  I am concerned that the industry which is contracted to protect money, property and persons operates to the highest possible security standards and my review is to consider what is the best way to achieve that objective in this complex and sensitive area.  The review also takes place in the context of the continuing growth of the security industry and the wide range of functions in now carries out.  The position regarding the regulation of the security industry in other jurisdictions is <Col N="2214" /> also being examined in detail.  In this regard, my Department has been in contact with the Home Office and has been appraised of the similar debate on regulation which has been taking place in the United Kingdom for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to appraise the Deputy of the conclusions of the review at the earliest opportunity and, in the meantime, I will give careful consideration to any proposals or suggestions that he may have in this regard.</P>

      <P>At present a gratuity of £1 per day is paid to each prisoner whose conduct and industry are good, as provided for in the 1947 Rules for the Government of Prisons. The gratuity is reviewed from time to time.</P>
      <P>I am about to introduce, on a pilot basis, a minimal payment which will relate directly to the prisoner's work output &mdash; it will be a form of payment for productivity.  This pilot scheme is taking place in a number of the activities at Mountjoy Prison and will involve about 100 prisoners.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my Department's policy document <i>The Management of Offenders</i>&mdash;<i>A Five Year Plan</i> published in 1994.  Chapter 10 outlines the current position in regard to work and training in the prison system and plans for the future.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the document points out that there is now a wide range of work and training activities in the prison system that have been developed by a corps of staff specially recruited and trained for them.  The training activities include welding, machinery, engineering, drawing, construction, painting, decorating, printing, electronics, catering and computer skills.  Most of these courses are now certificated by the City and Guilds of London or other bodies.  Manufacturing activities involve clothing, furniture, printing, banking, laundry, cleaning and grounds upkeep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2218" /> About 40 per cent of the prison population are engaged full-time in these activities and another 20 per cent on a part-time basis.  The actual number of prisoners who decline work opportunities or simply decide to opt out fluctuates on a daily basis in each prison and therefore is difficult to quantify.</P>
    <P>Chapter 10 of the five year plan concludes with an outline of plans for the development of work and training activities over the next few years.  Work on this plan is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Education facilities are provided in all institutions.  Participation is affected by factors such as facilities, availability, the rate of prisoner turnover, alternate activities such as work-training.  For many prisoners education will be their key activity.  The most recent data on prisoner participation indicated that 56 per cent of prisoners availed of education facilities, classes range from one class per week to full-time study.  Generally education participants will attend on a daily basis.  Attendance at classes is on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources throughtout the State.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the investigation unit commonly known as the &ldquo;Murder Squad&rdquo; which was attached to the technical bureau at Garda headquarters was decentralised on a divisional basis in 1988.</P>
      <P>Two superintendents and a number of sergeants with a high level of investigative expertise are still based at Garda headquarters and are available on request to divisional officers in major and complex cases.  Forensic-technical support continues to be provided from Garda headquarters such as crime scene examiners, fingerprints, ballistics, etc. Extra members are available on request to any division for major crime investigations.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation, together with the training and development of investigators nationwide, has made the divisional investigation teams more self sufficient and, of course, more readily available at short notice.  Investigators are now working nearer sources of intelligence and where they know the local community.  The Garda authorities also point out that their services can be used effectively on other duties when not engaged in major crime investigations.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider that the existing arrangements provide for a more efficient and effective use of resources, and there are no plans at present to alter them.</P>

I have also met other organisations such as the IFA and the ICMSA regarding this issue.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the community alert scheme, I announced last month a grant of £50,000 to Muintir na Tíre which will enable it to significantly increase the number of schemes operating throughout the country.  I am also providing funding of £4,000 per annum for the publication of a newsletter which will be issued quarterly by Community Alert.  When I say I am concerned about the safety of the elderly, it is not confined to those living in rural areas alone but also those who are living in cities and large towns where, regrettably, at times they can be as isolated as those living in remote parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Social Welfare recently established a task force on which my Department is represented to consider the security needs of the elderly.

      <P>The closed circuit television, CCTV, monitoring system currently in operation in the Temple Bar area of Dublin city was launched on 26 October 1995.  The pilot scheme is the first of its kind in this <Col N="2222" /> country and was introduced in the Temple Bar area with the co-operation of local interests.  A review of all aspects of the system, including technical aspects, has recently commenced to evaluate its effectiveness during its initial period of operation.

      <P>While I reiterate my commitment to the introduction of CCTV as an aid to policing I am anxious to ensure that the experience gained from the installation and operation of the Temple Bar scheme is used to maximum advantage when extended to other areas.  It would be premature at this stage, in advance of the review of the pilot scheme, to comment conclusively on the likely value of CCTV in reducing crime in this jurisdiction.  However, early indications from the Garda authorities are that the use of CCTV has had a beneficial effect on crime prevention and detection in the area in which it has been located and that there have been a number of arrests to date following incidents recorded by the cameras in the Temple Bar area.</P>

      <P>The Garda cannot prohibit them from parking cars in a public street.  From time to time members of the public complain to gardaí about intimidating behaviour by car park attendants. However, very often they do not wait until the gardaí arrive or if they do they are reluctant to go to court.  The only action gardaí can then take is to move them on or arrest-prosecute for begging, being drunk and disorderly, breach of the peace, etc.  The Garda have found that whenever a charge of begging is preferred judges almost invariably apply the Probation Act unless other charges such as larceny, criminal damages, etc. are also put.</P>

      <P>As <Col N="2224" /> Minister for Justice I am the political head of the prison service.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that on such a sensitive matter as prison issues I am entitled, indeed obliged, to decide when interviews might be granted on my behalf to the media and which of my Department's staff might appropriately give the interview.  As a matter of policy I seek to facilitate the media in its interest in prison issues.  However, the primary responsibility of prison staff is to run the prisons &mdash; a very onerous responsibility at the best of times.</P>
      <P>In the instance in question it was decided that the governor of Loughan House, which is in County Cavan, should give a requested interview to local radio about factual aspects of the operation of Loughan House and to clarify inaccurate statements about Loughan House which appeared in the press and which were attributed to him. A request for an interview on a national radio show &mdash;&ldquo;the Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;&mdash; for the same governor was turned down on the basis that the latter interview could be expected to focus on wider national penal policy issues which do not fall into his remit, and not just on specific questions relating to Loughan House.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that some time later when RTE visited Loughan House and requested an interview with the governor about the operation of the institution this interview was granted.</P>

I can confirm that these were the only persons in this offender category granted early release in the period in question.  Both prisoners were released under very <Col N="2227" /> close probation and welfare service supervision.  One offender was released, following a programme of intensive counselling on a one-to-one basis, six weeks early, having served 11 years and 10½ months, on the recommendation of the Sentence Review Group.  The other offender, serving a ten year sentence for rape, was granted varying short periods of temporary release during 1995, also on the recommendation of the Sentence Review Group, in the final three months of his sentence, having undertaken and successfully completed the sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison.  The periods of temporary release varied from a matter of hours to a fortnight's duration.</P>

      <P>The earliest date currently available in the Dublin Circuit Court for hearing a civil action which is ready to be set down for hearing is 3 March 1998.  This represents a delay of approximately two years in the hearing of civil cases in the Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I have received Government approval to appoint 15 additional judges, seven of whom will be Circuit Court judges.  Two of the additional Circuit Court judges will be permanently assigned to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have requested the Judicial <Col N="2233" /> Appointments Advisory Board to submit to me a list of suitable candidates for appointment as judges to the various courts in accordance with the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  When I receive the board's submission I will put the other matter to Government.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the additional judges will provide the courts in Dublin and around the country with the resources they require to effectively tackle the backlog of cases for hearing.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, she has to amend the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 in order to ensure that judges pass consecutive sentences in respect of crimes committed while on bail; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provides that &ldquo;Any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed... while he was on bail shall be consecutive on any sentence passed on him for a previous offence...&rdquo;.  This is subject, in the case of the District Court, to the aggregate term of imprisonment not exceeding two years.</P>
      <P>In its recent report on the law of bail, the Law Reform Commission suggested that the view might be taken that this section has been deprived of some of its deterrent power in the light of decisions by the courts that the section permits one of the consecutive sentences to be a suspended sentence and that the overall sentence must be proportionate in its totality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I, of course, accept the principle that our criminal law should do what it can to attempt to deter the commission of offences by persons while on bail, the judgements to which the Law Reform Commission refers give rise to complex issues.  I am addressing these in the context of my examination of the <Col N="2234" /> Law Reform Commission report.  This examination is being finalised at present with a view to putting proposals to the Government in the near future.</P>

Community service is, therefore, an alternative to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Certain conditions must be fulfilled before the court makes a community service order.  For example, the court must be satisfied that the offender is suitable to undertake community service and that there is work available for him/her to do.  The Probation and Welfare Service must provide a report to this effect.  The numbers of reports requested by the courts for the five year period are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Figures for the number of persons prosecuted in 1995 under the Act are not yet available.</P>

      <P>It is not clear from the question what long-term changes the Deputy is referring to. I presume that it is those referred to in the Corporate Strategy Policy Document 1993-1997 for the Garda Síochána which was presented to the then Minister in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many significant changes since the document was published on policy, operational and administrative strategies in the force.  I propose to outline some of these and to refer to the current status of the corporate strategy document.  A total of 1,050 gardaí are being recruited between 1995 and 1997.  An IT plan for the Garda Síochána is being implemented at present at a cost of approximately £26 million.  An automated fingerprinting identification system was installed at Garda Headquarters in December 1995. <Col N="2243" /> A CCTV system was established in the Temple Bar area of Dublin on a pilot basis and it is intended, following a review of this project, to extend it to other areas.  A policy of performance development and review was introduced for the force in February 1994.  A tenure of post policy was introduced in August 1995.  The National Bureau of Fraud Investigation was established in April 1995.  A Garda National Drugs Unit was established in July 1995 under the control of a deputy commissioner.  The number of youth diversion projects in operation in urban areas has been increased from two in 1994 to seven at present.  Additional funding has been provided to replace the Garda fleet on a five-year cycle.  In January of this year, a regional command structure was created within the Garda Síochána.  This was the first major change to the organisational structure of the force since the foundation of the State.  The reorganisation of the force on a regional basis will provide for a much more co-ordinated and cohesive approach in tackling, on an operational basis, all facets of crime.</P>

      <P>Delays in the hearing of court cases are a matter of serious concern.  To address this problem the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, increased the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the courts.  On 30 January 1996 I obtained Government approval for the appointment of 15 additional judges, three to the Supreme Court; two to the High Court, seven to the Circuit Court and three to the District Court.  All of the additional Supreme and High Court judges will be located in Dublin.  Two of the additional Circuit Court judges and at least one of the additional District Court judges will be permanently assigned to Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have requested the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to submit to me a list of suitable candidates for appointment as judges to the various courts in accordance with the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.

      <P>I have indeed seen the particular article in question and was somewhat surprised by its contents. As the Deputy may be aware, the Economic and Social Committee of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body for some months past has been undertaking a review of programmes of assistance <Col N="2249" /> for Northern Ireland and the six Southern Border counties, with particular reference to the International Fund for Ireland.  I understand the committee has received extensive submissions, has taken oral evidence from a range of qualified individuals &mdash; including the chairman of the fund who has met the committee on several occasions &mdash; and has visited quite a number of fund-assisted projects across the 12 Northern counties.  My understanding is that the report of the committee is only now in the process of being drawn up and will be presented to the plenary session of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body in April.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the International Fund for Ireland was established by the British and Irish Governments as an international organisation with an independent board.  The purpose of such a structure was to place the fund above any political divisions and to allow it to operate as an independent agent.  Moreover, the fund's activities are monitored closely by its donors &mdash; the USA, the EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand &mdash; all of whom, along with the British and Irish Governments, attend the meetings of the board of the fund.  In addition, the fund publishes the criteria under which its programmes operate, deals directly with the public as regards any queries they may have, and issues an annual report and accounts. The Government's view is that both the fund's structure and practice provide it with the means to deal in a fair and even-handed manner with all approaches.  In these circumstances, I do not see the need to consider the appointment of an ombudsman.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the precise information requested by the Deputy to be provided. The only relevant information available is an analysis of the tax returns for the income tax year 1992-93, the latest available, which indicates that a tax <Col N="2251" /> liability of £2.6 million arose for that year in respect of some 1,563 individuals who were identified as having income from the operation of taxi-cabs, chauffeur-driven hire cars and analogous activity.  Other individuals on tax records may also have income from the same activity but are not so identified in the statistics.</P>
      <P>Taxi-drivers are subject to the various audit and compliance programmes operated by the Revenue Commissioners. While statistics on tax arrears generally are not available by sector, it can be stated that significant progress in the carrying out of audits on taxi-drivers has been made in recent years, with nine audits completed to date for 1993, 60 audits completed for 1994 and 28 audits completed for 1995, at an average tax yield over the three years of £4,611 per completed audit.  For the most part, these audits were selected on the basis of careful examination of the tax returns of taxi drivers and not on a random basis.  Therefore, the results of these audits would not be representative of the tax position of that sector as a whole.  The results for the 1995 programme to date are incomplete and the figures for these audits will increase over time.  The increasing intensity of the audits activity is likely to have prompted an increased tax yield from this sector in more recent years.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to say what number of places will be allocated to either panel; this will be determined by Departments' requirements during the period of the panel; such requirements could not be forecast, with any degree of accuracy, at this juncture.  Under the administrative budget arrangements, my Department is not informed of the number of vacancies which exist at each grade level.  Even if such information were readily available, it would only be of limited use to the Deputy as Departments have certain discretion as to which posts they will fill.  However, as <Col N="2253" /> a precaution against unfilled vacancies falling disproportionately on lower grades, such as paperkeeper, I have emphasised that such delegation may be revoked if it is not exercised equitably as between various categories of staff.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to be precise as to the likely impact on the paperkeeper grade of the current staffing restrictions, under which only one out of every three vacancies may be filled, as I have delegated authority to the heads of Departments to decide which vacancy in any sequence of three is to be filled, subject to the proviso, as to equity between different levels, already mentioned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86, 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>In a submission to the Department of the Environment dated 20 August 1992, the National Parks and Wildlife Service expressed concerns about the failure of an environmental impact statement, commissioned by the local authority on the proposed sewage treatment plant, to adequately address the possible impacts of the proposed development on bird roosting habitats.  This was an opinion on the shortcomings of the EIS and not a statement that the impacts, if any, were likely to be significantly adverse. No other reservations about the proposed development were expressed in that submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report attached to the letter of 11 May 1995 was produced in response to questions raised by the European Commission on the proposed development and expressed the view that any loss of roosting sites resulting from the development will not have a significant impact on the inner Galway Bay special protection area, and that the proposed development would in fact produce a <Col N="2257" /> significant improvement in environmental quality in north east Galway Bay by effectively dealing with the sewage problem.  This report was produced by the National Parks and Wildlife Service which is the national authority for wildlife conservation.  The author of the report holds an MSc degree in environmental science and has very long experience in working in the field of bird conservation. He has conducted specialist research into marine birds and is an internationally recognised expert.  I have raised a number of questions with the officer concerned and I am satisfied on this basis that the proposals will have no significant adverse effect.</P>
    <P>The area below the high water mark at Renmore Point is included in the north inner Galway Bay special protection area, the boundaries of which were selected on the basis of recommendations contained in a report commissioned from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.  The purpose of the report was to collate and review existing data with a view to proposing a suite of special protection areas that would fulfil Ireland's commitments under the EU Birds Directive (EEC/79/409).  Any proposal to locate sewage treatment works at Renmore Point would require an environmental impact assessment in order to ascertain the significance of any impacts, direct or indirect, on the special protection area.</P>

I do not accept that any contradictory reports were submitted by the Irish authorities in the course of correspondence with the Commission on this case.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the differences with the Commission on this matter, I intend that Ireland will draw down its full allocation of Cohesion Fund assistance for environmental projects.  The total present cost of necessary environmental projects in Ireland, actual and prospective, considerably exceeds available Cohesion Fund co-financing.</P>

      <P>A special additional grant of £50,000 was made to Galway County Council in March 1995 for remedial works to roads in the Gort area which was the scene of severe flooding earlier that year.

      <P>In 1995, the overall estimates provision for non-national roads was increased at budget time to allow for additional grant allocations to local authorities generally taking account, among other things, of the unsatisfactory condition of county roads which had been aggravated by bad weather.  A further additional provision of £20 million was made available to local authorities in July 1995 to initiate a restoration programme for these roads.</P>
      <P>The record provision of over £146 million for non-national roads in 1996 will enable local authorities to carry out a more extensive programme of road works than was hitherto possible, including remedial works to roads arising from flood damage.</P>

      <P>The failure rate for tests in Clonmel in 1995, at 47.6 per cent was not unduly out of line with the national avarage rate of 45.2 per cent.  The failure rate of 54.8 per cent for Tipperary is high relative to the national average and the situation there is being examined to establish the underlying causes and, in particular, to ascertain whether certain faults are contributing unduly to the high failure rate.  Driver testers receive extensive training before commencing testing and are supervised and <Col N="2261" /> monitored by the experienced supervisory testers so as to maintain an even application of standards throughout the country.</P>
      <P>All applicants for driving tests are provided with an information leaflet, entitled <i>Preparing for your Driving Test,</i> which includes details of the common faults resulting in test failures.</P>

      <P>The selection of projects for funding under the INTERREG II programme was determined on the basis of their compliance with the EU eligibility criteria, the priority attaching to particular projects, the limited funding available and the needs of different areas. Donegal County Council submitted nine projects for funding under the programme at an estimated cost of £2.9 million in 1996.  The council received grant allocations of £1.35 million for seven projects in 1996, including an allocation of £130,000 for the R232 Laghey-Pettigo road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road grants have been fully allocated in 1996 and there are no further funds available from which an additional allocation could be made to any county <Col N="2263" /> council this year.  It is open to Donegal County Council in future years to apply for further assistance for the Laghey-Pettigo road under the INTERREG II programme which runs until 1999.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the proposed port access route is to provide a direct link from the C Ring Motorway to Dublin Port to cater for existing, and anticipated growth in, port traffic.  The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative recommended that the proposed route should be complemented by a range of management measures designed, <i>inter alia</i>, to maximise the use of the tunnel by port related HGV traffic; divert such traffic <Col N="2264" /> away from residential areas; and minimise the use of the tunnel by car commuters and non-port related traffic.  The nature of these measures and the manner in which they are implemented will determine traffic flows on individual links within the port area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>Because of limited capital resources, it is not possible to provide PE halls in all schools which have applied for these facilities over the years.  The decision to include certain schools in the 1995 capital programme was taken as a result of detailed studies into all the applicants' particular cases, taking account also of the educational requirements.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at Dunshaughlin community college can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for additional classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to say when a PE hall will be provided in this particular case.</P>
      <P>However, the sports section of my Department has recently allocated a grant of £150,000 under the major sports capital programme to Dunshaughlin Community Centre Association towards the provision of a sports centre for Dunshaughlin.</P>

      <P>In the case of the governing bodies in the Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act, 1994, and the Dublin Institute of Technology (Amendment) Act, 1994 stipulate that</P>

      <P>Under this provision, the governing body is charged with making regulations determining how student representatives are chosen.</P>
      <P>In the case of colleges of education &mdash; primary and home economics teachers &mdash; sector, my Department does not have a specific regulatory role in relation to governing bodies.  However, I understand that, generally in this sector, student representatives have ex officio status on governing bodies.</P>
      <P>In the case of universities, I intend to introduce legislation to broaden the composition of their governing bodies. The White Paper on Education makes it clear that student representation on governing bodies will be provided for in that context, thus giving students a statutory right to representation.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the existing primary school system for payment of grants of any kind to primary schools that are not recognised national schools.  In order to merit recognition as national schools it would be necessary for Steiner schools to meet certain criteria in regard to staffing, curriculum, access and accommodation.  It would also be necessary to demonstrate that there is a need for a national school in the locality in question.  There would also be requirements regarding the structure of the board of management and the length of the school day and school year.</P>
      <P>All teachers would have to be qualified to teach in a national school.  The curriculum would need to be broadly similar to the official curriculum for national schools and include the teaching of Irish as an obligatory subject. School accommodation would have to meet official standards and pupils could not be charged fees of any kind as a condition of enrolment.  Recognised schools are also open to inspection by the Department's Inspectorate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the introduction of the free fees initiative a working group <Col N="2270" /> was established to make recommendations to me on the overall implementation of the initiative.  The working group had regard to student concerns in recommending that: (a) colleges should not be permitted to demand from students more than the maximum amount of £150; (b) colleges should set out publicly for the student body how the £150 would be allocated and (c) the arrangements to be put in place should not adversely affect the funding of student unions, clubs and societies.</P>
    <P>The maximum charge of £150 was recommended by the working group to apply to the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years.  Any proposal for an increase in the charge in subsequent years would be subject to the approval of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>I share the serious concern of the community in rural areas at the spate of recent attacks.  I sympathise with those who have been attacked and their relatives and friends.  Any such attacks are deplorable but those on the defenceless elderly, living alone and in isolated areas are particularly reprehensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that considerable resources are being concentrated on putting an end to such attacks and on bringing the perpetrators to justice.  Among the measures being taken by the Garda Síochána are the following: the deployment of widespread and mobile road <Col N="2272" /> blocks throughout the west in Operation Shannon; extra patrols in areas at special risk; increased Garda visits to the elderly to advise them on measures to improve their personal safety; increased visits to neighbours and relations to enlist their assistance in the protection of the elderly; increased contact with voluntary agencies working with the elderly; special requests to voluntary agencies and the public at large to report any matters out of the ordinary to the Garda without delay; increased activity by crime prevention officers in areas affected; encouragement for the development of neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes in areas not already covered by them.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda authorities with these measures are taking appropriate steps to protect the rural community and that whatever further measures are found to be necessary will be taken by them.</P>
    <P>In all this activity it will be clear that the full co-operation of the rural community in general, and voluntary agencies working for them, is critical to this campaign.  I am doing what I can to encourage this community effort.  The community alert scheme is a good example.  The Garda recently evaluated the operation of the scheme in 15 selected areas.  Based on research carried out on the crime levels for the three year periods before and after the community alert scheme was established, the following results were recorded; 17 per cent decrease in attacks on the elderly, 25 per cent decrease in burglaries, 21 per cent decrease in other crimes.</P>
    <P>There are now about 800 community alert schemes in operation, involving over 150,000 households throughout the country.  To encourage more of them, I am providing £50,000 to Muinir na Tíre to assist them in expanding the scheme.</P>
    <P>I also warmly welcome the contacts between Muintir na Tíre and organisations such as the IFA and the ICMSA to discuss arrangements for enhancing the co-ordination between all of the organisations and voluntary groups <Col N="2273" /> which can make a major contribution in protecting those most at risk in rural-communities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Social Welfare recently established a task force on security for the elderly.  My Department is represented on this task force by a senior official and by a senior Garda officer. This task force will make recommendations on the security needs of pensioners and I can assure the Deputy that I will fully support these.  I understand that the task force is to report to the Minister for Social Welfare by the end of this month.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has to introduce an inquisitorial system as practised in France and other European countries in place of preliminary examinations.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the preliminary examination in criminal trials is currently under review in my Department.  This review arises from the general desirability of continuously assessing the effectiveness of criminal trial procedures, and more particularly from the concern which has been expressed in some quarters that preliminary examinations may in certain cases add unnecessarily to delay in the holding of trials.</P>
      <P>My objective in carrying out this review is to ensure that the law on criminal procedure keeps pace with the demands made upon our criminal courts, while continuing to strike the right balance between effectiveness and the rights of an accused.</P>
      <P>I will bring forward any proposals I may have for change, arising out of the review, as soon as possible.  Without anticipating the outcome, perhaps I might make a brief comment on the suggestion contained in the question, that the preliminary examination should be replaced by an inquisitorial examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2274" /> We need to consider very carefully whether one particular aspect of a different legal system could be successfully transplanted into our system.  I am not saying that such a thing could not be done, but that any such move should be based on a detailed analysis of the benefits and disadvantages of the proposal in the context of Irish law, rather than a straightforward measurement of its effectiveness in a very different context.</P>
    <P>The view is sometimes expressed that the adversarial system, which we have, is more a contest between opposing lawyers than a search for the truth, and that an inquisitorial system would better serve the interests of justice.  While we must be open to constructive criticism of our procedures, and I certainly would not shrink from any necessary change, even if radical, we should not imagine that a critical debate is not taking place in civil law countries about the value of the inquisitorial system.  Not only are some aspects of the inquisitorial system criticised in some of those countries, including the role of French examining magistrates cited in the question, but in some instances there is evidence of a shift towards a more adversarial system.</P>
    <P>We have to be careful in assessing the merits of different legal systems, while keeping an open mind on any final conclusions. To take a practical example, and here I refer back to the concern that our system of preliminary examination may contribute to delays in criminal trials, we would all agree that delays should be kept to an absolute minimum. The reality is that delays also occur in those countries with an inquisitorial system, sometimes leading to long periods of remand in custody prior to trial.</P>
    <P>In addition to practical considerations there are wider issues to be considered in any assessment of an inquisitorial system, in particular the degree to which such a system would accord with the constitutional safeguards afforded to accused persons.  Particular care would have to be given to considering the extent to which the role of a judge could <Col N="2275" /> overlap or supplant the role of the prosecutor or the defence, roles which have always been separate and distinct, and the extent to which this could impinge upon the right of an accused to test the evidence offered against him or her.</P>
    <P>In considering these matters, we must not forget the option of adjusting our existing procedures, if adjustment is needed, within the parameters of our present legal system.  The Law Reform Commission, for example, in its reports on child sexual abuse and the law relating to dishonesty, has suggested that an accused who feels that there is no <i>prima facie</i> case should be enabled to apply to the court of trial for the case to be discharged, rather than a District Judge at a preliminary examination.</P>
    <P>This suggestion, and all other aspects of this complex matter, need the most careful consideration.  That is what I am undertaking in the review which is under way, and I will bring forward any proposals I may have for change as soon as possible after the review is completed.</P>

      <P>Existing law contains a common law offence of conspiracy.  The Law Reform Commission in its report on dishonesty looked at the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud and recommended no changes in the law in relation to it.  While its consideration of the matter arose in the context of fraud, the commission mentioned in relation to the law on conspiracy generally that the courts have frequently stated that conspiracy should not be charged when the <Col N="2276" /> evidence relied upon to establish it is the evidence of substantive offences also laid in the same indictment.  The commission concluded that &ldquo;aside from that very reasonable restriction, the offence of conspiracy still plays an important role in our criminal law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should mention also a couple of recent legislative developments in relation to conspiracy in so far as drug-related offences are concerned.  The definition of drug trafficking offence contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, includes conspiring to commit the substantive offences set out in the definition e.g. offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I should mention also that the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill before the House at present contains a similar definition and, accordingly, it is proposed that the additional powers of detention which it contains would apply to conspiracy to commit drug trafficking offences.</P>
      <P>I am examining what difficulties, if any, may arise in practice with the existing law of conspiracy in relation to drug trafficking and, in that context, will consider the Deputy's suggestion that the matter might be referred to the Law Reform Commission.</P>

The breakdown of this figure between the various forms of disposition, for example, brought up on remand and not re-committed by the courts, released on bail, on remission, on full temporary release, is not yet available.  It would require the manual checking of almost 10,000 files and the collation of that information and the staff time required could not be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing legislation dealing with the sale <Col N="2280" /> and distribution of pornographic material is principally the following: the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967 (as amended); the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1992; and the Video Recordings Acts, 1989 to 1992.</P>
      <P>These Acts provide for censorship of books/magazines, films and video recordings, respectively.  The task of censorship is carried out by the Censorship of Publications Board in relation to books and magazines and by the Film Censor in relation to films and video recordings.  There are also Appeal Boards to decide on any appeal against the decisions of the Censorship of Publications Board and the Film Censor.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation, the various boards and the Film Censor are independent in the exercise of their functions.</P>
      <P>There is a mechanism in place, under this legislation, through which pornographic or obscene publications can be banned.  Once a publication is banned, it is then a criminal offence to sell, or expose, offer, advertise or keep for sale, or distribute, or offer or keep for distribution, any such publication.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge any person who may be aware of the sale, at any place, of books or magazines, which could be regarded as offensive or pornographic to employ the provisions outlined in sections 6 and 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 (as amended).</P>
      <P>In particular, section 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, makes provision for the Censorship of Publications Board, on receipt of a complaint from any person, to prohibit the sale of a book or magazine which they consider to be indecent or obscene.  Complaints should be made to the Censorship of Publications Board.  A complaint must be accompanied by a copy of the book in question or, in the case of a magazine, by three recent issues of the magazine.</P>
      <P>With regard to the censorship of films and video recordings, I consider that the existing legislation gives the Film Censor wide-ranging powers to deal effectively with this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2281" /> The gardaí and the Customs and Excise Service also have certain powers to search for, and seize, indecent or obscene pictures, books, magazines and videos.  I have recently obtained the advice of the Attorney General in relation to the existing powers which the gardaí have in this regard and I have forwarded his advice to the Garda Commissioner for his attention.  While I do not want to comment on the details of any particular situation &mdash; in case it would prejudice Garda operations in this regard &mdash; I can say that I am aware that an intensive Garda investigation is taking place in relation to one particular case and I understand that a file will shortly be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions in this regard.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that, if at any stage it were to become evident that the existing censorship legislation is inadequate to prevent the sale of offensive pornographic material, I will not hesitate to propose amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I have brought the details supplied by the Deputy with this question to the attention of the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>Any death that occurs in custody is a tragedy.  There is an elaborate strategy in place for the prevention of suicides in prisons but unless there is to be a total denial of personal privacy to all prisoners at all times the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be precluded, no more than it can be precluded in the wider community.</P>
      <P>I can say, for the information of the House, that 50 of the 57 Suicide Prevention Recommendations contained in the Report of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths (published in August 1991) have been implemented or are in the course of implementation at no small cost to the Exchequer.

    <P>The remaining recommendations are more long-term in nature, a fact which was acknowledged by the advisory group.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 127 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns about the present supplementary welfare allowance appeals system and I recognise the need for improvements.</P>
      <P>Among those who have expressed concern about the adequacy of the system are the Ombudsman, agencies such as FLAC and Combat Poverty, and many Deputies, including myself, who have been made aware of the difficulties involved through contact with their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2286" /> As I announced in my budget speech, I have now had the opportunity to consider the results of a review of the procedures in this area.  To be effective and to gain the confidence of the public, an appeals procedure must be able to demonstrate independence, an adherence to fair procedures and a consistency of approach.  It is fair to say that the social welfare appeals system &mdash; administered by the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) &mdash; has those characteristics in abundance.  This has been widely acknowledged by welfare rights groups and other commentators.</P>
    <P>I have decided, therefore, that the Social Welfare Appeals Office will, in future, also take responsibility for supplementary welfare allowance appeals. The supplementary welfare allowance system plays a very significant role in the overall income maintenance arrangements.  I believe that the quality of the valuable service provided by the various health boards across the country can only be improved through the existence of a demonstrably independent appeals system.  The necessary legislative changes to give effect to this decision will be provided in the 1996 Social Welfare Bill.  In the meantime, my Department is examining the administrative and other implications arising from this decision with a view to its implementation as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 22 January 1996.  His means were assessed at £60 per week effective from that date based on his spouse's income from a community employment scheme. Because his spouse's gross weekly income exceeds the prescribed amount, no adult dependant allowance is payable and child dependant allowances are <Col N="2287" /> payable at half the standard rate.  The means assessment is, however, halved and the person concerned was, accordingly, assessed with means of £30 per week.</P>
      <P>An appeal against this decision was received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 29 January 1996 and the matters raised in the appeal have been referred to the independent Appeals Office for consideration.  Every effort is being made to have the appeal determined as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the reason female psychiatric nurses who married in the 1950s and were compelled to retire on marriage, are not entitled in their own right to an old age pension in spite of the fact that their husbands who are in the same service are entitled to an old age pension.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the pension the Deputy is referring to is the old age (contributory) pension, which is payable by my Department.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a retirement pension) registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yearly average condition gives rise to particular problems for people with gaps in their insurance records. The issue is not specific to psychiatric nurses.  While a number of these problems have been addressed by my Department in recent years, the National Pensions Board (NPB) report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> recommended a <i>pro-rata</i> pension scheme, which, in their view, would resolve the problems arising from gaps <Col N="2288" /> in coverage in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>The NPB report recommended, <i>interalia,</i> a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime, where, for example an average of 45 or over (as against 48 at present) would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of ten to 14 contributions.  They also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased from 156 (three years) to 520 contributions (ten years).  As such proposals could lead to a reduction in entitlement for future pensioners, when compared with present arrangements, they have to be evaluated very carefully.</P>
    <P>The NPB report, which is both comprehensive and complex, is at present being studied in detail in my Department. I will bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report based on detailed considerations and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The improvements in family income supplement which I am introducing this year as approved by me on 24 January, consist of: an increase of £10 in the weekly earnings thresholds governing entitlement to FIS thereby ensuring that most current recipients will receive an increase of £6 per week; a reduction, from six months to three months, in the qualifying period of employment; the extension of FIS to job-sharers; an increase in the FIS payment immediately on the birth of a child which means that the family will not have to wait until the annual review of entitlement, as at present, to receive the increased payment; and a reduction, from 20 to 19, in the number of hours which must be worked in order to qualify for FIS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A related improvement which I will be providing for in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, will enable people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more to retain the child dependant allowances for a period of 13 weeks if they take up employment which is expected to last at least four weeks.  This innovative measure will overcome the disincentive against taking up employment, identified by the Expert Working Group on the Tax and Social Welfare <Col N="2290" /> Systems, whereby an unemployed parent immediately loses the child dependant allowances on taking up employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Forfás undertakes an annual employment survey on behalf of IDA Ireland and Forbairt of all their client companies. This survey records job gains and job losses to produce a &ldquo;net&rdquo; job creation result for the agency for the year.  This system has been in operation <Col N="2292" /> since 1972.  It clearly identifies and distinguishes between first-time jobs and job recoveries.  A first-time job is any increase during the year from the peak employment in a company in the previous five years, arising from a specific investment programme agreed with Forbairt.  Job recoveries, on the other hand, relate to jobs lost and subsequently recovered &mdash; they are clearly singled out as such and are not counted as first-time jobs.  The following table illustrates the performance of Forbairt's client companies in 1995.  All the figures refer to permanent employment.</P>

    <P>In relation to the specific instance of TEAM Aer Lingus, which the Deputy raises in her question, the following is the case.  In 1992, the company had 1,986 permanent employees.  At the end of 1994, permanent employment had dropped to 1,453 as a result of the firm's well-known difficulties.  During 1995, some staff who had been laid off at the end of 1994 (and therefore not included in the 1,453 figure) were re-employed, bringing permanent employment up to 1,698 at the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>The 245 people re-employed in TEAM were not included in the first-time jobs figure announced by Forbairt for 1995 as TEAM is still below its peak of 1,986 permanent jobs achieved in 1992, but have been included in calculating the figure published by Forbairt in respect of 1995 relating to the net change in employment during the year.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no double counting of jobs.  In the year to year employment change, the bottom line is reflected as a net gain or loss.  In the period 1992 to 1994, TEAM contributed a net job loss of 533 and this was <Col N="2293" /> reflected in Forbairt's net change figures for those years.  Similarly, the net change figure for 1995 reflects the recovery of 245 jobs, previously counted as a loss.</P>

      <P>Discussions have been held on a number of occasions recently between officials of my Department and representatives of the Irish Homing Union (IHU) in relation to the introduction of an alternative system for the vaccination of pigeons by pigeon fanciers.  Under the new system, operative from 1 January 1996, pigeon clubs affiliated to the Irish Homing Union will be able to arrange for the vaccination of pigeons belonging to their members. However, the release of the vaccine will still be subject to the supervision of a veterinary practitioner.  Vaccination records will be furnished to my Department by the IHU.  The East Coast Federation of Racing Pigeons Clubs has indicated that it wishes to continue with the existing system of pigeon vaccination whereby vaccination is carried out directly by veterinary surgeons.  I have no objection to any federation continuing with the existing vaccination system.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is a general non-vaccinating policy in the poultry industry in Ireland and strict controls are required on vaccine supplies to ensure that this status is maintained.</P>

I would add that Coillte Teoranta, in pursuance of its commercial mandate as laid down in the Forestry Act, 1988, is also required by that Act to have due regard to the environmental and amenity consequences of its operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns at local level about clear-felling proposals in this property.  The Forestry Act, 1946 provides for control over tree felling operations, including clear-felling and thinning, most notably by way of the granting or refusal of general and limited felling licences.  No licence which would have permitted clear-felling operations to be carried out by Coillte Teoranta in this property has been issued since 1994.  The only operations which have been licensed in this period are normal silvicultural thinning operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a wider context I can tell the Deputy that it is standard practice for my Department to require that any <Col N="2296" /> areas clear-felled are replanted fully, normally within 12 months, and that the planted trees are protected and maintained thereafter.  Compliance with my Department's &ldquo;Forestry and the Landscape Guidelines&rdquo;, introduced in 1992, is a licence condition and requires that where clear-felling and replanting of an irregular strip at the edge of a plantation should be considered ten years prior to general clear-felling operations, in order to minimise visual impact.  I might also mention that my Department is considering the preparation of Guidelines or a Code of Practice specifically applicable to harvesting operations.</P>

      <P>At present a total of 18 officers are on career breaks from the Permanent Defence Force for periods of up to three years.  Fifty enlisted personnel are on special leave without pay and allowances. Twenty of the latter group are serving either with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the UN Field Service.  Five personnel have been granted periods of special leave without pay and allowances in excess of three years, four for a total of four years each and one for a period of three years and seven months.  Two of the personnel were granted the additional leave in order to complete full-time education courses.  The remaining three personnel were granted the extra periods of leave because of the exceptional circumstances that pertained in each case.</P>

      <P>The terms of career break schemes for members of the Permanent Defence Force were agreed with both RACO and PDFORRA under the provisions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. These are broadly similar to those which apply to the public service as a whole. However, in the case of PDF personnel, the maximum duration of a career break is three years rather than five years. <Col N="2304" /> Such a term is considered to be the longest after which personnel could return to PDF service with a realistic hope of promotion and advancement, given the loss of seniority and service experience associated with a lengthy break in service.  Furthermore, as it is necessary to realise a return on the investment in service training and military education, it is only in exceptional circumstances that career breaks are granted to PDF personnel who have completed less than 12 years' service in the case of officers, six years' service in the case of general service enlisted personnel and nine years' service in the case of technicians trained at the Army and Air Corps Apprentice Schools.</P>
