    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2-7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Special Meeting of the European Council in Dublin on 5 October last was a success.  In relation to the Intergovernmental Conference the Special Council reaffirmed the timetable set by the Florence European Council thereby confirming that the conference should be completed by the middle of next year. The special council also confirmed the need to maintain the level of ambition of the conference so as ensure that its outcome is adequate to equip and strengthen the Union to meet the internal and external challenges facing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Presidency will now proceed to discharge the mandate given to it at the Florence European Council and <Col N="1437" /> submit a revised draft Treaty to the Dublin European Council.  It is our objective that this draft will meet the required level of ambition and will provide a basis whereby the conference can be successfully concluded in mid 1997.</P>
    <P>I also briefed the special council on the progress on Ireland's other key Presidency priorities in the areas of economic and monetary union, drugs and crime and employment.  I indicated that the Presidency was on course to submit substantive conclusions to the December European Council under these headings.  The special council saw a particularly strong consensus on the need for the Union to tackle the issues of crime and drug trafficking not just through Treaty changes at the Intergovernmental Conference but also on an ongoing basis.  There was acknowledgement of the progress already made on this matter during the Irish Presidency notably at the recent informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and a determination to see further progress recorded at the December European Council.</P>
    <P>In the areas of external relations the Special Council discussed the EU's relations with the US, Russia, Japan and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  We also discussed the Middle East Peace Process and agreed that the Tánaiste should visit the Middle East to meet with both the Israelis and the Palestinians to convey the strongly held view of the European Union of the need to accelerate the Middle East peace process.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware the Tánaiste has already carried out his mission during which he met the Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Netanyahu, President Arafat of the Palestinian Authority and President Mubarak of Egypt.  The Tánaiste also had discussions during his visit with the US Secretary of State Mr. Warren Christopher.  The prompt action of the European Union signifies that the EU will do all in its power to promote a rapid conclusion to the peace negotiations in the Middle East and that we will co-operate <Col N="1438" /> with both the Israelis and the Palestinians in a constructive way.</P>
    <P>The Special Meeting of the European Council also agreed in principle to the appointment of a special EU envoy to work on an ongoing basis with all of the parties in the peace process in the Middle East.  The Special Council instructed the General Affairs Council to consider a mandate for such an envoy at its next meeting at the end of October.</P>
    <P>Chancellor Kohl paid an official visit to Ireland on 2-3 October last.  I had discussions with the Chancellor on 2 October which covered European and international issues.  The Chancellor indicated full agreement with Ireland's Presidency priorities especially in regard to the Intergovernmental Conference and the fight against drug trafficking and international crime.  We also reaffirmed our commitment to economic and monetary union in accordance with the provisions set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  I also briefed the Chancellor on the situation in Northern Ireland and expressed my appreciation for his support for the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark on 3 September last.  We had a discussion on a broad range of European issues with particular emphasis on the Intergovernmental Conference.  We also discussed EU-US relations and the situation in former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>On 18 September as President in Office of the European Council I made a State of the Union Address to the European Parliament.  I have arranged for copies of my address and my comments in reply to the debate to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>In the address I identified the five main tasks facing the European Union. These are: to make the Union more relevant to its citizens, to successfully conclude the Intergovernmental Conference, to make the single currency a reality, to complete the next round of enlargement to the East and South and to secure Europe's place in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> Finally, I visited Japan for an EU-Japan Summit on 30 September.  The joint statement issued at the conclusion of the summit, copies of which I have had placed in the Oireachtas Library, detail the shared commitment of both parties to key international and economic objectives, notably the promotion of human rights and democracy, the fight against international crime and the strengthening of the open multilateral trading system.</P>
    <P>While in Japan I had the honour of an audience with Emperor Akihito and I also had a bilateral meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Hashimoto.  At the latter meeting I indicated my strong wish for an intensification of trade between Ireland and Japan.  I stressed in particular that Ireland was an ideal entry point to the European Union's market for Japanese investors. I delivered the same message at a meeting I had with key Japanese businessmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his detailed reply.  I have many supplementary questions, most of which deal with totally different issues.  In his State of the Union Address to the Parliament in Strasbourg the Taoiseach said that two of the priorities of the Irish Presidency were safer streets and a peaceful Europe.  I have no doubt that he was also thinking about this island in addition to the other places to which he referred.</P>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to utterly condemn those who perpetrated the bombing of the army barracks in Lisburn yesterday and to offer the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil Party to those who were injured in this very grave incident.  This bombing again pushes back what all the parties in this House are endeavouring to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In condemning the bombing and in agreeing with the actions of and statement by the Government yesterday, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate to have a full summit on the North with Prime Minister Major?  He will <Col N="1440" /> recall that at the beginning of September he stated it was necessary for the Governments to put greater impetus and more confidence building measures into the peace process.  Regrettably, this has not happened.  Neither does it give a good signal that the Taoiseach had only a 15 minute meeting on this issue at the summit.  This was always possible but it was not very helpful.  However, I am more interested in the future.  On the occasion of the three months anniversary of the talks, which have effectively made no progress &mdash; this is agreed by everybody &mdash; will the Taoiseach have a full summit with Prime Minister Major and try to put some life into a process which I do not accept is dead but which does not have much life?</P>

      <P>There are later questions to the Taoiseach on matters appertaining to Northern Ireland, but perhaps the Taoiseach may wish to intervene now.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to do so but there are a number of other matters raised in these questions with which I am sure Members would like to deal. I will facilitate the House in any way.</P>

      <P>Questions Nos. 18, 23, 25&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not reach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will reach them tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the entire House will join in condemning the outrage in Lisburn, the injuries inflicted and, in particular, the way in which the second bomb was placed in order to interfere directly with and put at risk the lives of those in the emergency services seeking to bring succour and aid to those injured by the first blast.  I think Members will also join me in condemning the timing of these bombs which coincided with a meeting between one of the Loyalist political parties and prisoners associated with them and the way in which they could <Col N="1441" /> have been designed to provoke those people into a reaction.  All those factors combine to make this a particularly appalling event.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise also that some of the individuals who have been injured who may appear to us to be just casualties or statistics will be in great pain, probably for the rest of their lives on this earth.  Some of their families will be traumatised in a way from which neither they nor their families will ever recover.  These are the casualties of politics pursued by violent means.</P>
    <P>Violence is not just a word which by constant repetition begins to lose its meaning.  Violence is severed limbs, violence is destroyed minds and it is people who can never walk on the street again with any sense of self-assurance for fear that there will be a repetition of what happened in Lisburn yesterday. That is what politics by means of violence means in practical reality.  It means families who will never recover from the shock.  We should never, in our attempts to find words to condemn these events, lose sense of the fact that these are individuals who have been hurt needlessly because a talks process exists in which all legitimate political parties can take part if they forswear violence.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I wish to state that of course the talks process is difficult.  We all knew at the outset that an all-inclusive talks process, as distinct from a narrowly focused one, would be inherently difficult.  If one looks at the history of Europe, virtually no state was established by consensus or by the agreement of 99.9 per cent of the people.  Even the Constitution of this State was contested when it was passed in 1937.  One does not get complete consensus about the establishment of a state easily in any forum or at any point in history.  This has been forgotten and people assume this is an easy process, that it is simply a question of everybody sitting down together and agreeing on a form of government.  This is not the case.  We could not agree initially on the formation of this State.  We eventually agreed <Col N="1442" /> on it but it did not come about through people sitting around a table &mdash; they sat around a table but they did not agree.</P>
    <P>We should not pretend that because these talks which have been in existence since 10 June have not found agreement yet that that is necessarily an indication that talks are the wrong way forward or that we need something completely different.  Seeking agreement on a form of Government by means of consensus is inherently very difficult, even if there had never been any violence in Northern Ireland.  However, given that there have been 25 years of violence it is even more difficult.  It is even more difficult, given that there have been sectarian and triumphalist marches and reactions such as boycotts.  Given that those phenomena have existed, there is even greater difficulty in finding agreement and consensus on the most fundamental question regarding the form of government for a state wherein there are disputed views about allegiance and sovereignty. It is not a simple or straightforward issue.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that progress has been slow.  Deputy Harney is correct; it is wrong to state that the talks are dead. Agreement was reached about procedure and the appointment of a chairperson from the United States.  The idea that a person from the United States could chair the talks would not have been agreed two years ago.  It has now been agreed, however, and has brought focus and status to the discussions which would not otherwise exist.  There have been immense difficulties regarding decommissioning but there is an agreed approach between the two Governments on that issue.  Such agreement did not exist in the past.  It is important that the two Governments agree on that matter because it means that those who disagree with our position have a case to prove.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Ahern's point that both Governments should continue to work together at every level, including the highest level.  I have been involved in intense discussions with Mr. John Major, not merely at the summit <Col N="1443" /> which took place at the weekend.  During the past week, I spoke to him on two occasions about this matter at some length.  Following those conversations, there have been ongoing and very intense exchanges between our administrations.  If Mr. Major or myself are of the opinion that a direct, special summit between us would be helpful, there would be no difficulty or unwillingness in organising one.  However, it is important to complete one's preparatory work before engaging in such meetings.  If others can be encouraged to come together without the necessity for such a meeting, then that approach should be pursued.  On Saturday, the Prime Minister and I agreed to renew our efforts to make the talks work and build on our joint approach to those talks in every way possible.  That is the best route forward.</P>
    <P>The violence in Lisburn represents a return to a form of political action that led this country into appalling suffering over many years.  This form of political action was abandoned for the settlement of disputes in Europe in 1945.  I believe it is not appropriate for the resolution of any of the difficulties which remain in this country.  There is an alternative way forward by means of the talks, which have been in existence since 10 June.  I ask those who have influence with the people responsible for the use of violence to encourage them to respect democracy, make them realise that the opportunity for discussion exists at the all-party talks and request that they attend those talks, take part and not stand aside from the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in some difficulty regarding the time available for dealing with questions to the Taoiseach.  Being Tuesday, only 30 minutes are available for that purpose. Members can observe the clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach would have no difficulty in postponing the supplementaries on the other questions he answered until tomorrow because this is a more <Col N="1444" /> important issue.  I have supplementaries on practically every question, the replies to which moved from Japan to Germany to Strasbourg to Dublin and everywhere in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in doing so if the Ceann Comhairle can facilitate us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach and the Leaders of the other parties are aware, there are proposals before the House to amend this situation and extend the time for questions addressed to the Taoiseach.  These proposals may perhaps come before the House tomorrow.  However, I still have a difficulty with today's time constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Could he provide a word of tactical advice regarding the following?  For a number of months, the talks have been ongoing but there has been little progress.  As I stated earlier, they are not dead but the public's interpretation is that when there is no action there is a vacuum which, when there was one in Northern Ireland during the past 25 years was filled with violence.  Unfortunately we are drifting into that path and hopefully it can be avoided.  I hope the loyalist leaders who have practised excellent restraint for the past seven to eight months can continue to do so.  It seems that a 15 minute meeting at a summit gives the wrong signal but perhaps that was the only possible arrangement which could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that he will see if it is possible to arrange a full summit between himself and the Prime Minister.  That would be very helpful because people looking at the process can see that individuals are impeding it and that progress is not being made.  The Taoiseach stated that some progress is being made but there is no agenda and ordinary people understand this to mean that we are going nowhere.  I am aware of what is happening behind the scenes.  However, if <Col N="1445" /> the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister are interested &mdash; I am sure they are &mdash; in trying to convince everyone on this island that progress is being made, a visible summit between them to put some life into those involved in the talks would help.  The fact that Senator Mitchell is not available this week, and will not be available next week, convinces no one and the vacuum is being filled by those who thrive on such situations. The least that can be done is for the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Major, to meet during the coming week to show that this process remains on the rails and is the only show in town, as they both stated in recent days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point to make is that an IRA ceasefire is needed to enable everyone to participate in the talks.  Those denying us a ceasefire are denying one of the parties, which represents 15 per cent of the voting population in Northern Ireland, any participation in the talks.  We do not need violence because it is counterproductive and directly contrary to the concept of dialogue.  During the past 24 hours spokespersons for Sinn Féin have requested dialogue in response to yesterday's events.  The opportunity for dialogue exists at the talks and it is necessary for the IRA to engage in a ceasefire to enable Sinn Féin to participate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>People who are not present at the talks cannot be blamed for delaying their progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the talks are concerned, I have already stated that we are not seeking to reach practical agreements about a narrow list of items regarding the operation of public administration.  The question of allegiance and sovereignty and other broad and inherently difficult issues are on the table for discussion.  If we consider the history of the states of Europe, not one was formed by 100, 80 or 75 per cent consensus.  It is important to understand that the scale of the problem to be <Col N="1446" /> tackled in the talks is great.  Therefore, we should not talk ourselves into failure because we are not able to achieve results to meet press deadlines or the impatient demand for something new on every occasion.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the viewpoints of nine different parties against a background of 25 years of violence, which continued in Lisburn yesterday.  It is not a simple matter of the two Prime Ministers meeting to devise a formula that will make people, who previously held opposite views, agree.  In this case, agreement must come from people being willing to compromise with one another.</P>

Of course the Governments retain the ultimate responsibility in these matters and they are willing at all times to exercise their responsibilities as and when necessary. Having had such a difficult task in getting the talks started, we should be loath <Col N="1447" /> to take initiatives that might have the effect of stopping them.</P>

      <P>I accept that in so far as the talks are ongoing the Taoiseach is correct in saying they are not dead.  May I take it from what he said that there is no suggestion of postponing the talks for an indefinite period?  Does he believe it is vital for the Government to inject new direction and momentum into the talks to ensure their success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration has not been given to postponing the talks.  The Governments believe they have an ongoing responsibility to inject momentum into them and we did that in our proposals on decommissioning.  The decommissioning of guns, mortars and bombs is one of the issues preventing the parties from engaging in substantive talks.  Only yesterday we were reminded of the fact that guns and bombs still have an effect in Northern Ireland and are relevant in people's minds.  Unfortunately, as a result of what happened in Lisburn yesterday, people are reminded of the effects of bombs and guns, where they are located, who owns them and the purpose for which they are used. Those who wave their hands in a dismissive manner and ask why this issue cannot be swept aside, as if it were a simple matter, must reflect on the views of constituents if such a bomb were to go off in one of their constituencies. That is the challenge facing us.  It is not a matter about which people can wave their hands and claim it is not important.</P>

      <P>In their proposals on decommissioning, the two Governments have put forward their views on how the problem could be solved.  If those proposals are accepted by the Unionist parties we can move forward to the agenda without prejudice to any of the concerns I have mentioned.  It is important that <Col N="1448" /> we continue to move the talks forward by purposeful leadership, which the Government has shown on the decommissioning issue, while at the same time allowing the parties a reasonable amount of space to reach conclusions. The talks will not work if we attempt to set at nought, or steamroll over, their opinions.  We must inject new thinking and leadership into the discussions in a purposeful way and at appropriate times.  We cannot approach it on the basis of simply ignoring the opinions of others.</P>

      <P>I am not sure to whom the Taoiseach was referring when he spoke about people waving their hands. I do not believe it could be any Member from the Opposition benches.  I have not heard any Member state that the violence in Northern Ireland does not concern us because some day, sooner rather than later perhaps, it may return to any of our constituencies.  That is a major concern for all of us and that is why we want progress on this issue.  Will the Taoiseach renew his invitation to the PUP and the UDP leadership to talk to the Government so that we could at least explain to them that all parties in this part of the island are anti-violence? I accept they refused an earlier invitation from him, but perhaps it is time to invite them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand how the Taoiseach could claim it is time to sit back and allow them work on the framework themselves.  If the three stranded approach and the Framework Document of February 1996 were working, surely there is an obligation on the Taoiseach to influence the talks at this stage rather than wait for them to break up in disorder.  It is not a question of waiting for an interjection.  At the beginning of September the Taoiseach stated <Col N="1449" /> the Governments would drive the talks process forward but he has done nothing since and the British Prime Minister has not done anything in that regard since 10 June.</P>

      <P>The three strands commence simultaneously and until strands one and two start the terms of reference for the talks cannot start.  We have not reached the agenda for the strands.  Therefore, strand three has not started and it does not provide us with the procedural mechanism to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the issue of decommissioning, as the Deputy is aware, the Governments tabled proposals on an agreed basis to break the deadlock.  Unfortunately, the Unionists did not to agree with the Governments' proposals and came up with their own. The outcome of that exchange must be considered by the Governments and I have discussed the matter with the British Prime Minister on two occasions in the past seven days.  The Governments must move the talks forward but in a way that ensures the process is preserved and continues.  Our actions must not prevent others from participating. The Government is striking the correct balance between giving direction to the talks and leaving space for the participants to reach conclusions.  The approach suggested by others would be foolhardy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is a perversion of logic for Sinn Féin to blame the Unionists for what happened in Lisburn yesterday?  Does he accept that as a result of yesterday's bombing it will be more difficult to resolve the decommissioning issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both assumptions are correct, but it is also the case that the <Col N="1450" /> Unionists' attitude has not been as forthcoming as it might have been. While I understand their reservations and concerns, we live in a real world in which it must be recognised that decommissioning will occur only when people agree to decommission.  For people to agree to decommission the political process must be seen to be progressing.  The Unionists have not been willing to see that fact and their approach has tended to be myopic, focusing on the need for decommissioning but not on the conditions necessary for it to take place in a real world.</P>
      <P>The two Governments have adopted the correct approach to breaking the decommissioning deadlock.  The joint proposals made in the talks represent the best way forward.  I hope it will prove possible for all the parties in the talks to accept the approach the two Governments have put forward in that particularly contentious matter, a matter which has unfortunately been brought vividly back to mind by the bombs in Lisburn.</P>

      <P>I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals for fresh broadcasting legislation to <Col N="1451" /> Government within the next few weeks. My proposals will deal with the legislative structures for all aspects of broadcasting in Ireland including local radio which I consider to be a very important element of broadcasting services here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister believes local radio is an important element of the broadcasting structure. Does he appreciate the cultural input of local radio?  What is his response to the AIRS press conference a few weeks ago which put forward a comprehensive document with proposals for local radio?  There has been no response to that document from the Government.  Is it aware of the broadcasting policy of that document?</P>
      <P>Following the Green Paper I am glad broadcasting legislation will be put before the House.  However, we are still working in a vacuum.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate his response to the AIRS document, with particular reference to local radio.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the AIRS document and have read the reports on the different points made by the group, including its proposals on advertising, radio broadcasting, aid in relation to costs, etc.  They are not markedly different from the submission of the AIRS on the Green Paper; indeed, they are an expansion of the AIRS agenda indicated to me before the publication of the Green Paper.  At this point it would be inappropriate to go into detail on its submission in advance of my bringing the heads of legislation to Government.  The Deputy will appreciate that the responsibility for local broadcasting lies with the Independent Radio and Television Commission under the 1988 Act.  In the proximate relationship, the relationship with the members of AIRS is with the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the responsibility of the Independent Radio and Television Commission in this <Col N="1452" /> regard.  However, putting the heads of a Bill to Government is one thing but seeing the Bill in the House and having it enacted is another.  Those young people working in local radio would be interested to hear the Minister's proposals and what he intends to do.  Perhaps he could give us a general indication of those views, particularly in relation to training, the proposed &ldquo;super authority&rdquo;, the 3 per cent levy and the Independent Radio and Television Commission structure.  There are many issues involved and, although the Minister may not wish to go into detail, we should not have to wait for years to find out the Government's views on broadcasting legislation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of all those who work in local radio, not just the young people the Deputy mentioned.  There are some people of mature years who work in the sector.  I expect the legislation to be passed by the Oireachtas early in 1997.  I expect to be in a position to go to Government with the heads of the Bill within a matter of weeks.  If the heads of the Bill are agreed by the Government, I have indicated that I am amenable to discussing the broad thrust of the legislation at that time.  It would be inappropriate to go into detail in advance of my going to Government with the heads of legislation.  I assure the Deputy there will be no undue delay.</P>

Is the Minister willing to meet representatives of the local radio stations?  Clare FM has tried to meet the Minister without success.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of how best to mark the millennium is a matter for the Government.  As I indicated to the meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs held on 6 June 1996, I was invited by the Taoiseach to make a presentation to the Government on the issue of the commemoration of the millennium.  I also <Col N="1454" /> stressed that any suggestions I mentioned at that meeting did not imply the commitment of additional resources to facilitate their implementation.  I have recently made this presentation to the Cabinet and it is now a matter for the Government to decide on how best to address the millennium.  The question of whether specific projects will be commissioned to mark the commemoration of the millennium can only be addressed following this consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific question of a national conservatoire for music and the arts, the Deputy will be aware that this matter was raised in the PIANO report which was submitted to me earlier this year, and which dealt extensively with the issue of musical education, an issue strictly speaking outside its formal terms of reference. However, I welcomed its inclusion.  The report makes a case for the establishment of an Irish academy for the performing arts based at the premises at Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin which is currently occupied by the National Concert Hall and departments of University College Dublin.  The report visualises that such an academy would not only serve classical music, which is what the term &ldquo;conservatoire&rdquo; implies, but would serve all of the performing arts.  Departments within the academy, suggested in the report include a department of classical music, obviously, and departments of opera, drama, traditional music, popular music and jazz, music technology and recording techniques, dance, film, video and television, and applied arts.  The report recommends that the most economical way of setting up such an academy would be to amalgamate the third level sections of the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Dublin Institute of Technology College of Music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Deputy has already raised this matter on the Adjournment Debate in this House on 26 June last, she will appreciate that the recommendation in the report raises many complex issues, including, especially, the issue of <Col N="1455" /> the use to which the Earlsfort Terrace site is to be put when it is possible to move the departments of University College Dublin, currently housed there, to the Belfield campus.  The Deputy is also aware I have already been in correspondence with the Minister for Education regarding the recommendations in the PIANO report that impinge on her responsibilities, including in particular the recommendation in relation to the establishment of an academy for the performing arts.  I can assure the Deputy I will be in further consultation with the Minister for Education with a view to coming to a conclusion on the relevant recommendations in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs a meeting of which he and I attended on 6 June.  I put a number of questions to him at that meeting and I would like to deal with the millennium project and the PIANO report. What moneys have been made available by the Government to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to lead a millennium project and what staff have been made available to him to carry out this work?  Without knowing the answers to those questions it is difficult to know how we can proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that when I answered questions on this matter I gave details of a small grant of £10,000 which I found from resources within my Department to consider an interesting proposal called Ireland 2000 which was submitted to our Department.  I reported on that on the day I met the committee.  At this stage the Government has not decided on resources, staffing and which Department will be responsible for leading the millennium project.  Until that Government decision is taken, which may well involve my Department, I cannot give any further information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I would be interested to hear when the Minister believes the Government will be able to report to <Col N="1456" /> decide on those two issues.  I would also be interested to hear when the discussions he is having with the Department of Education on the PIANO report's proposal for the setting up of a national conservatoire will be concluded. Fianna Fáil supports that proposal. It is an excellent idea.  I hope the Minister and the Government will be able to put forward this project as one, if not the main, millennium project.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is important that any project should be enduring.  The establishment of a national conservatoire in Earlsfort Terrace, which would be an appropriate building &mdash; perhaps the Minister could suggest another venue &mdash; would be the way to proceed as it would help many students.</P>

It is difficult to put a date on when the Government will reach a conclusion on the appropriate projects.  I will continue the discussions between my Department and the Minister for Education on advancing the implementation of the recommendations of the PIANO report. I will do that without delay.  That is as much as I can say.  I have opened talks and I will continue them.</P>

      <P>I have raised this matter in the Dáil on a number of occasions and the Minister has pointed out certain difficulties in this regard.  I raised it well in advance of the Irish Presidency because I had hoped the Government would issue a mission statement as to what it proposed to do to pursue the designation of Irish as a full working language of the EU.  Does the Minister accept that if the Irish language was recognised in this way it would create a number of jobs?  I understand 500 jobs in translation work alone could be created.  It would also solve the problem for many Irish people who are seeking EU positions which require two languages because at this stage they cannot count their national language as one of them.  With the onset of EU enlargement when other languages will be coming onstream and will be accepted as full working languages, the Minister should ensure that the Irish language is incorporated as an official working language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Every opportunity will be taken to make that point, particularly in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference where it is more strictly relevant than the Irish Presidency which runs in parallel with the Intergovernmental Conference process. As I said in relation to the arrangements for the conduct of our Presidency, this was the first time that Irish was used in simultaneous translation on a parallel with German, French and the other languages of the Union.  All documentation was prepared in Irish and it was used at the meetings.  We are trying to run the Presidency in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Intergovernmental Conference, particularly the issue of enlargement, I have said that every opportunity will be taken to consider the issue of the use of the language. What Deputy de Valera said is factually <Col N="1459" /> true in that if Irish had a working language status it would have employment consequences, but it must be borne in mind that whatever we do now we are trying to make up for a lost opportunity at the time of accession.  If the past was let go at that time we are trying to make up for that now.  I am not saying that just to make a point, but that is the circumstance in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We will certainly use what opportunities we can.  I agree that perhaps the opening may come in considerations of enlargement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that we should promote the Irish language.  I admire the way the Minister has done so, especially in the meetings he outlined in his reply.  However, official acknowledgement of the language is quite different and I know the difficulties that may arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that enlargement may help in pursuing the goal of accepting the Irish language as an official language.</P>
      <P>Does he agree there is scope for flexibility in this area?  The status of Irish should be ensured; final versions of EU documents and legal documentation should be available in Irish and it should be recognised as a language which citizens can use in job applications for EU promotions.  Irish should be included in all EU measures which affect language practice and research.  Does the Minister agree this would be a start?  If so, how does he intend to pursue those aspects?</P>

      <P>There have been talks between officials of my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs on many of the matters Deputy de Valera mentioned.  We have examined ways in which we might advance in relation to text and all of these other matters.  We have made proposals on where we can make progress in this area, and many of them have been agreed.</P>

      <P>Faoi mar a cuireadh in iúl don Teach mar fhreagra ar Cheist Uimh 12 ar 14 Márta, ar Cheisteanna Uimh.  23 agus 28 ar 12 Meitheamh, ar Cheisteanna Uimh. 166 agus 167 ar 18 Meitheamh agus ar Cheist Uimh 291 ar 25 Iúil 1996, níl soláthar i Vóta mo Roinne i mbliana le haghaidh caiteachais ar bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht.  Ar ndóigh, is ceist go príomha don Roinn Comhshaoil agus do na Comhairlí Contae iomchuí í staid na mbóithre sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Gheall mé níos luaithe i mbliana go mbreithneofaí an scéal tuilleadh, i gcomhairle leis an Aire Airgeadais, féachaint an dtig linn soláthar éigin a chur ar fáil i mbliana chun bóithre áise agus bóithre portaigh sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú nuair a bheadh cúrsaí níos soiléire maidir le caiteachas mo Roinne i 1996 ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

    <P>Mar thoradh ar an mbreithniú sin, meastar go gcaithfear ina iomlán, ar <Col N="1461" /> thograí atá ceadaithe cheana féin, an soláthar méadaithe atá ar fáil i mbliana le caitheamh ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar sin ní bheidh airgead ar fáil i mbliana ó mo Roinnse le caitheamh ar bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

Cuireann sé iontas orm freisin agus an bhféadfadh an tAire a dheimhniú gur iarradh ar na Comhairlí Contae i lár an tsamhraidh moltaí a chur ar aghaidh ag an Roinn maidir le caiteachas airgid ar bhóithre áise i mbliana agus má iarradh an teolas sin cén fáth ar iarradh é muna raibh airgead a dhul a bheith ar fáil?

      <P>Rud eile atá tábhachtach ná go ndearna mé féin leasú ar an scéim a bhí ann.

      <P>Nuair a chuathas i gcomhairle leis na comhairlí contae, an ndearna sé soiléir dóibh gur ag caint ar 1997 a bhí an tAire, seachas ar 1996?  Ar ndóigh, tá seans maith ann go mbeidh cuid de na bóithre a bhí luaite ag na comhairlí contae déanta taca an ama seo arís agus tar éis an chaoi ar caitheadh leo i mbliana, níl aon chomhairle contae chun a dhul sa tseans san earrach go mbeidh nó nach mbeidh airgead ar fáil do bhóithre áise an bhliain seo chugainn.  Ní dóigh liomsa gur leithscéal é sin.</P>
      <P>Níor fhreagair an tAire an dara ceist a chuir mé.  Cé mhéad iarratas atá faighte ag a Roinn ó thús na bliana seo ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta faoi Scéim na mBóithre Áise?  Más faoi oifigigh na gcomhairlí contae atá sé liosta a réiteach cén fáth a bhfuiltear ag scaipeadh foirmeacha iarratais ar phobal na Gaeltachta?  Cén túdar atá leis seo?</P>

Má tá an scéim chun teacht ar ais, caithfear é a reachtáil i gcomhpháirtíocht leis na húdaráis áitiúla agus na húdaráis eile ar bhealach.

Tuigeann an tAire go raibh mé ag gearán faoin seanscéim agus go raibh gá lena leasú.  Ach seachas é a leasú, is éard a rinne an tAire ná an <Col N="1463" /> scéim a chur ar ceal ar fad.  Chuir sé sin ionadh ar gach éinne agus glacann an tAire leis go ndúirt sé sa Dáil agus in áiteanna eile go raibh sé chun an cás a athbhreithniú.  Bhí an Teachta Ó Cuív agus mé féin ag iarraidh fáil amach uaidh cad é todhchaí na scéime seo.  An bhfuil sé i gceist é a athbhunú i mbliana mar d'fhéadfaí an chiall sin a ghlacadh ón méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire?  An bhfuil sé ag rá go cinnte go mbeidh sé ann an bhliain seo chugainn?

Glacaim leis go bhfuil riachtanais ann ach caithfidh mise mar Aire na riachtanais sin a chur i gcomhthéacs riachtanais eile agus chomh maith leis sin i gcomhthéacs na straitéise ó thaobh caiteachais phoiblí de.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 40 agus Uimh. 42 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Shocraigh an Rialtas ar an 20 Eanáir, 1995, go gcuirfí £10m in aghaidh na bliana ar fáil ón Státchiste ar bhonn leanúnach i leith costais reatha Theilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá dualgas leagtha ar RTÉ an bunstruchtúr teicniúil a thógáil chun a chumasú do Theilifís na Gaeilge feidhmiú mar sheirbhís náisiúnta ar <Col N="1466" /> leith.  Ba é an bunsprioc ná go mbeadh an tseirbhís ar fáil anois do 90 faoin gcéad den daonra ón tús.  Tuigtear ón eolas is déanaí atá ar fáil ó RTÉ go meastar go mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeilge ar fáil do idir 93 faoin gcéad agus 95 faoin gcéad den daonra ón túsdáta.  Tar éis don tseirbhís a bheith tosaithe, leanfaidh RTÉ ar aghaidh leis an gclár gléasaistrithe atá pleanáilte, a mheastar a chríochnófar go luath i 1997.  Ina dhiaidh sin, is ceist do RTÉ na ceantair a shonrú nach mbeidh glacadh sásúil le fáil iontu agus clár a chur idir lámha chun gléasaistritheoirí de chumhacht íseal a sholáthar, i gcomhréir leis na hacmhainní foirne agus eile a bheidh ar fáil, d'fhonn na fadhbanna sin a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Beidh an líonra tarchuradóireachta atá á thógáil don stáisiún nua ag feidhmiú ar mhinicíochtaí ar an mbanda craolachán UHF, a chuirtear ar fáil ag an Roinn Iompair, Fuinnimh agus Cumarsáide ón speictream craolacháin atá ceaptha d'Éire faoi chomhaontaithe idirnáisiúnta.</P>
    <P>I gcásanna nach mbíonn RTÉ 1 agus Network 2 á bhfáil ag lucht féachana ar UHF, tuigim ó RTÉ go mbeidh sé riachtanach do dhaoine ar mian leo Teilifís na Gaeilge a fháil aeróga UHF a insealbhú.  Ní mór dom a threisiú nach bhfuil aon rud speisialta nó neamhchoitianta faoi aeróga UHF: tá siad in úsáid ar fud na tíre.  Níl aon phleananna ann chun deontais a sholáthar d'fhonn aeróga UHF a cheannach.</P>
    <P>Faoi alt 19 den Acht um Údarás Craolacháin, 1960, arna cur isteach ag Alt 16 den Acht um Údarás Craolacháin (Leasú), 1976, ní cheadaítear don mhéid iomlán uaireanta in aghaidh na bliana a chraolann an tÚdarás ar raidió agus ar theilifís, bheith ós cionn uasmhéid nó faoi bhun íosmhéid a leagtar síos ag an Údarás le toiliú an Aire.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cláir seachas an phríomhsheirbhís trí Ghaeilge, tá moltaí curtha faoi bhráid le déanaí faoin bhforáil thuas ag Údarás RTÉ, ar mholadh ó Chomhairle Theilfís na Gaeilge, maidir le huaireanta craolta na céad bliana d'feidhmiú Theilifís na Gaeilge, áirítear <Col N="1467" /> moltaí i ndáil le hábhar a chraoladh seachas ábhar a bhaineann leis an mbunsheirbhís Ghaeilge.  Tá na moltaí sin á meas agam faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Ar son na foirfeachta, ba chóir dom a rá go soileír nach bhfuil rún agam, agus mo fhreagrachtaí reachtúla faoi na forálacha réamhráite á gcomhlíonadh agam, baint a bheith agam le cúrsaí clár ó lá go lá.  Fanann an fhreagracht eagarthóireachta faoin easchur ar líonra Theilifís na Gaeilge mar chúram reachtúil de chuid Údarás RTÉ go dtí go ndéanfar socruithe chun Teilifís na Gaeilge a bhunú mar eagraíocht reachtúil ar leith.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister is making £10 million of State funding available to RTÉ for the operation of Téilifís na Gaeilge.  Will the Minister confirm that he received a communication from the RTÉ board of management, and the RTÉ Authority, indicating that the provision of 360 hours programming will cost £5.5 million, a cost RTÉ states it cannot bear, and that it has indicated to the Department that it would pull the plug on Téilifís na Gaeilge at the end of the first year if further funding for such programming is not made available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by those who conduct negotiations with my Department that there is no basis for the newspaper report to which the Deputy refers.  There was not a suggestion that RTÉ would pull the plug on Téilifís na Gaeilge before the end of the first year.  I am anxious to be as open as I can about the figures.  The figure of £5.5 million was used in discussions on costs, about which there is some difference because costs depend on arrangements for the hour's programme and other costs attributed to it.  The engineering preparations are very well advanced and great credit is due to Radio Téilifís Éireann's engineering staff.  There is general enthusiasm and a great sense of expectation for the new station, which I expect will be a success.</P>

      <P>It appears that RTÉ does not share the Minister's enthusiasm for the operation of Téilifís na Gaeilge, however laudable the service.  In terms of competition facing RTÉ, in light of the fact that advertising this year is down £2 million on the figure this time last year, the independent radio station and the second national television channel are to come on stream, the independent commissioning budget will be £12.5 million and sports rights costs are spiralling, it is estimated that in two years there could be a loss of £9 million to RTÉ.  In those circumstances will the Minister ensure the success of Téilifís na Gaeilge and that RTÉ will not be at a disadvantage in terms of producing 360 hours of broadcasting for Téilifís na Gaeilge?  Will he give a long-term commitment to funding the additional programming he has requested from RTE?</P>

The national broadcaster, had it refused to provide one hour for an Irish language station, would have raised a question about its full extent as a national broadcaster, and people may advance that view if they wish.  On long-term funding, the commitments to Téilifís na Gaeilge will bring this service on air and the network will provide a considerable addition to the family of public service broadcasters in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very wrong to think that the cash position of Radio Téilifís Éireann derives entirely from difficulties created by Téilifís na Gaeilge.  I recall when making a submission to Government in favour of a television licence fee increase matters raised included the age of equipment, future staffing structures, changes in regard to technology and other matters that had nothing to do with Téilifís na Gaeilge. We must ensure Radio Téilifís Éireann <Col N="1469" /> is financially secure whether or not we are serious about Téilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of this matter relates to the consistency of our position nationally and internationally in terms of the balanced version of broadcasting that is desired.  Some people define freedom as the ability simply to be free to turn on and off buttons in relation to commercial options while others see it as including a full range of minority interests, with a wider remit including the old aim in broadcasting which is to educate as well as to entertain.  I have appreciated the general support from all sides of the House for Téilifís na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>At the end of this month Téilifís na Gaeilge will come on air.  The Minister, Deputy Higgins, has been charged with the duty, on behalf of this House, to make the arrangements to bring into being Téilifís na Gaeilge, which has the support of all parties.  Is it true that householders in western counties, where the majority of Gaeltacht areas are situated, will experience difficulty receiving Téilifís na Gaeilge because of the technical broadcasting arrangements?  Is it true that Téilifís na Gaeilge will be available on cable and UHF only in the west where RTÉ is available on VHF only, and because it will not be available on MMDS only a small percentage of householders in the west will be able to receive Téilifís na Gaeilge on 31 October without going to the expense and trouble of erecting an aerial, which may cost between £45 and £60?  In the eastern half of the country Téilifís na Gaeilge will be available to householders by simply retuning their sets to find the new channel.  Will those living in western counties have to purchase a new aerial or make an expensive adjustment to the aerial costing up to £60 before they can receive Téilifís na Gaeilge while the station will be available freely to UHF receivers located east of a line from Derry to Cork?</P>

      <P>Radio Téilifís Éireann is advertising a campaign of change from VHF areas to UHF areas.  It is also making significant changes to bolster transmission in different parts of the west.  For example, this week there is to be an improvement in the facility at Clifden, which will strengthen transmission.  It is somewhat unfortunate that RTÉ's campaign about improving reception for RTÉ 1 and Network 2 is taking place at the same time as we are launching Téilifís na Gaeilge.  At present one would need to get a UHF aerial to receive RTÉ 1 and Network 2 with quality.  Although frequency and transmission are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I have been looking at the VHF and UHF maps in terms of where changes are being made and I expect the entire country will have, at a minimum, 93 per cent coverage on the first night.  The remaining 7 per cent where there are difficulties is located in the west, but perhaps on the night of transmission the difficulties will be confined to parts of Mayo.</P>
      <P>This is not something I would wish for but it is something which can be addressed in the short-term.  The alternative to using UHF aerials would have been to put Teilifís na Gaeilge out on VHF.  There are many technical reasons against that because even for general television reception, one would have had to change one's aerial within two years.  There is and will be contact between my Department in Furbo, which has received some inquiries about this, and the Údarás, Comharchumainn, providers and others who are interested, to see if aerials can be provided at the cheapest possible price.  The problem is that while the aerial itself costs about £10, installation costs vary from £25 to £60.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Molloy's anxiety that a number of people will not be able to avail of Teilifís na Gaeilge because of technical difficulties. The answer given here does not allay my fears.  As regards the question of grants, the Minister referred to getting <Col N="1471" /> the cheapest price and I hope that would be so in any event.  Question No. 42 contains a direct reference to making grants available.  Can the Minister at least alleviate some of the costs that will be incurred by some viewers through no fault of their own?  They should have the same opportunity to avail of Teilifís na Gaeilge as others within our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the technicalities of transmission, can the Minister assure us he will have discussions with his counterparts in the North to ensure that those in the northern part of our country will also be able to avail of Teilifís na Gaeilge?</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy that discussions on broadcasting matters have advanced considerably between Northern Ireland and ourselves.  There has been a breakthrough on the technical side and I hope we will be able to make further progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as anxious as anybody, and more anxious than some, that the maximum number of people will be in Teilifís na Gaeilge's viewing audience.  We are addressing these difficulties but I must emphasise that some of them have nothing whatsoever to do with Teilifís na Gaeilge but with the transmission system.  Whether we stay with VHF or have a UHF system is a matter for RTÉ. I do not think, for example, it would be sustainable to suggest that the people of the Gaeltacht should be served by a 35 year old transmitter in the future while everybody else around the country changes to UHF aerials.  It is important to make sure that the aerials are available and can be installed at a reasonable price and, equally, that any boosting of transmission capacity and I straightforwardly identify a difficulty that I know will arise in Mayo should be dealt with in the short-term.  These difficulties will arise.  The only alternative would have been to defer the launch of the new station until we had all these technological adjustments ready but it is too <Col N="1472" /> important for that.  Most of the difficulties can be solved within a short period, even in the area I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody gets it wrong, I emphasise that a person changing over to a UHF aerial is, in the first instance, doing so to get good RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2 reception, and after that to get Teilifís na Gaeilge.  The issue in relation to reception would have arisen irrespective of whether we had taken a decision to launch Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>

Whose responsibility is it to seek out and find such a partner or partners?  Is it the responsibility of RTE or the Independent Radio and Television Commission?  Does the Minister have any fears that the arrival of Teilifís na Gaeilge will signal the abandonment of the Irish language by RTE and about the cavalier way in which news times, for example, are set by RTE and about the reduction of sports coverage on RTE?</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for her question which I will answer as fully and as briefly as I can to satisfy other Deputies.  At my initial meeting with the previous chairman and the Director General of Radio Telefís Éireann at which I communicated the Government's decision I made it very clear that the commitment to Teilifís na Gaeilge in no way allowed a diminution of responsibilities in relation to the Irish language on RTE 1 and Network 2. They accepted this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of spare capacity, the position is that Comhairle Teilifís na Gaeilge is an independent body looking <Col N="1476" /> at programming.  Because it is a public service broadcaster which will broadcast for three hours per day in the Irish language it is understood that the general ethos of the station will be taken into account.  It has prepared proposals based on approaches made to it.  I understand approaches have been made in relation to Oireachtas coverage and other matters.  I believe some people are interested in approaching Teilifís na Gaeilge in respect of education and teaching services.</P>
    <P>It will send these proposals for approval to the RTE Authority which has been given responsibility by me under the existing Broadcasting Act for bringing Teilifís na Gaeilge into existence.  The permanent arrangement in relation to the Authority which will control Teilifís na Gaeilge will be addressed in the Broadcasting Bill which will be introduced early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, my responsibility under the 1976 Wildlife Act is for the conservation of wildlife.  The principal concern of my officials during the oil spill on the east coast in late September was the monitoring of the coastline to find dead or ailing seabirds or other wildlife to determine the impact of the spillage on wildlife generally and bird species in particular.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, co-operated in exchanging information with IWC BirdWatch Ireland which co-ordinates counts of dead or injured birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The generally poor survival rate for rescued and treated seabirds suffering <Col N="1477" /> oil contamination does not devalue the trojan efforts of voluntary groups recently engaged in the rescue and treatment of oiled seabirds in Dublin Bay.  I certainly acknowledge and appreciate the very active role taken by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and other welfare organisations in this rescue effort.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle whereby persons responsible for pollution are liable for the costs associated with the incident.  The penalties for pollution at sea range from £1,000 to £10 million and costs incurred by any organisations as a result of this pollution should be claimed so that if and when the polluter can be identified in this case, suitable recompense can be obtained.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the DSPCA and other nongovernmental groups and volunteers have incurred costs in attempts to save oiled seabirds, I regret that I am not in a position to make funds available to meet the costs incurred by these organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the efforts in response to the coastal pollution in September were co-ordinated by a volunteer who had access to one telephone line and a call waiting service which was advertised on the national airwaves?  Have the Department and the Department of the Marine plans worked out to ensure co-ordination in the event of a further disaster so that there will not be further mistreatment rather than treatment of injured wildlife?  I believe a position has been made available for a member of the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the combined marine emergency service working group.  Has this position been filled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me suggests that my officials were in contact with the groups involved at an early stage.  I will answer the second part of the Deputy's question straightforwardly.  In relation to a <Col N="1478" /> disaster like this and it was a disaster in respect of the wild birds involved it is important that my Department is represented on a monitoring group responding to it.  Having read the file it seems to me that the ability to respond quickly was somewhat deficient and that the voluntary groups were called upon to respond without knowing the precise procedures in place.  That is the reason I was both appreciative and sympathetic to their efforts.  In relation to their request to me for the defraying of their costs, there are not funds available to me but I would be sympathetic in contacting my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and the Marine, to see if reasonable and modest <i>ex gratia</i> sums might be made available to acknowledge that they were the people of first response.  There has been a good and valuable exchange between the voluntary organisations and my professional staff.  As I said, the survival rate of birds damaged in this way is poor and that raises the issue as to how they are to be best managed when such damage occurs.  The clearer the procedures and the greater the partnership, the better it is for everybody and that is what I will be seeking to advance.</P>

In addition to all the other comments he has made on this issue, the Minister stated last night that, in the case of Mrs. McCole, lodging money in court was some advantage.  The Minister will be aware that the purpose of lodging money in court is to force a negotiated settlement.  That is what the Blood Transfusion Service Board was doing; it was trying to force the woman concerned, who was on her deathbed, into a position where she would have no opportunity of getting her due reward. This matter should be fully debated in the House.  It is a shame, it is a scandal, it is a cover-up and we should have an opportunity of debating it.  If the matter cannot be put to the House I want to propose an amendment to the motion <Col N="1590" /> that Private Members' time be taken now.</P>

It is important that that compensation scheme, initiated by the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan &mdash; something not done for other injuries done to other people but was rightly done in this case &mdash; should continue.  I strongly reject the suggestion from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that this scheme of compensation should be suspended.  It would mean that the women who are processing claims before the tribunal at the moment would not be able to get their money.

      <P>The matter of the tribunal's terms of reference will be brought before the House in the normal way.  I will, of course, be willing to consider that suggestion, but the matter of political responsibility is a matter for this House.  We have had recent examples of enormously wasteful exercises where this House attempted to use methods other than those of this House to establish political accountability.  This is the place &mdash; nowhere else &mdash; where people, without the aid of legal advice, establish political accountability.  I have no problem, as I have shown here since this Government came into office, in answering questions for as long as is necessary to satisfy every reasonable questioner whenever a difficult issue arises.  On this matter we will answer questions in the same way as we answered in regard to recent allegations about the Attorney General's office. There was a marked contrast between the way in which we handled those matters where we answered questions until there was literally no Opposition questioners left to ask them and the way in which Deputy Dermot Ahern's party when the beef tribunal report was produced here, at enormous expense, would not allow a single question to be asked of the Ministers involved.  That was not political accountability in this House, the place where we need political accountability.  The Government is accountable to this House and will ensure there is political accountability by it to the House in this matter as in every other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also that the facts should be found in a fashion that is fair to all, that allows all who have a contribution to make to the finding of those facts to make that contribution in a fair and open way.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Tánaiste is back and I welcome the Government's change from last week where the Minister told us he had no responsibility.  The Tánaiste is welcome back, he should be around more often.</P>
      <P>I should ask the Taoiseach, before he leaves the House, if he is prepared to provide exemplary damages in this case because, if so, he has the opportunity to do so under this Bill.</P>
      <P>It can provide for exemplary damages so that never again will a Government, a semi-State body or any of the services involved, treat women in the way in which they have been treated in the hepatitis C case.  Clearly, information has been withheld.  We have proposed that there should be a formal judicial inquiry into this matter and the Government has now accepted the Fianna Fáil amendment on the proposal by the Progressive Democrats.  We are anxious to see the terms of reference which will apply to this inquiry.  We expect it should be done as a matter of urgency so that the facts can be established quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, 1996, is a welcome amendment to an <Col N="1601" /> Act which has been of great benefit to the surviving dependants of a decreased family member in the past.  The amendment which the Government proposes at this stage will serve to update the Act, principally to take cognisance of the change in money values since the Act was promulgated in 1961 and also by extending the definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act to include co-habitees of at least three years standing and people who are entitled to have their foreign divorces recognised by the State.</P>
    <P>There is a number of deficiencies in the Bill.  Likewise, a number of issues not provided for in the Principal Act should be considered for inclusion in the Bill.  I will address these matters later. My main concerns about the Bill are, first, the inadequacy of the Minister's proposed increase in the amount of maximum compensation to £15,000. This figure should be increased to £30,000.  Second, it is unfair and discriminatory to treat a family with five dependent children in the same way as a family with one child is cases when the father or mother is killed as a result of the act of a wrongdoer.  It is grossly inequitable to divide the same sum &mdash; now to be £15,000 &mdash; between a surviving spouse and five children, on the one hand, and between a surviving spouse and one child, on the other.  Third, there is no provision in the Bill for exemplary damages.  Such a provision should be included to cover cases where death is brought about as a result of a deliberate act.  For example, if a drug baron or major criminal commits the act then his assets should be the source of exemplary damages.  If a State agency is guilty of a major wrongful act against women, as occurred in the hepatitis C case, then there should be provision for exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes in section 2 (1) to increase the amount of damages from £7,500 to £15,000.  The sum which could be awarded under the 1961 Principal Act was £1,000.  This figure was increased to £7,500 under section 28 of <Col N="1602" /> the Courts Act, 1981.  It is proposed to increase the sum to £15,000.  While I agree with the principle behind the increase, the figure is too low and should be £30,000.  When the Civil Liability Act, 1961, was passed compensation was provided for dependants of the deceased for pecuniary benefits, mental stress and funeral expenses and a maximum sum of £1,000 was payable in respect of mental distress.  Thirty five years later it is proposed to increase this figure to £15,000.</P>
    <P>This increase, which follows an interim increase to £7,500 in 1981, seems reasonable on the face of it but it is woefully inadequate when one compares the purchase value of money in 1961 with its real value today.  For example, according to the Department of the Environment's statistics, in 1961 one could have bought a house anywhere in the country for £2,128.  The Minister will probably say that if one takes the consumer price index and carries the figures forward to today one will get a figure of £14,300 or another figure just under £15,000.  However, is this the kind of mean approach the Government should adopt when dealing with a family which has lost a husband or wife because of the wrongful act of a third party?  The Department of the Environment's statistics show that during the first quarter of 1996, that is before the rapid increase in house prices, the same house would have cost £61,377.  On this basis, the level of compensation should be increased to at least £30,000, not £15,000 as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main reason we support a more realistic increase is that we want to give adequate support to those dependants who have suffered personal tragedy.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider their position on this matter.  We believe that the increase should be greater and we are prepared to pay it when we return to Government next year after the general election.  It is not a question of giving a figure off the top of one's head, rather we are committed to it.</P>

      <P>It is the Government which pays in cases in which it is involved.  The Minister should not try to do what the Minister for Health did last week and say it is not the Government but the BTSB, the drugs body or someone else which has to pay.  The Government is responsible for policy and it will have to pay.  There is no question about this and the Government should not try to get away from it in so far as hepatitis C is concerned.  If the policy and business of the Government is delegated to a body such as the BTSB it is the Government which must pick up the Bill at the end of the day and it must be prepared to act as a guarantor in those circumstances.  The sum to be awarded as damages for mental distress as a result of a wrongful death will be £15,000.  If my proposal is accepted the figure will be limited to £30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present arrangements include an inbuilt discriminatory element.  This matter must be addressed now.  This element was included in the 1961 Act and the Minister is carrying it forward into this Bill.  I wish to contrast the position of a family with a spouse and one child who are the dependants of a spouse killed as a wrongful act with that of a family with a dependent spouse and five children.  Under the Bill the sum to be divided will be the same regardless of the number of children, and one does not have to be a mathematical genius to work out that the larger family will be seriously discriminated against in those circumstances.  This inequality could be addressed if the amount to be awarded did not exceed the proposed sum, with the additional proviso that it be awarded to each of the dependants within the meaning of the Act.  In this way the family with the greater number of dependants would be made equal to the family with fewer dependants. Alternatively a lesser amount could be paid to each dependent child.  The Minister is particularly concerned with, and <Col N="1604" /> responsible for, the elimination of discrimination, equality and reform of the law.  Yet it is proposed to build more discrimination against families and children into the law.  I am sure the Minister did not intend to do this but this is what will happen if we pass the Bill as proposed.  We must address this matter now.</P>
    <P>In a society with a huge divergence between the rich and poor, the Bill should seek to put both parties on a level, or at least a more equal, footing. Take for instance the unemployed father of a large family whose death is caused by the wrongful act of another person.  Under the Act and the proposed amendment, the only money his dependants can claim and may receive relates to funeral expenses and mental distress compensation.  In other words, his life is only worth £7,500 before the amendment is passed.  Call it compensation for mental distress, if you will. Contrast this with the family of a high earning breadwinner who is similarly killed.  His family will receive the compensation provided for under section 48 (5) and the same sum, in most cases, for mental distress.  His life is worth more than that of the poor man.  One can play around with semantics but, in the eyes of the public, the total sum is what is perceived.  Surely the poor man's family is entitled to a greater consideration than this.  I urge the Minister to examine the statutory provision to try to produce a more equitable result.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that if an unemployed man is the tragic victim and leaves a wife and three children, they will only receive £15,000.  I have examples of this in my constituency.  Similarly, if a family loses a 14 year old son or daughter, the family will only receive £15,000 plus funeral expenses.  In such cases there will be no earnings or pecuniary benefits for which to compensate.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider the points I raised in this regard.  In addressing this aspect of the Bill I deliberately omitted reference <Col N="1605" /> to the funeral and other expenses provisions in section 49.  This aspect of the Act has not been challenged in the courts, but who is to say that the High Court or Supreme Court might not strike down the section on an issue of proportionality such as I have outlined. Fianna Fáil will support the Bill on Second Stage and look forward to improving it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of exemplary damages, the Principal Act specifically excludes exemplary damages.  In general, we are all concerned about costs which we do not wish to see rise unduly. However, in the recent past a greatly respected and well known journalist was brutally murdered.  The current wisdom is that her death was procured by rich criminals.  Why, in the event of the criminal element responsible being identified, should her family be limited to compensation for pecuniary loss, funeral expenses and a limited sum for mental distress?  Because of the heinous crime committed the Government acted on the prompting of the Opposition and introduced legislation which we pressed for at Oireachtas Committees and in this House.  Surely such a henious crime should attract exemplary damages.  Will the Minister consider this Bill in that regard.  I do not want to open the floodgates but there are situations where exemplary damages are appropriate.  I urge him to introduce an amendment to section 7 (2) to allow exemplary damages where the death is procured by a deliberate act or as a result of actions which were criminally reckless.  Many criminals have the resources and should be made to pay.</P>
    <P>This exceptions should be extended to cases where the death occurs as a result of gross negligence.  A debate on a Bill to amend the Civil Liability Acts cannot be allowed to pass without consideration of the recent tragic death of Mrs. Brigid McCole as a result of the gross negligence of a State agency.  No matter how one considers this issue, the Government is responsible for that <Col N="1606" /> State agency.  Earlier today the Taoiseach provided definitions of and lectures about public administration but he is aware that the Government of the day is responsible for the overall policy and operation of semi-State bodies, while the semi-State body is responsible for its day to day activities.</P>
    <P>When, as in the case of the death of Mrs. McCole, a death is brought about by the reckless behaviour of an agency whose duty it is to participate in healthcare on behalf of the State, exemplary damages should be awarded. The State and State bodies must be made aware that this situation will not be accepted by this House.  We want to make an example and inform those who are affected by and may lose their lives as a result of this scandal that this House does not approve of it.  Leaving aside the politicking which occurred earlier, the hard reality is that we cannot, will not and do not approve of the activities which took place.  Neither do we approve of those responsible for the cover-up.  I am not stating that the Minister was responsible but he is responsible for getting the facts into the open.</P>

The Minister for Health may be of the opinion that he can fool the public into believing he has no responsibility for recent events. However, I am sure the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will agree it is his duty to rectify an omission in the civil law which currently fails to provide for exemplary damages in situations such as that to which I referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a State agency supplied a blood product which was known to be contaminated and for which it has now, following a disgraceful and inexcusable delay, admitted liability, there must be a case for exemplary damages.  Such damages do not exist at present and we are dealing with the Bill by means of which they can be introduced.  There are, perhaps, no two better examples than those cited where this House would want exemplary damages to apply.</P>
      <P>Such an amendment will lead in turn to a necessary amendment to section 48 (6) which provides that the action shall be commenced within three years after the death.  This is fine where the identity of the wrongdoer is known, but it is of little value where he or she is unknown. The section should be amended to include a provision which would enable the action to be taken within three years of the death or within three years of the identity of the wrongdoer being established.  In the case of a criminal act, this later period might not commence to run until the criminal was convicted of the crime causing the death.  It might not be necessary to have such certitude, it could be approached on a balance of probability basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principal Act spelled out in detail the members of the family involved. They are listed as wife, husband, father, mother and so on.  Section 1(a) defines &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; in what the Explanatory Memorandum calls &ldquo;gender neutral terms&rdquo;.  The Minister did not achieve success in arriving at a gender neutral term for brother, sister, half brother and half sister.  If he had consulted the Oxford Dictionary he would have been able to gender neutralise the entire section.  It defines &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; as &ldquo;one of two or more children having one or both parents in common&rdquo;.  This would have enabled him omit the term <Col N="1608" />&ldquo;brother, sister, half brother or half sister&rdquo; and be politically correct and consistent throughout the Bill.  In section 1 (1)<i>(c)</i> he could have omitted the term &ldquo;husband and wife&rdquo; and substituted the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; and rendered that subsection gender neutral.</P>
    <P>Section 3 proposes a new section 49 <i>(a)</i> which states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything in this Part, damages may not be awarded to a person referred to in paragraph <i>(b)</i> of the definition of `dependant' in section 47 (1) in respect of any mental distress allegedly caused to the person by the death of the deceased.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of section 47 (1) states:</P>
    <P>A person whose marriage to the deceased has been dissolved by a decree of divorce that was granted under the law of a country or jurisdiction other than the State and is recognised in the State.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the Act, the only award that could be made to such a person would arise if he or she incurred funeral expenses on behalf of the deceased or lost pecuniary benefit.  If that is the intention, I have no difficulty with it.  However, if a stranger were to provide funds for the funeral expenses incurred they are not included as a party who could recover those expenses from the wrongdoer.  Should the Minister not include such persons in the amendment to the Act?</P>
    <P>I also note provision has not been made for the inclusion of a spouse recently divorced in the State under our new constitutional jurisdiction or in the definition section of the word &ldquo;dependent&rdquo;.  Surely a recently divorced spouse should be included under the heading of mental distress and pecuniary benefit. There should be a limit of, say, three years for mental distress.  In the Bill a foreign divorcee would be entitled to funeral expenses if they pay them.  Why should the same not apply to an Irish divorcee under the constitutional amendment?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> Section 2 (1)(b) proposes to empower the Minister to vary the amount to be paid by way of compensation for mental distress, having regard to the changes in the value of money generally in the State.  I note he phrased the section in the negative.  He wishes the Order which he would place before the Houses of the Oireachtas to stand unless a resolution annulling it is passed by either House within 21 sitting days.  Has he considered the implications of Cityview Press <i>v</i> An Comhairle Oiliuna 1980 or Harvey <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare 1990 and the other cases flowing from those two decisions?  In the former case the courts recognised that a ministerial power conferred or delegated by statute might only give effect to principles and policies contained in the statute.  This is the so-called principles and policies criteria.</P>
    <P>The Harvey <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare case demonstrates that there are two strands to the case law on Article 15.2.1º, namely, the principles and policies criteria and the Oireachtas may not delegate the power to make, repeal or amend the law.  The Minister's proposal to allow the amount of damages awarded under the heading of mental stress to be varied by Order is unlikely to fall foul of the provisions of Article 15.2 of the Constitution, but this should not be even a remote possibility in properly drafted legislation.  The provision which requires that a draft of every Order made under this section is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas should be discussed further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is inadequate for today's needs.  The sum to be awarded as damages should be increased to £30,000.  We are also concerned about the inbuilt discrimination in the original Act, and continued in this Bill, against families of different sizes.  The Bill does not address the question of exemplary damages for the dependants of a person whose death is caused by a deliberate act of a wrongdoer or another person acting on his or her behalf.  Why should the assets of a <Col N="1610" /> wrongdoer or a criminal who kills or procures the death of another person be immune from exemplary damages? That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>We will table an amendment on Committee Stage aimed at ensuring that the assets of drug barons and major criminals are no longer secure from such action.  We will table a further amendment dealing with the right of action for damages for mental stress and exemplary damages where death is caused by professional negligence, such as the current hepatitis C case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister thought this was a non-contentious Bill. I welcome it but, in the light of recent unfortunate circumstances, it must be amended.  It is non-contentious in so far as it seeks to amend the civil law to improve the rights of dependants who suffer loss through the death of loved ones as a result of wrongful acts.  The 1961 Act gives such dependants the right to claim damages for mental distress, loss of pecuniary benefits and funeral expenses.</P>
      <P>The Bill will increase the limit for compensation from £7,500 to £15,000 and extend the definition of dependants to include cohabitants and spouses of foreign divorces recognised here.  It will allow the Minister increase the amount allowable for compensation by ministerial order.  During the debate on the Occupiers' Liability Bill we talked about the compensation culture that exists.  When people hear the word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; their hackles tend to rise, but I hope they realise this Bill deals with a different matter.  While money could not compensate those devastated by the loss of a loved one, it might help to cover the expenses incurred by the family concerned.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, the limit for compensation has been raised from £7,500 to £15,000.  I will table an amendment in this regard to raise the sum to, say, £30,000.  If one considers the figures from a 1981 base £15,000 would be in line with inflation but it is not a sufficient amount if one uses a 1961 base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> In addition, one has to take into account that the amount of compensation may have to be divided up among a large family.  A sum of £15,000 is not sufficient.  Although the figure is in line with inflation since 1981 the legislation was not updated sufficiently at that time.  How did the Minister arrive at the figure of £15,000?  Was it based on inflation since 1981?</P>
    <P>There should be a degree of flexibility in relation to the circumstances of a family.  The Minister should have the power to raise the amount allowable for compensation and the amount should be examined on a regular basis.  There are often provisions in legislation for set amounts which are left unchanged.  It should be in the Minister's remit to examine the amount at specified periods.</P>
    <P>In extending the category of those who have a right to claim damages the Minister is recognising social reality. The Bill acknowledges the reality of changing relationships, changes within society and the changing nature of the family.  As the Minister said, the definition of a dependant must be amended to include those whose marriages have been dissolved in the State when the divorce Bill is enacted.  Will the Minister indicate how he arrived at the proviso that cohabitants must have lived together for at least three years?</P>
    <P>If it had not been for the tragic case of Mrs. McCole who died as a result of the hepatitis C scandal, leaving a family of 12 behind, we would not have examined the issue of exemplary damages. The Minister has an opportunity to reexamine the Bill to see if an amendment is possible in the light of that case and the principle that the issue of exemplary damages should be included in this Bill. In a humane society those who have perpetrated wrongdoing should not get away with it.  If there is a way in which they can be brought to book and made to pay damages it should be implemented.  The Minister should consider this matter seriously.</P>
    <P>It is a pity this matter arises in the aftermath of a tragic case.  The hepatitis <Col N="1612" /> C scandal will form part of the Private Members' debate this week and I will not go into it in detail.  I find the whole issue horrendous and difficult to talk about.  I ask the Minister to consider my amendments and to formulate an amendment to the Bill to deal with the issue of exemplary damages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that we should be debating civil liability after the unfortunate death of Mrs. McCole.  My heart goes out to all the women and their families affected by contaminated blood products.</P>
      <P>I applaud this excellent Bill.  It brings Irish society into the 21st century because it addresses the issue of compensation for mental distress and fatal injuries in actions which are brought under the Civil Liability Act, 1961.  It also extends the categories to cohabitants and persons whose foreign divorces are entitled to recognition in the State now that the country has moved forward with legislation to allow people whose marriages have broken down to separate in a modern and humane manner.  Marital discord has become a more frequent occurrence.  The many Irish people who have travelled abroad, married abroad and who, subsequently, have availed of foreign divorces will now be afforded some compensatory rights.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Bill will pass without controversy.  Given that the Bill deals with civil liability, it raises the hornet's nest of the &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo;.  No person claiming for mental distress after a fatal-accident will be frivolous in pursuing a claim.  However, it is important to point out that our civil liability laws are a necessary protection for the public.  The 1961 Act and this amending Bill will ensure that ordinary citizens will not be by-passed in making civil liability claims because of a lack of understanding of the law, as may have been the case in the past.  It is an important legislative protection.  I welcome the amendments which will bring the amounts payable in the context of the 1961 Act up to a rate more appropriate to the 1990s.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> What is happening in society with regard to liability and compensation is worrying.  In the past ten years the system of civil and public liability has been turned into a gold-mine which is being exploited by unscrupulous individuals out to make a quick buck.  These unscrupulous individuals are often aided by a minority of ambulance chasing solicitors.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members will not be surprised when I remind them that it is a common sight, particularly in poorer communities, to see large billboards proclaiming the words, &ldquo;make sure you receive the compensation you deserve&rdquo;. If one checks the Golden Pages one will see those words in advertisements that cover three-quarters of a page or the full page.  Advertisements in it are wallpapered with the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.  That word jumps out at the reader as if solicitors have engaged professional PR or marketing managers to act on their behalf.  As if further encouragement were needed, they often provide a freefone number for members of the public who believe they may be able to milk a public liability system, which in the past few years has gone out of control.  There are more than 20 pages of advertisements in the current edition of the Golden Pages which repeatedly screech the words &ldquo;accident, compo, get money, get rich quick&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have noticed a proliferation of solicitors' billboards metaphorically inviting punters to search for a loose paving stone, make a hefty claim for compensation and get a sizeable cheque: There are many cases where citizens are more than entitled to compensation for injury or damage suffered and those responsible should be made pay up, but I argue that a responsible solicitor is capable of weeding out frivolous cases from serious claims. Unfortunately, the number of frivolous claims is mushrooming and far from weeding out such claims a small minority of solicitors are leeching on to a good thing.  With the help of billboards, the Golden Pages, local newspapers and <Col N="1614" /> flyers circulated door to door, solicitors are encouraging individuals to claim lotto style compensation payouts.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that the people are only using the laws the Oireachtas has given them and that is hard to deny.  We have read and heard of the abuses in this area.  We are familiar with these type of claims because many of the Members hold positions on health boards and local authorities and are aware of claims made against public transportation systems, such as Dublin Bus, as well as the claims mounting against Dublin Gas and the ESB.  We are also familiar with the frequent practice of the same claims being made against a number of authorities. Examples of such claims include those made by Dublin Corporation flat dwellers who experienced inconvenience, such as dust in the atmosphere, when their homes were being refurbished. There was a sad case where a hefty claim was lodged against the volunteers in a voluntary agency as a result of mashed potatoes falling on the floor. Those volunteers are only interested in improving the quality of life of the elderly for whom they provide meals.  The agency providing those meals was doing good work, but the net result of that case being taken is that local authorities can no longer make such buildings available for people who are trying to upgrade the quality of life of people, particularly the elderly.  Dublin Corporation is at present facing a total claim of £20 million and claims have increased threefold in the past six years.  I am sure very few Members would argue that there has been a similar increase in the number of genuine accidents.  It is arguable that the number of accidents is decreasing but the number of claims is increasing.  Last month it was revealed that Irish architects have been effectively excluded from taking up public sector projects because of new guidelines requiring them to take out professional indemnity insurance cover which can cost up to £75,000.  I do not want to labour that point further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> Public sector bodies and those seeking to service the public sector are currently facing a spiralling compensation crisis which in the long term may impact on the quality of services and amenities being employed by ordinary citizens.  I argue that part of the increase can be attributed to the continuing absence of strict guidelines on solicitors' advertising.  The flood of frivolous, but lucrative, compensation claims and fraudulent claims must be stemmed using a two-pronged approach.  Solicitors must strictly regulate advertising and an antifraud package must be introduced to consolidate existing legislation which would close any gaps and underpin the work of the national fraud bureau.</P>
    <P>Although this is not the main element being addressed in the Bill, given that there is a compensatory element in it I took this opportunity to outline the concerns of many people about civil liability claims soaring out of control which will have a negative effect on communities and citizens.  Everybody knows there is no such thing as a free meal.  Somebody must pay the bill for a £100,000 settlement given to a person driving a car into a hole.  It is tragic that the quality of social life may be reduced and that the input of voluntary agencies, such as youth clubs and football clubs, is being undermined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to focus on two matters in relation to this Bill, the compensation payable for mental distress in a fatal accident case and the remarks made about fraud.  I agree with some of the remarks made by my colleague, Deputy Byrne, but not all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we took a fresh look at what the level of compensation should be for mental distress.  When I was a law student a good few years ago we were taught that from the point of view of a negligent party it was far cheaper for that party to kill rather than to maim. That thinking still prevails and it is the thinking behind this Bill.  If a person is seriously injured and brings a claim, <Col N="1616" /> provided negligence is proved, that person is compensated for loss of earnings and future earnings and other medical expenses.  He or she is awarded a figure by the courts for pain and suffering to date and prospective pain and suffering in the future.  That figure is assessed by the courts and in serious cases can be substantial and that is only right.  I am talking about genuinely serious cases where a person could end up as a paraplegic or quadriplegic and the general damages for pain and suffering and the ill done to that person is compensated for fully by the courts by an award which may be a very substantial sum.  I mention that point because it may be argued against the point I am making that it is impossible for the courts to put a figure on the value of a person's life. I understand that thinking, but how can the courts decide a figure for the pain and suffering of a person who has become a paraplegic as a result of a road accident?  That is the job of the judges.  They take reasonable factors into account, come to a conclusion as to what is reasonable in all the circumstances and decide a figure.  Whatever figure it is, I am sure most people who suffer such horrendous injuries would say it is probably not adequate. However, it is a reasonable effort by the courts to adequately compensate people who receive injuries, in particular those who are seriously injured.  That is the backdrop to the question as to whether there should be adequate and proper damages for mental distress in a fatal accident case.  The debate is not new. When the figure was assessed in 1961, I think it was about £1,000.  It was raised 20 years later to the current figure of £7,500, a derisory sum.  The Minister does not suggest that this is compensation &mdash; it is regarded as recognition by the court that there is mental distress.  It is time we went further.  We should either fix a sum of adequate proportion in the Bill or give the courts discretion to award a sum which they consider reasonable in all circumstances.  Similarly, the courts can award a sum for <Col N="1617" /> general damages where there is considerable pain and suffering involved.  I am not referring in particular to recent cases such as the lady who died from hepatitis C, but it highlights my point.</P>
    <P>There are 500 or 600 people killed in horrific accidents on the roads each year, in many instances because of the negligence of others.  Why should such people, or their dependants and relatives be limited in the amount they can claim as a consequence?  This is the thrust of the civil liability legislation.  It is improper that this is the approach we impose on the courts.  What do the courts do now when there is a fatal injury case?  I am a bit rusty in practice now but, as I understand it, they automatically add on the maximum figure allowed by the Civil Liability Act.  They do not have adequate moneys within the limit under the Act to take any differentiation into account.  Although all lives are equal, there can be differentiation. The mental distress suffered in all cases is not the same.  An elderly person with relatively distant relations surviving would of course be a loss.  It is a life lost and that factor should be recognised by the court and in any award which follows.  However, the contrast could be the death of a young mother survived by a husband and seven young children, all of whom suffer continuing mental distress as a consequence.  There can be different situations arising from death.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the courts are not empowered to take that into account in an award for mental distress.  The time has come to examine this issue afresh and to include a maximum figure in the Act, which we can stand over.  I find it difficult to stand over a derisory figure of £15,000 as being adequate for mental distress on someone's death.  If we are not anxious to include a figure for mental distress in the Act, consideration might be given to not having a limit and leaving it to the courts to decide, in the same way the courts decide the figure for general damages and pain and suffering.  This would be an alternative <Col N="1618" /> approach which I put forward for consideration.  I am unhappy about a situation where we continue to put a ceiling on the award courts can make for mental distress and fatal injury cases.  I note there is provision for increases by ministerial order in the Bill.  I see no problem with this but the provision seems to be constrained in that any increases such as cost of living factors are taken into account, rather than any general reappraisal of the overall limit.</P>
    <P>We must also be careful with compensation cases and the issue of fraud.  I agree with Deputy Eric Byrne's views on fraud.  We must be unrelenting in trying to establish systems to prevent fraud and in pursuing those who gain from it. Perhaps not enough is being done from the point of view of either preventing fraud or following up fraudulent claims. The danger is in confusing this approach with a view that those who are entitled to compensation should be prevented from making their just and proper claims before the courts.  People who have accidents as a result of the negligence of others must get to court and be entitled to legal assistance.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the legal profession were operating a cartel in relation to fixed fees, etc.  There was huge pressure on them from the competition authority to open up to advertising and enter the modern world.  As I recall, this was forced on them.  I am not sure it is entirely fair to castigate solicitors who advertise their services in the Golden Pages or on billboards.  I should declare an interest as a solicitor although not a practising one at the moment.  I am not sure I would be keen to advertise my legal services on billboards but if that is the modern approach some solicitors want to adopt, that is fine with me.</P>
    <P>It should not be confused with the fact that if solicitors' clients have proper claims, they are entitled to proper representation and compensation.  There is some danger in confusing the question of fraud and the entitlement of people to proper compensation.  In relation to fraud, there must be a case for more <Col N="1619" /> detailed investigation of claims.  In many instances, relatively small claims are not fully and properly investigated.  This is a wrong approach on the part of some people who are paying the piper, including some insurance companies.  All these claims should be properly investigated.  If they are not agreed, they should be fought in court.  To accept claims and then raise the issue of fraud does not make sense.  I have no doubt there are compensation claims, which, if properly investigated, would never be paid.  Recently, I read in the newspapers about fraudulent claims on medical insurance, one of which was a claim for a hysterectomy by a young man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The person investigating that claim should be sacked.  If such ludicrous claims can be made and let through it highlights my point.  On the issue of compensation claims, people are entitled to make claims and to be properly represented, but where there is a possibility of fraud we must ensure claims are properly investigated and evidence of fraud should be presented to the Garda and the DPP.  The people should be prosecuted and put in jail if necessary. People who make fraudulent claims should not be allowed to get in the way of those who have just and proper claims.</P>
      <P>I suggest a reappraisal with regard to damages for mental distress and fatal injuries cases.  In light of the current economic position it would be a symptom of a more civilised society if we took an approach which might not have been appropriate 30 years ago given the economic circumstances of the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this non contentious measure.  It improves various aspects of the fatal accidents code. Deputy Eric Byrne made an interesting contribution on the compensation culture.  I have to declare an interest in the first instance as a member of the Bar.  I <Col N="1620" /> am not allowed to put my name on a billboard, although I read occasionally about the fees I earn in the press.</P>
      <P>As poacher turned gamekeeper I have some sympathy with Deputy Byrne.  There are certain measures which should be considered with regard to the compensation culture.  The culture is not of great social benefit in some of its aspects.  There was much wisdom in the rulings of judges on civil liability down through the years.  They tended to view with suspicion occupiers' claims and that type of claim.  It has been the experience of the profession that the greatest abuse takes place, for example, in claims against local authorities.  Equally, the recent changes in the motor insurance bureau arrangements, where a claim can be maintained against an untraced driver, can in certain circumstances lead to abuse.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said, we need far more rigorous systems of control and invigilation for that type of claim.  The problem with the compensation culture, as Deputy Byrne said, arises from the operation of sports clubs, youth clubs and political parties where enormous sums are required or demanded by insurance companies to finance worthwhile social activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that advertising by solicitors should be abolished.  For the reasons outlined by Deputy O'Keeffe, there was a demand made by the Competition Authority that solicitors fees should be known, that the public should have a choice and there should be some measure of competition within the profession.  A code of practice is required here.  I agree with Deputy Byrne that some of the advertising is undesirable. It is a matter the Law Society should look at in tightening up its code of practice on advertising and in discouraging the type of advertisement which fosters or gives the impression of fostering the ambulance chasing mentality.  Potential litigants are entitled to exercise their rights before the courts which are established for that purpose, but I agree there is something indecorous about advertisements which give the impression to <Col N="1621" /> litigants that they are under almost a moral obligation to institute proceedings in the courts.  They are not, of course.</P>
    <P>On systems of fraud control and abuse, I understood the local authorities took an initiative in that regard recently in relation to sharing information.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>With regard to this measure, I welcome the extended definition of &ldquo;dependency&rdquo;.  The original 1961 Act contained a broad definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; and included, for example, in the case of a child, a child in relation to whom the deceased stood <i>in loco parentis</i> as distinct from being a married parent.  The fact that dependency is a factual dependency was recognised in the original Act and in this measure the Minister is extending that definition to accommodate various social changes which have taken place in the interim.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Woods, I found curious the decision to exclude a divorced spouse from an entitlement to claim damages for mental distress.  After all, the divorced spouse is in a position to claim damages for loss of dependency under the legislation, but there is a singularity in the treatment of a divorced spouse in this regard.  The court always has a discretion to consider mental distress and the divorced spouse could come within the category of persons who can claim damages for mental distress.  Perhaps the Minister was concerned that there would be a conflict in the case of a remarriage between the remarried spouse and the divorced spouse regarding a claim for the compensation moneys for mental distress. The court could resolve that conflict in an appropriate case.</P>
    <P>When mental distress was provided for in the 1961 Act it was an innovation. Prior to that there was no entitlement to compensation for mental distress suffered by the dependants of a deceased whose accidental death arose from the negligence of another.  The figure of £1,000, solatium as the Minister correctly described it, was an innovation in <Col N="1622" /> the 1961 Act.  Indeed it was a provisional innovation because a further Act was required in 1964 to eliminate a three year limitation that was put on it. It was initially viewed as an experimental measure and I welcome the proposal to increase the amount to £15,000.  It is difficult for the Minister to act as Solomon in this matter because he has to draw a line on what is the appropriate measure of compensation.  That is a function normally reserved for a judge or jury in an appropriate case such as libel or where a jury is still used in the assessment of civil compensation.  The Minister faces a difficult task because until recent years the law tended to view with disfavour a claim for mental distress as it was the recognition of a legally protected interest in the life or interests of another.  In 1961 the recognition of an expressed statutory right for compensation for mental distress apart from any question of dependency was an innovation.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years we have seen enormous changes in the thinking and decisions of the courts in this area.  In the case of injury claims, an item of damage frequently claimed by plaintiffs is compensation for mental distress arising out of the trauma suffered in an accident.  That is somewhat different in the sense that the plaintiff suffers trauma arising from an accident in which he was involved.  There is a great deal of trauma associated with the accidental death of a loved one.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the difficult task of assessing a compensation figure in these cases.  Professional practice since 1961 has been to pay out the amount prescribed under legislation.  That is a remarkable practice in the sense that earlier decisions under the 1961 Act suggested that the amount fixed in this House was but a notional figure and that the function of the court was to assess in the first instance the amount of mental distress suffered.  In practice it does not work that way.  Whatever figure the Minister fixes will become the definite figure for these purposes.  While I see much merit <Col N="1623" /> in Deputy O'Keeffe's suggestion that we should consider giving the courts discretion in this matter, judges may not want to exercise such discretion because nobody likes to assess the worth to one person of the departed life of another. In that sense we would do the judges a favour by fixing a figure here.</P>
    <P>Arising from what Deputy Woods said, there may be a case for varying the amount depending on whether the person involved is a surviving spouse, parent or child.  Surely the loss to a spouse would be greater than to any other relative recognised by the Bill, yet the guideline figure is the same for all survivors of a deceased person.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give his view on the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the compensation awarded by courts to people who suffer trauma as a result of an accident, a figure in the order of £20,000 or £25,000 would be fair.</P>
      <P>The Minister has power to vary the amount of compensation in the future. Deputy Woods referred to constitutional difficulties that might arise.  In considering an increase, regard must be had to changes in the value of money generally.  In those circumstances ministerial discretion may be exercised.  With the marvellous news about State finances at present we may anticipate a period of deflation, in which case the Minister may have to decrease the amount awarded, which is theoretically possible under the subsection.</P>
      <P>On the issue of exemplary damages, it is often forgotten that under the criminal injuries compensation scheme the next of kin of a murder victim are entitled to claim compensation, which is assessed in accordance with the Civil Liability Act.  The abolition of compensation for pain and suffering for the next of kin of a murder victim was most regrettable and unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal is worth considering in the context of an unknown wrongdoer <Col N="1624" /> as well as a known wrongdoer.  State liability would be extended enormously if the principle were applied to the case of an unknown wrongdoer, in which case the claim would be considered through the Criminal Injuries Tribunal. Perhaps the Minister will consider making provision for the case of a known wrongdoer where there is a conviction for murder or manslaughter.  The question would then arise of whether there should be a monetary limit in that regard, but I believe that should be left to the discretion of the courts.</P>
    <P>Under the 1961 Act a claim must be brought by an executor within six months of the death of the person and after that period has elapsed any one of the statutory dependants may maintain proceedings.  Where the survivor is an impoverished widow, even though she may have no interest in taking out a grant of probate within the six month period she may be anxious to have proceedings prosecuted with the greatest expedition.  Without the six month provision any statutory dependant could bring an action immediately after the death.  In future years problems may arise in that different statutory dependants may seek to maintain the proceedings and there is no provision in the Bill to deal with circumstances where two rival members of one family wish to bring a claim.  That could be dealt with by providing that the court will adjudicate on who may bring forward proceedings in that instance.</P>
    <P>Since there is no commencement section I take it the Minister has decided that the Bill should come into force in accordance with the Constitution, a number of days after signature by the President.  There is a case for setting a commencement date such as 1 January next because the Bill applies to cases of action accruing only after its commencement.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that matter.  I congratulate him on a worthwhile measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the two previous speakers I have no legal knowledge to bring to bear on this debate.  It <Col N="1625" /> is an important Bill which will not be a cause of contention.  I did not hear the Minister's opening speech last week but I heard most of the speeches this afternoon and as one would expect there is general welcome for the Bill.  Deputies Byrne, Lenihan and O'Keeffe provided food for thought and I will comment briefly on the points they raised.</P>
      <P>Very often generous compensation is awarded in civil cases and in many instances the claimants may recover from their injuries and suffering and return to a full and healthy life.  In this case, however, we are dealing with claimants who may never get over their loss.  This Bill does not attempt to put a value on a person's life and while I welcome the increase in the maximum amount of compensation to £15,000, a huge increase on the original limit of £1,000, there is a perception among the public that we should be a little more generous.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan suggested that the figure should be £25,000.  It is difficult to fix a suitable maximum figure.  I take the point that the Minister will have power by ministerial order to change the figure when necessary, but I concur with Deputy O'Keeffe that the amount should be somewhat greater than the £15,000 maximum limit.</P>
      <P>Not being an expert to any degree I cannot very well volunteer a figure but the Minister should take cognisance of what Deputies O'Keeffe and Lenihan said.  Perhaps the Minister could think of moving beyond the proposed new limit of £15,000.  I know the legislation is necessary and helpful and that it is an improvement, but for the few cases we will be dealing with concerning genuine distress and huge changes under the legislation, we must be as generous and compassionate as possible.  While £15,000 is not seen as an answer to their problems it is some recognition by the State and I hope we can do better than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Eric Byrne broadened the debate to the level most public representatives deal with on a more frequent basis now than heretofore, <Col N="1626" /> namely the plethora of civil compensation cases that come before the courts. As councillors we often discuss and deal with such matters at local authority meetings.  Some Members are aware of the recent decision by Cork Corporation &mdash; of which I am not a member, although I am a member of a neighbouring authority &mdash; to provide members of the corporation with a list of the amount of money paid to claimants over the years.  That list opened many councillors' eyes and the publicity it generated opened the eyes of the general public also.  It was disturbing to see a trend emerging in which not only were claims increasing rapidly but, unfortunately, there were also a significant number of repeat claims.</P>
    <P>The co-called compensation culture has set in to a severe degree and, apparently, the State is not able to prescribe any medicine to deal with this new problem.  Like social welfare fraud, we should not exaggerate it and claim that it is happening in every townland and parish, but it must be dealt with because it is beginning to have an effect on voluntary community organisations including sports clubs.  Certain functions and facilities are no longer available to the public because of the difficulty in obtaining public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>It is not the purpose of this legislation to deal with such a scenario but when we discuss any form of compensation most minds will now focus on the wider picture involving civil cases and the compensation culture.  I hope it is receiving the Government's attention because the taxpayer ends up footing the bill for someone who drives into a pothole and then claims £50,000 from the State.  The money is not plucked from the air, it is taxpayers' money and that is why the issue should be of wide concern to public representatives.  I expect it will receive significant attention from the Government.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his speech last week, it is a sign of the changing times that we must take note of new types of dependant.  This is not simply as a result <Col N="1627" /> of what will flow from the divorce legislation but also because we must respond to the situation caused by so many people living together even though they are not married.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is dealing with this is a practical fashion.  We must provide for the difficulties caused by changing lifestyles and there is no point in pretending that these scenarios do not occur.  The Minister is trying to broaden the legislation to take into account every possible set of domestic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The previous maximum limit of £7,500 has risen to £15,000, which I welcome.  As the Minister pointed out, this figure is not meant to put a defining value on the life of the deceased.  We must be as generous as possible and in that sense I hope the Minister will consider a slightly higher figure than the £15,000 he has proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House and to the Deputies for the general welcome given to this Bill.  It adds to the reform of our laws on civil liability which I initiated not long ago by way of the Occupiers Liability Bill. Earlier this year I gave a commitment to the House that I would look into the question of amending that part of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, dealing with compensation in fatal injury cases.  I am glad to be able to deliver further now on that commitment by way of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be of assistance to the House if I were to sketch the background to the provisions which exist in our law to deal with compensation in fatal injury cases.  The Bill is concerned with that part of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, which relates to liability for causing the death of a person.  The common law rule was that the courses of action in tort were generally destroyed by the death of either party.  This unhappy state of affairs was remedied by legislation.  The present statutory law contained in the 1961 Act makes clear, in section 7, that on the death of a person all courses of action &mdash; other than certain accepted <Col N="1628" /> courses of action &mdash; vested in him or her shall survive for the benefit of his or her estate.  Moreover, the same Act makes clear that the rights conferred by section 7 for the benefit of the estate of the deceased are in addition to the right conferred on the dependants of deceased persons by Part IV of the Act. In section 8 the Act provides that courses of action subsist against deceased persons.</P>
    <P>Common law also had another rule which was that in a civil court, death could not be complained of as an injury. It meant that the common law countenanced no civil claim for a loss caused by the death of a person.  However, by operation of Part IV of the Act of 1961 and prior to that of the Fatal Injuries Act, 1956, important exceptions to that common law rule were created.  Part IV is specifically designated to benefit certain classes of persons within the family group who may suffer by the death.  It compensates those relatives for economic loss.</P>
    <P>The salient point about an action on that basis is that there must have been a wrong to the deceased.  Damages are apportioned as the court thinks proper among the dependants.  The right of dependants to compensation is not a solatium for grief and injured feeling but to damages for a pecuniary loss, actual or perspective.  The claimant is entitled to damages proportional to the loss sustained by him or her from the death.  The assessment and apportionment of the pecuniary loss is decided having regard to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.  Formerly the law was that funeral expenses were not recoverable but again statutory provisions as now contained in the Act of 1961 provide that those expenses may be recovered if they have been discharged by the dependants.</P>
    <P>Damages for mental distress were first introduced in the Act of 1961.  That compensation is a form of solatium or compensation for injured feelings.  It is important to recognise that damages for mental distress are in addition to what <Col N="1629" /> may be awarded by way of general damages or special damages.  They give solace to the claimants and in a system of civil law such as ours which is based on the fault principle they have a basis in the principle of ethical compensation.  It is in that context that the long standing policy since 1961 has been to have a statutory limit on the amount which can be awarded.</P>
    <P>It was not intended that this Bill should be a broad ranging general review of the law of civil liability.  It is a strictly limited Bill dealing with limited specific objects.  It deals with two basic points namely, it provides for new categories of persons who may claim for damages and updates the compensation figure for distress where a fatal injury has been caused.  It extends the definition of dependants who should be in a position to claim damages for a law where a wrongful act gives rise to a fatal injury in Part IV of the 1961 Act to include cohabitants and persons with foreign divorces which are recognised in the State.  It is the intention also that the passing of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill or this Bill, appropriately amended, depending on which Bill is passed first, will enable persons who obtain a divorce here to make a claim under Part IV.</P>
    <P>The question of the maximum figure has been the subject of much discussion in the course of the debate.  Deputy Keogh raised the question of how exactly the figure of £15,000 was arrived at.  The answer is very simple and logical.  We updated the figure of £7,500 which obtained since 1981.  As Deputy Lenihan rightly pointed out, originally no figure was provided for.  A figure of £1,000 was then introduced which was later increased to £7,500.  I propose the sum of £15,000 in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan gave an interesting historical analysis of how we arrived at this position.  Having listened to the debate it may be that we should look at the figure and perhaps have an appropriate variation.  The attitude of the <Col N="1630" /> common law originally was totally negative in this regard but things change with the perception of the time.  My initial intention in introducing the Bill was to do no more than maintain the <i>status quo</i> but I have been impressed by what has been said and, while not giving any commitment, I will carefully consider the matter between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of exemplary damages is another matter which would require a more extensive examination.  There is provision in the law as it stands for the award of exemplary damages provided strict conditions are met, although I accept they are rarely, if ever, awarded, except perhaps in libel and slander cases.  It would not be my intention to go down that road at this time but no doubt at some stage that aspect will warrant consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eric Byrne made the point that there is no such thing as a free lunch.  If one increases the amount of authorised compensation somebody will have to pick up the tab, whether it be the State, a local authority or an insurance company, which means everybody.  It will affect insurance premia, taxation and all other aspects.  One has to proceed with a degree of caution and care.  On the one hand there is no point complaining about a compensation culture and on the other seeking even greater extensions of the amounts which may be awarded in compensation. There is a conflict and a compromise has to be arrived at.</P>
    <P>It is logical that a person who has been divorced should not be entitled to solatium.  They are reasonably entitled to the financial loss element of the claim &mdash; one can understand the reason for this &mdash; but given that the people concerned are, in effect, strangers so far as relationships are concerned and no longer cohabitants solatium would not be appropriate in the case of a divorcee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan raised the question of the six month period and the personal representative.  We will look at it between now and Committee Stage but the position is that when a claim is made <Col N="1631" /> every person who might come into play has to be either a plaintiff, a defendant or a notice party.  The court has to be satisfied that all relevant parties have been drawn in before an order is made.</P>
    <P>I have taken a careful note of what Deputy Lenihan said on the question of whether it might be advisable to specify a commencement date such as 1 January next.  I will look at it but I do not want to delay the commencement of the Bill because cases could arise.  I would like to have it implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their excellent contributions which have been helpful and worthwhile.  We will resume discussion of the matter on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Minister for Health for his failure to accept political responsibility for the mishandling of the hepatitis C affair by the Blood Transfusion Services Board, and for his failure to ensure the accountability of those whose <Col N="1632" /> individual actions gave rise to appalling human suffering and to massive liability on the part of the State.</P>

      <P>From the very beginning there has been a tendency for the public to be blinded by science in this whole matter.  The substantive issue of the scandal is easily clouded by the terminology of science and medicine. Deputies on all sides of the House have struggled to keep abreast of the extent of the BTSB scandal in so far as we can, given the limited information to which we have had access.  Knowledge is power and in this affair all of the knowledge and all of the information has been in the power of the Executive and its agencies.  The Dáil has been left to make what it can from the crumbs which have been extracted by way of Dáil questions and debates.</P>
      <P>Cynics will claim that by politicising this issue the Opposition can be charged with party political point scoring.  It is the oldest taunt in the Dáil and it simply does not wash.  If the infection of up to 1,600 people with hepatitis C by a State agency is not a political matter, and if the Minister for Health can evade accounting for the manner in which he has presided over the hepatitis C affair and the legal claims for compensation, then there is no such thing as accountability.  If the Dáil abdicates its responsibility of holding the Government of the day to account in such public matters, then it has failed the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been cover-up of facts in this whole matter from the beginning. Poisonous fumes of concealment are now leaking into the public arena and the air is growing thicker by the minute. The death of Brigid McCole has ironically and tragically brought these matters to a head in the belated admission of liability by the BTSB.  It is clear from corespondence revealed by the family of <Col N="1633" /> the late Mrs. McCole today that the Minister and the State, representing the people, have played soft cop in the Dáil but hard cop in the court proceedings, particularly in the proceedings of Mrs. McCole.  I understand the terms of the settlement in that case are confined to that case.  That is illogical, as the Minister has indicated.  Equally illogical is the State's stubborn refusal to accept liability.  Liability of the State lies at the heart of the cover-up we have experienced.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statements on Thursday were immediately curious to me.  It was the first occasion where the State sought to distance itself from the BTSB. I have pondered over the reason the State should adopt this particular stand at this late stage.  Could it be there is a reason for the State to be still in denial, even after the BTSB has admitted negligence and liability?  Could there be another appalling vista of further or potential liability opening up beyond the victims who are infected in this jurisdiction?  Is the State being sued by persons in another jurisdiction for defective blood products supplied by the BTSB, or could this be related to an insurance policy?  It seems that the State's fingerprints are all over the settlement agreed with the late Mrs. McCole's solicitors. In particular, I wish to reject any suggestion or implication that the Minister was neither consulted about nor approved the admission of liability in advance.</P>
    <P>Even more awful than the negligence of the BTSB, now admitted, is the manner in which the State, the BTSB, the other defendants and the Minister have sought to conceal and to cover up information since these matters came to their attention.  In so far as we are told, this was in February 1994.  There is the wider issue of the blood bank scandal, the truth of which we have not yet discovered, and there is the second but no less important matter of the extent of the duplicity and concealment of information legitimately sought in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> There is no dispute that the infection of a large number of people with hepatitis C as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product produced by a State body is the most serious disaster ever to affect a large group of patients and the public health service. The matter has been debated and questioned here <i>ad nauseam</i> and the emphasis has shifted from one aspect of the scandal to another.  Most of the emphasis has been on the provision of services for those affected by this tragedy, and the merits and demertis of providing compensation through a non-statutory tribunal, as opposed to through the courts.</P>
    <P>Last week's public admission of liability by the Blood Transfusion Service Board in the McCole case, within 24 hours of the tragic death of the plaintiff, has brought the emphasis firmly back to the question of responsibility for this tragic state of affairs and the handling of the matter since it came formally to the attention of the Government in early 1994.  It has always been claimed that these matters came to public attention, and to the attention of the Department, and were announced in 1994 following routine research by Dr. Joan Power.  Is this the whole truth?  Did something much more significant happen in the Department of Health and in respect of the BTSB at the same time?</P>
    <P>Up to now, the Minister has not felt able to comment in any detailed or coherent fashion on the question of responsibility; it has been skirted at every opportunity.  He has avoided doing so and equally avoided publishing the documents in the case, including the documents before the expert group which was asked to report on it, on the basis that High Court proceedings were pending and that he was a defendant. Apart from the question of offending the <i>sub judice</i> rule, on 1 May 1996, at Volume 464, column 1792 of the Official Report, the Minister claimed:</P>
    <P>The High Court proceedings which are fixed to commence on 8 October <Col N="1635" /> next will involve a judicial examination of and determination on this matter.  In the circumstances, to establish a special judicial inquiry would serve no useful purpose and would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Equally, at column 1795 the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I think everybody knows that unless liability is established before the courts damages will not be paid and unless negligence is proved there is no liability.  I object strongly to this being run in the media to establish a certain atmosphere rather than allowing the courts to examine every aspect.</P>
    <P>When asked specifically about the continued use of the product after 1991, after an English hospital had furnished a full report on 1977 samples to the BTSB, the Minister declined to do so on the basis that &ldquo;that matter is at the centre of the High Court case of 8 October and any comment I make as a defendant is evidential in nature&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the larger issues, at column 1801 of the Official Report, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Questions such as who is to blame, if anyone is to blame, whether there was negligence and if there is liability, form the core of the High Court case.</P>
    <P>As appears from those quotations, the High Court case was scheduled to begin today, Tuesday, 8 October.  A few days before that, and while the unfortunate plaintiff was on the point of death, the proceedings were settled on the basis of an admission of liability by one of the defendants, the BTSB.  It is important to recall that this admission of liability constituted a <i>volté face</i> on the part of the board because it had previously denied liability.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Services Board and the State defendants did far more than simply deny liability.  They made use of every lawyerly technicality to avoid acknowledging responsibility and to avoid paying compensation on <Col N="1636" /> the basis of that acknowledgment.  First, the BTSB and the State, in the defences on 15 April 1996 and 18 June 1995 respectively, pleaded the statute of limitations.  This may sound a technical point to make but it is quite horrific.  It means that the BTSB and the State said they were going to claim that Mrs. McCole had left it too late to sue and they would, if they could, defeat her claim on that basis.  That is an astonishing claim to make in view of the gross delays in notifying Mrs. McCole of what had, unfortunately, transpired.  This decision was presumably made on the advice of the Attorney General given to Government.</P>
    <P>Second, the State defendants actually pleaded that Mrs. McCole was not entitled to adopt the name Brigid Roe in order to preserve her anonymity during the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Because she had done so, they claimed her action was not properly constituted.  This challenge was pursued on the direct instructions of the Government.  This sort of pleading gives the lie to the Minister's claim that the State behaved in a caring and compassionate fashion.  Certainly, these claims were open in law and the Minister may have been advised to this effect, but it is for the Minister and the BTSB, not for the lawyers, to decide what defence they would actually rely on.  They adopted, calmly and deliberately, an attitude of nit-picking technicality, of legal hardball.  I call on the Minister to explain, if he can, how these pleas came to be in the State's defence and that of the BTSB in the name of the people.</P>
    <P>This was not the end of the pettifogging.  The State's defence denies that the BTSB manufactured or supplied anti-D, even though it must have known at all times that it did.  It denied that anti-D was administered to Mrs. McCole as alleged &ldquo;or at all&rdquo;.  It denied the particulars given of Mrs. McCole's state of health.</P>
    <P>The State's defence also denied that the BTSB used plasma from a patient who, to the BTSB's knowledge, had been diagnosed as having infective <Col N="1637" /> hepatitis.  This, of course, is absolutely inconsistent with the admission of liability.  The State also denied that the BTSB was negligent and, astonishingly, denied that the BTSB had taken no steps to notify the plaintiff after the fateful communication from the Middle-sex Hospital in 1991.  I call on the Minister for Health to explain to this House how these cynical pleas were placed on the record of the High Court with his authority in the name of the people.</P>
    <P>One is surely entitled to assume that the admission of liability in the case taken by Mrs. McCole implies that there will be a similar admission in all of the other cases.  It is now essential that the Minister should explain to the House the basis on which liability was accepted by the Blood Transfusion Services Board and should himself address, or appoint some other body to address, the question of where responsibility for the facts giving rise to the board's liability lies.</P>
    <P>This is essential for two quite separate reasons.  First, where a tragedy of this kind occurs, with literally deadly or life-blighting consequences for a large number of citizens, a full and detailed explanation and attribution of responsibility is owed to those citizens and their families and, indeed, to all who rely on the public health service.  It would be outrageous to any sense of justice if a tragedy of this proportion could occur in a vital public service without a full explanation and inquiry into responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, all those with claims now pending before the tribunal will have to decide whether to pursue their claims and receive compensation on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, or to pursue a claim instead before the courts and receive compensation as a matter of right if liability is conceded or established.  As the Minister himself pointed out on radio last Thursday, one distinction between the damages available in court as opposed to from the tribunal is that in certain circumstances exemplary damages may be awarded by the court.  However, without <Col N="1638" /> a firm explanation as to how the tragedy occurred, it would be difficult for those people or their lawyers to assess the likelihood of an award of exemplary damages or the extent of such award.</P>
    <P>The fact that liability has now been accepted where it was publicly denied up to a few days ago, raises questions of its own.  What caused this U-turn?  Presumably the Blood Transfusion Services Board, and its lawyers, thought deeply before deciding, on the facts as known to them, to deny liability.  It would therefore appear that the dramatic decision to accept liability where it had previously been denied was taken on the basis of some new fact or facts of sufficient importance to convince the board and its advisers that a finding of liability against it was certain or very likely.</P>
    <P>Those affected, and their families, this House and the community generally is entitled to be told what this fact is. Whatever the merits or demerits of the non-statutory tribunal established by the Government, it is certain that, since its awards were to be made on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, the proceedings there could never have led to an establishment of liability.  Central to the tribunal was that there was no liability.  It was a cash-dispensing body which deliberately skirted the issue of liability, for good reason.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of liability is, therefore, wholly due to the courage and tenacity of those who were not content with mere compensation but who insisted on a finding of liability.  In saying this, I do not mean in any way to pass judgment on those who brought their claims before the tribunal.  The tribunal suited the State far more than it suited the applicants.  It offered a shortcut to tired and ill people, people whose defences were down, who could not play the hardball of a State stubbornly defending everything and denying all in court.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the attitude of the State and State agencies in denying liability, in forcing those taking court proceedings to proceed in their own names, and in resisting an early date for hearing <Col N="1639" /> even in the most tragic circumstances, the attractions of the tribunal must have seemed overwhelming to many women. I reiterate, however, that this admission of liability is a monument to the remarkable courage in particular of the late Mrs. Bridget McCole.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made much of the fact that the amount of the McCole settlement was relatively moderate and compared well in this respect with awards given out by the compensation tribunal.  This view begs a number of questions.  First, the McCole settlement was arrived at in the face of the imminent death of Mrs. McCole.  When that occurred, the claim for damages for pain and suffering, for loss of earnings and other special damages into the future, disappeared.  It was arrived at in circumstances of express threats of a sort which it is completely unacceptable to offer to any of the claimants in this matter, much less to one who was dying.  The settlement was made in circumstances where a metaphorical gun was being held to the heads of Mrs. McCole and her advisers.  In no way can the sum of the settlement be regarded as just or appropriate compensation, or as what would have been sought by a plaintiff whose condition upheld to allow her to pursue a full claim.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to what the Minister for Health had to say in the House and in the media at the end of last week.  It appeared to me, and to many others, that the Minister's statements were directed, in part, to distancing himself and his Department from the Blood Transfusion Services Board which has accepted liability.  This is unacceptable and a fiction.  While noone can blame the Minister personally for what occurred up to the alleged notification to his Department by the BTSB in early 1994, it is nevertheless clear that there must be political responsibility for the BTSB.  If the Minister for Health does not carry that responsibility, there is effectively no public accountability for the board.  In fact, it is clear that the board is a creature of the Minister's for which he has political responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> While a blood transfusion board has existed since the 1940s, the present board was created by Statutory Instrument in 1965.  It was created under the terms of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  This Act provides in section 3 that the Minister for Health &ldquo;may from time to time by order establish a body to perform functions in, or in relation to, the provision of a health service or two or more health services&rdquo;. The board, therefore, is constituted by an act of a Minister for Health and its functions and the appointment of persons to it is a prerogative of the Minister.  The Minister has power to continue the body or to dissolve it.  There can be no doubt that the sums of money payable by the board on foot of the admission of liability will have to be provided, through the Minister's Department, by the taxpayer to whom the Minister is responsible.</P>
    <P>These supervisory powers of the Minister over the BTSB give rise to some interesting questions.  For example, how often did the Minister require that information be submitted in relation to Mrs. McCole's case and the other hepatitis C cases.  Article 21.2 of Statutory Instrument No. 78/65 which established the BTSB requires the board to submit to the Minister such information in relation to its performance as the Minister may require.  In his speech on Thursday last the Minister consistently used the phrase, &ldquo;I understand that&rdquo; in relation to the BTSB's admission of liability.  This is wholly misleading given that he had a statutory right to require that the BTSB kept him informed at all stages of the proceedings in the compensation claim.</P>
    <P>When it became known as a result of discovery in Mrs. McCole's case that anti-D had been manufactured from the blood of a donor who had been diagnosed in 1976 as suffering from infective hepatitis, did the Minister ask to be informed as to why this document had not been submitted or had been withheld from the Hederman O'Brien Review Group?  Has the board requested permission from the Minister <Col N="1641" /> to borrow money to fund the damages payable in Mrs. McCole's case?  If so, when was this request made?  Did any of the Minister's predecessors in the Department of Health ever request information during the 1970s or 1980s as to the manufacture of anti-D?  If so, what information was furnished?</P>
    <P>The expert group reports that in 1977 the BTSB used blood from a donor with jaundice to manufacture anti-D because of a &ldquo;scarcity of suitable antibody for anti-D production&rdquo;.  Was this scarcity referred to in the BTSB annual report to the Minister for 1977?  Was the fact the BTSB had manufactured anti-D from the blood of a jaundice sufferer referred to in that report, or, indeed, any report of the BTSB?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the practice of the board and of the Minister indicates that both parties accept the Minister's ultimate responsibility.  The event which triggered the establishment of the first inquiry into this matter was a letter on 25 February 1994 from the BTSB to the Department of Health, belatedly reporting upon the hepatitis C findings. Subsequently, the Minister took a view, and was entitled to take a view, on the question of the continued employment of certain persons, and that view was acted upon.  Did the Minister approve the severance packages for those people?  Does he now concede that these golden handshakes approved by him were inappropriate in the light of the addmitted liability?  Accordingly, it is impossible for the Minister to say because liability has not been accepted by the State or the Department of Health, that he has no further responsibility in the matter, or no responsibility to explain what has occurred and why.</P>
    <P>I do not understand him to go quite that far in explicit terms.  As I said he sought to distance himself from the BTSB, until on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; last night, with public pressure mounting, he realised that this position of distance was untenable.  He has come around to the view that there are questions to be answered.  Where stands his <Col N="1642" /> legal advice now?  There is a world of difference between legal advice and political advice as the Minister is finding out.</P>
    <P>The Minister previously thought, and informed the House, that the High Court proceedings would involve a judicial examination of the entire matter including the question of whether anti-D products should have been given out by the BTSB after 1991, and the question of, to quote the Minister, &ldquo;who is to blame, if anyone is to blame, whether there was negligence and if there was liability&rdquo; will not now be determined by the High Court.  It is essential that they should be determined in some forum.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether such measures would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case.  No one inside or outside the House can come to a reasonable conclusion on this topic until there has been full disclosure which has not taken place on the basis that High Court proceedings were pending, that those proceedings would establish what had occurred and whether there was liability.  This will not now take place because of the settlement of the case announced last week in public and formally in the High Court this morning. That settlement and the circumstances surrounding it raises further questions about the Minister's conduct of the case. The settlement was proposed in a letter dated 20 September 1996 from the board's solicitors to the family's lawyers. It was accepted by the family in the appalling circumstance of the imminent death of the unfortunate plaintiff, their mother.</P>
    <P>The letter offering the settlement makes a narrow and mean-spirited proposal and accompanies it with threats. Furthermore, the terms of the letter make it clear that in offering this settlement regard was being had to the interests, not only of the BTSB but also of the State defendants.</P>
    <P>Let us see exactly what was and was not offered.  First, the admission of liability was limited to liability for &ldquo;compensatory damages for negligence&rdquo;.  This <Col N="1643" /> excludes the plaintiff, who was in no position to refuse the offer, from the possibility of pursuing a claim for exemplary damages.  Also, the admission relates to Mrs. McCole only.  The Minister must make it clear this evening whether liability will be contested in the other cases.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to invite the plaintiff to drop her claim against the National Drugs Advisory Board and the State.  If she does so, it is said, the BTSB will pay the costs of those parties.  That proposition in itself underlines the cynical and unrealistic manoeuvring on behalf of the State.  The BTSB is in no position to pay the costs of the other public sector defendants, except from the taxpayers' money.  This offer, if availed of, would appear to mean that the Department of Health will make a grant to the BTSB to pay the Department's costs.  This manoeuvre is straight from the pages of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and is the height of duplicity.  The letter goes on to say: &ldquo;we respectfully suggest there is no justifiable reason for proceeding against the other defendants and incurring unnecessary costs in seeking to prove negligence on their parts&rdquo;. Why would the BTSB's solicitors make this point except that they had been constrained to do so by the State defendants?  It goes on, in the most express terms, to threaten the plaintiff who was then dying.  It says: &ldquo;if your client proceeds with her claim against the NDAB and the State defendants, our client will seek all additional costs thereby incurred from the date hereof...&rdquo;.  It makes the same threat in relation to the costs of her claim for aggravated and exemplary punitive damages and says that if this claim fails they will seek against Mrs. McCole, who was then dying, &ldquo;all costs relating to the claim for such damages and for an order setting off any such costs in favour of our client against any costs to which our client might otherwise be entitled...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The contents and tone of the letter of 20 September, addressed to the lawyers of a dying woman who was anxious to make provision for her family, are <Col N="1644" /> shameful.  They were made in the name of the people.  They were made in the names of me and you and are shameful. They fall below any standards of decency or humanity.  From the terms of the letter, it is plain that the Minister is directly responsible for them.  The State's fingerprints are all over this letter.  Remember the State is the people. Is this the way the people would expect the State to behave in trying to reach a settlement with a dying woman?</P>
    <P>There is no explanation for the BTSB's solicitors seeking a discontinuance of the case against the other State defendants other than a cynical ploy on the part of the Minister and the State to allow him to say, as he said last week, that the BTSB is a separate legal entity and that the responsibility is theirs and not his.  Because the family have made this letter public, they have done a public service.  Chilling as the terms of the letter are from the BTSB's solicitors, they are absolutely in line with the way in which this case has been fought under the Minister's authority.  Every attempt was made to coax and cajole claimants into the compensation tribunal, which had no power to make a finding of liability.  Crude threats were used to dissuade them from taking the case to the courts.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the State authorities informed the claimants that if, despite the scheme of compensation, any of them was advised to ignore the tribunal and pursue litigation, and accept such advice &ldquo;any resulting litigation will be fully defended by the State, if necessary to the Supreme Court, and will be conducted strictly in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure which govern litigation in the Superior Courts&rdquo;.  This is hard ball lawyerly defence.</P>

      <P>What this means, stripped of its legalese, is that the State will fight the case as if it were a drink driving prosecution.  No procedural device was too low for the State to sink <Col N="1645" /> to.  Under the authority of the Minister, it lived up to its threat in every particular.  In the family's letter to the Minister of today's date, they ask for an explanation, among other things, as to why a threat in relation to costs was made if the late Mrs. McCole pursued a claim for aggravated and exemplary damages. This question cries out for an explanation from the man on whose authority the threat was made, the Minister for Health in the name of the State, the people.</P>
      <P>As a preliminary and urgent matter, there must be full disclosure of all documents, including those not seen by the expert group, to this House.  There must be full disclosure of whatever fact or discovery which caused the volte-face which led to the acceptance of liability. On 1 May 1996, in the situation as then existed, the Minister felt it would be inappropriate for him to produce certain documents on the basis that they had been handed over in the pursuance of a High Court order for discovery and could be used only for the purposes of legal proceedings.  This misses the point. Before the documents could be discovered by the BTSB, they had to be in the possession of that board.  It is as documents in the possession of the board, and not as discovery documents, that the Dáil is entitled to them.  It is not the case that this information was on the files of the BTSB?  Who withheld this information from the Hederman O'Brien inquiry?  Did this information not exist on other files in the BTSB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister specifically stated on a number of occasions before the settlement of the case that the establishment of a judicial inquiry was unnecessary because the High Court case would constitute such inquiry.  That reasoning no longer applies.  The Government motion indicates that the Minister has changed his tack yet again.  The Government has announced a judicial inquiry.  What was once out of the question is now Government policy.  One of the lessons of the beef tribunal &mdash; which is constantly held up as a precedent to all inquiries &mdash;<Col N="1646" /> specifically held by the judge who conducted it was that the tribunal would not have been necessary if there had been full and appropriate disclosure to the Dáil when certain questions were raised here.  Yet again the Dáil has shown itself, over a two to three year period, as being incapable of an inquiring role and holding the Government of the day to account.  It is absolutely clear that any inquiry must not confine itself to the events of the 1970s, the 1980s or the early 1990s.  These certainly must be included but the conduct of the State authorities and statutory bodies, after the revelations of early 1994 right up to the settlement of the case last week, must also be subject to inquiry.  The terminus of the Government's proposed inquiry must not stop at February 1994.</P>
    <P>The case has been defended, no doubt with great ability, on a purely technical basis appropriate to a drink driving case in the District Court.  In the history of the legal case there is no evidence of compassion, no recognition of the special and appalling condition of these plaintiffs.  There is instead a determined effort to get them to accept money without admission of liability and to threaten them if they showed signs of seeking such an admission.</P>
    <P>I refer expressly to the statement issued on behalf of Mrs. McCole's family today in which they say:</P>
    <P>It would have been easier for our mother to accept the rulings of the tribunal.  However, all she really ever wanted was a public acknowledgement that a wrong had been done.  As it turned out, that decision resulted in a very difficult year for her.  Despite the pain and hardship of travelling to and from Dublin for treatment, she never once faltered in her determination to have the truth told.</P>
    <P>We owe it to the memory of the late Mrs. McCole and her family, who fought the State to a standstill, literally in the last hours of her life, to ensure that the truth is told.  The Minister's compensation tribunal was not set up to find out the truth and cannot possibly <Col N="1647" /> do so.  The expert committee, valuable though it is, was not set up to decide contested questions of fact and responsibility and did not do so.  Of course, it did not have all the information.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed several times in the House that he believed the High Court proceedings would lead to the truth but hoped for no such thing.  If that had not been his hope he would not have pleaded the Statute of Limitations, the incorrect constitution of the proceedings, when Mrs. McCole tried to protect her anonymity or made the plaintiff prove technicalities which were not even at issue.  Unless the Minister can explain his position in regard to these matters a question arises about his suitability to continue as Minister for Health.  I wonder, for instance, if any of his colleagues from the Fine Gael back-benches or from the Labour Party or Democratic Left will stand up in the House and support the Minister's reliance on technicalities in his defence against Mrs. McCole's pleadings.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister should now commit himself to the following: (1) admitting liability in each and every one of the cases pending before the High Court with facts similar to the facts in the Brigid McCole case; (2) ensuring that no purely technical consideration, such as the Statute of Limitations or the constitution of proceedings will be allowed to impede or reduce any person's claim for compensation and (3) a full inquiry into every aspect of these tragic events and responsibility for them covering the period from initial infection whenever that may be in the mid-1970s right up to today.  This inquiry must be formal with all necessary powers to establish and attribute responsibility where appropriate.  Once the principle is conceded, Members should be given an opportunity to discuss the precise form of the inquiry with a view to ensuring its efficacy and controlling the costs which arise from it.</P>
    <P>A further question which arises in the ocean of questions, relates to a body of <Col N="1648" /> research which was funded by the Minister into the 1,100 women infected by anti-D.  Something in the region of £3 million was allocated to the six hospitals treating the women infected.  I understand this research has been completed for almost a year but has not yet been published because of a separate legal wrangle about credit for the research. This is vital information, paid for by the taxpayer and it should be published immediately.  I understand from a report in yesterday's <i>Irish Medical News</i> that this research shows that anti-D contamination occured not only in 1997 but also in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Of the 500 liver biopsies carried out in the research, 20 patients had cirrhosis of the liver.  Tragically most had the early stages of fibrosis, the precursor to cirrhosis.  Some seriously ill women are tragically not responding to treatment and are therefore in the throes of a terminal illness.  The scale of this disaster is only now being grasped by an appalled public.</P>
    <P>In his statement on Thursday the Minister said: &ldquo;I have been legally advised that the Department of Health/the State does not have a liability because it acted properly and that is the advice I am following&rdquo;.  Was that advice given before or after the review undertaken by the BTSB which, according to the Minister, caused it to admit liability?  Is the Minister stubbornly denying liability on the part of the State on legal advice?  Will he publish that legal advice?  There is no reason he should not, as the legal professional opinion which normally protects legal advice can be waived by the client, i.e. the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister really wants the truth to come out he cannot have it both ways.  Last night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; the Minister was at pains to stress his obligation to protect the integrity of the blood supply and public confidence in it.  He cited this as one excuse for being constrained in what he could say in answer to Dáil questions and for the manner in which he has dealt with the hepatitis C affair.  It appears to be a <Col N="1649" /> legitimate objective from the point of view of any Minister for Health, but it is only legitimate if public confidence in our blood supply is deserved.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument is similar to the accusations of national sabotage leveled at the Deputies who raised questions about malpractice in the beef industry.  If the credibility of the blood supply has been severely undermined by the events leading up to the hepatisis C scandal then the proper course in a democracy is to come clean immediately and not to seek to limit the damage by concealment and by stubborn denial of State liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This very important matter has been dealt with by the Minister for Health and the Department of Health in a deplorable fashion and I wish I had more time to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Within the past hour I listened to the Minister for Health speaking live on an RTE programme.  I wrote down some of his points but can only deal with one of them now.  He made the incredibly arrogant statement: &ldquo;I was prepared to allow a case to go to the High Court on 8 October&rdquo;.  The arrogance of him to say that he was prepared to allow a case to go to the High Court.  The plaintiff has no rights and the courts have no say; he decides what goes to the court and when it goes, and this when 1,600 people are reduced to their present state by a disease which was inflicted on them by the State.  It is no accident that this happened to these people; rather it was inflicted on them by the State and by an agency which is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Department of Health and for which the Minister for Health of the day has to take responsibility whether it suits him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 18 months I have tried to help a lady whom I will not name but who can conveniently and accurately be described as the second plaintiff &mdash; she is the plaintiff whose case follows next after that of the late Mrs. McCole, the <Col N="1650" /> Lord have mercy on her.  I know something of the agony this woman has gone through having talked to her many times in the past 18 months.  I wrote many letters to the Minister for Health. He did not reply to several of them and when he did reply it was often many months later.  In my letter of 15 November last year I wrote:</P>
    <P>Mrs. X was dissatisfied with the treatment she was getting in Ireland and she is now attending the Royal Free Hospital in London where she is being treated by a specialist in hepatitis.  She is incurring considerable expense but feels she has to do this to try to prolong her life as she has eight children, some of whom are very young.  They are now aged between 4 and 20.</P>
    <P>She feels that in the circumstances the State here should pay the costs she is incurring.  She is not going to London by choice but out of necessity for treatment for a disease which was inflicted on her by the State here. Because of the state of her health she is in an understandably distraught state and the refusal to pay her expenses adds to her agitated condition and does nothing to promote her recovery.  She is apparently being put on the drug Interferon in London. A three month supply there costs £700 whereas it costs between £2,500 and £3,000 in Ireland.  She feels that she is therefore saving the State substantial sums by being treated in London.</P>
    <P>As her illness is entirely the fault of the Blood Transfusion Service Board which is State owned it seems to me to be only reasonable that the State should pay her expenses as well as compensating her for the illness which they have inflicted on her.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to hear from you in the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Three months later to the day I got a reply from the Minister for Health who said: &ldquo;There are six hospitals in Ireland where Mrs. X can go if she wants, she <Col N="1651" /> has a medical card and she will get certain medicines here free&rdquo;.  He went on to say that if she wanted to do anything else that was her own affair.  That was the concern shown after three months, for that lady.</P>
    <P>This lady wants one thing above all else, that is a guarantee of a clean blood supply for her children, their children and all our children in the future.  This woman is being treated in London and the medical description of her, unhappily, is that she is a non-responder.  I do not need to spell out what that means. Her statement to claim was filed seven or eight months ago and the Minister and the other defendants have not filed a defence.  She has a motion for judgment in default of defence before the High Court next week.  She should not have had to bring this motion.</P>
    <P>No offer of compensation has been made to this lady.  Will she be treated like Mrs. McCole?  Will the Minister also wait until the last possible minute in this case?  Why has no offer been made to her?  She does not want any lodgment made with the defence.  She simply wants a reasonable offer which she can accept.  Only last week this woman's eight year old child who had been playing on the street said to her: &ldquo;mammy, I was told you are a drug abuser&rdquo;.  The mother said: &ldquo;I am not a drug abuser&rdquo; but her child then said: &ldquo;I was told by one of my friends that you have a disease which was caused by drugs&rdquo;.  The reason the other child on the street was able to identify that woman is that in spite of an application for anonymity made by this woman it was opposed by the State and the National Drugs Advisory Board.  A wholly owned quango of the Minister, went out of its way to give her name and address to the press so that she could be identified.</P>
    <P>That is a scandalous situation.  Some years ago we had a tribunal about which I probably know more than most Members.  I know how unnecessarily long and expensive it was but that does not have to be the case.  Like the Scott <Col N="1652" /> Inquiry in England, a tribunal could be operated successfully, expeditiously and without the need for excessive expenditure and a vast number of lawyers cross-examining witnesses on everyone else's behalf.  The work of that or any other tribunal to discover what happened could be greatly assisted by the automatic production of documents by the Department concerned and its quangos. During the beef tribunal, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for hundreds of days sought to conceal the facts by withholding documents from parties, witnesses and the tribunal. I hope that when this tribunal is established, the Department of Health will not act in the duplicitous and dishonest way in which the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry acted in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for Health for the comprehensive series of measures which he has taken in discharging his responsibilities in dealing with the consequences of the hepatitis C infection and in particular confirms its approval to: (1) the Scheme of Compensation published by the Minister for Health on 1 December 1995 which will continue indefinitely as an alternative to court proceedings for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from human immunoglobulin anti-D, blood transfusion or other products; (ii) the proposals set out in the health care document published by the Minister for Health on 1 December 1995 in relation to the long-term health care needs of persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C which provides statutory guarantees in respect of the future provision of health care services; and (iii) welcomes the announcement by the Minister for <Col N="1653" /> Health of the decision of the Government to move a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas establishing a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as amended, into the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I reject totally the allegations and condemnations which are contained in the Progressive Democrats' motion put down before the House and the allegations made by Deputies O'Donnell and O'Malley.  Since I became Minister for Health in December 1994, I have fully accepted my responsibilities as Minister for Health in dealing with the consequences of a human tragedy which had its genesis in events which occurred 20 years ago.  The late Brigid Ellen McCole was infected with hepatitis C as a result of anti-D product which was administered to her from a donor whose plasma was infected in 1976.  That occurred 20 years ago and did not take place during my term of office.  The anti-D product remained suspect until my predecessor, Deputy Howlin, removed it from the market in 1994.  That did not happen during my term either.  I am dealing with the consequences of events which occurred before I took office.  I stand over my record and I believe I have dealt with them effectively.  I have devoted more time to this issue than any other matter arising in my Department. It is the most important issue I have faced.  I cannot turn back the clock however.  I can only alleviate, as far as is humanly possible, the consequences of this tragedy.</P>
    <P>I am being charged with lack of accountability on this issue.  I do not believe any Minister has appeared more frequently before this House and answered questions more fully on any particular issue than I have in connection with this matter.  I challenge the Progressive Democrats to repeat their charges.  They are untrue.  The record is established in that regard.  Deputy <Col N="1654" /> Geoghegan-Quinn was present on almost every occasion that this subject was debated and she is aware that I answered any question put to me.  Like any Minister, I can only answer questions related to my area of responsibility.  I cannot answer questions about matters which are before the High Court because I could enter into conflict with that body as a result.  However, I am prepared to answer any questions within my area of responsibility which I am free to answer.  I will answer such questions in the same way I have in the past.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Progressive Democrats have politicised this issue.  I am disappointed that they are attempting to make this a party political issue, particularly in circumstances where the events had concluded long before I took office.  I am charged with lack of accountability.  One of the main ways to be accountable in this House is to answer questions.  I have frequently answered Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's questions but it is very difficult to provide answers to those who do not table questions.  In my view, the Progressive Democrats have identified a party political advantage to be gained. Mrs. Brigid Ellen McCole has died and the Progressive Democrats are trying to gain political advantage out of that tragedy.</P>

I advise Members to reread the report, copies of which were circulated.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> For the past two weeks in particular, a number of articles have appeared in the media as if they were new revelations when the information was available since January 1995.  It is contained in Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien's report.  Members claim they are not getting answers to questions when they are either in that report or I have already replied to them in the House.  At all times I have been accountable to this House and will continue to do so within my area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>We know from its terms of reference that the expert group was not in a position to deal with legal liability.  It could not encroach on the domain of the courts.  Therefore, the issue of legal liability was not fully determined when the report was published.  The expert group did a good job within its terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I became aware then that claims in the statement of claim put forward in respect of the Brigid McCole case, allegations made in the House and comments in the media called into question the conclusions of the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report.  I defended it on its merits because it did not have the power <Col N="1658" /> of the judicial tribunal.  I said the contentious matters, which many people are stating as facts but which are allegations, would be determined in the High Court.  It is not a question of me allowing a matter to go to the High Court.  I said I was not disposed to setting up a judicial inquiry when Miriam Hederman-O'Brien had carried the matter a certain distance and that the contentious items in the case of Brigid Ellen McCole could be the subject of a judicial determination.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am entitled to put my remarks on the record.  It is appropriate to mention that 3,000 blood donations are required each week to meet the needs of our hospital services.  Blood and blood products are essential to the provision of the health services and are a vital element of most operations.  It is incumbent on me as Minister for Health to ensure that there is an adequate supply of blood available for our health services.  It was obvious that the publication of the expert group's report on the BTSB might seriously damage the confidence of donors which would have had a devastating impact on our health services and the public in general.  To maintain public confidence in the BTSB on the day the group published its report, I announced the assignment of Professor Shaun McCann, Professor of Haematology and Mr. Liam Dunbar, the then chief executive officer of St. James's Hospital, to the Blood Transfusion Services Board to enable it to implement the necessary improvements recommended by the expert group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were the circumstances surrounding that change of power and that is why I had to move quickly and could not risk the matter being held up in the courts for an indefinite period.  I was asked about the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the chief medical officer and the chief executive officer on the night in question.  The chief medical officer had a consultant's contract.  It was I who also had to make the final decision on the only other person with a consultant's contract to be removed from his position.  That <Col N="1660" /> decision was made following a lengthy inquiry into events at Beaumont Hospital.  I was not prepared to allow the Blood Tranfusion Services Board to be bogged down in the courts.  I had to move quickly to maintain confidence in the board and I was glad the person concerned retired on the night in question.  It allowed me to assign people in whom I could have full confidence and thus maintain confidence in the board.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The BTSB and its new management have worked well and will continue to do so to ensure there is not a repeat of this type of tragedy.  On 5 April 1995, I announced the Government's decision <Col N="1661" /> to establish a compensation tribunal to fulfil the commitment in our Programme for Government to pay fair compensation for women infected by hepatitis C.  The scheme of the compensation tribunal is well known.  The Government's main reason for establishing the tribunal was to provide an alternative to the courts system for persons infected with hepatitis C to alleviate some of the anxieties for persons who might have recourse only to the courts.  No person is compelled to apply to the tribunal.  It is a matter for each person to decide whether to process his or her claim through the courts or the tribunal.  The making of a claim to the tribunal does not involve a waiver of any right of action.  It is only if the claimant accepts the award made by the tribunal that he or she is required to waive a right of action which he or she may otherwise have had.  If a claimant receives an award from the compensation tribunal he or she has a period of one month to accept or reject it.  If an award is rejected &mdash; to date no award has been rejected &mdash; a claimant may initiate or continue proceedings through the courts.</P>
      <P>The scheme of compensation approved by the Government has worked extremely well.  It has numerous advantages which I have outlined on several occasions.  Any fair-minded legal person or citizen will realise that the compensation tribunal I have put in place is the most advanced and successful and provides the best access to compensation ever provided for any group of victims in this country and the best access to adjudication on the amount of compensation since the State was founded.</P>

No applicant is compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement to a date fixed by the tribunal.  I will not yield to the calls on the Order of Business today to suspend the compensation tribunal.  It is an effective scheme and it will continue for those who wish to go to it.</P>
      <P>The highest award was about £332,000 and the average was £110,000. The legal costs are working out at slightly less than £11,000 per case or slightly less than 10 per cent of the average award.  In terms of the compensation I have always wanted the money to go to the victims and for medical aid. Good lawyers deserve a decent fee and I want them to be paid properly. However, through the tribunal there is a significant saving to be made in legal fees.  I do not apologise for making the point that we save legal fees at the tribunal and I hope we will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I wish to announce again the Government's decision to establish a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, into the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB.  It is my intention to bring forward a motion to both Houses of the Oireachtas next week outlining the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I have some experience of tribunals.  I was a witness at the beef tribunal because I was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who first cancelled export credit to Iraq.  I did not make allegations at the tribunal.  The beef tribunal went on for far too long and it lacked focus because the terms of reference were ill-defined.  It became the best show in town and what was dealt with there was what is proper for this House &mdash; the question of political accountability.  I have no intention of letting this tribunal take the same course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will reflect and take advice from anybody in the House on how we will <Col N="1665" /> get focus in the terms of reference of the tribunal to ensure it does what we want it to do.  The issue of political accountability which interests many Members is, as the Taoiseach said on the Order of Business, a matter for this House. Deputies may ask me any questions they wish and I will do my best to answer them.  They may not agree with my answers but that is not what accountability is about.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I refuse to suspend the tribunal.  Matters may arise from the conclusions of the judicial tribunal which would cause me to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal.  As the tribunal is an informal compensation tribunal I can amend its terms at any time and notify the Government.  I will always amend if that is in the interests of the victims claiming compensation.</P>
      <P>Many issues arise from the infection of approximately 1,400 persons with hepatitis C from blood products.  Many people think we are simply talking about the anti-D product alone.  Some of the original cohort of women infected with anti-D product became donors and the infection was carried through into the blood supply of the transfusion service.  My predecessor put a national screening programme in place and about 60,000 women were screened.  I was involved with the targeted &ldquo;look-back&rdquo; programme to trace those who got blood transfusions.  It was not an easy task but many of them have now been identified.</P>
      <P>A national optional testing programme was put in place also because the screening programme was not sufficient to identify everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the House of the <i>ex gratia</i> expenses scheme I put in place initially for victims, also the comprehensive health package I put in place on a statutory and non-statutory basis which has the full acceptance of the four representative groups.  In particular, I remind it of the Health (Amendment) Act the commencement order for which was signed on 23 September 1996.  I remind the House of the secondary care services in place and the provision of <Col N="1667" /> specialist liver consultants, hepatologists, counsellors and so on and the annual budget for that.</P>
    <P>A question worthy of answer is that asked by Deputy O'Donnell about the data bank in Cork.  A research article is ready for publication in one of the medical journals and it will contain the result of that research.  Because of this tragedy we probably have the best information available anywhere in the world on hepatitis C.  The six main consultants who treated women have fed in information into a data bank in Cork.  That information is very valuable to those in the medical field, but, particularly, to women.  When that data is produced, it will show that the disease progresses at different rates and there is not any inevitability.</P>
    <P>I understand consultants advised many of the victims that the circumstances which applied to Brigid McCole would not apply to a very great number of them.</P>

    <P>The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, set the terms of reference for the report produced.  The ink was hardly dry on it when those terms <Col N="1669" /> of reference were found to have been ineffective.  The tribunal did not have the correct information or appropriate terms of reference and its report turned out to be unhelpful.  The Minister, a capable politician should know when to stop digging.  We are not legal experts but as a matter of common sense we asked him about the setting up of the tribunal, the cut-off date, the likelihood of what has transpired in the High Court arising and what might occur.  I presume the Minister has been able to seek advice from the various agencies, lawyers and battery of experts referred to by Deputy O'Donnell acting on behalf of the people and the State as to what the process involves.  He told us he was restricted in answering questions here because of legal considerations. Did he have all the information and, if he did, would he have taken the actions he took?  One must come to the conclusion that he would not.  In light of the information available, and the lack of information provided through the Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien report, the Minister would have decided that something had to be done.  Now the Minister has been forced to deal with this matter. He appeared on the news this evening, and on &ldquo;Question and Answers&rdquo; last night and irrespective of whether he uses the words &ldquo;grossly, unfairly, inaccurately&rdquo; or whatever he led us to believe he was not in charge of dealing with the problem or providing a solution.  Now he is faced with the possibility that everything dealt with before the tribunal will be the subject of a judicial inquiry which may overturn what the Minister has done.  What will the judicial inquiry produce that is not already known?  Because of a discovery in the High Court documentation and information will come from where it should have come on day one.  The Minister will set up a judicial tribunal, oversee the tribunal already established <Col N="1670" /> and the High Court cases.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>On the financial aspects of this matter, last year we asked why £60 million provided was needed in 1995 and a big debate about that followed.  The funds were provided and I do not intend to rehearse the tragic circumstances of the recent happening in the High Court.  I am sure my colleagues who represent the area from which the unfortunate and now deceased lady came, can articulate that.  Focusing on the logical management of this matter by the Minister, and his predecessor Deputy Howlin, one must come to the conclusion that it was incompetent.  The matter was not handled properly and now the Minister is being forced to do what he should have done from the first day.</P>
    <P>I appreciate legal advice.  It must be said that if legal people are paid enough they will defend anyone.  They are expert at their job but experience in this House prior to and since the beef tribunal indicates that the input of legal people should be minimised and there should be as much practical political decision-making in the process as possible.  We have ended up using three systems, the worst of all worlds.  It is wrong for the Minister to think the legal cost of the tribunal will be the end of the story when we also have the cost of setting up the judicial tribunal with possible knock-on effects.  It may be a very expensive exercise by the time it is complete.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, handled this matter incompetently from day one and that incompetence was compounded by the Minister.  On commercial, bureaucratic or legal advice the Minister has attempted to handle the affair.  He did not listen when we asked him to allow the High Court to clarify the issue.</P>
    <P>We now have this late discovery of information forced from the State board.  Somebody in the Department under the former Minister for Health, <Col N="1671" /> Deputy Howlin, should have written a comprehensive list of questions, called in the board and asked that everything be provided to the Minister so that he could answer questions factually and comprehensively in the House.  The records, information and documentation have been in the Blood Transfusion Services Board since the 1970s.  Paying someone to get rid of an incompetent consultant in a particular situation, instead of bringing in an emergency law within an hour and addressing the matter, should not be boasted about.  A competent person should be appointed to get the information and run the Department and its subsidiary body, particularly in the health service.  The arguments put forward by the Minister do not stand up. On &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo;, the Minister agreed to something he should have agreed to initially.  He knew the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report was inadequate and he should have dealt with it on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not think he can run the tribunal.  He should get the other body established as quickly as possible, obtain the report and submit it to the House so he can put the full facts before it.  This tragic human misery should be addressed and compensated for.</P>

      <P>As one of the TDs for Donegal South-West, I express my sympathy and that of all of my constituents to the family of Mrs. Brigid McCole on her sad death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister was from Donegal South-West he would be sickened at what has been going on in this House this evening and what the Taoiseach said this afternoon.  This is not about beef.  Nobody cares about the beef tribunal.  This is a tragedy about women, fathers, mothers and children.  It cannot be dealt with by political blows or bullying &mdash; I do not agree with what was said about arrogance.  It is sad that a person <Col N="1672" /> who suffered for almost ten years had to give in at the end.  People obviously knew they were to blame for something yet they tried to prevent the truth from emerging.  Oceans of &ldquo;whys&rdquo; still remain.  We all want answers and agree the women deserve their compensation but we still do not have the full facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the tribunal, which we wanted.  It was based on the facts that we and he thought were available at the time.  We now have additional information.  From a layman's point of view how can the BTSB now claim responsibility, when they could not do it a number of months or years ago?  Nothing has changed, which is an awful tragedy.  Women were bullied into going into the tribunal, which had a cut-off date.  It was a case of &ldquo;like it or lump it&rdquo;.  Yet there were many who had the tenacity and forthrightness to pursue what they felt was an injustice.  Many questions were asked by all parties. People would not give up on this issue. It would have been easy to shove it into a tribunal where nobody would know what was happening or who was responsible.  If people did not pursue the matter, perhaps we would not have ongoing debate and the lack of real information and fact.</P>
    <P>Today the family of Brigid McCole asked the Minister for five answers.  I assume he will give those five answers clearly and distinctly.  Following the scandal and publicity regarding this awful tragedy, why were eight doses still administered between February and September 1994?  The product was known to be contaminated.  The Minister is aware of the five questions.  They should be answered and I hope he will give a guarantee to the family that they will obtain the full information on this occasion.</P>
    <P>If I was sick, which luckily I am not, I would find it galling if all the full facts were not made available and there was no admission of liability.  I do not think the people are stupid.  How can a State <Col N="1673" /> agency, under the control of the Minister's Department not be responsible for this matter?  How can that connection not be there?  It is also particularly galling for many people when they see the money that has been made available.  People deserve the money and it is probably not enough for the suffering people have endured &mdash; the personal tragedies, the family tragedies and the huge expenses.  One of our colleagues mentioned additional expenses in travelling to London.  That will never be compensated for, but at least the compensation would be acceptable in the full knowledge that people knew what happened, why it happened and who will take responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister came to the House today and took the situation personally, as if it was his responsibility.  It was stated that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government at the time.  I do not remember anyone saying that Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Health, was personally responsible for this matter, but he is personally responsible as the Minister for Health, on behalf of the people.  We are not yet satisfied with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Minister's change of mind in introducing the statutory tribunal.  I am sure we will learn from the mistakes made over the last number of years regarding costs and full disclosure. We do not want another merry-go-round.  We want a situation whereby the inquiry takes place as quickly as possible, The terms of reference are appropriate, and we get to the bottom of this matter.  The Minister's speech in the House today was almost a reproduction of many of the speeches he has made here.  We welcome many of the matters he has introduced and many of the compensations he has made available.  We do not have to make him a martyr because he gave money to Positive Action to do their work.  He can do it <Col N="1674" /> and let it be.  He says he has given this money to Positive Action and is a hero.</P>

      <P>I never said the Minister was concealing anything.  Obviously, somebody did not tell Dr. Hederman-O'Brien the truth.  The Minister is now basing his tribunal on the facts regarding the inquiry, which is now flawed.  I cannot understand how we can progress with the tribunal because we now have new information and people are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister said we had to ensure public confidence in relation to blood donations in particular.  We were all in a farcical situation where we always believed there was nothing as good as the BTSB in this country.  We spoke about Americans getting paid for their blood and asked how they could run a system like that.  We were blind.  We want to have complete confidence in blood donations and the Blood Transfusion Service Board but this will not happen after each case we find other facts.  We must have the full facts.  I hope on this occasion there will be no bullying and that the unfortunate McCole family will obtain the truth.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I tabled a number of questions to the Minister on this school because it is a matter of grave urgency which needs to be rectified before September.</P>
      <P>The school was built in 1958 but the rooms in it are too small.  There are two rooms with four classes in each and it is easy to understand how overcrowding could occur.  The concerns are ongoing and the matter has become urgent.  The situation for the staff and pupils is becoming intolerable and parents are concerned at the overcrowding.  These are essential and urgent requirements and I trust that by raising the issue again the Minister will see the urgency and give a positive reply.  The Department of Education has the facts and figures and I have received correspondence in the last month regarding the school.</P>
      <P>The school consists of two small rooms, six metres by five metres, and each caters for four classes.  Currently it is a two teacher school and there are 44 pupils but by 1999 the number will increase to 66 pupils which will make it a three teacher school.  There is no room for these pupils.  The money involved in this exercise is not exorbitant, but it is urgent in view of the current overcrowding and timeframe involved.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education, to reply to the issue raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to outline to the House the Department of Education's current position regarding Ramelton No. 2 national school, Letterkenny.  The school has a current staffing level of principal and one assistant teacher with an enrolment of 45 pupils on 30 September 1995.  The school's current <Col N="1676" /> accommodation consists of two permanent classrooms.  The school has requested that each of the classrooms be extended.</P>
    <P>In February 1996, the school authorities requested grant-aid towards the cost of extending the two classrooms. The Department's planning section has advised that the school's accommodation requirements will be two classrooms plus appropriate ancillary accommodation.  A costing has been requested from the Department's professional advisers for the extension sought.  When this costing has been received, the Department will be in touch with the school authorities on the matter.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Department of Education is anxious to see satisfactory accommodation at Ramelton No. 2 national school.  However, any development proposals must have regard to available financial resources and other priority projects.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter but I am sorry the Minister for Education is not here.  I suppose if the Minister for Education were to reply to an Adjournment Debate we would be surprised because her record is not great.</P>
      <P>This issue relates to my local national school which is attended by two of my young children.  The school has been thrown into turmoil as a result of decisions made by the Minister.  Some time ago the Minister decided that rather than allow a number of teachers, in the region of 250, to stay in the system and not go on a panel, she would take 100 of them and give extra teachers to disadvantaged schools around the country.  Certain schools would lose a teacher because of falling numbers.  It was a laudable suggestion by the Minister but has had dramatic effects on particular schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> I make the case for this school because it is in an area which has an expanding population.  For the last five or six years there has been an increase in enrolment.  Unfortunately, this year the enrolment figures dropped in comparison to last year thereby allowing the Minister to reduce the number of teachers by one.  The figures for the coming year, based on September's figures, show that this additional teacher will return.  We are caught in a ludicrous situation where in an area which has the second highest increase in population in County Louth according to the census figures, the local school will lose a teacher.  It has gained a teacher over the last couple of years because of rising figures.  As a result of a blip in the system it has lost a teacher this year and next year it will gain a teacher.  In future years it may even require an additional teacher and additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to pass on the severe objections of the people in the locality.  I attended a meeting which was called immediately after this issue came to light.  There was general consensus that this was most unfair in an area where there was an upward trend in population.  The teachers, board of management and parents are making the case that out of about 30 schools affected around the country this is one of the few &mdash; it may be the only one based on the figures &mdash; which shows an upward trend in pupil intake.  I question taking teachers out of schools.  From my information, 150 teachers will be deployed into the system elsewhere. With regard to this particular school it is losing a teacher for this year only and will gain one next year.</P>
    <P>One teacher who was appointed recently had to move from the school on 1 October.  This teacher was in the school for the first time and was settling in.  It has caused huge disruption and six different classes have been affected.  The pupil-teacher ratio in some of the classes is at the limit.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1678" /> to make an exception with regard to this school.  The figures show an upward trend rather than the general downward trend in the rest of the country.  The school was nine pupils short based on September's figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some concessions where she originally allowed three extra teachers over the limit and has now given up to five.  That does not take into account the fact that the population trend in this area is increasing rather than decreasing.  Will the Minister of State pass on to the Minister a request made by me and other Oireachtas Members in the constituency on behalf of the various interests in the school that she meet a deputation from the school so that they can put their case directly to her?</P>
    <P>When I left my children to the school this morning I witnessed the grave disruption there as a result of removing the teacher.  The people are very annoyed because they believed that settlement of the dispute between the INTO and the Department would result in the teacher being left in the school.  Unfortunately, just before that school and a number of others were due to go on strike, they learnt that they would not benefit from the settlement.  It is ludicrous for the Minister to decide, based on numbers in a particular year, that a teacher will be removed given that next year the teacher will be replaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me this opportunity to reply to the debate on behalf of the Minister for Education.  The Minister is keenly aware of the position as set out by Deputy Ahern and is anxious to assist in every way possible.  She has gone to considerable lengths to see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thirteenth assistant's post at Blackrock national school was suppressed at the end of the 1995-96 school year due to declining enrolments.  The authorised staffing at the school for the <Col N="1679" /> current school year consists of a principal and 12 assistant teachers.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that the staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. This accords with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the INTO.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of Blackrock national school on 30 September 1996 was 383 pupils.  The retention figure for the thirteenth assistant's post was 392 pupils. Accordingly, not only was the enrolment at Blackrock national school nine points below the retention figure for the thirteenth assistant's post, but additionally, the enrolment at the school had decreased by 26 pupils between 1994 and 1995.  In the circumstances, the thirteenth assistant's post at the school was suppressed in June 1996.  The most junior assistant teacher in the school exercised her option of having her name placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment, which has now occurred.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the Deputy that in addition to the staffing which I mentioned above, this school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher.  The staffing agreement mentioned above can be deviated from and additional posts allocated to a school in the current school year if one of two circumstances exists.</P>
    <P>The first circumstance refers to a situation whereby a school achieves developing school status.  This occurs as a result of rapid enrolment growth.  In the case of Blackrock national school, in order for it to achieve developing school status, it would need to increase its enrolment in September, 1996 to 413 pupils.  I understand that the enrolment at Blackrock national school in the current year has increased to 396.  If this is a valid enrolment, it will be sufficient for the reappointment of the thirteenth assistant's post from the start of the 1997-98 school year.  However, it is <Col N="1680" /> clearly not sufficient to qualify the school for developing school status.</P>
    <P>The second circumstance arises when a school is in breach of maximum class size guidelines.  Maximum class size guidelines in the current school year are as follows: 35 applies in the case of a single grade class grouping, 34 in the case of two consecutive class groupings, 31 in the case of multi-grade class groups and 29 in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.  Clearly, if the managerial authorities at the school are unable to manage the existing enrolment within the recommended guidelines mentioned above, it is open to authorities to contact my Department in the matter.</P>
    <P>While the staffing schedule attached to the annual staffing circular 13/96 remains unaltered, it was decided to implement some interim changes in a number of the retention figures.  I emphasise that these were once off adjustments for the 1996-97 school year only and occurred at the retention points for the third to the fourteenth assistant inclusive.  Even allowing for these amendments, it was still not posible to save the thirteenth assistant's post at Blackrock national school.</P>

      <P>Deputies Ahern and McDaid raised topics of great importance in their constituencies, but this is a topic of national importance because it concerns one of the central planks in the Government's stated employment creation policy.  While I have every respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, I am extremely disappointed the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is not here to answer on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing illustrates the cynical contempt of the Government for the plight of the long-term unemployed more than the failure of the so-called Jobstart scheme which was announced last January.  The Minister for Enterprise and <Col N="1681" /> Employment has known for some time &mdash; he must have known from the beginning &mdash; that this scheme was doomed to failure.  It involved the introduction of a subsidy of £80 per week for employers to employ people who had been on the live register for more than three years. In his budget speech, column 737, volume 460 of the Official Report of 23 January 1996, the Minister for Finance stated: &ldquo;Up to 5,000 places will be provided under this arrangement&rdquo;.  It does not require mathematical expertise to work out that a subsidy of £80 per week for 5,000 people would cost £20 million in a full year or £10 million in half a year.  Despite that, the amount provided to finance the scheme was the princely sum of £1 million, sufficient to subsidise only 250 employees for one year or 500 for the six month period from the time the scheme started.</P>
    <P>Even though the scheme has been in operation since last June it has resulted in the creation of a grand total of 140 jobs, one-tenth of 1 per cent of the 138,000 people who have been out of work for more than one year or one-fifth of 1 per cent of the 68,000 people who have been out of work for more than three years.  In the entire mid-western region, which covers a number of counties and urban areas such as Limerick and Ennis, the so-called Jobstart scheme has created a grand total of 13 new jobs.</P>
    <P>Determined efforts by FÁS to sell the scheme to employers has proved an abject failure.  It has been my experience that when employers are informed by FÁS that the person to be taken on has been unemployed for three years they do not want to know.  Employers have effectively colluded in the failure of the scheme.  I am informed that most people who applied for a Jobstart scheme had already participated in community employment schemes, FÁS training schemes and so on.  These are people who are genuinely seeking employment <Col N="1682" /> and desperately want to be afforded the dignity of being allowed to work but they have been let down by employers and the Government.</P>
    <P>The Jobstart scheme is a textbook example of the Government's sticking plaster approach to a problem about which the parties of the left have often come in here and shed copious crocodile tears.  Tackling long-term unemployment requires a genuine radical approach but all we have had to date are short-term transparent gimmicks.  Is it the Government's intention to amend or scrap this scheme in view of the extent to which it has failed?  Has the Government realistic measures to even begin to ameliorate the problem of long-term unemployment and, if so what are they and when will they be announced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Jobstart is a serious attempt by this Government to increase the number of jobs in the economy filled by persons who are unemployed for three years or more and was introduced against a background where such persons are often by-passed by employers when filling vacancies.</P>
      <P>Under the Jobstart programme, employers are enticed to fill existing or new vacancies with persons who are unemployed for more than three years by means of an £80 per week recruitment subsidy payable for one year.  In addition, workers employed under Jobstart may retain eligibility for secondary social welfare benefits subject to an income limit of £250 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> Jobstart is a new programme which was launched during the summer and, as such, is still in its infancy.  Given the short period that has elapsed since the programme has been in existence, it is premature to make any informed judgment on the success or otherwise of the programme.  Previous experience demonstrates that recruitment incentives require a lead-in time before becoming established.  In this regard I would like to assure the House that FÁS and the Local Employment Service are actively publicising and promoting Jobstart among employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should talk to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What is important is that Jobstart is a real attempt by this Government to remedy the plight of the most disadvantaged of the long-term unemployed, that is, those three years or more unemployed.  It is the first attempt by any Government to directly target this group and its objective is to prevent such persons from becoming marginalised by providing an incentive to employers, which hopefully will result in their reintegration into the labour market.</P>
      <P>While 1995 represented the second successive year of growth in the number at work, approximately 50,000 net new jobs were created in 1995 and this job growth is having a real impact on unemployment, it is nevertheless having an insufficient impact on long-term unemployment.  For example, recent statistics indicate that only one in four persons who are unemployed for three years or more actually finds employment.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Jobstart is a real recognition of this Government that the long-term unemployed face real difficulties in breaking back into the labour market and is an effort to overcome the perceptions and attitudes of some employers in taking on the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> There are real benefits for employers as well as the long-term unemployed in availing of this programme and I would like to take this opportunity to call on all employers with job vacancies to take into account the subsidy available under Jobstart when deciding on recruitment policy.</P>

If Irish Ferries drop this service it will have huge implications for the economy of the south-east.  It will disrupt businesses which depend on this service as well as those firms which use the Rosslare link to France.  It will also greatly inconvenience the travelling public.  Small businesses, in particular, will be badly damaged by this decision.</P>
      <P>The cancellation has major implications for the staff of Irish Ferries.  The proposals include laying off 200 permanent and temporary staff for seven months.  As well as this hardship they are being asked to accept changed working conditions when the full service resumes next year.  It is easy to see why staff believe there is a hidden agenda involving an attempt to bring in low priced labour.  The Government must immediately seek a meeting with Irish Ferries and establish what is really going on and what agenda is at play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> Irish Ferries came about because of a deal that was done with the State in relation to the B &amp; I Line, a deal that was specially constructed, including favourable terms on the basis that Irish Ferries would retain staff and develop services.  Instead, Irish Ferries is trying to row back on this.  The Government must challenge it and establish what are the company's motives.</P>
    <P>This news was broken to the staff of Irish Ferries through the news media. This seems to be the trend in management dealings with staff.  There have been several examples of this &mdash; at Packard Electric the workers heard about the closure on the 9 o'clock television news and at Semperit, no consultation took place and little notice was given.  Workers have been treated as if they are expendable and have no feelings despite their loyalty to these firms.</P>
    <P>In the case of Irish Ferries it appears there was no prior consultation and no attempt to show figures or explain why the decision was being taken, although to my mind the company cannot give such an explanation.  Civility and decent treatment towards those with whom you work seems to have flown out the window.  I genuinely fear for the future of labour relations if that trend develops. The Minister should use his good offices to seek an immediate meeting with Irish Ferries and bring about a resolution of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to discuss it with the Minister of State who I am pleased to see in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wexford has the second highest unemployment levels in the country.  It may be difficult to believe but it is a true and unfortunate statistic.  Some 400 jobs are under threat if Irish Ferries is allowed to discontinue its service to France on 1 November, 200 of them from Wexford.  This means that 200 <Col N="1686" /> people will be out of work and 200 wage packets will not go into the local economy.  We will also lose out on services provided for lorries, shipping and passengers, such as oil and food.  It will have a major negative effect on the local economy.</P>
    <P>Rosslare is a state of the art port and has been greatly supported by State money.  In any situation involving job losses Ministers from outside the constituency are wheeled in and deputations are arranged to see Ministers in Leinster House.  I am beginning to wonder if it is good fortune that we have two Ministers and a Minister of State in our constituency.  I have not heard a squeak from either senior Minister, and the best the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, can do is to arrange a meeting for tomorrow morning.  I sincerely hope she has something in the pipleine.  The situation is somewhat hypocritical given that if we did not have Ministers in the constituency we would be running up to Dublin to meet them, yet with two Ministers representing the county we have not seen either of them.  It is time for them to be seen to do something to help their native county.</P>
    <P>If Irish Ferries closes down it will forfeit the business to some other company.  The Minister of State must agree that when one gives away a business like that it is difficult to recover it.  Come next March or April when Irish Ferries intends to resume the service to France, it will be difficult for it to pull back the business which will have gone elsewhere.  I am fairly certain that whatever company takes over will be anxious to hold on to it.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years Irish Ferries has lost business and when the Minister meets the company's representatives he should ask them why.  My own feeling is that their marketing strategy is not aggressive enough and the Minister should put forward that point.  In the interests of Wexford, its workers, the credibility of the port of Rosslare and <Col N="1687" /> the business we do with the continent, this service must not be allowed to stop. If it takes a State subsidy to put us on a level playing field with other companies servicing the same market then that must be considered also.</P>
    <P>Last week I sought a meeting with the Minister for the Marine and with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, yet to date I have not received confirmation that such meetings will take place.  I am greatly disappointed by that.  Where the port, to a degree, and the jobs of 200 Wexford people &mdash; 400 people in all &mdash; are under threat, we should not be dilly dallying.  When there were job losses in other areas there was an immediate response with the Minister travelling abroad to secure jobs for the areas affected.  In this instance we should hold the jobs we have.  Support must be forthcoming in the first instance from the Ministers who represent County Wexford and from the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this matter and Deputy Hugh Byrne.  I also thank the many public representatives and groups who have drawn attention to the matter in recent weeks, including the Ministers who represent the constituency of Wexford.  As the House is aware, I replied to an Adjournment debate on this general issue on 25 September.</P>
      <P>I understand that the employees of Irish Ferries propose to take disruptive action against the company in protest about its decision to discontinue its services between Rosslare and France during the winter months.  I am not aware of the nature of the proposed action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully understand the disappointment and anger being expressed by the Irish Ferries staff and I can identify with those who are to be laid off for the winter months.  They are the victims of the competitive difficulties being experienced by the company.  I do not propose to dwell at length on these difficulties.  I <Col N="1688" /> have already set out the background in the previous Adjournment debate and my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, has in reply to questions earlier today pledged his full support to pursue a level playing field in relation to State aids and subsidies for the shipping sector in the context of the EU Presidency.  The possibility of introducing a special income tax and PRSI regime for seafarers aimed at making their employment more attractive and enabling them to compete better in labour competitiveness terms with the other EU and non-EU seafarers is being examined.</P>
    <P>I stated during the previous Adjournment debate that the decision taken by the company was a commercial one taken by a privately owned firm.  A decision to take disruptive action would likewise be one for the employees concerned.  It would be a matter of considerable regret, however, if such action were to further undermine the company's competitiveness and threaten more job losses.  I appeal to all concerned to try to resolve this dispute without disruption of services to the travelling public and our exporters and importers.  As an open economy and island nation, we simply cannot afford a serious interruption in the flow of goods and visitors into and out of the country. I appeal, therefore, for calmness and reflection on all sides.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke asked me to meet representatives of Irish Ferries.  I have already done so.  I had a useful meeting with representatives of the company since I last spoke in the House on this issue.  I expressed my concern and disappointment in regard to the action of the company and I remain in contact with it about the issue.  I will be meeting with members of the Irish Ferries Action Group tomorrow to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>While responsibility for industrial relations is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I am concerned about the potential loss of seafaring employment <Col N="1689" /> and the loss to the country's shipping services of the direct Irish Ferries link to France this winter.  In the longer term I would also be concerned at the implications of this development for Ireland's maritime links with mainland Europe.  I <Col N="1690" /> will be keeping in close touch, therefore, with future developments in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 October 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate for the information of all Deputies, details of the 24 projects which I have to date approved, in principle, for funding under the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme (CDIS).</P>
      <P>Following my approval, in principle, of funding towards the cost of developing these 24 projects under Phase I of the CDIS, a sum of some £5 million remains to be allocated.  I can now confirm that it is my intention to allocate this amount following a second and final call for applications which will be made towards the end of this month. Following this process I hope to be in a position to announce details of successful projects in the spring of 1997.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there has not been fair allocation of funding.  The allocation of funding is determined primarily on the basis of a comparative analysis of the quality of all applications received by the advisory committee established by me for this purpose. While this committee made its recommendations primarily on the merits of each individual application, it was also made aware of my commitment to develop an arts and culture infrastructure in the regions.  This concern will be taken into account by the committee in its deliberations on the applications I will receive as a result of the CDIS being readvertised, just as it did during the process which resulted in grant assistance being offered to the projects announced earlier this year.</P>

    <P>Provision was included in the Finance Act, 1995, for a scheme under which tax <Col N="1483" /> relief would be given for the donation to national collections of pre-eminent heritage items up to a total limit of £500,000 in any one year.  This limit was increased to £750,000 in the Finance Act, 1996.  Under this scheme an independent assessment committee, comprising the directors of the National Library, Irish Museum of Modern Art, National Museum, National Archives, National Gallery as well as the Director of the Arts Council and the Chairperson of the Heritage Council, was established to decide whether an object would qualify for tax relief.  These donations must comprise an archaeological item, archive, book, record, manuscript or painting (or collection of these) valued at more than £75,000 which is deemed by the committee to be pre-eminent in its class.</P>
    <P>This committee has already processed successfully a number of cases with substantial donations to our national cultural institutions being realised as a result.</P>

      <P>Tá sé mar chuid tábhachtach de Chlár an Rialtais chun Athnuachana go leanfaí le bearta a chur i gcrích, trí chláracha gníomhaíochta Ranna Rialtais agus Eagras Stáit, le feabhas a chur ar an bhfáil, i gcoitinne agus go háirithe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ar sheirbhísí Stáit trí Gheilge agus go dátheangach.  Aithnítear gur gá, má táthar chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú, go mbraithfeadh an pobal go gcuirfí fáilte roimh aon saoráonach a bheidh ag iarraidh gnó a dhéanamh leis an Státchóras trí mheán na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Mar chuid dí chúram maidir le hathbhreitniú a dhéanamh ar an dul chun cinn, d'fhoilsigh Bord na Gaeilge tuarascáil dar teideal <i>An Dátheangachas san Earnáil Phoiblí</i> i mí na Bealtaine anuraidh.  Dhírigh an tuarascáil sin ar fhreagairt na hEarnála Poiblí i gcoitinne do na Treoirlínte faoin Dátheangachas san Earnáil Phoiblí a eisíodh chuig Ranna Stáit agus Eagrais Stáit agus tá anailís neamhspleách inti a rinne an Foras Riaracháin thar ceann Bhord na Gaeilge.

Tá an tuarascáil sin bunaithe ar thaighde a rinne an Ionaid Taighde sna hEolaíochtaí Sóisialta i gColáiste na hOllscoile, Gaillimh, ar fheidhmiú polasaí an Rialtais i leith an dátheangachais san earnáil phoiblí i gceantar na Gaillimhe.  Léiríonn an tuarascáil sin go bhfuil teipthe glan ag formhór na neagras Stáit sa cheantar seirbhís shásúil trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an earnáil phoiblí i gcoitinne cur go mór leis na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun cheana féin chun cur leis an teacht atá ar sheirbhísí go dátheangach. Caithfidh Rúnaithe Ranna agus príomhfheidhmeannaigh na n-eagras Stáit athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar a bhfuil i gceist sna Treoracha agus sna Treoirlínte agus féachaint chuige go dtosófar ag feidhmiú dá réir.  Beidh mé féin i dteagmháil le gach Aire arís chun a iarraidh orthu iarracht speisialta a dhéanamh chun a gcearta teanga a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis an deis seo chun a iarraidh ar an bpobal i gcoitinne seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a lorg ón earnáil phoiblí.  Is mar thoradh ar éileamh láidir leanúnach ón bpobal ar sheirbhís mhaith dhátheangach a thiocfaidh feabhas de réir a chéile ar an scéal.</P>

    <P>Tá dul chun cinn de réir a chéile á dhéanamh maidir leis an nGaeilge a leathadh sa phobal.  Maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge sa phobal i gcoitinne is é Bord na Gaeilge an bord Stáit a bunaíodh chun an Ghaeilge, agus go háirithe a húsáid mar theanga bheo agus mar <Col N="1486" /> ghnáthmheán cumarsáide, a chur chun cinn.  Bíonn iarrachtaí leanúnacha ar siúl ag an mbord chun na críche sin.  I measc na n-iarrchtaí sin tá an bord i mbun:</P>
    <P>&mdash;teagmhálacha leis an earnáil ghnó chun úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn san earnáil sin;</P>
    <P>&mdash;úsáid na Gaeilge a chothú sna healaíona agaus i bhforbairt phobail &mdash; mar shampla, Amharclann de hÍde; agus Coillte Mach, an Baile Dátheangach;</P>
    <P>&mdash;tacaíochta do thograí chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn &mdash; ar nós Comórtas Glór na nGael, féilte agus ócáidí;</P>
    <P>&mdash;feachtais réigiúnach i gceithre ionad ar leith chun an Ghaeilge a leathadh; agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;feachtas fógraíochta ina raibh áit lárnach ag Michelle Smith, a chuir bród orainn uile lena tacaíocht phearsanta don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Chomh laith leis sin foilseofar nuachtán nua Gaeilge <i>Foinse</i> an mhí seo le cúnamh ón mBord.</P>
    <P>Maidir le mo Roinn féin cuirtear cúnamh leanúnach ar fáil do na heagrais dheonacha Gaeilge mar chabhair dóibh chun a n-imeachtaí ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge sa phobal a chur chun cinn. Anuas ar chúnamh do na heagrais sheanbhunaithe ar nós Conradh na Gaeilge, an tOireachtas, Gael-Linn agus mar sin de tá cúnamh á thabhairt d'eagrais nua ar nós Gaillimh le Gaeilge, Tiobraid Árann ag Labhairt, Mhuintir Chrónáin agus mar sin de.  Bíonn cúnamh leanúnach le fáil ó mo Roinnse freisin trí Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge don fhoilsitheoireacht i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is comhartha é bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge de na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú.  Is fianaise í bunú na seirbhíse nua sin go n-aithníonn an Rialtas go bhfuil sé de cheart ag daoine, a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga laethúil, teacht a bheith acu, sa teanga sin, ar an earnáil chraoltóireachta theilifíse.  Leis an nuachtán nua Gaeilge agus le teacht <Col N="1487" /> Theilifís na Gaeilge ar an aer ag deireadh na míosa tá bonn láidir á chur faoi chóras cumarsáide do phobal na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ginearálta</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, is gá go nglacfadh an pobal féin páirt níos mó ná mar ata á glacadh aige i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Tá bá iontach ag pobal na tíre don Ghaeilge ach ní leor bá amháin. Caithfimid uile iarracht phearsanta leanúnach a dhéanamh lá i ndiaidh lae chun feidhm a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá againn cibé chomh meirgeach is atá an Ghaeilge sin.  Ní thig leis an Stát ná le pobal na Gaeilge féin an t-ualach ar fad a iompar.  Tá cúnamh ón mórphobal de dhíth freisin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear distinction between the funding responsibilities of my Department and An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon is an independent statutory body set up in 1951 and which operates under the Arts Acts, 1951 and 1973.  Its funding is provided for in Vote 44 of the Book of Estimates and in 1996 amounts to £18.4 million. One of the principal functions of an Chomhairle set out in the Arts Act, 1951, is to &ldquo;co-operate with and assist any other persons concerned directly or indirectly with matters relating to the arts, and the assistance may include payments by the council upon such terms and conditions as they think fit&rdquo;.  The assistance which may be offered by An Chomhairle to persons involved in the arts is in the main revenue funding, although An Chomhairle also provides capital funding to a limited number of <Col N="1488" /> arts organisations.  These capital moneys &mdash; estimated at £1 million in 1996 &mdash; are allocated in the main towards the cost of developing small scale arts projects or for repairs and renewals to existing arts infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In contrast funding for the arts for which my Department has responsibility relates mainly to capital projects and is financed through a combination of EU Structural Funds allocated under the Operational Programme for Tourism and matching Exchequer funding.  With regard to revenue funding, my Department provides funding to the national cultural institutions such as the National Concert Hall and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  In addition, my Department is providing funding to CAFE (Creative Activity for Everyone) for the implementation of the Arts Awareness Intervention Scheme, a scheme which helps to support important local initiatives in the area of arts and culture with urban and rural marginalised communities.  This particular scheme, because of its innovatory nature, does not at present come within the parameters of &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; that dictate the criteria applied by An Chomhairle to its funding decisions.</P>

      <P>In examining the issues arising from its terms of reference, the working group engaged in broad consultations with a wide range of intertested parties, including inviting all planning authorities to make submissions.  The published report has also been sent to all planning authorities inviting them to forward any observations they may wish to make on the recommendations contained therein.</P>
      <P>Prior to publication, the report of the working group was circulated to relevant Government Departments and Offices, and they have now been invited to make observations on the recommendations in the published report.</P>

      <P>Faoi mar a chuir mé in iúl don Teachta mar fhreagra ar Cheist Uimh. 38 ar 28 Samhain 1995 uaidh tá sé mar chuid thábhachtach de Chlár an Rialtais chun Athnuachana go leanfar le bearta a chur i gcrích, trí chláracha gníomhaíochta Ranna Rialtais agus eagras Stáit, le feabhas a chur ar an bhfáil, i gcoitinne agus go háirithe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ar sheirbhísí Stáit trí Ghaeilge agus go dátheangach.</P>
      <P>Tá sé de cheart ag saoránaigh gnó a dhéanamh le h-eagrais Stáit trí Ghaeilge nó trí Bhéarla de réir mar a roghnaíonn siad.

    <P>Cé go bhfuil dul chun cinn áirithe á dhéanamh maidir le feidhm a thabhairt do na pleananna gníomhaíochta ní leor é.

Caithfidh Rúnaithe Ranna agus príomhfheidhmeannaigh na n-eagras Stáit athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar a bhfuil i gceist sna Treoracha agus sna Treoirlínte agus féachaint chuige go dtosnófar ag feidhmiú dá réir.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent (11 July 1996) judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, case reference C &mdash; 44/95 regarding the Lappel Bank in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to give a definitive legal assessment of this judgment and I can only summarise the judgment of the court in a general fashion.  Council Directive 79/409/EEC of the 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds &mdash; the &ldquo;Birds Directive&rdquo;&mdash; imposes obligations on all member states to, <i>inter alia</i>, classify and designate within their territories the most suitable sites for particular species of birds.  These sites are classified and designated by member states according to EU pre-set criteria as special protection areas (SPAs).  The court, in its ruling, affirmed that under the &ldquo;Birds Directive&rdquo;, the boundaries of SPAs must be determined <Col N="1499" /> by ecological criteria and that economic considerations cannot and must not be taken into account by member states in so doing.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that the great majority of sites designated as SPAs under Ireland's SPA programme meet the judgment of the Court in the &ldquo;Lappel Bank&rdquo; case, an undertaking has already been furnished to the EU that sites designated early in the programme will be reviewed, where necessary, to ensure that the designated SPA boundaries comply with the ecological boundaries of the sites.  This review will be undertaken later this year when the main designation programme is completed.  Any new sites proposed for designation or any alteration to the boundaries of existing SPA sites will be subject to the normal public advertisement and consultation procedure in place for the designation of sites as SPAs.</P>
    <P>Under the &ldquo;Birds Directive&rdquo;, the State must take appropriate action to protect special protection areas and prevent pollution, deterioration of sites or disturbance where these are significant.  Designation does not imply restricting existing activities.  Landowners are, however, asked to consult the heritage services of my Department before undertaking any new projects or activities in or near designated areas which may adversely affect the site. There are no restrictions on developments which do not damage the conservation status of the site.  The planning authorities are also asked to take account of designation when examining development proposals.</P>
    <P>No natural heritage areas (NHAs) have been designated to date.  Designation will not occur until amending legislation to the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been enacted.  I expect to introduce this legislation to the House later this year.</P>

      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference was launched at the Turin European Council on 29 March and has been meeting regularly since then.  Negotiations take place at the level of Foreign Ministers who are assisted by a group consisting of their personal representatives.  Mr. Noel Dorr, former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, is my personal representative at the Intergovernmental Conference.  During the Irish Presidency, I chair meetings at Foreign Minister level and Mr. Dorr chairs meetings of the Representatives Group.  As is normal, a national delegation also represents Ireland at meetings at both levels.</P>
      <P>The Florence European Council requested the Irish Presidency to bring forward for the Dublin European Council in December a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties.  The European Council indicated it expects that its meeting in December will mark decisive progress in the negotiations so that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to complete its work as envisaged by mid-1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> With a view to helping Foreign Ministers to fulfil this mandate, the Intergovernmental Conference Representative Group meets on a weekly basis to discuss the various issues under consideration at the Conference.  The Representative Group met in Brussels on 23/24 September to discuss a number of issues including the environment. Due to lack of time, however, discussions on the environment issue were postponed to the next meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference Representative Group which took place on 30 September in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>Under the general heading of bringing the Union closer to its citizens, the Florence European Council asked the Intergovernmental Conference to address, among other things, the question of making environmental protection more effective and coherent at the level of the Union in order to secure sustainable development.  The Irish Presidency tabled a Presidency Introductory Note on the environment dated 17 September which was forwarded to the Oireachtas Library as are all other Presidency papers submitted to the conference.  The Presidency Introductory Note formed the basis for discussion on the environment by the Intergovernmental Conference Representative Group on 30 September.</P>
    <P>The Presidency Introductory Note suggested that the environmental provisions of the Treaty could be enhanced in two main ways:</P>
    <P>&mdash; first, by including in the Treaty an explicit formulation of the Union's commitment to sustainable development; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; second, by including in the Treaty a strengthened horizontal provision to ensure that environmental considerations are integrated in the sectoral policies of the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported both of these proposals and this was made clear by the Irish delegation on 30 September.</P>
    <P>While the attitude of partners to <Col N="1507" /> strengthening the Treaty provisions on the environment on the lines identified above has been generally positive, a key consideration is that all Treaty amendments must be approved unanimously by the member states at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is too early to predict definitively what the final outcome will be on issues under consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference.  At the present stage of the conference no decisions as such are being proposed or made.</P>
    <P>The Presidency Introductory Note on the environment also identified a number of other issues for consideration which has been brought forward by delegations.  One of these was a discussion document which had been tabled by the Irish delegation concerning the possibility of strengthening the nuclear safety provisions of the EURATOM Treaty in the context of the future enlargement of the Union.  This discussion document was presented by the Irish delegation at the meeting on 30 September.</P>
    <P>Apart from the environment, the Intergovernmental Conference Representative Group on 30 September also considered a number of other matters including flexibility and a range of issues on which proposals had been brought forward by delegations.</P>

      <P>Since then, the situation has deteriorated further with the detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and some 550 of her supporters and the blockading of her residence by the State Law and Order Council (SLORC).  On 1 October 1996, the General Affairs Council issued a declaration expressing serious concern at this further deterioration of this situation.  The Council called for the immediate and unconditional release of all detainees and for a resumption of normal activities by the National League of Democracy to be permitted.</P>
      <P>The European Union emphasised the need for a genuine dialogue to commence without delay between SLORC and the National League for Democracy, as offering the only possible credible way forward for national reconciliation in Burma.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">

      <P>The position is that the VAT treatment of schools and school equipment is laid down in EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply.  Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, education is designated as an exempt activity.  This means in effect, that schools do not charge VAT on the services they provide, but, as a necessary corollary, they cannot recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services which they purchase in the course of their activities.  Generally speaking, VAT can only be recovered by registered businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most goods and services purchased by schools are taxed at the standard rate of 21 per cent.  However, building work carried out by schools, in common with <Col N="1510" /> construction generally, is taxed at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that the level of Exchequer grants paid to schools and other educational establishments takes account of their VAT exempt status.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully alert to the situation that prevails with regard to illegal street trading in tobacco products and are taking steps to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>These steps include an increasing number of prosecutions for smuggling of tobacco products and for selling unstamped cigarettes; ongoing largescale seizures of tobacco products whether smuggled from outside the EU, purchased in excess of duty-free allowances, or transported irregularly outside the correct channels within the EU; increased co-operation with various trade interests concerned, other Revenue services and with the Garda; the extention of tax stamps to &ldquo;roll-your-own&rdquo; tobacco products with effect from 1 October 1996; a co-ordinated approach with the Garda in street operations.  Other additional measures will be taken as necessary.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners have statutory responsibility for preventing the illegal importation of tobacco products and the sale of unstamped products within the State.  In view of the specific street-trading dimenson, customs are working in close co-operation with the Garda in a series of on-street joint operations.  It is intended to intensify these efforts.  Arising from these operations, an increasing number of prosecutions in the courts have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from efforts at street vendor level, investigations are continuing in an <Col N="1511" /> effort to trace the source of the tobacco products feeding this illicit trade and urgent inquiries are being pursued in this area with the investigation services of our EU partners.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Review Group on the Ambulance Service in its report of December 1993 stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service. The ambulance service is so recognised on the basis of its task in responding to emergencies requiring an ambulance response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the health service also has a significant requirement for non-emergency transport of patients and the <Col N="1519" /> ambulance service has long fulfilled an important role in meeting such transport needs.  The dual role of the ambulance service has envolved over many years in recognition of the need for flexibility to meet both emergency and non-emergency needs of the health service.  Non-emergency work is an integral element of the ambulance service workload and it has been estimated that over half of all ambulance calls relate to the non-emergency work.  Rather than viewing this situation as anomalous, I consider the flexibility to undertake both emergency and non-emergency work as essential to the efficient and effective operation of the service.</P>

      <P>Our statutory system for the recognition of foreign adoptions is confined to adoptions effected abroad which are broadly similar in their legal effect to that of an Irish adoption order in terms of the termination and creation of parental rights and duties.  As a simple adoption decree does not extinguish the legal relationship between the child and his or her birth parent(s), it is not possible to recognise them.  To do otherwise would be to accord such an adoption a legal status beyond that which it was intended to have in the country where it was granted and, in particular, beyond that which the birth parent(s) of the child would have understood when giving consent to the making of the simple adoption decree.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the practical difficulties which Irish residents who have been granted simple adoption decrees abroad are encountering.  Since the issues involved relate to a number of areas of Government, I am arranging to have them considered at a forthcoming meeting of the Cabinet committee on children.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  111 agus 112 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá dualgas leagtha ar RTÉ an bunstruchtúr teicniúil a thógáil chun a chumasú do Theilifís na Gaeilge feidhmiú mar sheirbhís náisiúnta ar leith.  Ba é an bunsprioc ná go mbeadh an tseirbhís ar fáil do 90 faoin gcéad den daonra ón tús.  Tuigtear ón eolas is déanaí atá ar fáil ó RTÉ go meastar go mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeilge ar fáil do idir 93 faoin gcéad agus 95 faoin gcéad den daonra ón tús-dáta.  Tar éis don tseirbhís a bheith tosaithe, leanfaidh RTÉ ar aghaidh leis an gclár gléasaistrithe atá pleanáilte, a mheastar a chríochnófar go luath i 1997.  Ina dhiaidh sin, is ceist do RTÉ na ceantair a shonrú nach mbeidh glacadh sásúil le fáil iontu agus clár a chur idir lámha chun gléasaistritheoirí de chumhacht íseal a sholáthar, i gcomhréir leis na hacmhainní foirne agus eile a bheidh ar fáil, d'fhonn na fadhbanna sin a réiteach.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an glacadh sa Tuaisceart, dírím aird na dTeachtaí ar fhreagraí ar cheisteanna roimhe son ar an ábhar céanna, go háirithe an freagra a thug mé ar Cheist Uimh. 86 ar 12 Meitheamh 1996 &mdash; feic colúin 1895 agus 1896 den Tuairisc Oifigiúil don lá sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar a cuireadh in iúl san fhreagra sin, <Col N="1527" /> tá scríte agam chuig an Rúnaí Stáit don Oidhreacht Náisiúnta, an tAire a bhfuil freagracht fheidhmiúil aige i ndáil le cúrsaí craolacháin sa Ríocht Aontaithe, ag iarraidh comhaontú polaitiúil chun moltaí atá curtha le chéile, d'fhonn an glacadh ar RTÉ sa Tuaisceart a fheabhsú, a chur i bhfeidhm ar bhonn céimnithe.  Tá mé ag fanacht ar fhreagra substainteach ar an litir sin.  Bhainfeadh aon fheabhsúcháin ar ghlacadh RTÉ sa Tuaisceart a eascródh as an bpróiséas seo le craolacháin Theilifís na Gaeilge chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Beidh an líonra tarchuradóireachta atá á thógáil don stáisiún nua ag feidhmiú ar mhinicíochtaí ar an mbanda craolachán UHF, a chuirtear ar fáil ag an Roinn Iompair.  Fuinnimh agus Cumarsáide ón speictream craolacháin atá ceaptha d'Éire faoi chomhaontaithe idirnáisiúnta.</P>
    <P>I gcásanna nach mbíonn RTÉ 1 agus Network 2 á bhfáil ag lucht féachana ar UHF, tuigim ó RTÉ go mbeidh sé riachtanach do dhaoine ar mian leo Teilifís na Gaeilge a fháil aeróga UHF a insealbhú.  Ní mór dom a threisiú nach bhfuil aon rud speisialta nó neamhchoitianta faoi aeróga UHF: tá siad in úsáid ar fud na tíre.  Tuigim ó RTÉ freisin go dtagann costas na n-aeróga sin, gan costas insealbhaithe a chur san áireamh, laistigh de raon ó £7.50 go dtí níos lú ná £20 an ceann.  Bheadh ionadh orm, mar sin, dá mbeadh ar mórán den lucht féachana, ar mian leo aeróg dá leithéid a fháil insealbhaithe go proifisiúnta, praghas a íoc a bheadh chomh hard leis an bhfigiúr atá luaite ag an Teachta Lawlor ach iad a bheith sásta tairiscintí inchomórtais a lorg nó teacht le chéile le sealbhóirí tí eile sa cheantar chun idirbheartaíocht a dhéanamh le soláthróir aeróga le conradh insealbhaithe ar an mórchóir.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 to 117, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The present urban renewal scheme commenced in August 1994 and operates in 35 centres throughout the country.  A comprehensive review of the impact, effectiveness and cost of the urban renewal schemes which have operated to date is currently under way to assist in the formulation of future policy in this area.</P>
      <P>It is not intended that the current scheme will be extended to any additional towns or areas.  It would be inappropriate to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation as part of any future scheme until general policy in relation to the next phase of urban renewal is determined in the light of the review.</P>

      <P>I take it that the question relates to the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996.  These regulations are intended to help improve conditions generally in the private rented sector by providing information and resources to local authorities to assist their enforcement of the range of statutory requirements, including rent books and standards, applicable to the sector.  I consider that the regulations will, over time, lead to improvements in the standard of rented dwellings and benefit tenants in the sector, including those who are applicants for local authority housing.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  My Department is currently engaged in urgent efforts to put suitable transport arrangements in place for the children in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> My Department makes every effort to provide school transport for children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services. However, in some instances this is simply not feasible due to particular circumstances such as excessive cost, too long a distance, or the inability of a child to avail of a service because of the nature of the disability.  In such cases my Department offers a grant to the parents to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.  The amount payable depends on the distance involved and the level of attendance of the pupil.</P>
    <P>The children in question have been enrolled at a special class for pupils with speech and language disorder which has been established at the school mentioned by the Deputy.  A total of eight children have enrolled in this class.</P>
    <P>Because of the dispersed locations of the children in relation to the special class, it has not proved possible to arrange a transport service to the class. Neither have the children's parents found it possible to make alternative arrangements within the limits of the grant assistance offered in this case.</P>
    <P>In view of these developments and in order to facilitate the children in question, my Department is urgently examining ways of overcoming the present difficulty.  I hope a satisfactory solution can be devised in the near future.</P>

      <P>As I have stated in previous replies to parliamentary questions a project of this scale requires very careful consideration because of the implications for Exchequer funding of the overall capital and operating costs involved, particularly in the context of the demand for funding for a wide range of other sports facilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation serice, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>
      <P>Since amy appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question. However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>I appointed a judge, retired, to carry out an independent, informal examination into allegations which, according to media reports, had been made by a sex abuse victim in the course of a criminal trial.  These allegations were to the effect that the victim had made complaints of sexual abuse to a probation officer and the officer had failed to report the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the reply to the Adjourment debate on 26 September, to which Deputy O'Donnell refers, I have asked the judge to examine allegations made by the victim about a probation officer's alleged failure to report the sexual allegations.  I have also asked the judge to examine a media statement indicating that the accused was well <Col N="1562" /> known to the Probation and Welfare Service, to ascertain if this was factual and the basis on which referrals, if any, were made.  Finally, I have asked the judge to examine the relationship and contacts the accused had with the Probation Hostel, Lady Lane, Waterford, and to report and make recommendations on the matters covered by his examination.</P>
    <P>I believe that the correct course, once these allegations were made, was to have the matter independently examined without delay and I have no doubt that the Deputy will agree with me on this.</P>
    <P>The judge's examination is ongoing and I will take any necessary action following consideration of the report.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Chief State Solicitor's Office that civil proceedings are being issued against the State and others in relation to this case.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that pension schemes generally are regulated by the Pensions Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Income continuance schemes while closely allied to occupational pension schemes are in fact totally separate in their legal structure, status and operations.  They are run by insurance companies and are quite separate from the pension scheme in any given employment.</P>
      <P>They do not come within the remit of the Pensions Act and, accordingly, I would have no direct function or responsibility in relation to such schemes.</P>
      <P>However, earlier this year I wrote to the Pensions Board setting out the various issues that I wanted them to place on their agenda during their five year term of office.

      <P>To qualify for unemployment benefit person must have 39 contributions paid at the appropriate rate in <Col N="1570" /> the governing contribution year, which is currently the tax year 1994-95. According to the records of the Department, the person concerned was employed and paid class Al contributions until 15 May 1994, when he became self-employed.  From that date he paid the appropriate class S1 contributions, which do not carry entitlement to short-term benefits such as unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The contribution record of the person concerned for 1994-95 shows he paid six class A1 and 46 class S1 contributions. He does not have the required 39 contributions at the appropriate rate of his application for unemployment benefit was refused on this basis.  He was invited to apply for unemployment assistance, which is means tested, but declined.  It is, however, still open to him to make an application for unemployment assistance if he is still unemployed.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for a contributory old age pension at age 66, a person is required to have been in insurable employment or insurable self-employment before reaching age 56. The person concerned was self-employed and was 62 years of age when he entered social insurance for the first time in 1988.  His total contributions amounted to 156.  Hence, he is not entitled to a contributory old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally self-employed persons who enter social insurance after age 56 can <Col N="1571" /> claim a refund of the pension element of their PRSI, provided that they are not entitled to, or in receipt of, a non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>The person concerned claimed and was awarded a non-contributory old age pension with effect from 19 March 1993 which is currently payable at a weekly rate of £36.50.  Accordingly, he is not entitled to a refund.  He has paid three years contributions up to the time he reached pensionable age.  The contributions paid are sufficient to provide entitlement to widow's and widower's contributory pension.  Under current legislation there is no provision for the payment of additional contributions which would enable him to qualify for an old age contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The couple concerned are both in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension which is a means tested payment.  When assessing a person's means the Department must take account of any savings, investments, property or income &mdash; including any other pension &mdash; which the person may have.  Old age non-contributory pension application forms include a request to notify the Department of all incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1995, the Department discovered that the couple concerned were both in receipt of British retirement pensions.  They had been in receipt of these pensions prior to qualifying for Irish old age non-contributory pension, but they had not disclosed this relevant fact to the Department either at the <Col N="1572" /> initial means investigation stage or subsequently, as required under the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the light of this new fact, their pension entitlements were reviewed.  Following correspondence with the couple concerned, it was decided that they were entitled to a reduced rate of old age non-contributory pension, with retrospective effect.  The couple were notified of their right of appeal against this decision.  An overpayment of £17,000 has arisen as a result of this revised decision.  In accordance with the Department's code of practice, the couple concerned have been notified of the amount of overpayment due and afforded the opportunity to provide any further relevant information before a determination is made on the recovery of the overpayment.  This determination will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The latest available estimates from the Central Statistics Office for overseas visitors which relate to the first half of 1996 show visitor numbers <Col N="1573" /> at 2,002,000, an increase of 16 per cent on the same period last year, distributed across markets as follows: Great Britain at 1,183,000, up 17 per cent; other European countries at 464,000, up 15 per cent; North American &mdash; USA and Canada &mdash; at 286,000, up 18 per cent and other countries at 68,000 down 9 per cent.</P>
      <P>Provisional CSO figures for earnings, including carrier receipts, are only available to date for the first three months of 1996 and show estimated total income from visitors at £265 million, representing a 9 per cent increase on the same period in 1995.</P>
      <P>The published data released by the Central Statistics Office does not give a breakdown of the number of overseas visitors who visit the regions.  Bord Fáilte does however, as part of its own market research, undertake a survey of overseas travellers which, <i>inter alia,</i> measures the regional distribution of overseas tourist visits.  I understand that this survey is compiled on an annual basis and information in respect of 1996 is not yet available.  The compilation and publication of this material is the direct responsibility of Bord Fáilte and the relevant details are contained in Bord Fáilte's annual report and accounts, copies of which are available from the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned about the recent decision of Irish Ferries which will result in considerable loss of employment in the Wexford area.  It is my intention to assist in any actions, within my power, to address the issue. The background was dealt with in a previous debate on the Adjournment on 25 September.  The Minister of State met representatives of the company on 26 September and expressed serious concern to them about the company's decision, which was taken in the light of the changing competitive environment on the continental corridor following the completion of the Channel Tunnel and other developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of subsidies and the employment of non-EU labour is extremely complex.  I understand that a complaint has been lodged in relation to subsidies being paid to a French company also operating on the continental corridor.  It is my intention to monitor progress of this complaint in the EU Commission.  I am also pursuing in the context of the Presidency a &ldquo;level playing pitch&rdquo; for State aid, which will be aimed at making clear where and how State aids, if any, can be permitted.  I understand that the EU Commission will produce a draft of such guidelines in the near future and it will by my intention to progress them urgently in my role as President of the Council of Maritime Transport Ministers.  As regards the employment of non-EU labour, I am pressing in the EU context to ensure that untrained or inadequately trained non-EU seafarers do not find employment on vessels plying EU <Col N="1583" /> waters.  I am also pursuing possible concessions in the area of tax and PRSI for Irish seafarers, aimed at making their employment more attractive and enabling them to compete better in labour competitiveness terms, with other EU and non-EU seafarers.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned at the loss of employment arising from the decision of the company in this instance.  I will keep in close touch with the situation and as mentioned I am prepared to contribute to any action within my power to ameliorate the situation.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the proposed Fisheries (Amendment) Bill dealing with the licensing and regulation of aquaculture development.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give an exact timeframe for publication of the Bill in question.  The draft Bill is currently being finalised by the Attorney General's Office and, subject to Government approval, it is my objective to publish the Bill as soon as possible and certainly during the current Dáil session.</P>
