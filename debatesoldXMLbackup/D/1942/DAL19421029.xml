      <P>I regret I must refuse the Deputy's request as, in my opinion, it would be contrary to the public interest to supply the information which he seeks.  As the Deputy is aware, Section 49 of the Finance Act, 1941, provided for the setting up of the Foreign Exchange Account into which is paid all sums in foreign currencies acquired by the Department of Finance.  All the operations and transactions on the account are open to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who will report thereon to the Dáil under the provisions of Section 49 (10) of the Act referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will grant greater facilities <Col N="1641" /> to bellmen, and if he will give them increased supplies of any available fuel so that they can give adequate supplies to intended customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the nature of the additional facilities to which the Deputy refers.  I am always prepared to consider any representations which are made by bellmen. Merchants are authorised to supply bellmen with turf to the full extent required to provide the domestic ration for all their registered customers.  I am informed that the Dublin bellmen as a whole have not taken up the full amount of turf to which they would be entitled on this basis.  The question of increasing their supplies, therefore, does not appear to arise at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the bellmen do not get the turf anywhere near where their customers reside, and that the distance they have to travel, to such places, for instance, as Whitehall, Drumcondra, and Crumlin, is so far that it is scarcely worth their while?  Will the Minister endeavour to make turf available for the bellmen so that they may be able to get two and, if necessary, three loads a day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to be a different question.  So far as I am aware, there is no restriction on the number of loads they may take.  The bellmen usually draw their supplies from the merchants with whom they are associated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that Swords and district has been without fuel, either turf or timber, for the past week; that the poor and working classes have had no firing in this area for over a week, and that this is due to the fact that Mr. J. Savage, fuel merchant (lorry No. Z.9051), received no petrol coupons for October although he received a permit; and further if the Minister will take immediate action to remedy this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. As regards Mr. J. Savage, on the recommendation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, an allowance of 30 gallons of petrol was granted to him on the 22nd September exclusively for the transport of turf.  Before any further allowance could be considered, however, Mr. Savage should have furnished particulars to show how that allowance was used.  Such particulars were not furnished until the 23rd instant, and, on the basis of these, a further allowance of 30 gallons was granted to Mr. Savage on the 28th instant.  In addition to the foregoing, a special allowance of ten gallons of petrol for the transport of turf in Swords has also been granted to Mr. Savage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the great hardship imposed on the people of the Freemount, Milford, Tullylease and Dromina districts by the closing of the Coolbane Mills, he will have the Order closing these mills immediately revoked and allow the mill to reopen forthwith for the making of flour for the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that hardship has been occasioned to people resident in the areas mentioned in the question from the closing of Mr. Denis O'Shaughnessy's mill, known as Coolbane Mills, Freemount, Charleville, County Cork.  Such hardship is, however, due primarily to the fact that the proprietor of the mills failed to comply with the wheat-milling regulations, which are made in the general public interest, and to conserve supplies of wheat required for human consumption. I have received representations from the parish council concerning this case and they are having consideration. As it is my primary duty to conserve wheat supplies, my decision on these representations must be based on the likelihood that, should the mills be allowed to reopen, further irregularities will not occur.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 30th September, 1942, the Slievardagh Coalfield Company had obtained from public funds the sum of £40,209 15s. 2d., made up as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>£33 15s. 2d.&mdash;a loan under Section 7 of the Slievardagh Coalfield Development Act, 1941, to pay the expenses of forming the company.</P>
      <P>£40,176&mdash;repayable advances under Section 9 of the Act for the general purposes of the company.</P>
      <P>No non-repayable grants have, as yet, been made to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has not emerged from the development stage and coal is not yet being raised on a commercial scale. From temporary working faces, however, <Col N="1644" /> some coal has been raised continuously since the month of February. For the months of February to June inclusive the output from these working faces was approximately 200 tons per month.  From July onwards the monthly output has been at the rate of 250 tons per month, and is likely to remain at this figure until the main drift now in the course of construction has been completed.  It is expected that the construction of the main drift will be completed on a date in the month of November.</P>

In a letter dated 12th August, the applicant admitted that the works had not been completed in March as stated by him, but said they had been finished about 16th July.  He further stated that, while the work done might not be strictly according to technical requirements, it was in reality satisfactory. A further inspection indicated that the work was not yet satisfactorily completed and the applicant was informed to this effect.  Further representations were received from him on 10th September and a senior officer was instructed to visit applicant and report as to whether any further progress had been made and whether the work performed was of such a nature as to merit a grant.  The report of this officer has not yet been received.</P>

Surely the cost of living is as high in Cork as it is in Dublin, and the work is as heavy in Cork as it is in Dublin.

      <P>There are 74 male temporary clerks employed in the Finance Branch of my Department.  No female temporary clerks are employed.  The average age of the male temporary clerks is 41 years.  They are all in receipt of a basic salary of 29/9 per week plus bonus which brings the salary of each married man up to 58/1 a week and each single man up to 56/7 a week. The tenure under which the posts are held is purely temporary.  Those men who entered the service at an inclusive wage were subsequently placed on basic salary plus bonus&mdash;the change being made to give these temporary officers the benefit of any increased remuneration allowable under the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) (Amendment) Regulations, 1942.</P>

It was found that the sum of 9d. a day did not cover the cost of the services provided, and it was, therefore, necessary to revise the rate.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should perhaps have mentioned last night in giving the reasons for the introduction of this Bill that one of our objects is to speed up action against defaulting parents, and therefore some of the points to which Deputies called attention have had to be introduced. I think, however, that these can be more appropriately dealt with on the Committee Stage.  For example, there is a question as to the absences of members of school attendance committees. I regret to say that the attendances of members of these committees in the Dublin County Borough area are not as good as they should be. While some members attend very regularly others do not, and there have been cases where the period of membership of certain members has been characterised by complete absence from meetings.  However, my only object is to endeavour to secure that the attendance will be as good as possible.  If the House feels that three months is not a sufficiently long period to cover cases of illness, the matter can be dealt with.  Provision, of course, is made in Section 10 of the Bill by which school managers or patrons of schools who may find it difficult to attend will be permitted to appoint deputies, and I am hopeful that under this arrangement <Col N="1662" /> we shall be able to get active deputies who will be able to attend. Very often parish priests are not in a position, owing to the numerous calls upon them, to attend as regularly as they would wish.</P>
      <P>The question was also raised in connection with employment whether an endeavour would be made to deal with the employment of children by their parents.  That matter has been examined and it would be extremely difficult, I think, to deal with it.  I have not been able to suggest any way in which the work of children for their parents could be brought in as a type of employment which we ought to prevent, if it interfered with school attendance. Of course there are other statutory provisions beyond those now contemplated dealing with the control of juvenile employment.  Under the Conditions of Employment Act and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act the employment of children under 14 years of age in industrial work or in shops is prevented.  It is really not my function to deal with the control of employment directly; that is more a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  We have had some complaints, however, and the proposals in the Bill are merely put before the House as an endeavour to meet the situation.  If they can be improved in Committee, well and good. There are also, perhaps I should add, certain by-laws in the Cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, governing street trading and the employment of young people in certain trades.  The corporations concerned, of course, can amend these by-laws from time to time. So it is not entirely a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that the provisions regarding vagrants will be difficult to carry into effect.  However, I have been asked by high authorities to have this matter dealt with.  Quite a long time ago representations were made to me, and the provisions here, again, are largely experimental, but we must start off by having a register of these children and seeing how the situation will work out.  If such people are not able to provide for the education of <Col N="1663" /> their children by giving them to others as guardians, then I presume that action will have to be taken to ensure that the minimum education, which the Constitution lays down as being necessary and which it is emphasised that the State must provide for children from the moral, intellectual and social aspects, will have to be provided for them in some way.</P>
    <P>Emphasis has been laid upon the social conditions which deter children from going to school.  I mentioned last night that the Government has established various social services to endeavour to ameliorate the situation of poor parents, and I do not think that it is possible for the State to do everything in these matters.  The parents have a certain responsibility, and it should be a fundamental responsibility that they should see that their children are given an education.  After all, as I said last night, it is the most valuable thing which can be given to the children, even though there may be some small charges in connection with the provision of education, and I think that most schools and teachers try to meet the cases of very poor or destitute children.  In fact, when I hear Deputies talking of the provisions of school meals, light, heating, and so on, I would remind them that managers and teachers, as has been admitted in the debate, often provide out of their own pockets for these amenities.  As I have often stated, the parish is expected to make its contribution towards the upkeep of the school.  Then, as far as the provision of meals is concerned, you have the school meals scheme operating in a number of urban areas, and, I think, in all the borough areas.  I know, myself, of a great many cases of schools where the managers provide meals for the children from their own resources&mdash;often to the extent of 300 or 400 meals a day&mdash;and, in the same way, clothing is provided in necessitous cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I suppose we cannot all be satisfied in these matters.  I think, as Deputy Morrissey said, Deputy Dillon overstated the case when he suggested that we were interfering, in some way, unnecessarily and unduly, with the parents' rights.  After all, the principle of compulsory school attendance was recognised by the Legislature so far back as 1892 and, in 1926, the Irish Parliament introduced another Act along similar lines and, after 16 years' experience of that Act, I think it is not too much to hold that it should come up, in the ordinary way, for re-examination and that, if possible, the legislation should be improved. Certainly, the numbers that I read out for the House last night would indicate that, making all allowances for reasonable causes of absence, there would seem to be an unduly high proportion of children absent from our schools every day.  I hope that the result of this Bill, if it is carried into law, will be to remedy that situation very greatly.  As I have said, if particular points can be improved, I shall be very pleased to have the assistance and co-operation of the House, which the debate last night showed will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy raised the question of large classes.  I explained in the House on a previous occasion that infants come into the large city schools in large numbers from the month of April up to the end of September, and even later.  Even still, young children are coming in for the first time.  Infants are supposed to come in at the beginning of the school year, the 1st July, and were it not that such a regulation would cause hardship on parents &mdash;and no doubt they would resist and object to it very strongly&mdash;for the smoother organisation of the schools and more efficiency in education, I think the Department would really be justified in urging parents to send their children, if not on the 1st July, then within a reasonable time after that. The children come in in large numbers, and then, during the winter period, <Col N="1665" /> they do not attend regularly.  The attendance becomes most irregular and, side by side with that, the children in the senior classes who have passed the age of 14, are being withdrawn from school.  Some of them may be going into employment or withdrawn entirely, and others may be going on to secondary schools or vocational schools.  In any case, there is a falling off in the attendances in the senior classes during the year, making itself apparent during the autumn period, on to Christmas It is extremely difficult for head masters or head mistresses to organise their classes properly, because they have these fluctuating numbers to deal with.  Moreover, our staffing arrangements are based on giving a teacher for every 40 to 45 pupils.  That is the arrangement for staffing, and, as I told Deputy Mulcahy on the Education Estimate, I see no prospect of improving the staffing arrangements in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not allow for any percentage.  When, in a particular school there is a number of pupils, ranging from 40 to 45, for whom there is not a teacher, a teacher will be provided, and teachers have been provided already in some of the cases to which the Deputy has called attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure that is laid down in the circular dealing with the organisation of classes is 55 on the rolls.  The inspectors do not consider that a figure of 55 or below 55 is unduly high, having regard to the average percentage of attendance.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the numbers on rolls went up to 60, and the percentage of attendances went up accordingly, the class might be abnormally large.  The number that the Deputy gave yesterday &mdash;that is, 53&mdash;as the average number on rolls for these large classes, would not be considered abnormal by the inspectors, having regard to the attendance.  It would furnish an attendance of about 40 to 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty that headmasters have, as I have said, is, under the existing staff arrangements, to divide the numbers in their schools into such homogeneous and equal groups as will enable each teacher to have roughly the same number of children under control.  In the cases that the Deputy asked me about, though there were some unduly large classes, there were also other classes, the majority, I think, which were well beneath the figures I have mentioned of 55 on rolls or 40 to 45 average attendance.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is really largely a question of organisation, if the rooms are suitable, to try to bring about such a grouping as will make things more equal.  More attention is given to the upper classes in these large schools because, as I have said, the position is fluctuating with regard to infants and even if an extra teacher is appointed it may be the case&mdash;and it does happen &mdash;that the attendance will not be maintained and there will not be the numbers requisite for the maintenance of that teacher in the school.  It would be very difficult to have a system of appointing temporary teachers.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the whole matter is under constant examination by the inspectors and I am satisfied that there is only a small number of cases in which the classes are unduly large.  I am hopeful that through the arrangements that are being made in consultation with the inspectors, this difficulty will be eliminated for the future.</P>

In order to carry out that plan it will be necessary to have the children allowed off at 12 instead of 12.30 in a small number of schools.

I have not sufficient information now available to answer the question the Deputy has put me, but I would like to congratulate him on the fact that he has found that there are possibly other ways of dealing with this problem than by asking parents and children to go on strike if certain demands are not met in connection with the campaign that is going on for community meals or community kitchens.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first five amendments I suggest might with advantage be taken together.  The kernel of the amendment to which the first five amendments refer is contained in No. 5, which is an attempt to define the meaning of &ldquo;public authority.&rdquo;  We did not attempt to define &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; originally in the Bill as drafted, and questions have been asked as to what definition we propose to give to it.  Of course, if there were any difficulty, about it, the question might have to go to the courts, and my personal attitude was that &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; as set out in Section 7 of the Act should be interpreted as widely as possible.  I was not anxious to exclude any public authority or any body that could possibly be regarded as a public authority from the section, but I was informed by legal authority that there are Acts in existence where &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; is defined for specific purposes&mdash;housing and other things&mdash;and that, if the matter were raised and brought to the courts, the courts might feel that they were bound by the definitions already in existence and the object I had in view, that is, to give it a wide and liberal interpretation, might not be achieved.  I was advised that the wisest thing, if I wanted a liberal and wide interpretation, would be to define &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; and that I have <Col N="1669" /> attempted to do in the amendment that is down here from the Seanad&mdash; No. 5. Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are consequential on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Central Bank Bill was going through I put down an amendment to the effect that examinations for the clerical staff should be by open competition, with Irish as one of the subjects in the syllabus.  For reasons that I need not go into now, I was unable to put it before the Dáil.  The matter was, however, reopened in the Seanad and there the Minister accepted the principle, at all events, that Irish was to be one of the necessary subjects for competitive examinations for the clerical staff.  I think the Minister went further with regard to what he called the class of positions for which competition would be open and rather extended that beyond the clerical staff. In my original amendment I wanted to eliminate what I call the very pernicious element of nomination which prevails at present in the banks.  While <Col N="1672" /> at the present time positions in the banks are nominally open to competition, there is also a pernicious system of nomination, which permits those in control to handpick their staff according to their own prejudices, likes or dislikes.</P>
    <P>I do not think in the amendment that came from the Seanad the Minister has accepted unreservedly the principle of doing away with nomination and it is on that account that I have put down my amendment.  I think it necessary to emphasise that in a measure like the Central Bank Bill if we are to have any sort of democratic control at all.  This question of nomination with regard to banks is very pernicious, and as the central bank, with the development of things, will probably be the people's bank&mdash; though as the Bill passed this House we are keeping very little control&mdash;I foresee the time when we will have control.  I say that it would not be in keeping with democratic principles if we allowed nomination to stand for the clerical staff.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment and to do away with the possibility of nomination for clerical appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment. The amendment that has come from the Seanad, which was moved by myself, is possibly not in the exact form in which it was moved by the Senator who moved the other amendment.  I had some discussion with the Senator who moved an amendment and I think he accepted the point of view that I was anxious for competition, and keenly anxious, of course, that Irish should get a proper place.  The Senator accepted an amended form of the amendment put down by him.  I am all out for competition, open competition in suitable places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy is mixing up this bank with the ordinary commercial banks, and seems to imagine that we will have dealings here somewhat like those of commercial banks. We will not have any branches at all.  We will have one office and a relatively small staff.  The basis of the staff will be the present <Col N="1673" /> Currency Commission staff.  I do not think it is going to be very much enlarged in the beginning.  The Currency Commission staff has not had a vacancy for a male employee for five years, and has not had a vacancy for a female employee in two years.  If we adopt the Deputy's suggestion, and have to advertise open competition for perhaps one vacancy in two years, according to my experience&mdash;and I think it is the experience of the House &mdash;we will probably have 1,000 applicants for one clerical appointment, after expending several hundred pounds in hiring examination halls, engaging examiners, for perhaps one or two vacancies that might occur within two years. I think that would be wasteful expenditure.  What is required is in the amendment that I have asked the House to accept from the Seanad.  It secures competition, and that proper regulations will be made for the subjects, including Irish, that applicants will have to be examined in.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that open competition would mean that we would not be in a position to have an interview board as part of the examination system.  I think for a bank, even for commercial banks, and for the central bank, an interview board is essential. It is not necessarily the person who has the highest intellectual qualifications&mdash;although they are very desirable &mdash;that would be the best possible person for the staff of a bank or for the staff of the central bank.  In the central bank staff every individual, the most junior clerical officer or typist will probably have to deal with currency and to handle currency in the ordinary daily duties, and it would be most important that the character of every person going into the service of the bank should be very thoroughly examined.  The Civil Service is a big organisation and some other place could be found for a person not found suitable, but you cannot do that with a small staff.  Therefore, you have to be careful in selecting a staff.  I think the amendment I proposed meets the situation, indicating as it does that the House would like to secure that there would not be any suggestion of any impropriety in the way people from any <Col N="1674" /> part of the country would be chosen as members of that staff.  I think the amendment secures that that will not be the case.  As far as the commercial banks are concerned, my experience has been&mdash;though I have not known the directors&mdash;that if I asked for a nomination for anybody I had not any difficulty in getting it for people who wrote to me from different parts of the country.  I was facilitated.  I think it will be the same here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not confusing the commercial banks with the central bank.  I am afraid the Minister is trying to adopt the worst principle of the commercial banks, of which I complain, whereby appointments are going to be made by prejudice and patronage. The Minister seems to have had the same experience as I have had. It is very easy to get a nomination, but you have very little chance of getting your nominee any place on the staff, when it comes to be chosen afterwards, if he is of a particular kind.  The whole financial activities of this country are confined practically to three out of the eight or nine banks that we have operating here, and these banks are, in the main, manned by people whose sympathies and whose loyalties are given to a country other than their own.  I do not want that sort of principle, or that sort of element, to come into the central bank in its principles of administration.  I quite realise that the central bank is only another name for the Currency Commission.  The basis of its operations, it seems to me, has not been extended much beyond that of the Currency Commission which we have operating at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is not going to accept my point of view, I suppose there is no use pushing this amendment to a division.  I am very sorry that the Minister, with his sound Irish democratic ideas, is not prepared to fall in with my point of view, and with what I am aiming at.  In this amendment I am trying to kill the old pernicious system of patronage and prejudice, and I am sorry that the Minister is not going to help me out. <Col N="1675" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies who remember the violent controversies that followed the introduction of the Trade Union Bill of 1941 may have been apprehensive of a similar protracted discussion taking place in the Dáil when they saw that another Bill with the same Title was being introduced this year.  The fact is, however, that this Bill is largely an agreed measure.  It is being promoted mainly on the suggestion of bodies connected with the trade union movement.  Its purpose is to effect certain amendments in the Trade Union Act, and its passage through the Dáil may, in fact, be fairly described as the formal termination of the controversy which took place last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time after the coming into force of the 1941 Act, representatives of various trade unions met me to discuss certain provisions of that Act in connection with which they desired to suggest amendments.  The suggestions which they put forward were considered, and proposals for meeting them were prepared and submitted for their observations.  Their observations were generally favourable to the enactment of these proposals, and this Bill has been introduced to give effect to them. The changes are, I think, of no very great importance.  However, I will indicate their character.  In Section 6 of the Act, it was provided that a register should be set up of bodies of employees employed by the same employer who desired to be in a position to carry on negotiations with their employers as excepted bodies.  The present Bill proposes to make such a body of employees an excepted body without any condition of entry in a special register. It was always intended that an employer should be free to negotiate with his employees, and that employees should be free to negotiate with their employer without restriction.  I agreed to the view which was expressed, that the maintenance of the special register was unnecessary and might, in fact, become a complication at some stage <Col N="1678" /> as indicating a special status held by these otherwise unorganised bodies of workers.  The second amendment relates to the position of bodies negotiating on trade boards, apprenticeship committees, industrial councils, conciliation boards, arbitration boards, and similar bodies recognised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is proposed that a body which acts on any of these boards and negotiates on any matter that relates to wages or conditions of employment need not, by so acting, be required to hold a negotiation licence.  It is obvious that the functioning of those bodies is desirable from every point of view, and no impediment should be placed in the way of it.  It was felt that it was unnecessary, where a joint industrial council or a conciliation board had been established, that the one, two or three employers in that trade, for example, should be required to constitute themselves a trade union and take out a negotiation licence.  So long as they act on one of those recognised bodies, there is no need for any further formal arrangements.</P>
    <P>One of the main objections taken to the provisions of the 1941 Act related to Part III of that Act, which is not yet in force.  Deputies will remember that Part III of the 1941 Act provided that a union could apply, to a tribunal to be established, for the sole right of organising workers in a particular occupation.  The Act provided that, where a union got that sole right of organisation, an individual worker who was aggrieved by reason of a refusal of membership in the union with the sole right could appeal from the decision of the union committee to the District Court.  It was represented to me, and I felt there was force in the representations, that the District Court was an unsuitable tribunal for hearing such appeals, and consequently I agreed to amend that provision in the manner provided in this Bill.  The amendment contemplates that, when the tribunal which hears the application from the union for the sole right of organisation decides in favour of granting that sole right, it will require the applicant union to indicate the machinery it <Col N="1679" /> proposes to establish for the purpose of giving the aggrieved applicant for membership an appeal from its decision.  I think everybody will recognise the justice of providing that, where there is a sole right conferred upon a trade union, an individual who may be refused membership of that union will have some means of getting his case heard by an independent tribunal.  I contemplate that the Irish Trade Union Congress, or some other authority within the trade union movement, will set up an appeal tribunal which will be impartial as between the union and the individual claiming membership of the union, and can be trusted to give a fair decision on the facts, and with more knowledge of the problems of trade union organisation and other relevant considerations than the District Court might have.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other of the provisions of this Bill require special mention. There are some sections of the Act being repealed, consequential on the new provisions being inserted.  One of the sections being repealed is sub-section (8) of Section 6.  That sub-section was introduced to make it clear that nothing in the Act was intended to prevent a third party intervening in a trade dispute for the purpose of assisting in the negotiation of a settlement. I am advised by the law officers of the Government that the insertion of that sub-section was not necessary; that in fact there was nothing in the Act which prevented the intervention of a third party in trade disputes, whereas it was represented to me by the trade union interests concerned that the maintenance of the sub-section might remove the necessity for some trade unions obtaining negotiation licences, and that consequently an ambiguous situation might result which would be a source of difficulty to the unions which had applied for and obtained negotiation licences.</P>
    <P>There is one other section which provides that, when an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce inspects the register of any licensed trade union, he will not have to pay the same fee which a member of the <Col N="1680" /> public would have to pay.  Those are the only changes which are being made by this Bill, and, as I have said, they have all been agreed to by the representatives of the trade union movement with whom they have been discussed.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is of a composite character.  Each section deals with a different point.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to remedy certain difficulties which have appeared in the electricity supply code.  Sections 2 and 3 have their origin in a recent judgment of the High Court in a case in which a former employee of the board who had been discharged from its service in the year 1933 succeeded in obtaining a judgement to the effect that his dismissal was invalid because, to put it briefly, it was held by the court that, as a person transferred from the service of a former undertaker to that of the board, he possessed, under the appropriate section of the Act of 1927, certain rights, amongst which was a condition that his dismissal following suspension, to be valid, required the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Prior to 1933 the board had applied for the consent of the Minister for Local Government to the removal from office of certain persons transferred to its service under the Act of 1927, and, as the Minister for Local Government was then advised that such a consent was not necessary, it was not sought for or obtained in the case of this official.  The consequence is that the board may, as a result of the action to which I have referred and further legal proceedings, be compelled to pay to the plaintiff a large sum by way of arrears of salary since 1933.</P>

    <P>Following that judgment, a number of other persons formerly in the service of the board, and who also possessed <Col N="1681" /> rights under Section 39 of the 1927 Act, have commenced proceedings against the board, claiming arrears of salary on the ground that they were not validly retired or dismissed.  In those cases, and in over 30 other instances, the board is liable to be sued, on the grounds mentioned, for arrears of salary.  In the majority of those cases the persons concerned were retired by the board on pension, and in two instances the persons concerned were dismissed for grave and admitted misconduct.  In the case of the pensioners, the claims are, and would be, in respect of the difference between the pensions and the amount of salary on retirement, and in every case for the restoration of full employment.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to enter into the question whether the person who received the High Court judgment to which I have referred was or was not dismissed for good reason.  The judge at the hearing stated&mdash;I am quoting from the judge's statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nobody could, on the facts, have quarrelled with the opinion of the board that the plaintiff had misconducted himself in relation to the duties of his position in the service of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government considers, however, that it would not be desirable to invoke the Oireachtas to use its powers to nullify the judgment of the court, but it will probably be generally agreed that the existence of this judgment should not be allowed to be utilised as a basis on which to found a series of unjustifiable claims against the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, proposed to allow the judgment of the court to stand and to permit the plaintiff to recover such a sum as he may be awarded in the consequential proceedings now before the Supreme Court but, at the same time, it is proposed to prevent that judgment being used by others to recover from the board moneys to which they have no equitable title whatever.  Proceedings other than those instituted against the board in this connection after the date on which this Bill was introduced&mdash;17th <Col N="1682" /> July, 1942&mdash;are, therefore, barred and in the case of those pending provision is made for the payment by the board of the taxed costs incurred by the plaintiffs.  At the same time, I should point out that the Bill does not in any way worsen the conditions applicable to any transferred officer nor does it affect any of his rights.  Any transferred officer who considers himself aggrieved by an act done in relation to him by the board has, under this Bill, a right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health who is empowered either to annul or to confirm such act.</P>
    <P>Another matter dealt with in the Bill is an amendment of Section 11 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1930, which section relates to the valuation of undertakings acquired by the board.  Under the section of the 1930 Act to which I referred, where an undertaking was acquired after the 3rd July, 1930, the valuation for rating purposes is stabilised at that existing on the 1st April, 1929.  Deputies from County Kerry will be particularly interested in this amendment.  Representations were made that this restriction operated unfairly in certain cases and it is proposed to remove it, thereby substituting the valuation existing at the time when the undertaking was acquired. That change will remove a grievance of certain local authorities. A grievance of the Killarney Urban District Council in this connection was raised here in the Dáil some time ago.</P>
    <P>A further provision in the Bill relates to certain employees of former undertakers&mdash;the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin United Transport Company &mdash;who lost their employment when the Pigeon House and Ringsend generating stations were closed by the board. Under Section 61 and the first Schedule to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, these persons were awarded compensation in the form of annual pensions based upon service up to the time when their services were dispensed with. Subsequently these men were employed by the board after the re-opening by it of the Pigeon House station.  It has been found that, under the law as it stands, the years of service with the <Col N="1683" /> board subsequent to the reopening of the Pigeon House station cannot be reckoned to supplement on ultimate retirement the pensions they already enjoy in respect of their service up to the closing of the station at which they had been employed.  It should, of course, be understood that none of the men concerned on being employed or re-employed by the board received full salary or wages in addition to the pension awarded as compensation.  Instead of this the board paid, as remuneration, the difference between the pension and the full appropriate salary or wage.  All of these men possessed actual or prospective pension rights with the former undertakers in whose service they had been, and if, for example, the Pigeon House station had, instead of being closed for a time and then reopened, been maintained in continuous commission, the men employed at the station would have been entitled to count their entire period of service for pension purposes when ultimately they came to retire.  Owing, however, to the break in their service they are not now entitled as the law stands to count their services from the time they resumed work.</P>
    <P>I think it will be generally agreed that it would be unfair to permit the men concerned to lose for pension purposes the period of service from the time they recommenced work.  The Bill, of course, does not propose that two pensions should be paid in any case&mdash;one for former service and one for subsequent service&mdash;or that any of the persons concerned will be compelled to surrender his present pension rights.  All that the Bill provides in that regard is that each of the persons concerned may choose whether he will retain his present pension rights, in which event he will not benefit under the Bill, or as an alternative, surrender those rights.  If he chooses to surrender his present rights and satisfies the conditions laid down in the Bill, then Section 13 of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, will apply to him.  In short, that will mean in practice that his period of service with the former undertaker will be aggregated with that spent in the service <Col N="1684" /> of the board, the pension on retirement being calculated on his total aggregate service.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the cases of certain people who have pension rights, former employees of the Dublin Corporation who worked at the Pigeon House.  The Pigeon House was taken over by the board and was closed down for some time.  If the Pigeon House had been continued in operation these employees would have remained in the service of the board and carried their pension rights with them.  In practice what happened was that the Pigeon House was closed down by the Electricity Supply Board who did not at that time consider that it would be necessary to continue the Pigeon House station in operation. Subsequently the Electricity Supply Board decided that it was necessary to re-open the Pigeon House and they re-employed the staff.  The legal difficulty which has arisen was due to the closing down and the re-opening of the Pigeon House station.  As the law stands they can get no pension in respect of their present service.  We propose to give them the alternative of retaining their present pensions or coming into the general pension scheme applicable to all Electricity Supply Board employees, if they surrender their present pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only remaining feature of the Bill to which it is necessary to make <Col N="1685" /> reference is the provision to remedy a defect which has been revealed in connection with the prosecution of persons alleged to be guilty of the act of theft of electricity.  For purely technical reasons, the board finds that it possesses no effectual means of prosecuting offences of this kind; and the Attorney-General, whose advise on the matter I have sought, considers that the defect should be remedied in the manner provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to speak at any greater length at this stage.  Each section of the Bill deals with a separate matter and, as is usual in Bills of this kind, if any Deputy wishes to raise a point in connection with any of the sections, he will probably find it more convenient to do so on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any objection to giving the date of the judgment and the name of the judge who delivered it?  In so far as this Bill deals with persons whom the Electricity Supply Board has found it necessary to dismiss for disciplinary reasons, I enter no objection; but in so far as it deals with dismissals for other than disciplinary reasons, and when superannuation rights are now being interfered with or lessened, that is another matter.  I would not enter as much objection to the taking away of a right which even these people have at the moment to go to court, as I would to a case such as that which came under the notice of some members of this Dáil some years ago.  An official employed by Rathmines Urban District Council was concerned.  I am not positively certain whether he was transferred to the Dublin Corporation, when the city boundary was being extended, and took up service with the corporation, subsequently being taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  For reasons best known to themselves, they found it possible to get done in some other way whatever particular duties he discharged, and they determined his service by dismissal, not for any disciplinary reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not give any further identification of the man than to say he was well known in musical circles in the <Col N="1686" /> city.  The circumstances of his superannuation were brought before members of this House some years ago. They were very unjust.  He was about 51 years of age when discharged and had something like 20 years' service. I do not remember the exact circumstances but, speaking from recollection, he got approximately one-third of his salary.  In the normal course, if he had reached the age of 65 at that time, that was all he was entitled to; but the general policy that has been adopted in connection with these matters for the past half century, if not more, is that a person who has been employed by a local authority and is taken over by another local authority or, under statutory authority, by some other body, he gets some rights conferred upon him by statute which would increase the normal superannuation he would get. That is the first objection I see in this Bill.  The position there is most unsatisfactory.  Apparently, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health did not understand his responsibilities in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the taxed costs do not appear to be fair.  Why not pay the whole of the costs?  Does it follow that, when the taxed costs are discharged, the persons concerned will have to pay their solicitor or counsel some sum in excess of what they will be allowed by the Electricity Supply Board?  I am sure the Minister, or some official in his Department who is advising him, must have had experience at some time or other of litigation where taxed costs are limited in certain cases to prescribed amounts; but it rarely happens that any person engaged in one of those cases escapes with just the taxed costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>None of these cases has come for hearing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have happened in this way?  A person goes into the solicitor and sees him on several occasions.  He is asked by the solicitor for certain information.  Each time he goes in he incurs extra costs. The solicitor then takes counsel's opinion.  I do not know by what <Col N="1687" /> measure of value the fees are fixed, but I do know that there is a very big difference between the sums charged by different counsel.  There is a limit set by the taxing master in connection with that.  The Minister knows very well that, as between a fee of £10 10s. and a fee of twenty guineas, there may be very considerable advantage in paying the twenty; but if the taxing master does not allow it, does it seem that the unfortunate man&mdash;whose rights now, although they are rights according to law, are taken away&mdash;is going to be at the loss of this amount?  It is a small point but, when we are taking away certain rights which a man has according to law, we should discharge a liability of this kind.</P>
      <P>In the case of the alteration in the valuation, I enter no objection whatever. In connection with the matter of superannuation, however, when we are taking away superannuation rights and interfering with people's rights, there should be very wise discretion, to make sure that we are not setting an unsavoury precedent.  It is a very extraordinary thing that a matter of this kind should remain undiscovered for so many years.  Perhaps the Minister has the date of the judgement now?</P>

      <P>In connection with Deputy Cosgrave's remarks, I do not think we are doing any injustice to anybody.  In fact, out of a desire to avoid injustice, we are leaning in the opposite direction.  Employees of a local authority under the law could not be dismissed without the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Employees of the Dublin Corporation engaged in connection with the electricity supply were transferred to the Electricity Supply Board with all the rights they had as employees of a local authority.  One of the rights which it has been held now was transferred with them was this right of not being dismissed without the consent of the Minister. About ten years ago, the Minister took legal advice in the matter and was assured that his formal prior consent to the dismissal of an employee by the Electricity Supply Board was not necessary and the Electricity Supply Board proceeded to act upon that legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> This officer was dismissed from their service.  I am quite satisfied myself that he was properly dismissed.  The judge who heard his application used words which conveyed that he thought he was properly dismissed; but, on the purely legal point, that the formal consent of the Minister for Local Government to his dismissal had not been secured; he was held to have been illegally dismissed, and to have remained in the service of the board.  As a result of that, he got an award amounting to a substantial sum, representing the wages he would have earned if he remained in the service of the board from the time he was dismissed up to the time of the judgement.  We are letting that stand.  He got his award and he is getting away with it. But, immediately he got the award, everybody who had been transferred from the service of the Dublin Corporation to the board, and who was retired because of old age or for any other cause, seemed to think that they also, on this legal point, could establish a claim.  We are proposing to stop them from doing so, and we are providing that any legal costs that might have occurred up to the day this Bill was introduced in preparing submissions for the court, will be recouped. I think it will be held that we are acting fairly, in all the circumstances. We are providing that for the future the prior consent of the Minister to the dismissal of these employees will not be required, but such employees, when dismissed, can appeal to the Minister for Local Government against the dismissal.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Emergency Powers (No. 194) Order, 1942, dated the 7th July, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order, to which very serious objection is taken by me, was issued <Col N="1690" /> under the emergency powers which were granted to the Minister for the purpose of preserving, during the emergency, the life of the community, dealing with supplies and any other matter affecting the safety or preservation of the State.  Under the powers so provided we find an Order issued concerning the affairs of a particular company, as a result of which the Government take over that company, make it practically a Government company, apparently appoint a board, and take other action of that kind.  Under Order No. 194 the Government indicate that no person, having made a contract with the company concerned-that is, Irish Steel-shall be able in any way to take legal or other steps that might be necessary to secure that the contract will be carried out; that no person to whom the company owes a salary shall be able to recover that salary; that no person to whom it owes fees or commission or payments of any kind will be able to seek legal redress if these payments are not made.</P>
    <P>The Order puts the general shareholders in the same position as any person who has a claim against the company; that is, they are completely cut away from safeguarding their interests by making claims against the company.  In addition, the shareholders and the debenture holders are prevented from exercising the power they normally would have in connection with the company's affairs.  Here we have in operation an Emergency Powers Order which is intended to deal, during the emergency, with exceptional circumstances.  Under this particular Order the company is made a Government company, and all persons having claims against the company before the date the Government took over are prevented from exercising their rights. What the position of that company will be when the emergency passes, and the powers given to the Government under the Emergency Act cease to have effect, I do not know.</P>
    <P>We are presented with two sets of facts.  First of all, where people established a company and had an interest in it, the Government have completely cut out that interest.  As I said before, <Col N="1691" /> when we were continuing the Emergency Powers Act, I believe it is a blow to general credit that the Government could do such a thing.  No statement has been presented to the House, or was made at the time the Order was issued, giving an explanation why this particular industry should be treated in this way, and why the people who have claims upon the company should be treated in the way in which they are being treated.  We do not know what other industry may, in the future, be treated by the Government in the same way.  We do not know what industries may have to be established during the emergency.  If it is necessary to establish industries during the emergency, I do not know how anybody can expect that they will get capital if a sword like this is left hanging over their heads by the Government.</P>
    <P>Even if a complete statement of the facts were issued by the Government at the time of the making of this Order, I would object to the procedure. If people are going to be deprived of their statutory rights, particularly in a case like this, then it ought to be done by legislation.  If, on the other hand, the Government are going to take on the responsibility for organising, managing and controlling an industry of this kind, then the House should have, through the only medium in which it is possible for the House to have them, the facts put before it, and that is by way of legislation.  The House should have all the facts, both in regard to the Government's plans and the necessity for proceeding to establish and develop this industry. Deputies should have the facts placed before them in the only way in which these facts should be placed before them, and that is by legislation passing through the House.  The House should have an opportunity of discussing the pros and cons of the matter and understanding what are the financial commitments of the Government in this connection. I think it is a shocking thing that use should be made of an Emergency Powers Order to enable the Government to take over a large industry like this and to undertake very big financial commitments in connection <Col N="1692" /> with it.  No satisfactory explanation has been given to the House.</P>
    <P>There is a number of detailed matters that I should like to put to the Minister.  First, what is the necessity connected with the present emergency which prompted the Government to take over this industry?  Secondly, what do the Government intend to do towards solving any problem connected with the present emergency by means of this company?  Thirdly, under what powers have the Government taken over the company and appointed a board of directors?  What experience of the steel business have the directors who were appointed, and what technical persons who are capable of running it are left with the company?  What are the financial commitments at the present time in connection with the running of the company?  These are matters that we should know.</P>
    <P>As regards the matter that the Order deals with, I should like to know the nature of the contracts that are set aside by this Order, the number of people owed salaries or fees or commission, what the total amount is, and what are the general circumstances that prompted the Minister to decide that these people's claims should be set aside.  Finally, what will be the position of these people and of the company as a Government concern when the emergency passes and the powers in this Order no longer exist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to second this motion, I should like to quote what the Taoiseach said in this House. At column 594 of the Official Debates of July last, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is in order to protect public money that this particular Order has been made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Speaking in the Seanad, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That power can be exercised when it is necessary in the opinion of the Government to operate it for the purpose of preserving the life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all sure that the life of the community would be endangered <Col N="1693" /> if this Emergency Order were withdrawn. The more one looks at this matter, the less one likes it.  If this had been an ordinary concern, it would have gone into liquidation and a receiver would have been appointed for the debenture holders&mdash;I think, as a matter of fact, a receiver was appointed&mdash;and the company would either have been sold as a whole or would have been broken up.  Why this extraordinary procedure in this case, under which a wall is built around a company to protect it from all legal actions?  Deputy Mulcahy spoke of the position of the company when the emergency powers are withdrawn. I suppose that walls sometimes have a habit of falling with disastrous results.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that either the Taoiseach or the Minister has been absolutely frank with us because it is popularly supposed that there were certain contracts held by individuals which had to be brushed aside and, if that is so, I think this is a most unfortunate procedure.  We have only just dealt with a Bill which is designed apparently to do away with the rights of certain private individuals against a company.  The Minister made a very able defence of that position, but I do not know that he did away with the query in some of our minds as to whether it was really necessary to invoke the powers of this House in order that private individuals should not exercise certain rights which they had.  Following that Bill on the Agenda, we have an Order which, I suggest&mdash;I do not say it was brought in for the purpose&mdash; prevents certain individuals from taking steps which they might think they were entitled to take.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying: let justice be done though the heavens fall, and I would much have preferred that this State should have been &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; for a certain sum or sums which we might consider unjust in order that the rights of a private individual should be preserved.  When the Russian Government years ago were floating a loan on the London market, they used to put on it: &ldquo;Free from all Government taxes, present and <Col N="1694" /> future.&rdquo;  That guarantee was given by the Russian Government.  If we are to continue much longer like this and have many more of these Emergency Orders, I think we shall have to have some sort of statement by the Minister for Finance or certain other members of the Government to the effect that they will not pounce on a company and do away with anybody's rights.  Even from that aspect alone, I think this Order is most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I should like the Minister to deal, because it is the whole kernel of the position. Why is this company so sacred, and why is it so necessary to preserve it?  It is a steel company, but any expenditure which will be incurred&mdash;and presumably very substantial expenditure will have to be incurred&mdash;will be incurred at the top of the market or very near it.  Does the Minister see any prospect of being able to get ample supplies of coke for its furnaces, and billets and pig-iron for conversion into steel?  If the Minister is relying on the stocks of steel in the country at present, I should not be at all surprised if he got an unpleasant awakening, because scrap iron, which before the war nobody would look at, and which was simply shipped across the water to be again turned into steel, has now been turned into steel over and over again by anybody who thought he could get a turn out of a rod or sheet of iron.  It is only the other day that I made inquiries as to what a certain man was doing with very small pieces of steel.  I was told that they were going into the manufacture of studs for the boots of soldiers.  If that scrap of steel is not beneath the notice of a person who is looking for a piece of those dimensions, it is not likely that furnaces will last very long on the stock of steel in this country.  If the Minister could get steel in here, it would be very valuable; but, when he is replying, I should like him to give us some assurance on that point, because a most extraordinary procedure has been adopted, and the question is: will the end justify the means?</P>

      <P>I am only concerned in <Col N="1695" /> this matter so far as it gives the Minister an opportunity to let us know what hopes there are of getting those furnaces completed and the steel factory going.  The agricultural community are at present breaking up the old gates and taking them to the forge to get shoes for their horses.  There is no shoeing iron in the country&mdash;at least, very little of it finds its way into the forges of the rural smiths.  One of the jobs of this industry was to be the smelting down of scrap iron and steel for the purpose of converting them into workable iron and steel.  I do not agree with Deputy Dockrell.  I think that there is plenty of scrap steel and iron to bring us right through the emergency if those furnaces were completed and this factory set going.  I think that the keeping intact of the factory for that purpose is complete justification for any kind of emergency Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My anxiety is to know when the new company intend to get a move on in that direction and when the agricultural community can expect to see that scrap turned into workable iron and steel.  The situation is serious at present and is getting more serious every day.  We who have to put horses on the roads to do work which was formerly done by lorries know the difficulties and the seriousness of the situation. I consider that the keeping of that factory intact was absolutely necessary for that purpose alone.  I am looking forward to a statement from the Minister as to when we can hope to see those furnaces completed.  I know that the necessary technical skill for converting scrap iron and steel into workable iron and steel is in the country.  The necessary expert advice is there and the experts are there to do the work&mdash;men who did it previously and who are prepared to carry on here.  My anxiety is to see the work going ahead and to learn when the members of the agricultural community can hope to get horse-shoe iron and stuff of that description out of the factory.  If we have to put our horses off the roads and out of the fields, it will mean that there will be a more serious position regarding kerosene <Col N="1696" /> and petrol.  When the Minister is replying, I hope he will state what hopes there are of carrying out the original purpose of the factory, which was self-sufficiency in iron and steel so far as practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in intervening in the debate is to bring to the Minister's notice the position of the people of the rural areas in connection with horse-shoes.  The blacksmith who shoes my horses has told me definitely that he cannot procure any more iron, and that I shall have to send iron to the forge before he can shoe my horses. That will apply to all his customers. The iron is simply not there.  There never has been a great deal of iron, capable of conversion into horse-shoes around a farmer's place, and there is not much now.  I do not know the merits or demerits of the Emergency Order under discussion except in so far as I have heard the arguments here.  Therefore, I leave the debate on that question to people who know more about it than I do.</P>
      <P>I have searched every hardware shop in my town and in other towns to get a couple of beet sprongs, and I have been unable to procure them because there is no steel suitable for the making of them.  The ordinary sprong seems to be available, but the beet sprong cannot be obtained.  That is the position so far as I am concerned, and I know that other people are in the same position.  It seems very peculiar that we are not able to get implements to harvest a crop which the country so badly needs.  I do not know whether this matter has been brought to the Minister's attention or not, but I take this opportunity of mentioning the shortage of iron for horse-shoes and for implements which are wanted about a farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy is moving to annul an Emergency Powers Order made by the Government.  His objection to that Order was more theoretical than real.  I have got to deal with realities.  One of the realities I have got to deal with is the shortage of steel.  There may be theoretical objections to trying to meet that difficulty in the particular way decided upon by the Government, but the reiteration of these theoretical objections does not minimise the reality of the problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asks what circumstances connected with the emergency justify the Government in dealing with this matter under the Emergency Powers Act.  Deputy Corry and Deputy Curran have both answered him.  It is a vital matter for this country to get some supplies of steel bars and sheets for the production of agricultural instruments and for other essential purposes.  There is only one steel mill in this country.  Deputy Mulcahy objects to the Government interfering with the affairs of a private firm.  The Government would not normally think of doing so.  But here is a steel mill partially completed&mdash;the only one in the country. There is no possibility of getting fresh supplies of steel from any other part of the earth except from Haulbowline. Steel is an essential implement of war.  All the great steel-producing countries are at war.  All these countries need the full output of their steel mills for their own purposes and they have none to spare for us.  It is quite useless to hope that there will be any importation of steel bars, steel sheets, or any products of steel from any other countries.  There will be no more steel until the end of the war, unless we can get this mill going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me tell you the circumstances under which the Government found it necessary to intervene in this matter at all.  A private company was <Col N="1698" /> formed, financed by private money, to establish a steel mill in this country. They decided to locate it at Haulbowline in County Cork.  They ordered plant for that mill, they proceeded with the construction of the necessary buildings and the erection of such plant as had been delivered to them, and they were half-way through the process of completing that mill when the war started.  A large part of the plant they required was on order in Germany, and the day the war started it became impracticable for them to obtain that.  They proceeded to continue in operation upon the basis of imported steel billets.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain that the process of steel production can be divided into two parts.  The first process is the production of billets from iron ore or from scrap steel, and the second process is the manufacture from these billets of steel bars or steel sheets, which constitute in themselves the raw material of other industrial undertakings.  The merchant mill, the portion of the plant capable of producing steel bars from billets, had been completed at Haulbowline and, in fact, came into production some time about the date on which the war began.  The billets which were being rolled in that mill were procured for a time from Belgium and, when that source of supply dried up, from the United States of America.  They cannot be procured now.  Some substantial quantity of billets was purchased in America by the Government after this company had ceased operations, and of that quantity which was purchased, or at any rate upon which options had been taken, a proportion was brought over here before they shut down all export of these things. The balance is still in the United States and will stay there.</P>
    <P>This company, starting under these inauspicious auspices, finding itself unable to make a large part of the total capital invested in the enterprise remunerative, because it was represented by partly completed furnaces and partly erected machinery, faced with the very rapidly rising cost of <Col N="1699" /> billets and an obligation to import them as they could, in circumstances entirely different from those which would operate in normal times, found itself in financial difficulties and finally went into liquidation.  The company had been financed, as I said, by private capital partially subscribed in the form of ordinary share capital and partially provided on debentures.  The total nominal value of the debentures issued by the company was £250,000. The debenture holders, finding that the company was unable to pay the interest due on the debentures, and fearing that other unsecured creditors might forestall them, decided to take action to protect their own interests and appointed a receiver.  The works ceased operations.  The receiver endeavoured for a long time to dispose of the property of the company as all going concern, and various efforts were made by me and by other members of the House&mdash;Deputy Corry, Deputy Cosgrave and certain other Cork Deputies&mdash;to get together a group of people who would be prepared to put up the money to buy the enterprise from the receiver who was endeavouring to sell it, and it could have been bought for a comparatively small sum.  But all these efforts in that regard were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>The alternative course which would ordinarily be taken by a receiver in such circumstances would be to break up the concern and sell all the assets separately at a break-up sale.  Clearly if that had happened the prospect of getting this mill into production again during the war would have been nil. The Government decided not to let that happen if they could prevent it. But the powers of the Government to intervene in the affairs of a private company of that kind were limited.  We could undoubtedly, under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts, give them financial assistance, and eventually, on the basis of an application from the company, the Government did offer to guarantee a loan under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts amounting to £200,000, subject to conditions.  The Government naturally insisted upon <Col N="1700" /> conditions which were considered necessary to protect the interests of the taxpayers who would have to find the money in the event of the enterprise failing again.  These conditions were simple.  First of all we required that the board of the company should be nominated by the Government while any portion of the loan guaranteed by the Government remained outstanding. Secondly, we required that the company should get the consent of the debenture holders, of the shareholders, and of all the unsecured creditors; because it is quite obvious that if the consent of the unsecured creditors to the proposed arrangement was not obtained the whole development could be arrested, the whole project could be brought to naught by anyone of those creditors taking the course of action which would be open to him in the courts to secure the payment of whatever amount of money he claimed was due to him.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal in relation to these unsecured creditors was reasonable.  We suggested that they should agree to accept a third debenture on the assets of the company in discharge of their claims against the company.  There was a first debenture which had been issued when the company was established.  There was a second debenture created in this way. When the Government undertook to guarantee a loan of £200,000 on debentures it desired that its claims should have priority over other claims on the assets of the undertaking.  There was, however, a prior claim in the case of the holders of first debentures, but the holders of the first debentures agreed to surrender that position of priority in respect of half their claim.  Consequently, under the arrangement contemplated by the Government, there would be a first claim on the company, representative of half the original debentures, and of the Government guaranteed debentures, a second claim representative of half the original debentures, and we proposed that there should be a third claim, in the form of a third debenture, issued to the unsecured creditors, in discharge of their claims.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> Now, the process of getting the consent of each individual debenture-holder, and of each individual shareholder, and of each individual claimant of any kind against the company, so far as they were known, was a colossal one.  The great majority of the claimants against the company&mdash;those who were creditors for substantial amounts&mdash;accepted the Government's proposal, but because of a certain difficulty in determining the identity of all the people who had claims, and because a few individual claimants stood out, the whole project was not merely delayed for a very considerable period&mdash;a period during which the question of the Government taking action to restart these mills was raised frequently here in the Dáil&mdash;but it seemed that the whole project was likely to be nullified.  Therefore, the Government made an Order postponing the claims of those who had refused to accept the offer of a third debenture, and that postponement was to last for the duration of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Now, let it be quite clear that no hardship of any kind whatsoever was inflicted on any of these individuals. The company against which they had a claim had gone into liquidation; the holders of the first debentures, secured upon the assets of that company, had appointed a receiver.  The receiver had failed, in any effort he made, to sell the concern as a going concern, for an amount equal even to a fraction of the claims of the first debenture holders. There was not the slightest prospect of the assets of the concern, if sold separately at a break-up sale, yielding more than sufficient to meet the claims of the first debenture holders&mdash;if, in fact, they would meet so much.  Therefore the chance of the unsecured creditors getting even a penny on their original claims at any time was practically nil.  There was also the question that if we were prepared to put new money into the enterprise, these people would still have a live claim and could hold up the scheme, and we felt that it was unreasonable that they should be put in such a position, and that we would not be justified in risking public money for that purpose: that if there <Col N="1702" /> were to be any risk, the only risk should be that, as a result of it, the public need of getting this mill restarted and producing the iron bars and sheets required was likely to be met in consequence.  That is why this Order was made.</P>
    <P>Now, I have been asked, what are the prospects of getting the enterprise going again?  I, honestly, cannot answer that.  The position is that it is possible to equip the mill so as to enable it to operate entirely upon scrap steel, and, if that possibility can be realised, then our most pressing problems in relation to steel will have been solved for the duration of the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But whether we can get the equipment necessary to complete the furnaces and to get the mill into production upon scrap steel, I cannot say.  The board which have been appointed think that they will be able to do so, but even if they are successful, on the basis of their most optimistic expectations, it will be a matter of from nine to 12 months before the construction of the works can be completed and production, upon the basis of scrap steel, begun.  I might mention, however, that after the company had gone into liquidation and the mills had ceased operating, the Government, realising the difficulties that the future was likely to bring, and hoping that an arrangement would be possible which would enable these mills to be made productive again, stepped in, itself, into the American market, and bought steel billets.  We bought these steel billets and held them&mdash;at least, we purchased the billets on option and held them in America: first of all, until we could get shipping to bring them here, and secondly, until there was some immediate prospect of the Haulbowline Mills commencing operations again.  A quantity of some thousands of tons of billets was, in fact, shipped, and then the export of steel billets from the United States was stopped by the American Government.  Another quantity <Col N="1703" /> of steel billets was secured from a wreck which went ashore off the Donegal coast, and these billets are also at Haulbowline.  There are also some thousands of tons of steel rails which can be used as raw material.</P>
      <P>The position, therefore, is that even if the project of the completion of the furnaces cannot be proceeded with, it will still be possible to restart the merchant mill and keep it going for a time upon the basis of the raw-material that is there.  The board decided&mdash;and, I think, rightly decided&mdash; not to restart the operation of the merchant mill until they had reached a decision as to the possibility of being able to complete the furnaces, because, clearly, if they were preparing their plans on the assumption of continued operation for an indefinite period, they would proceed upon a somewhat different basis, both in the matter of the recruitment of staff and of the contracts they would make with skilled personnel and other matters of that kind, from that upon which they would proceed if they were merely contemplating a short period of operation, and then finally to stop.  The position is that the company have now reached a decision to proceed with the construction of the furnaces and the full development of the mill originally contemplated. They may fall down on that job by reason of inability to get the necessary equipment from abroad. Some part of the equipment can be procured here, and perhaps some improvisation may be possible with the equipment that is already available. Nevertheless, the whole project may fail to mature by reason of difficulties in securing equipment.  On that account, they will, at some date, be in a position to restart the merchant mill so as to utilise the available supplies of billets, aiming, no doubt, to time that so that the date of exhaustion of the existing supply of material will coincide with the date of the production of new material for the merchant mill from the completed furnaces.</P>

The point is, the nomination of the board of this company is done by the Government by reason of the fact that the shareholders of the company met and unanimously decided to alter their articles of association to provide that the directors of the company would be nominated by the Government.  That is the power under which it has been done.  The provision of the trade loan guarantee was made in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Loan <Col N="1706" /> Guarantee Acts.  The making of this Order was merely intended to secure that the whole project would not be brought to naught because a small number of unimportant creditors have failed to comply in any reasonable time with the request made by the Government, namely, that these unsecured creditors would accept a third debenture in full discharge of their claims.  I cannot say what number of persons is concerned or what is the total amount involved, but it is insignificant in relation to the total claims of all the unsecured creditors. In fact, one unsecured creditor alone had a claim for, I think, almost 80 per cent. of the total amount due by the company.  He accepted the Government's terms and so did all the other large creditors.</P>

      <P>The principal question put to the Minister was what was the Government's authority for the steps they have taken.  What is the Minister's answer?  &ldquo;Because the Government was asked by the proprietors and the shareholders.&rdquo;  Is that given seriously in this Parliament as an adequate and as a reasonable reason? The Minister started off to tell us that the Government stepped in to prevent a catastrophe, that the Government stepped in to prevent the complete closing down of this mill.</P>

      <P>It is still closed down.  The extent of the production that can be expected is represented by the steel that may be turned out at some time in the future from the billets brought in from America by the Government&mdash;how much or how little, we do not know; whether it would represent a month's or six months' work in the factory, we do not know. Except for that, and some miracle&mdash; I think the Minister almost put it in these words himself&mdash;that will enable them, in the emergency, to complete that part of the factory which it is necessary to complete in order to produce steel from scrap, there is no hope of production.  That is a very poor prospect.</P>

      <P>The Minister gets heated.  He usually does when he has a very bad case.  He has a very bad case here and he gets heated because he is asked to give the House, that will have to undertake the responsibility for whatever finance is necessary in connection with this matter, an explanation.  That is the full measure of this resolution.  The Minister is asked why the Government took certain steps in connection with this industry.  He is asked to explain the reason for taking those steps.  He is asked to explain what money is involved. He is asked to explain what rights or securities are being taken away from the people who put up the money originally to start this factory. He is asked when this factory, which was taken over to be put into production, will be put into production.  He says he does not know.  He says the company does not know.  He says there is a possibility&mdash;and I think the Minister could not be expected to say more than that&mdash;that the factory may be so equipped during the emergency as to be able to produce steel from scrap.  Is not that information that this House is entitled to get?  Are not these questions that the House is entitled to ask?</P>
      <P>The Minister heard from Deputy Corry and from Deputy Curran what he could have heard from every Deputy in touch with rural areas.  It is very little consolation, either to Deputy Corry, Deputy Curran, or to any farmer or blacksmith, to be told by the Minister's reply that we have a quantity of steel which was got from America and that it may, at some time, be put into the furnaces, with some remote possibility later, during the emergency, that we may be able to equip the factory to turn out steel bars or steel plates from scrap.  I am not in a position to say the amount of scrap available, but, from the disclosures that were made&mdash;or rather extracted&mdash;in the House, whatever suitable scrap there was in the country, there is not as much as might have been available.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that he has to deal with realities. I welcome and I appreciate Deputy Hickey's remarks in which he said that if he were dealing with realities he would not be waiting until July 1942 to deal with steel.  The Minister stated that the mill was closed down 12 months before that.  Were there no realities to be faced before July 1941 with regard to steel?  It is because we want to make the Minister face realities that we protest against the method adopted in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the Minister dealing with it in an Emergency Order.  We have not the power to prevent him doing so if he could get the support of the House.  A question of this kind should not have been dealt with by an Emergency Order before the House got the fullest particulars with regard to the possible effect on their rights on the one hand, and the actual work to be done by the Minister on the other hand, in facing the realities of the situation connected with steel production.  Although this <Col N="1712" /> mill was shut, as the Minister admits, 12 months before making the Order, it is only now, in reply to a motion that was put down some weeks, if not months ago, that we are getting information, but how little information. The realities of the situation are the one thing that must be faced.  One of the realities is the presence of this House, and the help that it could be in directing public affairs, as well as the responsibility of this House for safeguarding the proper carrying on of public affairs.  If we confine ourselves to the production of steel I want to ask whether any of the directors appointed to the new company have any experience of the business.  I asked for some information as to what experts still remain with the company that are able to carry on, but we got no information with regard to that. We got the information that a certain class of work could be done, that there are rails and billets available, as well as the whole machinery of the mill to get these processed into steel.  But that is not going to be done until the problematical question of the setting up of the furnaces to deal with scrap has been fully investigated.  How long was that under investigation before the order was issued in July last?  Has it been under investigation since, and what progress has been made with it? The Minister threw up his hands regarding the giving of any information or of any hope&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that decisions had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When?  I take it that when a decision was made there was plenty of time for consultation and review of the situation, but he has told us nothing of the review that took place before a decision was made, or that there was any hope that there would be any achievement in building up the furnaces.  In the meantime, in spite of what Deputy Corry has said about the horse-shoes and steel required for various things, the raw materials for the manufacture of steel are to be held at Haulbowline for a further period, so that the better staffing required as well as contracts with <Col N="1713" /> regard to people to be employed might be made.  I think the Minister indicated that it would take from nine to 12 months before we could have any results from some of the decisions taken.  I wonder if this is an emergency proposal at all, or for what purpose related to emergency this Order has been issued.  On the face of what the Minister has told us tonight, we can get no immediate purpose related to the present emergency, and this mill is not likely to do anything to help the present emergency inside the next 12 months.  I do not think that in this short and unsatisfactory way of drawing information from the Minister, we can be satisfied to leave the situation as it is.</P>
      <P>I welcome the help of Deputy Corry and of other Deputies in getting more information with regard to the realities of the situation.  I think it is a shocking thing, in an emergency such as the present, which the Minister admits he is faced with, that dark chamber work of this kind should be done, and the facts not put before this House.  More than the rights of those who have contracts with Irish Steel, and of those who are owed wages, salaries or commissions by Irish Steel are being wiped out by this procedure, because the rights of this House, and the rights of the people to be served by this House by the doing of its work in a proper way, are being taken away.  If they are being taken away in a matter in connection with Irish Steel, it is a very nice precedent for having them taken away in other ways as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> It is because of that and of the realities of the present situation, that I raise this question, and that I oppose this Order.  The Minister has said that, if the Order is annulled, this factory goes, and that we are going to get no production.  Does he take us to be children?  The Minister has responsibilities to this House, and this House has its responsibilities.  If the Minister does not stand up to his work and face the realities that he speaks about, if he does not accept his responsibilities and take action suitable to the situation, we cannot rid ourselves as lightly of our responsibilities. The problem that is involved in the provision of steel is one that, as Deputy Hickey indicated, should have been tackled before July, 1942. For months and months before that the people who had interested themselves in the setting up of Irish Steel had been pressing the realities of the situation on the Ministry, but the Minister was not prepared to face the realities until July last.  I condemn in the fullest possible measure the whole approach of the Ministry to this particular matter, and I condemn absolutely the utilisation of an Emergency Powers Order for the purpose of taking action of this kind, particularly for the purpose of endeavouring to keep vital and important information from this House, of preventing the House from exercising its responsibilities with regard to very big parts of Government policy, and very big matters affecting the country's necessities in the present emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Emergency Powers (No. 209) Order, 1942, made by the Government on the 12th August, 1942, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>In doing so I want to make it quite clear that I am not in the least out of sympathy with the purpose behind the Order; rather, in fact, the reverse.  I am in full accord with the idea behind it, and it is merely the method of the Order which I wish to criticise.  The body of my criticism is contained in paragraph 3 (1) (a).  Paragraph 3 gives the Minister power to make an Order known as a Fire-prevention Order, which makes provision for various things, including &ldquo;requiring occupiers of premises to which the Order applies to make and carry out arrangements for the purpose of securing that fires occurring, as a result of attack from the air, at the premises will be immediately detected and combated&rdquo;. In normal times, there are various systems of mechanical detection and combating of fires, but not even the most ardent adherents of those systems would claim that they are completely and absolutely effective in time of war, with the possibility of attacks from the air.  One presumes, therefore, that this Order envisages the detecting and combating of those fires as being done by persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order requires that the occupiers of premises shall make and carry out arrangements for this detecting and combating.  I take it that the words &ldquo;make and carry out arrangements&rdquo; mean, in fact, that one must have those necessary persons, that one must have them trained that one must have them instructed on what to do under the various circumstances, and that, in order to comply with an Order requiring the making and carrying out of arrangements, it is not sufficient simply to say: &ldquo;A, B, and C will do this, and X, Y and Z will do that.&rdquo; That, at all events, is not my interpretation of what is intended there. <Col N="1717" /> Therefore, in my view, this Order calls on the occupiers of premises to do something which they are unable to do, because it calls on them to have persons trained in the detecting and combating of fires, but it gives them no power to make the necessary persons available for this work.  It seems to me, therefore, that the Order becomes unworkable.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, in raising this point, I am raising a major matter, possibly, and that is the question of the compulsory use of persons to carry out duties during a time of emergency in this country.  But arguing for or against that is not my function.  It is a matter which the Government must consider for itself; it must make up its own mind what it wants to do, and proceed to do it.  My only purpose in putting down this motion is to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that they have, in my view, made an Order here which is unworkable without that provision, and that, if it is not their view that such a provision should be included, then the Order should be amended in such a way as to make it possible to work it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House yesterday certain criticisms were directed at the organisation of A.R.P. which were not to my mind very reasonable.  The criticism made was not entirely informed.  Deputy Benson has always been most helpful in the development of A.R.P., and I felt sure, when I first saw this motion, that I could actually envisage the line his criticism of the Order would take. While the Order may have, in a certain way, the defects of which Deputy Benson accuses it, I think that the provision which he wishes made should not be attempted until some alternative system is tried out first.  In the early days of the organisation of air-raid precaution measures, arrangements were made by the Department of Defence for facilities for the training of instructors for industrial concerns with a view to the subsequent organisation by these instructors of <Col N="1718" /> air-raid precaution schemes in the firms or in the businesses with which they were concerned.  The first item in all these schemes was fire fighting and fire prevention.  At the same time, we urgued all the scheme-making authorities to contact the general public, and to discuss the matter with householders.  We advised them to seek the co-operation of the general public and of business firms for the purpose of providing domestic arrangements within houses and within the premises of firms for fire-fighting equipment.</P>
      <P>As far as dwelling houses are concerned, particularly in the suburban areas in Dublin, I think that very adequate fire prevention equipment has been secured and quite a number of people have been very well trained in fire prevention methods.  This has been brought about by the intensive efforts of the voluntary members of the various A.R.P. organisations.  Many firms in Dublin have on their own initiative and in their own interests provided themselves with adequate fire fighting equipment and have organised inside their own firms quite reasonable fire fighting schemes, fully manned. Nevertheless, it is true that the high civic spirit and intelligence that have been displayed by these people have been very adversely affected by the negligence and want of foresight of a small minority of the citizens.  These people have made no attempt within their firms to provide equipment or to provide and train personnel.  It is therefore necessary that certain Governmental action should be taken to bring all those neglectful and recalcitrant people into line with people who have done their duty and, with this view, Emergency Powers Order No. 209 of 1942 was made on the 12th August, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main features of the Order are&mdash; I am not quoting the text fully, but this is the purpose of the Order&mdash;a Minister may, by Order, make provision for (a) requiring occupiers of premises to make and carry out fire prevention arrangements; (b) such arrangements to be subject to the approval of the appropriate authority; <Col N="1719" /> (c) empowering or requiring occupiers of several premises to make joint arrangements; (d) empowering the appropriate authority to carry out fire prevention arrangements and to recover the expenses from the occupiers of the premises.</P>
    <P>This Order finds its roots in much consideration and in much discussion with the various interests involved. In January, 1941, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and I met representatives of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and other representatives of industry in Leinster House, to discuss the implementation of air-raid precautions measures in industrial concerns.  The following resolution was passed at that meeting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this conference is generally in favour of the development of air-raid precautions in factories and business premises, and agrees that the Government, in default of an adequate response, should take steps to enforce such schemes with equality of financial assistance, subject to any special assistance for essential undertakings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Dáil on the 2nd July, 1941, replying to Deputy Benson, I stated that I did not think any useful purpose would be served at that time by making fire-watching service compulsory.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (5) of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, provides as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall authorise the imposition of...any form of industrial conscription.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly legislation would be necessary to enforce compulsory fire prevention service.  In that month also the Dublin Chamber of Commerce requested the advice of the Chief Superintendent of the Dublin Fire Brigade in connection with the development of fire watching in business premises. Subsequently the Chamber of Commerce arranged for the training of a number of instructors and advised their members to organise fire prevention schemes in blocks or streets. There was a number of discussions between <Col N="1720" /> the Department of Defence and the Chamber of Commerce in regard to putting this scheme into operation and certain arrangements had to be made, such as the provision of identification cards, badges and armlets.  It was also arranged that official recognition would be given to the scheme. The activities of the Chamber of Commerce ceased, however, with the training of the personnel and with the contacting of a number of business firms in each particular block or street affected.  Afterwards we had discussions with the Dublin Corporation as to the best manner in which we could approach the problem and how we could provide the greatest possible service in case of aerial attack. Finally, we evolved the idea of taking a sample block here in the city and planning out a method by which that could be defended so that we would be able to direct the owners of property as to the methods they should adopt in developing their schemes.</P>
    <P>In November, 1941, we met representatives of the various business interests, at a meeting in the Mansion House.  We explained our proposals and they seemed to meet with general agreement in principle.  Then the corporation was authorised to employ an engineer as fire-prevention organiser. He has been appointed since then. From the reports we got from the Dublin Corporation and from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, it became evident to us that satisfactory progress could not be made on a voluntary basis.  Gaps were bound to arise&mdash;and did arise&mdash;in the development of the organisation in various city blocks.  Again, it was known at that time that a draft Compulsory Order was on the stocks and, for the moment, the Dublin Corporation and the Chamber of Commerce took no further steps.  However, in July, 1941, the Department of Defence reported to the Government that discussions with business representatives in Dublin had been held and that a scheme of organisation on a voluntary basis for fire-watching in Dublin had been devised.  It further reported to the Government on the 11th December, 1941.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> In the meantime, it was hoped to put the scheme into operation without compulsion.  At that time the Government got a comprehensive report on all A.R.P. matters, and were informed of our particular line of thought which led us to that particular view.  The Government took a view other than ours in regard to the question of compulsion. They instructed us that special consideration should be given to the question of compulsory fire watching.  In March, after consultation with the various Government Departments concerned, we put proposals to the Government.  These proposals contemplated that business premises in city blocks would provide equipment and trained crews, and that private premises in such blocks would be dealt with on the same basis by the local authority as the ordinary private dwellinghouse.</P>
    <P>The Government directed along these lines; that Emergency Powers Orders should be prepared: (1) an Order by the Government, enabling the Minister for Defence to prescribe the fire-prevention arrangements to be carried out; and (2) an Order by the Minister setting out the actual arrangements to be made.  On the 5th May, 1942, I met a deputation from the Chamber of Commerce, which included Deputies Dockrell and Benson.  In the discussion, their contention was that it was farcical to compel owners of property to provide fire equipment if the Government were not prepared to compel the employees of any particular firm to undertake the work of fire prevention. This raised a rather peculiar Constitutional issue which we could not meet in the Department of Defence.  We made an arrangement whereby the Chamber of Commerce discussed the matter with the Taoiseach and with the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  During that discussion the terms of the draft Ministerial Order were conveyed to the deputation, and the Taoiseach made a statement along the following lines: (1) occupiers of business premises should undoubtedly be required to provide equipment (2) occupiers could look for volunteers from their staffs; (3) if volunteers were not forthcoming an <Col N="1722" /> effort could be made to get the citizens generally to volunteer for a fire-fighting and fire-watching reserve; (4) the reserve's personnel, when trained, could be allocated to business premises where volunteers were lacking among the staffs; (5) the fire prevention Order should not provide for the compulsory provision by occupiers of premises of fire-fighting teams.</P>
    <P>It seems to me&mdash;and I think it seems to Deputy Benson&mdash;that it is reasonable and wise to compel the owners of property in Dublin to provide, within reasonable financial limits, the equipment for fire prevention.  The organiser who was appointed by the Dublin Corporation some months back made a tour of a number of cities which had been subject to bomb and aerial attack.  He spent quite a long period doing this work and making a detailed examination of the effects of aerial attack, the best methods of coping with such attacks, and exactly how far private firms had gone in trying to secure equipment, or, in fact, how far an Order made by another Government had gone in compelling these firms to provide equipment.  I mentioned a while ago that we organised a sample block.  The fire organiser is a qualified and experienced engineer and I have had him examine the sample block.  I am informed by the people who represent the residents in that block that the total cost of the equipment specified by the Chief Superintendent of the Fire Brigade in Dublin for fire prevention work in the block has cost £150.  To my amazement, after a survey of the block, the organiser informed me that the equipment made available for that money compares much more than favourably with the equipment provided by similar firms in the country where tremendously heavy aerial attacks have occurred.</P>
    <P>The Westmoreland Street-D'Olier Street block represents, I suppose, at least £1,000,000 in valuable property, and it does not seem to be an undue demand on the occupiers of the premises there to provide £150 for this equipment.  I am not suggesting that there was any disagreement to provide it: they did it very gladly.  It is a very <Col N="1723" /> little thing to ask the residents in any block of buildings throughout the city, of comparable size, to spend £150 on a very essential and valuable service&mdash;a service which, in my opinion, should be in every such block of buildings, even in normal times and not only in times of emergency.  In the discussion with the Taoiseach, the very same idea was expressed as has been expressed by Deputy Benson to-night.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell suggested during the discussions that the Order should provide that the failure of employees to undergo training should entail loss of employment.  The Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures replied that this would be tantamount to conscription.  The Taoiseach then put the point of view that all that could be expected of the owners of business premises was to ask their staffs to volunteer.  But the employers would be required, under the Order, to provide fire-fighting equipment, and he promised that if it was intended at any time to demand of the various firms concerned that they should provide fire-fighting crews, then he proposed to discuss the matter with them again before he proceeded along these lines.</P>
    <P>The Order was submitted to the Government on the 17th July, 1942, together with the enabling Order. Before the Orders were formally considered by the Government, a draft Ministerial Order was referred to the Chamber of Commerce and agreed to in principle.  On the 12th August, 1942, the Government made an enabling Order; that is Emergency Powers (No. 209) Order, 1942, the terms of which I have already outlined.  The Government also approved the terms of the proposed Ministerial Order. The making of this latter Order has been deferred pending the publication of a handbook of instructions, without which firms would be very much at sea and would not be able to implement the proposals in the Order.</P>
    <P>It is our view in the Department of Defence that it is only by organising fire-watching on a block system that we shall ever be able to produce the <Col N="1724" /> desired results.  We are proposing certain amendments to the Order which will prevent the non-co-operation of the small minority whose refusal voluntarily to co-operate with other firms is endangering the property, not only of those who refuse to conform, but of those who have already built up a very effective fire-fighting organisation. We are not asking very much of firms in the way of providing equipment.  So far as can be visualised by the chief officer of the Dublin Fire Brigade, £150 worth of equipment and certain structural alterations will be considered an effective safeguard.  The engineer in charge of the organisation has pointed out to us that this amount has not been expended over the same area or value of property in England. All these things emphasise my belief that in asking or compelling firms to provide this reasonable amount of equipment, we are not putting an undue burden upon them.</P>
    <P>All that is by way of general explanation and, like the prefaces to George Bernard Shaw's plays, it has occupied much more time than the real kernel of the motion.  To me it seems that the whole purpose of the motion is to express the fears of those moving it as to their inability to create a fire-fighting organisation by voluntary means.  If such should prove to be the case, the Government must take some alternative steps to provide that fire-fighting organisation.  If the Government take such steps, it will mean a very heavy burden on the taxpayer, and that is something which the Government are not anxious to face.  I think that before any such steps are taken by the Government, we should try out the voluntary method.  In view of the fact that the voluntary method by which the A.R.P. organisation generally, its various services, has been built up&mdash;and I do believe it is an outstanding success in all the circumstances&mdash;and in view of the fact that men with no property, men who have no personal concern with property, have volunteered to defend the lives and property of the citizens of Dublin, it would not seem to be too much to expect that men who are deeply concerned with the preservation of the <Col N="1725" /> property and the equipment from which they derive their livelihoods should volunteer to protect that property and equipment.</P>
    <P>From the experience I have had in Dublin with reference to the building up of a volunteer organisation, I think it is not quite hopeless to expect that men who are making a living out of a particular piece of property and the equipment thereon will volunteer for service in defence of what constitutes their livelihood.  If they are so shortsighted, so timid and bashful, as not to be desirous of co-operating with the Government in this matter, then the Government will have to adopt alternative methods.  So far as the present situation is concerned, the alternative methods will have to be on a contractual, paid basis, because men might be paid right up to the time of a blitz and, if not under a contract, they might not turn up to do their duty in time of need.  If we do have, as a substitute for a voluntary organisation, a body which has a contract with the Government, that will impose a tremendous burden on the taxpayer, and that is a thing which the Government will not readily face.</P>
    <P>With regard to conscription, there is nothing that I can say.  The Government have not indicated their desire to impose any kind of conscription. Of course, it would mean legislation. I suggest to Deputy Benson and Deputy Dockrell that we should first try the voluntary method before we proceed to consider any alternative method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the very frank and very fair survey he has given of the conditions existing. At the same time, I rather think his speech has proved our contention.  In reviewing the situation, the Parliamentary Secretary described the position in the suburbs as very satisfactory &mdash;at least that was the effect of his words.  I agree with that.  As one goes through the outskirts of the city, one can observe the little notices &ldquo;stirrup pump here&rdquo;.  They are pretty frequent, and I do not think a person would have to go very far in <Col N="1726" /> the suburbs before finding a house with a stirrup pump.  The rest of the equipment is only buckets, sand and static water, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary might regard the situation in the suburbs as fairly satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In the course of his statement, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to his having calculated the amount of money required to prepare a block for fire-fighting purposes.  He decided that a sum of £150 would prepare such a block to make an effective show in case of a &ldquo;blitz&rdquo;, or, at any rate, a show to the best of their ability, and he suggested that that was not too much to expect of the owners.  I entirely agree with that, and I do not know that either Deputy Benson or I ever contended that the owner should be relieved of the obligation of providing fire-fighting equipment.  We can absolutely agree with the Parliamentary Secretary in that respect.</P>
      <P>It is then necessary to provide the people who will fight the fires.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows perfectly well that the more extensive the premises, the more complicated the training which the employees or fire-fighters require.  In the ordinary house, the only information required is as to the location of the tap and the sand and stirrup-pump, but, in the bigger blocks of property and in industrial premises, there are all sorts of complications, such as turning off the water so that the pressure may not be reduced in certain places, the shutting of certain doors and the opening of other means of access to parts of the building. It is clear that it is only the people intimately connected with these premises who can render any effective service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was also favourably impressed with the report as to the preparations in a neighbouring country as compared with the preparations in some of the blocks in this city.  If that were true some time ago, I am not so sure that it is true at present.  Time marches on, and I doubt if we have progressed as rapidly in respect of fire-fighting as some other countries.  I think we have been told also that incendiary bombs have increased in efficiency and size, <Col N="1727" /> so that if we ever have to face it, I am afraid we may have to face something very much greater than we would have expected some time ago.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary keeps skirting around the main point in this question, namely, that there must be someone to put out a fire.  I think he was under the impression that I was against him in his view as to owners having to provide equipment.  If he thinks that, I should like to make him a present immediately by saying that I consider that occupiers should be compelled to make adequate preparation, and this Order provides for it.  We have heard cases, on the other side, of fires, due to incendiary bombs, in two houses beside each other.  One person put out the fire, but before he could rest on his laurels, he found that his house was in danger from the fire in the house next door.  His house was ultimately destroyed from the fire spreading from the house next door, so that I require no conversion to the Parliamentary Secretary's opinion that owners must provide equipment.</P>
    <P>Now we get down to the question of who is to put the fire out, which is the kernel of the whole matter.  I gathered from the Parliamentary Secretary that his attitude was: &ldquo;I know there will have to be some form of compulsion if it is not done voluntarily, but see what is the best you can do voluntarily, although we know that something will have to be done and that legislation will have to be passed, if there is an emergency.&rdquo;  If that is his attitude, this country is living in a fool's paradise because employees can be trained, and have been trained in a great number of instances, but, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, they could be trained right up to the point of the emergency and could then fade away.  That is the crux of the matter, as has been found across the water.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to adopt the attitude of his colleague who sat beside him a few minutes ago when he said he was a realist.</P>

      <P>No, but the fact that the Minister was a realist does not alter the question whether you are dealing with men or with steel billets. The Parliamentary Secretary shakes his head.  Perhaps he thinks that his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when dealing with such a hard subject as steel billets, has to be a realist, but that when you come down to dealing with men, you can just stick your head in the sand like the ostrich.  If that is his view, I would urge him to get up, to take his head out of the sand, to be a realist and face the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Dockrell in saying that I think the House should be grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the review he gave of the various steps which from time to time have been taken in this matter.  The three of us, the only three in the House who have taken any part in this debate, are all of one mind.  I think there is no question about that.  We all want to see the best possible system produced for the prevention of the destruction of this city by fire, if such is possible.  The only difference between us is on the question of the best way to set about it.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has pinned his faith to the voluntary system.  I think that he has been right to do so&mdash;up to a point. He referred to a sample block in the city and he will, I think, agree with me that, even in that case, it was difficult to get the full co-operation of every person in that block.  As Deputy Dockrell's illustration shows, one very small person&mdash;I do not mean small in stature but occupationally small&mdash;may, by abstaining from full co-operation, nullify all the work put in by all the bigger places around.  It is a well-acknowledged fact, as a result of this war, that unless there is full co-operation by everybody in a block the danger to all is virtually as great as if there were no system at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that I did not argue for compulsory service.  The <Col N="1729" /> Parliamentary Secretary argued on the assumption that I did.  I deliberately refrained from so arguing.  My main argument on this Order was that it was asking something to be done which could not be done.  Whether the proper way of dealing with that position was by imposing compulsory service or whether it could be met by some other method, I left to the Parliamentary Secretary to decide.  It is not my job to make the choice.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spent a good deal of time in discussing the question of the equipment to be provided in a block.  I should like to point out that this Order does not mention one word about equipment, save in paragraph 3 (2), which says that a Fire Prevention Order may set out that occupiers of premises be required to provide proper and adequate sleeping accommodation, bedding, sanitary conveniences and facilities for washing. Is there a reference to equipment there?  Admittedly, the carrying out of the required arrangements may&mdash; and, probably, must&mdash;include the provision of equipment.  But I did not refer to equipment.  The equipment must be provided.  It is essential that there be compulsion in that respect. The only question to be argued, so far as I am concerned, is how that equipment is to be used.  The occupier is compelled to provide equipment and make arrangements for its use.  Having done that, he comes up against a stone wall.</P>
    <P>The arrangements having been made, they may never, in fact, be carried out and the occupiers have no power to see that they are carried out.  During the various conversations to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, it was stated that, if and when the necessity for fire prevention arose, there would be national compulsory service. Surely, that is too late.  There would be no use in having a gang of untrained people coming along to fight a fire.  The probability is that the position would be worse than it would be if they were not there at all.  Surely, the purpose of any Fire Prevention Order should be that the maximum number of suitable persons be trained <Col N="1730" /> in the proper use of the equipment which must be supplied by the occupier.  My only doubt is whether this Order provides the proper method of achieving that object.  The sole purpose of a Fire Prevention Order should be as I have stated, and every person should be compelled to have these arrangements made in such a form that they could be put into operation at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>If I may go back to the opening remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary, he paid tribute&mdash;a well-deserved tribute, I think&mdash;to what has been accomplished in this city already by the voluntary system.  The result has been extraordinarily good.  I have heard of no case in which the persons who would, in time of necessity, be required to do the fire-fighting raised any objection to undertaking such work.  In my own case, at the time that the Chamber of Commerce arranged for these instructional classes to be held at the fire brigade station, I called the male staff together and explained the position to them.  Just as the Parliamentary Secretary explained in his remarks, I told them that it was in their interests that the building which provided their livelihood, as it provided mine, should not be damaged.  I pointed out that it was in their interests to co-operate fully in any system that might be devised for the fighting of fire&mdash;that it was as much their interest as anybody else's to see that no harm should come to the building which provided their livelihood. They all agreed that it was in their interest to protect the building and they all agreed to be trained.  They also agreed that, if necessity arose, they would be formed into teams and perform the necessary watching and so forth.  That was very satisfactory.  I have heard of no case where objection was taken, but there are cases where no arrangements have been made.  The Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me in that.</P>
    <P>Where no preventive or fire-fighting arrangements are made, the premises of other persons may be endangered. My whole purpose in moving this motion was to secure that the best Order for the desired object would be <Col N="1731" /> made.  I suggest that this Order, while going a long way towards providing the necessary powers, imposes on the occupier an obligation which, under certain circumstances, he may be unable to fulfil and thus, presumably, become liable to a penalty.  I suggest that, if he is unable to fulfil the obligation, he should not be put in a position in which he may be subjected to a penalty.  I am not suggesting a <Col N="1732" /> remedy, but I do think that the Parliamentary Secretary should give further consideration to the matter, and see if some different system can be evolved which will satisfy all the interests concerned.  I ask the leave of the House to withdraw the motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.10 p.m. until 3 p.m. Wednesday, 4th November.</P>
