      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that very considerable quantities of iron were taken by the Army from yards in the city which caused the iron available for agricultural purposes to be very scarce and very dear; that the price of iron jumped immediately after the Army secured what supplies were available, with the result that it is costing 10/- to get a horse shod at present and that, in certain districts, there is no iron available at all?</P>

The Deputy will have observed that subsequent to August, 1939, a summary only of the values of imports and exports has been issued.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of the hardship and inconvenience caused to secondary teachers by the payment of their incremental salaries quarterly, and if he will have arrangements made with the Minister for Finance to have their salaries paid monthly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations on behalf of a number of secondary teachers that it would be more convenient if payment of their incremental salaries was made monthly instead of quarterly.  I have inquired into the possibility of doing this, and I find that, owing to the conditions governing these payments, such a change would involve a considerable amount of additional work for which an increase of staff would be required; it would also involve an additional expenditure in the current financial year of over £18,000.  In the circumstances, I regret that it is not possible to adopt the proposed change.</P>
      <P>As the reference to &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; in the last line of the Deputy's question might lead to misunderstanding, I wish to explain that the payments made to secondary teachers by the Department are merely the incremental additions to their salaries based on length of teaching service; the main or basic portion of their salaries is paid by the managers of the schools in which they are employed.  I see no reason why the basic salaries of these teachers should not be paid monthly, and if this is done it should tend to reduce or remove any inconvenience arising from the quarterly payments of their incremental salaries.</P>

The ages of the trees burned ranged from four to 20 years, and in no case, in the years in question, were there any grounds to support a claim for malicious injuries.</P>

With regard to the second part of the question, I am not aware of any change in circumstances which would cause me now to modify the replies given to Deputy Norton on the 19th March, 1941, and to Deputy Davin on the 17th September last, when I indicated that it was not the Government's intention to introduce proposals for a moratorium affecting hire-purchase or other obligations.</P>

      <P>If the position is as you say, Sir, it is a pity we had not a little more information that this Bill was going to be taken to-day.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 2 (1), lines 43 to 45, to delete the words &ldquo;not less than ten years continuous whole-time membership of the board&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;two or more periods (whether continuous or discontinuous) of whole-time membership of the board which amount in the aggregate to not less than ten years and include at least one term of office of five years as a whole-time member of the board,&rdquo; and in line 52 to delete the words &ldquo;the period of his continuous&rdquo;, and in line 53 to delete the words &ldquo;ending on the date of such cesser.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as drafted proposed to permit of the payment of pensions to members of the Electricity Supply Board who had completed ten years' continuous service as such.  During the course of the discussion in Committee it was suggested that the condition prescribed for the receipt of a pension was a bit onerous, and I agreed to reconsider the terms of the appropriate section.  I am now proposing that pensions will be payable to members of the board on retirement who have had ten years' aggregate service as such, subject to two conditions.  One is that, included in the aggregate service, will be at least one period of five years' continuous service, and secondly, that, in the case of a member of the board who has received or may receive a gratuity from the board in respect of the termination <Col N="618" /> of his appointment at the end of a period of service, that period of service will not count in determining the aggregate service.  I think those two amendments, Nos. 2 and 3, go a long way if not the whole way to meet the points raised by members of the Dáil on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 go together.  This does not appear on its face to be a very gracious acceptance of the case that was put to the Minister about a member of the board whose term of office was determined at a particular period and who has received or may receive a gratuity.</P>
      <P>I should like some information as to whether the gratuity was granted in respect of loss of office, rather than in respect of service.  Surely there is a distinction between the two things.  It may be that, in a normal case, a person might be regarded as having been compensated by reason of receiving a gratuity but, if this is to meet the particular case in point and it is intended to cover loss of office rather than service rendered, it does appear a little hard.  In the case in question, the present Ministry considered the person suitable for the board.  He brought to the board a certain amount of experience and, in so far as the termination of his service at that period was concerned, my impression was that the gratuity was intended to compensate for the interruption of his life rather than for the service he rendered. This would, therefore, appear to be a rather ungracious way of dealing with the matter.  It is not a very big issue and it would seem to be advisable in a case of this sort that there should be no cause for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is a case of granting a gratuity and pension in respect of the same period of service.  That is, in fact, what this proposal is.  The individual in question served for a period as a member of the board.  It was decided to terminate his appointment as a member and, in making that decision, to give a gratuity of a year's salary to <Col N="619" /> him for the termination of his appointment. That closed that question.  To give a pension as well in respect of that period would be unduly generous and I doubt very much if it could be justified.  We can defend the proposal to give pensions to members of the board who have had a long period of service, as such, but we could not defend a proposal to give a pension for a period of service in respect of which a gratuity had already been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A gratuity and a pension are granted in the case of quite a number of members of the Defence Forces.  Members of the Civil Service are also paid both, unless I am mistaken. There is nothing unusual in the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are different.  A member of the Defence Forces retires from active service as such at a comparatively early age.  We are proposing to deal here only with men who retire at the age of 60.  They will not be persons who would, normally, be seeking to engage in new occupations or who would be looking for an active career in some other sphere.  What we are giving is a retiring pension.  I do not think that there is a proper analogy between the retirement of a member of the board and the retirement from active service of a member of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The analogy, as the Minister calls it, would not have been made if he had not introduced the question of gratuity and pension. There is a marked distinction between a professional man going into this service at a particular age and an ordinary layman.  The professional man brings to the service the experience of his professional career to date.  He is in a different category from an ordinary layman, who brings nothing to the service but his normal experience.</P>

      <P>In page 4, Section 4, to add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  When the board has prepared a scheme in pursuance of the foregoing sub-section of this section, the board shall, before submitting such scheme to the Minister,&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  make a copy of such scheme available during a period of 21 days for inspection by the employees of the board who would be entitled to receive superannuation benefits under such scheme as so prepared, and</P>
      <P>(b)  give notice to the said employees of such availability for inspection, and</P>

      <P>(d)  make such (if any) alterations in such scheme as the board shall consider to be necessary or desirable having regard to representations so made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> I think that the amendment I propose meets the point Deputy Norton had in mind.  He proposed to provide that the board should prepare a scheme in consultation with representatives of the employees of the board.  My amendment is more elaborate.  It provides for the practical difficulty of determining who are, in fact, the representatives of the employees and it requires the board to make a copy of its scheme available for inspection by its employees, to give notice to the employees of its availability for inspection and to receive and consider any representations made by or on behalf of the employees.  I think that that meets the point Deputy Norton had in mind and provides for the practical difficulty as well.</P>

      <P>The matter raised in this amendment was discussed at some length in Committee.  The purpose of the amendment is to abolish the principle of equal contributions.  I intimated during the discussions in Committee that that was a fundamental part of the Bill so far as the Government were concerned and that we would not, under any circumstances, agree to depart from it.  We think it is not unreasonable to require that the fund to be established under this Bill should be built up by equal contributions from the board and its employees and I stress the undesirability, having regard to the possibility of this scheme being taken as a guide in connection with the preparation of similar schemes by other bodies, of establishing any principle other than that of equal contributions.  I could not agree to accept this amendment under any circumstances.</P>

    <P>It was suggested, in the course of the discussions on the Committee Stage, that a circumstance may arise in which a member of the Manual Workers' Pensions <Col N="623" /> Fund would be promoted to a non-manual post or&mdash;a less likely circumstance&mdash;that a non-manual worker might be transferred to the manual worker category, and that the Bill should contain arrangements to provide for the transfer of the individual from one fund to another, in the event of such circumstances arising.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable that to be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 7 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  In addition to the matters mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, the general employees superannuation scheme shall provide that only continuous service in the employment of the board ending on the date of retirement from that employment on account of age or ill-health shall qualify or be reckonable for superannuation benefits under that scheme, but the said scheme shall also provide that, in the reckoning of such continuous service of any employee, any period of service of such employee in the employment of the board prior to a break after the passing of this Act in that service shall be included if, but only if, either the contributions paid to the said fund by such employee in respect of such period of service remain in the said fund or, where a sum in respect of such contributions or such contributions and interest thereon has been repaid to such employee, such sum is refunded to the said fund, whether with or without interest, but subject to the over-riding limitation that only service prior to such break which would have been so reckonable if such break had not occurred shall be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the provisions of the Bill, as originally introduced, dealt with the possibility of a manual worker leaving the service of the board for the purpose of seeking employment somewhere else if the opportunity were <Col N="624" /> offered to him, and at the same time keeping his claim upon the fund alive in the event of his re-entering the service of the board at a later date.  The Bill provided that, if the worker left the employment of the board to seek employment elsewhere, he could leave his contributions in the fund, and if he re-entered the service of the board at a later date he could get the benefit of that old service in respect of his pension.  The query was put as to why that arrangement was contemplated only in respect of manual workers and as to whether there might not be possibility of the same circumstances arising to affect non-manual workers.  I felt that that was a fair contention and, consequently, I propose in this amendment to enact the same provisions in a case of non-manual workers as are provided in the Bill in the case of manual workers.</P>

      <P>This relates to a matter that was discussed in Committee.  I think it would be true to say that a large part of the discussion in Committee centred around the point raised on this amendment.  We are proposing in the Bill, where an employee of the board deliberately breaks his contract with the board, that is to say, leaves <Col N="625" /> the employment of the board of his own free will&mdash;in such circumstances as would arise, say, in connection with a strike of the board's employees&mdash;that that action by the employees would involve sacrifice of the pension rights acquired up to that date by the employee.  The contention of the Government is that, in providing for pensions to employees on retirement and old age, they are entitled to ask that there should be no wilful disruption of the board's service, the importance of which in the life of the community cannot be exaggerated.  In order to protect the workers against injustice, the Bill provides for the establishment of a tribunal, to which all disputes between the board and its employees can be referred. The decision of the tribunal will be binding upon the board, and in that way the employees are protected against injustice arising out of arbitrary action on the part of their employers. Again, this is a fundamental principle of the Bill, and I could not possibly agree to accept the amendment. It is a matter on which, as I have said, there was discussion at length in Committee and the attitude of the Government was made clear on that occasion.</P>

      <P>One of the matters which I discussed at some length with the representatives of the Trade Union Congress who came to see me in connection with the provisions of this Bill was the procedure to be followed in the establishment of the tribunal to be set up under this Bill.  I think I may say that the amendments appearing in my name are acceptable to the Trade Union Congress.  They, in effect, postpone consideration of the practical difficulties that may arise in securing for the purpose of this tribunal a representative of the board's employees, by providing that the selection of the representative of the employees shall be carried out in accordance with regulations to be made by me and that, in the making of those regulations, I shall consult with and consider the representations made on behalf of the employees.  The position, therefore, is that the tribunal, instead of being as originally proposed in the Bill, will consist of a chairman who will be agreed between the representatives of the board and the representatives of the employees.  In the event of no agreement being possible as to the nomination of the chairman, and only in that event, the chairman will be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understood, the main objections to the form of the tribunal as set out in the original Bill were, first of all, to the appointment of the chairman of the tribunal by the Minister, and secondly to the selection of the representatives of the workers in accordance with a scheme to be prepared by the board.  I am meeting both of those objections.  The chairman of the tribunal will, as I have said, not be appointed by the Minister unless there is a failure to agree between the two parties, and so far as the representative of the workers is concerned we are not proposing to lay down in the Bill how he will be selected.  We are proposing to provide for that in regulations <Col N="628" /> to be made under the Bill, and in making the regulations we will have regard to the representations of the workers.  I informed the deputation of the Trade Union Congress that I proposed to proceed on those lines, and I think it was accepted that that was the only practical course to follow. There will be considerable difficulty in devising machinery to ensure that the person appointed to the tribunal as a representative of the workers will, in fact, be so representative; and it will require some time to prepare that machinery.  It could not be done in time to have inserted in this Bill the detailed provisions, nor do I think that is necessary, as these provisions would have to be quite elaborate and they could be more properly made by regulations, particularly having regard to the fact that experience may show that the regulations may have to be amended, which also could be done by order.  The new tribunal to be established under Section 9 will consist of a chairman, who will be agreed between the parties, a representative of the board, and a representative of the workers, to be chosen in accordance with regulations to be prepared subsequently.</P>

      <P>I am doubtful as to what Deputy Norton has in mind. The effect of amendments Nos. 26 and 27, if accepted, would be to confine the tribunal to matters in dispute arising out of the pensions scheme.  It is a fundamental part of the Bill that if we are going to limit or restrict or penalise in some way the workers' right to strike, we should give them an alternative means of having their grievances adjusted.  This tribunal represents the alternative means.  The Bill provides that any matters affecting wages or conditions of employment, which may be in dispute between the board and the workers, can be referred to this tribunal, which will give a final decision upon them.  It is that provision which Deputy Norton is proposing to delete.  It occurs to me that Deputy Norton's proposal is, in fact, consequential upon an earlier amendment of his to remove the limitation upon the right to strike and I am sure he would agree, if that limitation were to stand, that something should appear here as affording an alternative means of protection to the workers. As the Bill provides that there will be a restriction upon the right to strike, we must ensure that we give to the workers this alternative means of protection, namely, an independent tribunal to decide on any dispute that may arise between them and the board.</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, every superannuation <Col N="631" /> scheme shall provide for every person transferred without pension rights to the service of the board and who would, if he had remained in the service of the urban district councils of Rathmines, Pembroke and Dún Laoghaire until the year 1930, become a pensionable employee of such council in that year, the same or similar pension rights as are or were applicable to the pensionable employees of the said urban district council transferred to the service of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was also raised at an earlier stage in the discussions on this Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to give pension rights to transferred employees who were formerly employed by the Rathmines, Pembroke and Dún Laoghaire Councils and who, at the time of that transfer, did not possess pension rights.  On behalf of these men, a claim has been advanced that, at a subsequent stage, legislation was enacted which enabled the Dublin Borough Council, in which had been amalgamated these smaller councils, to give pensions to their employees, and if these workers had continued in the service of the urban councils and had been transferred from them to the Dublin Borough Council and had remained in the service of the borough Council, they would have become the possessors of pension rights and that, therefore, we should make their service with these councils before their transfer to the board pensionable, as if it had been service with the board itself, although, at the time the service was being rendered, it was not pensionable, nor had the workers concerned any expectation that it would become pensionable. That was the claim I considered, but I decided I could not support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were large numbers who entered the service of the board from employment in which they had no pension rights and I could not see, in equity, that these workers transferred from the Rathmines, Pembroke and Dún Laoghaire Councils had any stronger claims to pensions than the workers <Col N="632" /> transferred from some firm of electrical contractors, and who were recruited into the service of the board because of their specialised knowledge or particular competence.  In this proposal we would be giving the persons concerned preferential treatment, which would appear unfair in relation to the treatment proposed to those other employees of the board who had not got previous service with a local authority.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remember that, as the Bill stands, there are special provisions in respect of transferred employees without pension rights which would entitle them to receive from the board supplementary allowances equal to half the service with the former undertaker.  To that extent transferred employees are being put in a better position than a person who entered the service of the board from the employment of an ordinary commercial firm.  I think that is as far as it is possible to go to meet the claim which has been advanced on their behalf. The men, at the time they were transferred to the service of the board, had no pension rights.  Their employment did not entitle them to claim a pension upon retirement if their employment by these councils had been left undisturbed. From the time they entered the service of the board they will be entitled to a pension on retirement and, in respect of the previous service, we are empowering the board to give them supplemental pensions equivalent to the pension appropriate to half their previous service.</P>

      <P>a consent to pay contributions under that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a person in the employment of the board has signed and deposited with the board such consent as is mentioned in the foregoing <Col N="633" /> sub-section of this section, the board shall, as soon as may be, give to such person a summary in writing of the provisions of this Act in relation to the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  continuity of service with the board so far as concerns manual workers, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the effect of a break in the service of a manual worker and, in particular, the effect of a break due to wilful action which causes or might have caused an interruption in the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity by the board or which impedes or might have impeded the due performance of any of the functions or duties of the board, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the tribunal and the functions thereof.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it was introduced, required that no person should become entitled to pay a contribution or receive a benefit under the manual workers' superannuation scheme unless he had signed and deposited with the board an undertaking that he would not go on strike, but would refer matters in dispute between himself and the board to the tribunal to be established under the Bill.  Objection was taken by the Trade Union Congress to the form of that section and I agreed to meet their objections in the manner proposed in the amendments I am now putting before the Dáil.  It is necessary, as a practical course, to require that the workers shall sign a consent to join the fund.  There must be a formal act by the worker which makes him a member of the fund and it is desirable, as a protection for the workers, that there shall be an obligation on the board to point out to them what membership of the fund involves them in, and that is what my amendments propose to ensure.  Instead of having a formal signing of an undertaking to refer matters in dispute to the tribunal, the Bill now merely requires that the worker shall sign a consent to become a member of the fund and he will, on signing that consent, receive from the board a formal statement of the provisions <Col N="634" /> of the Bill, so that he will know precisely the legal consequences of his act and what might arise in various circumstances in the future.  I gathered from the observation of the Trade Union Congress that they regarded this new proposal as not objectionable, or, at any rate, not open to the same objections as the original section of the Bill, from their point of view.</P>

      <P>(a)  is in the employment of the board at the passing of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(b)  at such passing is not less than 40 years of age, and</P>
      <P>(c)  pays contributions and is entitled to superannuation benefits under a superannuation scheme, and</P>
      <P>(d)  is not a person to whom the next following section applies.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person to whom this section applies retires from the service of the board in such circumstances that he is entitled to a pension under a superannuation scheme and the board is of opinion that, owing to the age of such person at the passing of this Act, such pension is, having regard to all the circumstances, unduly small, it shall be lawful for the board, if they so think fit, to grant and pay to such person (by way of addition to such pension) a supplementary allowance for his life of such amount as the board shall think proper subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of such pension and such supplementary allowance shall not exceed either of the following amounts, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the amount of the pension to which such person would be entitled under the said superannuation <Col N="635" /> scheme if ten years were added to the period of service on which his said pension under that scheme was calculated, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the maximum pension payable under the said superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>It was proposed in the course of the discussion in Committee that the board should be empowered to pay out of its own funds to employees to whom Section 14 does not apply&mdash;Section 14 relates to transferred employees without pension rights&mdash;and who are of such an age that they could not hope to get from this pension fund a reasonable pension on retirement, some supplementary allowance.  I gave consideration to these representations and decided to meet them.  This amendment empowers the board to pay out of its own funds to employees who are aged 40 or over when the Bill becomes law, supplementary pensions not exceeding a maximum equivalent to the addition of ten added years of service in respect of which full contributions have been paid.  The supplementary pensions will be given only when the ordinary pension payable under the scheme to be prepared would, in the board's opinion, be unduly small, and in no case may a supplementary pension be granted of an amount which, when added to the basic pension, would exceed the maximum pension under the appropriate scheme.  I think this amendment meets entirely the points that were raised concerning these aged employees during the course of the discussion in Committee.</P>

    <P>This relates to the persons covered in Section 14, to which I have already referred, that is, transferred employees without pension rights. Section 14 permits the board to pay allowances to such persons, the allowance not to exceed three-eighths of the average annual rate of the salary or wages paid by the board during the three years before his retirement.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill deals solely with housing grants which are payable to private persons and public utility societies and it does not refer at all to housing grants which are paid to public authorities.  The Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1932 made provision for grants to private persons and public utility societies for the building and reconstruction of dwelling-houses.  The aggregate amount of the grants under the Principal Act was fixed originally at £700,000 and, to qualify for grants, houses were required to be erected or reconstructed before the 1st April, 1935. By further amending Acts, the limiting date was ultimately extended to the 1st April, 1942 in the case of houses erected or reconstructed in the rural areas while the provision for grants was increased to £3,500,000.  The primary <Col N="637" /> purpose of the present Bill is to extend the period for the erection or reconstruction of houses under the Bill to the 1st April, 1943.  The House may be interested in the figures for the number of new houses completed or reconstructed by private persons and public utility societies under the 1932 Act as amended.</P>
      <P>These, up to the 31st March last, numbered, for new houses in urban areas, 10,901; for new houses in rural areas, 21,796; for houses reconstructed in rural areas, 28,602, making a total of 61,299 houses which were built or reconstructed under the Act of 1932.  Of the 21,796 houses thus built in rural areas, 9,446 houses were provided for farmers with a valuation up to and not exceeding £15; 2,062 for farmers with a valuation from £15 to £25, and 3,253 houses for agricultural labourers; 7,055 for persons outside these categories.  I should like to say that these figures take no account of new houses built under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts or under the Land Commission.  Of the 28,602 houses that were reconstructed, 26,298 houses were reconstructed by farmers with a valuation not exceeding £25, and 2,304 were reconstructed by agricultural labourers.  Out of the £3,500,000 originally authorised for grants, there remained at the 31st March last a sum of £128,219 unallocated and this amount is likely to meet all applications for grants in the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come now to the specific provisions in the Bill: Section 2 of the measure will enable grants to be paid for new and reconstructed houses completed after the 31st March last and before the 1st April, 1943.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for the appropriation of certain houses for the accommodation of persons whose homes have been injured by aerial bombing or by the landing or falling of any foreign aircraft or by mines.  Last year, the House will recollect, it was necessary for the Corporation of Dublin to transfer persons from houses injured in the North Strand bombing and to use for the purpose of accommodating them new houses which had been built for the accommodation of the working classes.  In the letting of such houses <Col N="638" /> the corporation must comply with certain statutory provisions.  Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Bill will waive these conditions should it again become necessary to provide emergency accommodation arising out of such disasters as I have described.  Sub-section 4 (a) of the section provides for a like waiver in the case of houses built under the Labourers Act, subject, however, to the condition that a house let under the circumstances contemplated by the section shall not be capable of being purchased under the Labourers Act, 1936, by the tenant to whom it is let in this particular instance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is intended to validate certain grants paid or allocated in respect of the erection or reconstruction of houses to persons carrying on the trade of small shopkeeper. The Labourers Act of 1919 extended the definition of the expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; so as to include any person not working for hire but working in a rural district at some trade or handicraft, without employing any persons except members of his own family.  It was a condition that the trade should be associated with a handicraft and it did not therefore include that of shopkeeper.  In administering the Act hitherto, the interpretation given to the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; did include in some cases a small shopkeeper and accordingly was wider than a close examination of the law has been found to permit.  The provisions of Section 4 will validate the payment of grants already made to small shopkeepers in these instances and will also permit of the payment of grants where allocations had been made or promised to small shopkeepers in the belief that they were covered by the present Act.  In many instances they entered into commitments on the basis of these promises and undertakings, and the power which is now sought in the Bill is necessary to enable the Department to fulfil the undertakings which were then given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of housing facilities as outlined by the Minister is welcome.  It is quite possible <Col N="639" /> that something more may have to be done by his Department with regard to facilitating people who have had grants allocated to them but who have great difficulty at the present time in getting the permission of his Department to carry on with substitute materials.  I have had a few cases of that kind brought to my notice.  It appeared that some misunderstandings had arisen between the people to whom grants had been made and the Department. People who could not get asbestos slates, for instance, or other materials of that kind, felt that they were being prevented from carrying on the work although they would have been able to get some substitute materials.  Very good work has been done under the 1932 Act and subsequent Acts.  It is possible that the sum of £128,000 indicated by the Minister may be sufficient to cover all the work that can be done having regard to the very limited supply of materials at the present time.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 3, it seems pretty hard to interpret or to know what exactly is meant by sub-section (2) of that section.  Of course that would be a matter really for the Committee Stage but reading the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, in connection with this Bill, one is forced to the conclusion that if, for instance, a person's dwelling happened to be damaged by some of our own aircraft falling on it, even if they were trying to protect our own country, the person whose property had suffered, and who in consequence was deprived of a home, would not be allowed to be transferred to the house of a local authority because the accident or the injury was not caused by foreign aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the provisions of this Bill were considered in connection with the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act or whether the Government's attention was called to this aspect of the matter but that does appear to me to be the situation, that although a person might lose his house, he could not, because the injury was not caused by some foreign aircraft or through some other foreign <Col N="640" /> agency, get the accommodation needed to replace his old home.  The question may have been settled earlier but it does not appear to me that the section covers people who suffer injury in that particular way.  I can also foresee difficulties arising under Section 3, particularly sub-section (2), in cases where houses built for labourers or for certain artisans would be appropriated in this way for the purpose of accommodating people who lost their homes.  I think the Minister will be forced to provide some kind of special letting for that purpose.  If not, the local authority later on may find itself in the position that it cannot get rid of these people as tenants and that there is no machinery to restore to the local authority property which was originally built for other people.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister can justify Section 4 of the Bill with regard to the carrying on of shops.  I know, of course, there has been all over the country evasion of the provisions of the previous Bill under which a shop was not supposed to be carried on in connection with these houses.  It happened that in many cases a shop was carried on; there was no great crime committed and possibly it was a great convenience to the people of the locality when it was carried on in some small way but I wonder whether it will be possible under this new provision to permit a man who is a shopkeeper to have his private residence in a labourer's cottage, to live there and to have his shop somewhere else?  Where you open the door at all you may make it very difficult for local authorities to make selections; in fact you may open the door so far that people will be admitted, whom it was never intended should be admitted, to labourers' cottages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been heralded several times.  The provision for taking over houses for the accommodation of persons who have to leave homes which have been damaged is a new one.  The Bill will probably confer a limited amount of benefit, where materials are available, on farmers and other people, because they will be able <Col N="641" /> to get grants to renovate buildings. That is very satisfactory as far as the rural parts are concerned, but, speaking as a Dublin Deputy, I think the Bill has no interest for Dublin City or County.  The subsidy that was given in Dublin for building was slowly withdrawn.  A builder told the Minister's predecessor that he would prefer if some assistance were given people to purchase houses and, on the strength of that, the subsidy was withdrawn. Assistance was, however, never given for the purchase of houses.  It is almost a joke to suggest that housing could proceed now to any great extent, because no timber has been available for over a year.  For whatever limited supplies of timber are here there are three sections of the community competing: for firewood, with which people can warm themselves; for commercial purposes, and also for the manufacture of charcoal.  I do not know if it would be proper on this section to call attention to the fact that while many people were allowed to cut down firewood, there were not the same facilities for dealing with commercial timber or for the manufacture of charcoal.</P>
      <P>It seems as if the provision for the acquisition of small dwellings has been done away with in Dublin.  Many people built too well and deprived themselves of the benefit of any grant that they might get from public funds. Now that houses are not being built this would seem to be a time for stocktaking, and to ask what the Government's plans are for future supplies. Many of these supplies were subject to customs duties.  As duties have been withdrawn those concerned are anxious about the future.  Will the duties be reimposed when supplies are available? Surely it is not inappropriate to ask the Minister what his plans in that respect are.</P>

      <P>This is not a Bill to amend the Housing Acts.  It merely extends the period during which grants may be given to private individuals or utility societies for houses, and particularly for houses to be finished on 1st April, 1943.  I suggest that the general provision of building supplies will arise more appropriately <Col N="642" /> on the Minister's Estimate which will be before the House at an early date.</P>

I also want to ask the Minister what has become of the report of the housing inquiry which was held some years ago.  There was a question on the Order Paper asking when that report would appear.  It should be an interesting document, having regard to when the inquiry took place and the present position.</P>

      <P>Section 4 gave Deputy Brennan some cause for worry.  I think it will apply to reconstruction <Col N="643" /> grants and not to the provision of dwellings.  I understand that this matter arose out of a case that came before the Public Accounts Committee. I agree with Deputy Brennan that it is very doubtful whether a person carrying on a shop could be regarded as a person suitable for a grant under the section.  When replying I hope the Minister will deal with that aspect. Another difficulty is that there does not appear to be any definition of &ldquo;shop.&rdquo;  I do not know whether such a definition appears in the Principal Act.  If not, it opens up endless possibilities.</P>

      <P>I should like if the provision contained in the Act of 1932 was continued, under which the Minister gave an account of the total number of houses built, the cost in urban and rural areas, and also the number reconstructed in the different counties. The Minister spoke of the power conferred on local authorities by Section 3 of providing temporary accommodation for people as a result of aerial bombing arising out of belligerent action.  I quite sympathise with the purpose of that section, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are people in the country who, while not suffering from actual aerial bombardment, are at least suffering as the result of the acute shortage of housing accommodation. As the law stands, public bodies are precluded in many cases from giving these people the accommodation essential for themselves and their families.  I refer to the order made by the Local Government Department which prevents local authorities from providing housing accommodation for, or even giving a vacant house to, married people who may have seven or eight in family, but who are not eligible for houses because they have taken rooms in houses owned by public authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might consider the point before the Estimate comes along, and allow these authorities a little discretion in the matter of providing accommodation for these people.  It is impossible for these people to get houses at present. With regard to the grant of £40, the Minister is aware that, owing to the high cost of building materials at present, it is impossible to carry out the same amount of work now for £40 as was carried out a few years ago for that sum.  I quite appreciate the difficulty of increasing the grant.  I am one of those who hold the opinion that it is virtually impossible to proceed with the building of houses, or even with the reconstruction of houses, on any large scale, and it is doubtful whether it would be prudent, even if the Department were anxious to give the money, to proceed, in view of the shortage of the right type of material. For that reason, I do not propose to ask the Minister to increase this grant, because it might do more harm than good to proceed, in view of the present shortage.  These matters are important, and I know that they have been a source of worry and uneasiness to members of public boards who are anxious and ready to do what they can to meet the problem to which I have referred, but, as they can be raised on the Estimate, I shall avail of the opportunity to raise them when the Minister's Estimate comes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn has drawn attention to an aspect of the problem to which Deputy Brennan referred <Col N="645" /> when he described for us the difficulties which are impeding the building or reconstruction of houses by private individuals in rural areas at present and wondered whether we could not do something by way of providing substitute materials to encourage the construction of houses by such persons.  We have given a great deal of attention to this question of substitute materials for the construction of dwelling houses, and I must say that I have not yet seen any plan for a house of such materials which would, in my view, provide an attractive house.  Accordingly the degree to which we can go in encouraging people to utilise substitute materials in building houses is, I think, rather limited. If we do give a grant at present and the materials are either unsatisfactory or unsightly, the house, instead of becoming an attractive home, will always remain an eyesore in the countryside and a source of annoyance to the man who occupies it.  At the same time, if there are ingenious persons who can devise acceptable substitutes, we should be very glad to hear of them and to the degree to which they are acceptable, we shall be very anxious to encourage their use, but it is a very difficult problem and one to which, I, at any rate, have not yet seen a satisfactory solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall look into the point Deputy Brennan raised as to Section 3 in reference to the damage which may be done by our own aircraft.  Perhaps we have overlooked it, but on the other hand, it may have been thought that the possibilities of such damage under present conditions are very slight and that it was not necessary to make any special provision for it.  I think that one of our aircraft falling or landing inadvertently is not likely to occasion anything like the damage which would be created, say, by the dropping of a bomb.  However, I shall look into the matter.  I shall also consider the point to which Deputy Brennan drew my attention in relation to the possible need for special agreements of tenancy in connection with these houses, but I think it would be possible to safeguard ourselves in that connection by the regulations which the local <Col N="646" /> authority will make in letting the houses.</P>
    <P>Section 4 was referred to by Deputy Brennan and by Deputy Benson.  I think that in both cases there was a slight misunderstanding of its effect. The purpose of it is not to open a door, but to honour commitments which were entered into before the matter came under the review of the Public Accounts Committee.  The interpretation given to &ldquo;a shop&rdquo; was, I think, unduly wide.  It was held Departmentally to be a trade or handicraft associated with a rural industry.  The Public Accounts Committee drew attention to the action of the Department in this matter, and, as a result of their report, we have examined the legal position more closely and have come to the conclusion that, under the Labourers Act, 1919, a grant could not properly be made for the reconstruction of a shop or a shopkeeper's residence. Prior to that conclusion having been arrived at, grants had been made and undertakings to make grants had been entered into and the purpose of Section 4 is, firstly, to validate the grants already made and, secondly, to permit us in the limited number of cases in which promises of grants have been given, to honour these promises.  When that has been done it will no longer be possible for any person to get a grant under the Labourers Act in respect of the reconstruction of a shop or the provision of a dwellinghouse for the person who happens to be a shopkeeper in a rural area.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be proper for me to deal with the points raised by Deputy Dockrell.  As you, Sir, pointed out, this Bill confines itself solely to the provision of grants for private persons and public utility societies living or operating in rural areas.  Most of Deputy Dockrell's remarks, I think, appertained to housing activities in urban areas.  I am afraid I cannot deal with the question which he put to me as to how timber should be allocated to meet the various needs of the moment, such as for firewood, charcoal, and constructional purposes. Those are questions which, I think, should be addressed to the Minister for <Col N="647" /> Supplies, as I have no control over the allocation of timber.  With regard to questions he raised as to the report of the commission which was set up to inquire into housing conditions and housing activities in Dublin City, I should like to say that that commission was appointed early in 1938.  It sat during 1938 and 1939.  A considerable number of sittings were held, and a great deal of very complicated and highly technical evidence was submitted.  The hearings had not finished when the war broke out, I think.  Since the war broke out most of the members of the commission have been very heavily involved in connection with the emergency provisions which have had to be made to deal with the conditions created by the war situation, and, accordingly, the amount of time which they could give to an examination of the evidence submitted and to preparing a report has been considerably restricted.</P>

Since then a considerable number of changes have taken place, and I have no doubt that when the report is submitted and made available to the public, one of the things we shall have to consider is whether there will not have to be a radical revolution in regard to this matter of housing in the city.</P>

There is an omission there, but it will be quite clear that paragraph (b), in both cases, depended <Col N="649" /> on paragraph (a), where reference is made to paragraphs (d), (g) and (h) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Principal Act.</P>

      <P>Gan amhras, do tháinig feabhas éigin ar an scéal le tamall, acht is fada uaidh bheith i gcaoi shásamhail go fóill, dar liom.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I rith na bliadhna seo thart, ba dheacair ar fad na Sceimeanna Gairm-Oideachais d'oibriú.  Mar gheall ar riachtanais na bhFórsáí Aiteamhail Cosanta agus na gcumann eile do cuireadh ar bun le linn na héigeandála, ní dearnadh na ranga do fhreastal mar ghníthí roimhe sin&mdash;go háirithe sna bailte móra.  Ins na ceanntair <Col N="650" /> tuaithe, níorbh fhurasta do na múinteóirí gléas iomchair d'fhagháil.  Ba dheacair, freisin solas d'fhagháil do sheomraí na rang agus neithe eile d'fhagháil le haghaidh oibre na rang. Mar sin féin, do tháinig beagnach 3,000 de mhéadú ar líon na ndalta&mdash;ó 62,680 i mbliadhain a 1939-40 go dtí 65,618 i mbliadhain a 1940-41.  I dteanta an iomláin sin, do bhí tuairim 900 dalta ag freastal na gcúrsaí éigeantach i gCathair Chorcaighe.  Ins na scoileanna lán-aimsire lae, do bhí an tinnreamh beagnach mar do bhí sé i mbliadhain a 1939-40.</P>
    <P>Ó cuireadh na scoileanna seo ar bun, do bhí líon na ndaltaí ag dul i méid ina bhfurmhór ó bhliadhain go bliadhain, agus do bhítheas ag súil le méadú eile anuraidh, acht nior thárla sin, óir do bhí éileamh mór ar bhuachaillí ó 14 go 17 mbliadhna d'aois sna ceanntair tuaithe mar gheall ar scéimeanna na curadórachta agus na móna.</P>
    <P>Do chuaidh na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais i gcomhar leis na comhairlí paráiste agus le cumainn áiteamhla eile, agus, dá thoradh sin, do tugadh sraith léigheacht i dtaobh stórála bidh agus i dtaobh na neithe dob fhéidir d'úsáid in ionad na n-adhbhar bidh a baintear as an gcruithneacht.  Bhí gach Coiste, nach mór, páirteach sa scéim seo, agus d'éirigh go han-mhaith léi, I dteannta na léigheacht, do hullmhuigheadh leabhairíní chun eólas an scéil do thabhairt do mhná tighe agus dá leithéidí nach mbeadh i ndon na léigheachta do fhreastal.  Níl cuntas cruinn le fághail go fóill faoi'n méid daoine do bhí i láthair ag na léigheachta, acht meastar é do bheith ós cionn nóchad míle.  I gCondae na Gaillimhe, cuir i gcás, do tugadh 117 léigheacht, agus b'é an tinnreamh do bhí ann 4,951.  Is é rud do socruigheadh go mbeadh dhá léigheacht in gach ceanntar tuaithe, agus nach mbeadh ní ba lugha ná ceithre léigheacht i gceanntair na mór-bhailte agus na gcondae-bhuirgí.  I gcondae-bhuirg Chorcaighe do bhí cúig léigheachta sa sraith, agus do bhí an t-éileamh chomh mór agus gur riachtanach gach léigheacht aca sin do thabhairt cúig uair déag.</P>
    <P>Is maith is fiú trácht ar nidh eile do thárla le linn an tseisiúin&mdash;An Coláiste <Col N="651" /> nuadh Eólaideachta Tíoghbhais faoi Choiste Chathrach Bhaile Atha Cliath dá oscailt.  Ins an gColáiste seo atá gach caoi is nuaidhe ar bith le haghaidh tréineála i mBainisteóireacht Institiúd, i gCócaireacht Tighthe Osta agus i mbrainnsi eile d'eólas speisialta nach bhfuil gléas a dteagaisc sa ngnath-scoil.  Ina theannta sin, tá socruighthe gur sa gColáiste seo tréineálfar múinteóirí Tíoghbhais i n-ionad iad do thréineáil i Scoil Chill Mochuda, de bhrígh go raibh an scoil sin gan mórán de na gléasanna nuadha atá riachtanach fá láthair.  Tá foireann eólgasach inneamhail sa gColáiste, agus, do réir gach cosamhlachta, is dóigh líom go n-éireóchaidh go geal leis.</P>
    <P>Tá réidhteach dhá dhéanamh chun go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm, i gCathair Luimnigh, Cuid V d'Acht an Ghairm-Oidis. Daoine óga ar bith atá sa gceanntar agus iad idir cheithre bliadhna déag agus sé bliadhna déag caithfidh siad, do réir Cuid V den Acht, freastal do dhéanamh ar chúrsa speisialta foghluma nuair a stadfaidh siad de fhreastal ar lá-scoil cheaduighthe.  Orduigheann an tAcht gur 180 scoil-uair i n-aghaidh na bliadhna chaitheas bheith i gcúrsa den tsórt seo.  An méid sin scoil-uair coinnte ar an mbliadhain go léir, ní leathtrom ar bith é ar dhaoine óga atá ag obair féin, agus ní trom-ualach ar bith ar lucht a bhfostóidhthe é gidh go gcuireann an tAcht d'fhiachaibh orra sin caoi do thabhairt do na daoine óga chun na gcúrsaí do fhreastal agus gan airgead ar bith do choinneáil as a dtuarastal mar gheall air sin.  Dar ndóigh, tá uaireanna an chúrsa anghairid do na daoine óga nach raibh sé d'ádh ortha obair d'fhagháil, acht is é atá ar aigne againn go ndéanfaí a gcomhairliú chun freastal ar ranganna eile agus chun bheith páirteach i n-oibreacha agus i gcaitheamh aimsire den tsórt atá riachtanach le tréineáil mhaith choirp agus intinne do thabhairt d'aos óg faoi'n tuairim sin d'aois.</P>
    <P>Chun Cuid V den Acht do chur i bhfeidhm i n-áit eile, ba mhór an chúis mhisnigh dúinn an t-eólas do fuarthas mar gheall ar na cúrsaí atá <Col N="652" /> ar siubhal i gCathair Chorcaighe ó bhí bliadhain a 1938 ann.  Ins an mórthuis, is é rud atá sna cúrsaí sin teagasc i gceárdanna do na buachailli agus teagasc i gcócaireacht, i n-obair snáthaide agus i dtíogbhas do na cailíní.  Le n-a chois sin tugtar teagasc  Matamataice, i nGaedhilg agus í mBéarla, agus tá seiplíneach páirt-aimsire ann le haghaidh an teagaisc bhaineas le Creideamh.  Féadann na daltaí, más áil leo é, dul chuig ranganna oidhche mar a dteagasctar ceol, rinncí céilidhe, lúith-chleasa agus drámaidheacht; agus&mdash;de thoradh na coda sóisialta den scéim&mdash;do cuireadh ar bun dráma, roinnt chuirm cheoil, cluithchí agus spóirt bhliadhantamhla. I mbliadhna tá scéim plotanna dhá cur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Cuid de na daltaí do bhíodh ag na cúrsaí éigeantacha páirt-aimsiré d'aistrigh siad, dá ndeóin féin, gó dtí na cúrsaí lán-aimsire lae.  Mar gheall ar an aos óg do ghríosú chun dul chuig na cúrsaí lán-aimsire lae tar éis dóibh an cúrsa éigeantach do chríochnú, tugann an Coiste uaidh scoláireachta íocas na táillí teagaisc agus costas leabhar agus uirléisí ranga. Do ghlac uimhir réasúnta de na daltaí leis an gcaoi seo chun leanamhaint dá n-oideachas.</P>
    <P>B'é bhí ar aigne againn, i dtosach, an dara triail de Chuid V den Acht do dhéanamh i gceanntar tuaithe, acht ina ionad sin do thoghamar ceanntar cathrach ar adhbhair bhaineas go páirteach leis an éigeanndáil atá ann fá láthair.  An chéad adhbhar agus an ceann is mó tábhacht&mdash;daoine óga nach bhfuil acht idir cheithre bliadhna déag agus sé bliadhna déag, is féidir leósan féin cuid mhaith oibre do dhéanamh ar an talamh, agus is riachtanach dúinn gan nidh ar bith do dhéanamh do cuirfeadh bac dá laghad ar sholáthar na n-adhbhar bidh.  An dara fáth&mdash;san am atá i láthair, is géire theastuigheas sé uainn rud éigin do dhéanamh do dhaoine óga na gcathrach atá tar éis an scoil d'fhágaint agus nár éirigh leó obair d'fhagháil.  Féadtar a innsint, ámhthach, go raioh obair fachta ag 49 per cent. de na buachaillí agus ag 27 per cent. de na cailiní do bhí ag freastal na gcúrsá éigeantach i gCorcaigh i mbliadhain a 1940-41.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Atá £5,000 de sholáthar nuadh dhá dhéanamh sna Meastacháin chun Ionaid Tréineála don Aos Óg do chur ar bun i gCathair Bhaile Atha Cliath. Tuigeann gach éinne go bhfuil gádh le scéim éigin chun daoine óga&mdash;go báirithe na buachaillí&mdash;do shábháil ar an dochar cuirp agus intinne éirigheas dóibh le linn iad do bheith i bhfad gan obair.  Mar leigheas air sin, is minic adubhrathas leis an Roinn go mba chóir bliadhain nó dhó eile do chur le haois fhreastail na scoile sa gcathair. Do chuirfeadh sin a thuilleadh costais orainn, dar ndóigh, acht táneithe eile sa scéal taobh amuigh de chostas agus d'oideachas.  Tá ceist economaice ann freisin, agus do measadh nár mhaith riaghail gheinearalta mar siúd do dhéanamh gan féachaint do staid economaiceach gach dreama a mbainfeadh an riaghail leó.  Go fóill, ar chaoi ar bith, do b'fhearr, dar linn, ionaid tréineála don aos óg do chur ar bun i gcuid de na ceanntair is líonmhaire ina bhfuil daoine óga gan obair.</P>
    <P>Ní bheidh freastal na n-ionad seo éigeantach, agus beidh níos mó de shaoirse ionnta ná mar bhíos sna gnáth-scoileanna.  Beidh teagaisc foirmeamhail ar adhbhair oireamhnacha le fagháil ionnta, agus, ina theannta sin, beidh tréineáil bhaineas le ceárdanna áirithe, le cleasa lúth, le siubhlóid agus campáil, agus le ceol agus drámaidheacht.  Go geinearalta, is é is cuspóir dóibh tréineáil shocharách do thabhairt do dhaoine óga i seal dá saoghal ina mbíonn a leithéid ag teastáil uatha go mór, agus, le n-a chois sin, congnamh do thabhairt dóibh le hobair oireamhnach bhuan d'fhagháil. Atá Coiste Gairm-Oidis Cathrach Bhaile Atha Cliath tar éis riarachán na scéime do ghabháil orra féin, agus tá eagrú na scéime dháthaobhadh aca le fó-choiste de dhaoine eólgacha bhíos ag pléidhe le hoibreacha sóisialta den tsórt.  Déanfaidh lucht an fhóchoiste na hionaid d'eagrú dá dtionnscnamh féin, agus ina theannta sin, táthar ag súil go gcuideóchaidh siad le lucht eaglaise agus le cumainn eile oireamhnacha chun a gcuid oibre don aos óg do chur i bhfairsinge agus i bhfeabhas.</P>
    <P>Le tamall bliadhanta, ba léir go raibh gádh le saghas nuadh múinteóir <Col N="654" /> chun an Ghaedhilg do chur ar aghaidh i measc na macaomh agus na ndaoine fástá&mdash;go mór-mhór sna ceanntair tuaithe&mdash;agus do bhí cúrsa speisialta ann anuraidh le múinteóirí den tsaghas sin do thréineáil do na Coisti Gairm-Oideachais.  Triail do b'eadh an cúrsa sin, agus níltear ag brath ceann eile do chur ar bun nó go mbídh eólas deímhin le fagháil i dtaobh oibre na ndaoine do tréineáileadh anuraidh.  Ceithre dhuine dhéag díobh sin, táid ag obair faoi Choistí Gairm-Oideachais cheána féin, agus táthar ag súil go dtiocfaidh deagh-thoradh ar a saothar roimh i bhfad.  Cuirfidh siad i bhfeidhm modhtha nuadha teagaise agus treóracháin trí léigheachta, chonspoidí, chuirmeacha ceóil agus drámaí, féacháil leis an nGaedhilg agus le Gaedhealachas i gooitchinne do chotú i mbeatha shóisialta na gceanntar tuaithe.  Tá sé de chúram speisialta ar dhuine de chigirí na Roinne na múinteoirí nuadha seo do chomhairliú agus do threorú, acht ní féidir éifeacht na scéime do mheas nó go mbídh sí tamall eile i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>An scéim fheabhsuighthe scrúdúchán do na ceárd-scoileanna, tá ag éirghe léi mar do bhí ó thús.  8,914 de ionntrála do fuarthas i mbliadhain a 1936 an chéad bhliadhain dí bheith i bhfeidhm&mdash;acht do fuarthas 17,582 dé íonntrála le haghaidh scrúdúchán na bliadhna seo, 1942.  Agus ní hé amháin gur mhéaduigh líon na n-ionntráil, acht do tháinig feabhas ar obair na n-iarrthóirí.  I mbliadhain a 1936, níor gnóthuigheadh acht 51 per cent. de phasanna, agus do gnóthuigheadh 60 per cent. i mbliadhain a 1941.  Ins an mbliadhain chéadna sin, 1941, do rinneadh clár an scrúdúcháin d'fhairsingiú ionnas gur leigeadh isteach an dá phríomh-bhrainnse de cheird na clódóireachta .i. obair na cumadóireachta agus obair na gcló-inneal.  Nidh eile, tá ag éirghe go sásamhail leis na scrúdúcháin bhaineas le muilneóireacht phlúir.</P>
    <P>Baineann na scrúdúcháin seo na gceárd-scol le daoine bhíos ag freastal ar chúrsaí páirt-aimsire tráthnóna chun eólas d'fhagháil do rachadh i dtairbhe dóibh ina gceárdanna nó ina ngnótha <Col N="655" /> féin, agus, dar ndóigh, ní ag iarraidh teastais d'fhagháil bhíos cuid mhaith aca sin&mdash;go háirithe cuid mhaith de na mná.</P>
    <P>Maidir le lucht na rang lán-aimsire lae&mdash;idir ranga le haghaidh na gceárdagus ranga le haghaidh na tráchtála&mdash; ní hé amhéin go mbíonn scrúdúcháin ag na coistí féin chun a gcuid oibre do mheas, acht cuireann cigirí faoi scrúdú, freisin, í.  Do réir na scéime speisialta cigireachta atá i bhfeidhm fá láthair, déantar mion-scrúdú, gach tríomhadh bliadhain, ar ranga agus ar adhbhair fhoghluma gach scoile lán-aimsire lae. Tá an scéim sin an-shásamhail.  Fáightear cruinn-chunntas iomlán tréimhseamail ar obair na scol dá bárr, agus, ina theannta sin, bíonn comhdháil ann de na múinteóirí agus de na cigirí, tar éis an scrúdúcháin, ionnas go ndéanann siad comhairle le chéile i dtaobh na hoibre.  De thoradh na gcomhdháil sin, táthar ag súil go mbuanóchthar comh-chongnamh caradach idir na múinteóirí agus na cigirí, go gcothóchthar suim i n-ealadhain na múinteóireachta, agus go mairfidh obair na scol ag dul i bhfeabhas.</P>
    <P>Sa seisiún dár gcionn, do bhí dhá chomhdháil idir an árd-chigire agus árd-oifigigh feidhmeacháin na gcoiste, agus, le n-a linn sin, do rinneadh trácht iomlán ar na slighthe éagsamhla ina mbainfidh iarsmaí na héigeandála le heagrú agus riarachán na scéim teagaisc san am atá romhainn.  Do tairgéadh comhairleacha tairbheacha do laghdú caithteachais maidir le hobair agus costais bhóthair na múinteóirí, maidir le damhna oibre do na ranga, agus maidir le soillsiú na scol, le n-a dtéathadh, agus le n-a gcoimeád i n-órdú.  Tá na foirgnimh scoile dhá gcoinneáil i gcóir mhaith. Dar ndóigh, ní dearnadh ach fírbheagán d'fhoirgnimh nuadha taobh amuigh díobh siúd do bhí ar tionnscnamh roimh thús an chogaidh.</P>
    <P>Tá suim bhuan dhá cur i gcoimeád na ngarrdha bhaineas leis na scoileanna tuaithe.  Do cuireadh treóracha speisialta chuig múinteóirí na tuaithéolaidheachta, ionnas go dtabharfaidís congnamh uatha chun síolta glasraí agus a leithéidí do chur ar fagháil i <Col N="656" /> n-aghaidh an ghanntanais, agus do rinne na múinteóirí obair an-tábhachtach ina thaobh sin.  I móráin de na condaethe, tá scéimeanna duais dhá gcur i bhfeidhm chun na daltaí do ghríosú le gáirdíní beaga do bheith aca de chois baile; cuirtear síolta ar fagháil dóibh go saor, no i n-aisce, agus roinntear na duaiscanna tar éis na gáirdíní do scrúdú i ndeireadh an tseisiúin.</P>
    <P>I gColáiste Náisiúnta na hEaladhan, do bhí 519 de dhaltaí ar an rolla&mdash;62 dhalta de bhreis ar uimhir na bliadhna roimhe sin.  I bpéinteóireacht agus i bhFíoghrú go háirithe, do bhí uimhir an-mhór dalta ag iarraidh teagasc d'fhagháil, agus do b'éigean dhá chongantóir breise d'fhostú.  Do ghnóthuigh ocht ndaltaí lán-teastais an Choláiste&mdash;duine amháin ar son pátrúnachta, ceathrar ar son péinteóireachta, agus triúr ar son dealbhadóireachta.</P>
    <P>I n-onóir an chúigeadh comh-dháta fichead de Sheachtmhain na Cásca do bunuigheadh taisbeántas speisialta na Muséum Náisiúnuta, an bhliadhain seo caithte.  Do cuireadh dhá phríomhhalla an Mhuséum ar fagháil le haghaidh na hócáide, agus do taisbeánadh cnuasach do bhí líonmhar agus an-spéiseamhail de neithe staireamhla&mdash;idir an méid do bhí i gCnuasach 1916 cheana agus neithe eile do fuarthas ar iasacht.</P>
    <P>Ní éireóchadh leis an taisbeántas seo chomh maith agus d'éirigh, muna mbeadh an comh-chongnamh do fuarthas ó fhorais phoiblidhe mar Oifig na nOibreach Poiblidhe, agus an Gailearaí Náisiúnta maraon le morán daoine príobháideach.</P>
    <P>O hoscladh an Taisbeántas go hoifigeamhail, i mí an Aibreáin, 1941, do tháinig na sluaighte daoine ghá bhreathnú.  Go mór-mhór do tháinig na céadta de dhaltaí scoile faoi threóir a n-oidí, agus do tháinig buidheanta de shaighdiúirí óga faoi threóir a n-oifigeach.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, ní misde a luadhadh gur cuireadh ar bun fó-thaisbeántas speisialta sa Muséum, i n-onóir an chaogadamhadh comh-dháta de bhás Pharnail.  Do rinneadh sin tré <Col N="657" /> chongnamh ó mhuinntir Pharnail, ó mhuinntir Choláiste na Tríonóide agus ó mhórán daoine eile, agus do chruthuigh an fó-thaisbeántas do bheith an-spéiseamhail ag na céadta daoine do thug cuairt air.</P>

      <P>Discussion on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education generally ranges over the whole field of what might be called the education group.  There is a difficulty in this instance arising from the fact that on the Vote for Primary Education it will be moved that it should be referred back for reconsideration.  There should not be a duplicate discussion, the rule being that a motion to refer back and the Estimate to which it refers should be discussed together.  If it were possible, I think it would be better, should the Committee desire to discuss education generally on the Vote for the Office of the Minister, that the Vote for primary education should be taken separately.  Perhaps Deputy Mulcahy will be good enough to state the specific points on which he desires to refer back the Vote so that consideration of these might be deferred to the discussion on primary education.</P>

      <P>The points upon which I wish to move to refer back the Vote for Primary Education really arise out of the report of the committee of inquiry into the use of Irish as a teaching medium set up by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. But there is one particular aspect of that which I should like to discuss on the Vote for the Office of the Minister as a kind of preliminary to hearing the Minister in a more detailed way on the details of the report itself on the Vote for Primary Education.  Here is a report which has been made following a rather exhaustive inquiry by the primary school teachers, who, over a large part of our educational field, are the people with technical experience; they are the technicians.  They made a report to the Minister, and I think that was given to the Minister about May or July last year.  They had a discussion with the inspectors in January <Col N="658" /> last, but there has been no reaction from the Minister in regard to the technical details of that report.  Certain statements have been put up, certain ideas have been brought forward by those people who are technical experts, people who are interested in the language, and interested in the educational side, but they are left without any guidance or any information as to what the technical experts in the Department of Education, on the one side, and the Minister, from the point of view of policy, on the other side, have to say with regard to the whole business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some slight difficulty as to which problem I should take first.  In regard to the statement which the Minister has made &mdash;with his usual courtesy, he has supplied us with a very fluent English translation, for which I sincerely thank him&mdash;I cannot say that it raises many problems, but it gives an opportunity for raising many problems; I think that comes nearer to a description of the Minister's speech.  Before I address myself to a few outstanding issues of great importance and of great scope, perhaps I might refer at the beginning to a few issues some of which are minor but one of which I regard as of considerable importance.  It was not referred to in the Minister's speech, although one reference which he made to the maintenance of schools brought it forcibly before my mind.  I think the Minister will remember his implication that there was failure on the part of some people&mdash;whether he meant the managers or the local people <Col N="661" /> I need not discuss for the moment&mdash; to play their part fully in the maintenance and heating and cleaning of schools.  I am particularly interested in anything that touches the managerial system in any way.  By an extraordinary stroke of good luck, and possibly historical accident, a system of educational control has been evolved in this country which, whatever may be said against it in theory and in regard to its failure explicitly to recognise certain principles on one side or the other, has worked out remarkably well in practice.  It has saved us a very great deal of the futile and extremely harmful controversies, heated and bitter controversies, that have taken place in most other countries.  Consequently, anything that would seem to me to weaken that position would call for examination and anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one thing the Minister did not think of referring to, but I should like to direct his attention to it.  How long is this panel system going to exist?  I could never understand why the managers agreed to it.  I know, from personal experience, that there is sometimes difficulty in saving the managerial system, even from some managers' zeal.  I cannot look upon an arrangement which allows a manager a choice between two teachers in making an appointment as anything else but an abrogation of the system. I think if the managerial system is to work, there must be a proper, a real choice, and to my mind any financial consideration should be entirely waived aside if it seemed to interfere with the managers in making their choice of duly qualified teachers.  I have known instances in which the manager had either no choice or only a choice between two or three teachers, neither of whom might be satisfactory in his eyes, and I understand from the attitude taken up by the Minister either last week or the week before that he considers the rule absolutely binding.  If so, the panel system is radically bad and I was hoping that in the course of years that have elapsed since this compromise, which seems to me a very unwise compromise, had been made, the need <Col N="662" /> for it would pass away and that, with the diminution which the Minister has brought about in the number of teachers who are trained, the need for keeping on the panel system might no longer exist.  I put it to the Minister that, whatever financial loss might be involved, it would be safer if he now agreed to keep these supernumerary or redundant teachers in employment even at a certain financial sacrifice than what seems to me continuing a system that really undermines the whole arrangement that has worked so marvellously up to the present.  I should not like to run the risk of undermining it.  That is one matter to which I have always attached considerable importance.</P>
    <P>Another matter was raised and I do not know whether we should consider it a minor matter or not&mdash;it was just touched upon by the Minister&mdash;that is, the qualification of a secondary teacher.  I gather that the number of qualified teachers employed in secondary schools is not at all increasing at the rate at which we should expect it to increase.  I do not know what the reason is, but I think that is the fact. With the rise in the numbers attending school, there should be a corresponding or, rather, more than merely an arithmetical proportion of an increase in the number of qualified teachers.</P>
    <P>Connected with that is another matter which I should like to raise. Am I not right in supposing that a secondary teacher may have a degree in classics and that he can be sent to teach mathematics?  Is that not the position?  That was brought rather forcibly before my mind in connection with work, very useful work, inaugurated by, I never know whether it was the Taoiseach or the Chancellor of the University, in connection with co-ordinating the standards of examination, the matriculation examination and the National University Leaving Certificate Examination. When we happened to put on a new period&mdash;it was the mediæval period, and it was only on for one year as it would give place in the next year to another period; it was a period which I thought the people of this country who owe an allegiance to a certain <Col N="663" /> faith, would find particularly appropriate&mdash;I found a large number of the schools nearly collapsed at the idea and a number of the teachers of history, duly recognised in our schools, went straight away to seek advice as to what text books they should read, so as to teach the subject in the coming year.  I cannot look upon that as satisfactory and I gather that the Minister, if I rightly interpret a certain portion of his statement, is giving that his attention.</P>
    <P>I see the difficulty.  There are difficulties in practically any reform or any advance.  Some schools are in the position that they cannot afford to have a special, qualified man in every subject and what happens is that they get one or two teachers qualified in certain subjects and then, when other subjects, which require in fact a great deal of explaining and of ability on the part of the teachers to make them comprehensible to the students, are to be taught, they are thrown on to the teachers in what are looked upon as the essential subjects.  For many schools that may be financially unavoidable. But it is not satisfactory and I wonder whether, even in the case of the bigger schools, proper steps are taken to see that as far as possible satisfactory teachers are found for the subjects.  I am told that a teacher need not be qualified in a given subject; he need not have got a degree in it; he need not have read it in the university.  He is not asked before being sent to teach a subject, to supply any evidence he knows it, or that he is capable of teaching it.  The only check on the capacity of that man to teach the subject is inspection.  I know enough of inspections in secondary schools, and the lack of thoroughness that must go with them, not to be prepared to accept them as a guarantee that the teacher is capable of teaching the subject which he is put to teach. As I say, he need provide no evidence beforehand that he is able to teach it.</P>
    <P>The principal matter to be raised on this Vote is the whole position of Irish in the schools.  Before I embark on the more general discussion, I <Col N="664" /> would like to make a reference to A schools and B schools.  The A schools are those where the teaching medium is Irish, and the B schools those where a great deal of the work is done through Irish, but not all of it.  The Minister gives the number of such schools, but I would like to know the genuine capacity of the teachers to carry through the work, and of the pupils to benefit by it.  I am not objecting to there being a number of A schools and a number of B schools.  On the contrary. But I found at one period that the schools were being unduly pushed on, and this applies to both secondary schools and primary schools.  Some inspectors, in their enthusiasm for the national work&mdash;that is to their credit &mdash;were rather inclined to push on teachers and pupils to work that they could not undertake.  On the whole, that is not sound policy, even from the language point of view.  It would be better to have a number of schools that can do the work properly, rather than to force on some people prematurely to work they cannot do.  It is like a young boy being put into a class that is too high for him: you could not inflict a greater educational wrong on a boy than that.</P>
    <P>I have seen boys who might have developed well in a number of subjects had they been postponed for a year but who, educationally, have been dragging the devil continually by the tail all their lives.  I would like to hear the Minister's definite policy in regard to this point.  On the whole, more good would be done to the language if the Minister toned down a certain amount of the ardour, not of the teachers but of some other people, and particularly of the inspectors.</P>
    <P>The House may remember that last year I made the suggestion that the time had come for an investigation into this whole subject.  I am not at all prepared to accept the alarming statements continually being made about the deleterious effect, educationally, of the teaching of Irish and through Irish.  I remember perfectly well that it was said that these effects showed themselves immediately on the introduction of the system.  How that <Col N="665" /> could be I do not know, because it would be several years before these things came to the attention of the people who saw the bad effects.  The teaching of Irish was introduced to infants and, apparently, it affected their elder brothers ten years earlier. Therefore, it seems likely that that subject has not always been approached with the objectivity which I should like.  Some people condemn the system <i>a priori</i> and then the cry is raised and repeated that facts show that damage has been done.  I do not believe in having too premature an inquiry.  Good results could not have been got out of too early an inquiry, as the system had to be seen working for some years in order to get an idea of the results produced.  However, it is no slur on the Department of Education, and the Minister should not regard it as criticism of the general policy for which he stands, when he is asked now to undertake an inquiry.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to get the proper people for that inquiry.  I made it clear last year that there should not be on it men whose opinion already is made up, men who are identified, even in the public mind, with the policy of the swift promotion of Irish.  There should be on this committee men interested in the welfare of the language. There may be one or two others to put certain points of view before them, which in their enthusiasm they might forget.  On the whole, the duty of the committee would be to investigate whether the charges made are well-founded or not.  Let us take the report to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred. According to it, not merely is the present system harmful to the children, dulling their minds and blighting their lives, but it is harmful also to the language. That requires investigation. The publication by the teachers of this pamphlet, giving the results of the questionnaire they sent out and their various comments on it, makes an inquiry inevitable.  That pamphlet has been published and has been before the members of this House, and in it very serious conclusions are come to, rightly or wrongly, on the basis of the evidence collected with a great deal of care.  I am not saying whether the conclusions are well-founded or not, but they <Col N="666" /> should be investigated.  With that report before him, surely the Minister should have indicated what he intended to do.  He may have what views he likes about the temper of mind in which this investigation was approached, but I do not see how he can ignore it.</P>
    <P>Some definite questions were put to a large number of teachers.  It must be remembered that the teachers concerned were able to do the work which the Department required of them, and also they were teachers who were either highly efficient or efficient.  Their views are summarised in this pamphlet. There is a certain amount of general argumentation on principles in the pamphlet, and, possibly, it might have been better to get the teachers' views apart from the questions of educational theory.  However, it is partly on the strength of such evidence that the conclusions of this committee of the National Teachers' Organisation have been based.  Therefore, I venture to suggest that, in the interests of the language itself, a very carefully selected committee should be set up, not of partisans on either side, but of men of sound commonsense with a knowledge of education and an interest in education and in the formation of the minds of the children, and also with an interest in the revival and the spread of the language.  That committee should be set up without undue delay, and the Minister will make a grave mistake if he does not announce before the conclusion of this Estimate his intention to set it up.  I would insist again that nobody who is committed in one way or another in the eyes of the public to one side or the other should be a member of the committee.</P>
    <P>When I first addressed myself to this question of the promotion of Irish, I confess that I had two main motives in mind.  One was the obvious national motive, but there was also the belief that it would be educationally sound if our people had a second language. Deputies may say: &ldquo;Had they not a number of languages other than Irish?&rdquo;  I never knew about them.  I know there were things called Latin, French and Greek, but if anybody told me I was learning Latin, French or <Col N="667" /> Greek, I should not have believed it. I learned a different set of symbols, but it was English the whole time.  I always thought in English.  I could translate into English a Latin word, whether pronounced or put down in Roman letters, and I could even connect a few Latin words into a bad English sentence, but I am not convinced that I knew Latin.  It was the same way with French.  When I hear people bemoaning the present standard of education, I often wonder whether I am the only person who looks back on his own education.  People say that the present system is most irrational. I wonder if it was rational to read and get off by heart 20 lines of poetry and, two days afterwards, to get off by heart 20 more lines from the same author and the same story, but never to connect the two.  I wonder if it was rational to get off by heart canto after canto of Scott, not having the remotest idea of what the story was about.</P>
    <P>I did hope that, in the Irish language, we might have another real, live language in which the people would think.  I wonder if we are attaining that objective.  I should like an investigation into that, apart from the great national significance of the language. Educationally that is important. How far has Irish become, even for a short time, a real second language for a large number of the pupils who take it up?  Is it really only another form of writing and pronouncing English, as was the case in many schools in the case of other languages in the past?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement, suggests that a number of teachers who are quite qualified, in the technical sense, to deal with the language do not keep up fluency in the language. He refers to &ldquo;the gradual decline in the command of oral Irish for want of practice amongst the teachers who have succeeded in obtaining the bilingual certificate&rdquo;.  It is difficult to know whether a number of people who were supposed to be qualified for the carrying out of the full programme <Col N="668" /> of the Department are really any longer so qualified.  If that statement is correct, it raises doubts not merely as to how we should approach the problem from the point of view of the pupils but as to how we should approach it from the point of view of the teachers.  I understand that Deputy Mulcahy has indicated that he will go more fully into the matter.</P>

      <P>I stress the advisability of a thorough, impartial inquiry into this whole matter.  We have had a lot of charges and counter-charges and they are leading us nowhere. The scheme has been in operation sufficiently long to make such an inquiry fruitful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the general level of education in the secondary schools, I cannot speak. In certain circles in recent years, there was an uneasy feeling that the standard of examination and, possibly, the standard of teaching was not improving and, in some respects, that it was going down.  It is hard to know how far a feeling of that sort is justified. Personally, I do not find that the answers I get from those who have just come into the university are in any way inferior to those I got 30 years ago.  However, I am speaking only for myself and I do not say that the standard in my particular subject was very high 30 years ago.  Taking the students who are with us for a year, I cannot find that there is any falling off &mdash;I want to be fair and candid&mdash;in general ability or capacity to deal with the questions I put before them in their first-year examination.  If I be asked whether, on the whole, I think there is an improvement, I should say that, on the whole, I think there is. Again, to be quite candid with the House, I must say that that is not the view of all my colleagues by any means.  I remember some of the answers I got 30 years ago and, if I got them to-day, they would give me a bigger shock than they gave me then.  That is my personal experience. In other subjects the position may be <Col N="669" /> different.  There are a number of subjects in which we are not as far advanced as other countries.  However, that is so very vague a question that there is not much use in discussing it. How we can come to a conclusion on the matter is more than I can say at the moment.</P>
    <P>A number of other problems were touched upon by the Minister.  One of them was that of raising the school age.  He pointed out that this was not merely an educational problem but an economic problem&mdash;and an economic problem from two points of view, the point of view of the individual family and the point of view of the country. That being so, has any consultation taken place between the Departments of Education, Industry and Commerce and Agriculture?  I do not mention this matter for the purpose of controversy. Apparently, it is impossible or economically inadvisable to raise the school age in country districts because boys beyond the age of 14 are necessary for agricultural work of some kind or other.  Another aspect of our economic life would lead us to believe that there was not enough work for the people, because they are going away.  I admit that it is not for the Minister alone to solve this problem. It involves other Departments.  How far have they been consulted?  Why is it necessary to keep young boys from school after 14 or why should the Minister be prevented from raising the age on the ground of shortage of labour if there is, as there seems to be, too much labour?  That is a difficult problem, but that is no reason why it should not be faced not alone by the Minister's Department but by other Departments.  I cannot now recall the terms of the Compulsory School Attendance Act or the Vocational Education Act, but should it not be possible to make full-time attendance at school compulsory for young people who are not in employment.</P>
    <P>Why should it be only 180 hours a year?  Why only a partial attendance? Is it an economic question in the sense that there is not money in the treasury for that?  I always find it difficult with the present Minister and the present <Col N="670" /> Ministry to accept that explanation for failure to do anything&mdash;that it was due to lack of money.  There has not been the same expansion in the expenditure of money on education that a nation that will have to face the post-war problems is entitled to expect, or at least that would result in a considerable amount of benefit to itself.  A great deal more training will be necessary on the part of our youth to face the new situation.  I think, therefore, that the Minister ought to get into touch immediately with these other Departments to see whether the excuse is valid for not raising the age or increasing the hours of attendance That will mean more schools.  It will mean more teachers.  But have we not too many teachers?  We have undermined the managerial system in the country due to the fact that we have too many teachers.  Therefore, that need not be a barrier to the Minister.</P>
    <P>These are matters of more general import.  There are one or two matters of more detail on which I should like a little more information from the Minister.  He speaks of school buildings. I remember a number of years ago I had a census made of the condition of school buildings.  Money was more valuable then than it is now.  For £100,000 a great deal more building could have been done than could be done a year or two ago.  As well as I can recall, at that time, it was calculated that an expenditure of £200,000 a year would just make good the wastage. The Minister speaks of spending £200,000 a year in buildings.  Does that really do more than keep the bad level that we had, say, 15 years ago?  Every school deteriorates to a certain extent every year.  Some of them that were tolerable, say, ten years ago, would now possibly be intolerable.  So far as my memory goes, the view then was that expenditure of that kind could merely keep us at that level, and that if you wanted to bring the schools of this country into the condition which the Minister obviously desires&mdash;because he expressed it quite clearly in his statement&mdash;then you would have to engage in a much bigger building scheme.</P>
    <P>I think that was the common opinion.  Certainly it was the opinion <Col N="671" /> in the Department of Education ten or 11 years ago.  Whether it has varied since, or whether the stones and mortar, instead of growing old, have grown younger, I do not know, but, if the Minister wants to get the type of schools to which he refers here, then £200,000 a year will not carry him far. There would have to be big capital expenditure and I see no evidence of any advance in that direction for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In regard to publications in Irish, perhaps the Minister might give me information on one point that particularly interests me.  There was an idea many years ago that it would be a good thing to publish a number of the theological writers of the 17th century, those that wrote in Irish, educated men, therefore using educated Irish. It would not be necessary to be too careful as to whether you had an exact text or not.  I am speaking from the practical point of view of the language, not from the point of view of scholarship. What advance has been made in that direction?  I have made casual, personal inquiries and I met a situation such as this: I would refer to the name of a certain book and I would be told: &ldquo;That cannot be done.  So-and-so has undertaken to do that.&rdquo;  I would ask when did he undertake to do it.  I would be told: &ldquo;Ten years ago.&rdquo;  I would say: &ldquo;Cannot somebody else do it?&rdquo;  I would be told: &ldquo;No; that is his bailiwick; nobody else can touch that.&rdquo;  It reminds me of a miner's claim in Australia in the gold rush days.  But if you did not work the claim mine, it was jumped.  Apparently, the sensitiveness of our Irish scholars would not allow any man's claim to be jumped.  I think it is time that these texts were brought out. They would be very useful.  In regard to county histories, what has been done?  How many county histories have been published and, when published, what use is made of them?</P>
    <P>There is another small matter in which I am personally more interested though it deals with Irish history rather than with Continental history. <Col N="672" /> The grant has been reduced, under subhead B (7) to the Irish Committee of Historical Science, from £100 to £70. That society does a lot of useful work. It publishes a magazine twice a year in co-operation with a society in the North of Ireland.  I merely ask that the Minister would consider restoring that to the full figure if a case is put up to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the implementation of the arrangement come to last year about the teachers in the industrial schools.  So far as I can see, even from the Minister's statement, in the case of certain schools nothing has been done up to the present.  I understand that they will be paid the minimum salary and that, of course, back payment will take place afterwards. A number of them are expected to get a bilingual certificate, I think. Has account been taken of the age of a number of these men and has account been taken of their facilities for study?  Is it putting a fair burden on them to make that a condition?  Is it worth it?  I should like the Minister to explain more fully the delay and the cause of the delay.  A year has gone and, though there is every intention on the part of the Ministry to come to the aid of these people, actually the aid has not come from the Ministry yet. That is a matter, therefore, that I should also like him to look into.</P>
    <P>These are the main topics, which, varying my usual practice of not intervening in this debate&mdash;I do not usually intervene; certainly not at the beginning&mdash;I thought it well to put before the Minister.  Perhaps he will clarify them fully and, therefore, not lead to another long debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan prefaced his remarks by referring to a matter which I want to deal with in a particular way, that is, the operation of the panel system.  I referred to this matter two years ago on the debate on this Estimate.  I then stated that it was, in my opinion, a matter that was calling for a remedy.  I made certain suggestions.  I do not know whether the Department found them impracticable or not, but they were never carried out.  I do not know whether other Deputies in the House <Col N="673" /> have had the same experience as I have had&mdash;probably they have not&mdash;of the injury which the operation of the panel system inflicts upon children.  I understand that the greatest difficulty in operating the panel system arises in the West of Ireland.  At least, I am told so.  That is probably due to the fact that redundancy in teachers occurs there to a greater extent than in other places.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that the falling population is more in evidence in those districts than in other places and that, as a result, we have more redundant teachers.  I do not know whether that is the case, but apparently the Department has more trouble in operating the panel system in the West than in other places.  Because it has not been the same source of trouble in other parts of the country, it is quite possible that Deputies from these areas do not know what it is at all.  With us in the West of Ireland it is a very live matter. Deputy O'Sullivan said that the thing was wrong in principle.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan; I think it is wrong in principle but it is much worse in practice.  Formerly the managers had the right of selection when vacancies occurred, but what they found happening was that, as the population fell in various districts, the number of pupils on the school rolls declined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In two- or three-teacher schools, because of falling averages, certain teachers were not required, and the Department of Education simply told the teachers that they would have to quit the service.  The managers then came along, and in a charitable effort to try to relieve that situation they said to the Department: &ldquo;We will enter into an agreement with your Department to provide that, where teachers are disemployed as a result of falling averages, such teachers shall be put on a panel in every diocese and as vacancies occur in that diocese, we shall select teachers from that panel to fill the vacancies.&rdquo;  Meanwhile it was arranged that the teachers should hold their positions in the schools to which they were originally appointed until vacancies arose elsewhere in the diocese.  Deputy O'Sullivan appears to think that the managers were not justified <Col N="674" /> in doing that.  I think so too.  I think that there is an obligation on the part of the State towards these teachers and that it is unfair for the State to cast these people on the scrap heap.  If those teachers originally went into the Civil Service, their employment was secured and they got their pension rights and retained that employment irrespective of whether there was work for them or not.  They could not be thrown out of employment.</P>
    <P>If we look back on the way in which teachers were originally selected and educated, I think it will be agreed that there should be a much greater obligation on the part of the State towards teachers than towards civil servants. The method of selection was that persons who gained certain marks in their examinations and who wished to take up the profession of teaching became entitled to be trained as teachers. Their education was followed up by the State; they were educated practically free by the State in order that they might become teachers.  Notwithstanding that, we find that as averages fell teachers were being dismissed.  There was no employment for them and they were being retired on pension.  I do not exactly know whether any of them went out without pension.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what really happened. I happen to be in very close touch with some of these cases.  One would imagine from the operation of the panel rule that there was no obligation on the part of anybody in this country towards children.  The managers took upon themselves to appoint a teacher from the panel to any vacancy which would occur within their diocese, the panel being a diocesan panel.  As it happened they limited themselves to two, or sometimes three, teachers.  I remember my attention being drawn a few years ago to the panel which operated in my diocese. A vacancy occurred in a certain district and the panel that was presented to the manager contained the names of three teachers, one of whom was within two years of 60&mdash;that is the retiring age &mdash;another within three years of sixty, while the third was marked &ldquo;non-efficient&rdquo;. The manager would be supposed to take one or other of these <Col N="675" /> teachers.  It also happens sometimes that many of those teachers who become redundant are married ladies who have settled down in certain localities. Possibly they had married small farmers or small shopkeepers and they were settled in particular localities. Their families were in these localities but, under this panel arrangement, they could be asked to go to another school, 30, 40 or 60 miles away from their homes to take up new appointments, possibly only for a period of two years when they would be going out on pension.</P>
    <P>At the present time a case about which I asked a question the week before last, has arisen at a place called Clooncagh in the parish of Strokestown, County Roscommon.  A vacancy occurred in the national school there. The panel was presented to the parish priest, but it did not appear to him that there was any teacher on that panel except one whom he would, if free, ask to come and teach these children.  This one remaining person, who is still on the panel, resided 60 miles away from the school.  She has seven young children and her husband is a permanent invalid in hospital. What was the manager to do?  If he offered the appointment to this lady and she said: &ldquo;No, I cannot go, I cannot take my children up there.  I have a little farm where I am and I must look after my husband and family&rdquo;, she would be immediately struck off.  Now the Minister informed the House in reply to me that the rule is a very rigid rule and that he had no ways of getting round it.  He read out a certain clause in the panel regulations which apparently bore out what he said.</P>
    <P>My point is that a very grave and a very serious injustice is being inflicted upon the children concerned.  Apparently because the rule was made at one time, and because the managers in their impatience to deal with teachers who were being thrown out of employment as a result of falling averages agreed to appoint people only from the panel, we are now to inflict a very grave and a very serious injustice upon the children.  In this particular <Col N="676" /> case of Clooncagh, the manager did not offer the school to this lady who had seven children.  She was the only acceptable person on the list.  He gave the school to a newly-trained teacher, a fully-qualified teacher.  She taught there for three or four months and then she had to quit because nobody would pay her.  The Department refused to pay her because they held the appointment should have been made from the panel.  The manager refused to ask this lady who had seven children to come to the district and take up this school.  The result is that with the exception of a period of three months when a teacher was there who was not paid, the children have been for 16 months without a teacher and they are still without a teacher.  Now they have gone on strike, are not going to school, and their parents are threatening legal proceedings.  If we had a foreign Government here I know what we would say about a situation of that kind.  There is no use in the Department of Education saying: &ldquo;We cannot budge, there is the rule, and it must be observed.&rdquo;  I believe that before the Committee on Public Accounts and in other places the Department of Finance stated: &ldquo;We must have absolute observance of the panel system.  If not, there is a drain on the resources of the State, which is unwarranted.&rdquo;  Surely we are masters in our own house.  A wrong and an injustice has been inflicted on teachers and children and we ought to set about putting it right.  It is not good enough for the Department of Education or the Department of Finance to say: &ldquo;We can do nothing about this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be general recognition of this fact, that teachers who are redundant have some rights, as they were trained as teachers at our expense.  They were brought into the teaching profession, and because something for which they are not responsible happens, the average falls, they are thrown out of employment.  When speaking here on this matter last year or the previous year I said that with the consent of the managers, the Department of Education and the Department of Finance&mdash;personally I believe the Department of Finance is the stumbling <Col N="677" /> block&mdash;there should be some type of arbitration to decide what cases should not be placed on the panel.  I do not know if that suggestion was well received, but I have to a certain extent canvassed the views of people very intimately associated with this matter, and a suggestion was made to me which I am going to mention for what it is worth.  I do not know whether it would be accepted by the teachers as a solution.  It has been suggested that, where a teacher becomes redundant, if she is offered a position in the diocese which she could not accept, or refused to accept because of certain circumstances, she should then receive a salary equal only to her pension during whatever period she would remain in that school, pending a vacancy in the locality.  On the face of it, that appears to be an injustice to the teachers but, possibily, from the Departmental point of view it might not be.</P>
    <P>In any case it would be preferable to the situation we have at present, with a deadlock between managers, the Department of Education and the Department of Finance, resulting in the neglect of the education of children in the side of a parish.  For 16 months the children at Clooncagh school had a teacher only for a short period and that teacher was not paid.  It is a two-teacher school, with a partition between the senior and junior rooms.  It is not creditable that a situation like the present one should be allowed to exist and the sooner we end it the better.  It should be an easy matter to get together representatives of the managers, and the Departments of Education and Finance to find some solution of what is purely a domestic matter.  If we are not able to manage a small affair like this then we are not really fit for self-government.  If we are going to allow children to run about wild because we cannot agree on some scheme, while at the same time we pretend to be a very learned people, interested in education and having a college for advanced studies in Dublin, that is pretence and humbug and should be remedied.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement generally, in my view, is satisfactory.  It contains <Col N="678" /> four or five reforms which will be welcomed on all sides of the House.  For instance, the primary certificate is now to become obligatory.  That is something we have to be thankful for.  The case was made by the Minister and by other speakers last year that the percentage of schools presenting pupils for the primary leaving certificate was very low.  The change will certainly give parents in rural Ireland an opportunity of seeing in what way the work, as disclosed at examinations, is being done and that is all to the good.  Then we have co-ordination of the leaving and matriculation certificates which was certainly very much needed.  We have also the industrial school teachers dealt with, as well as the marking of papers done in Irish.  There was certainly a situation with regard to the marking of papers that was open to a good deal of criticism, when a pupil could, in fact, get more marks for a subject than were allowed.  That should not be allowed to continue. The Minister has met that by retaining the basis of the system.  He has done as well as he possibly could in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke at great length last year on education generally, and he struck a note which interested me very much.  I have had contact with managers and others interested in education, and while I do not suggest that my experience fits me to be in any way critical of education, everybody is interested in it, particularly in primary education, because it is going to be the basis of this country's future, socially, morally, and in other ways.  When speaking last year the Taoiseach referred to certain old-time teachers who had their heart in their work, and a desire to impart knowledge, who were in fact geniuses and that, generally speaking, we could not expect to get geniuses as our teachers&mdash; that they only turned up occasionally. I wonder if we have made an effort to get them?  I wonder if our method of selection is all that might be desired and whether we have in any respect followed the methods adopted in other countries in relation to the selection of teachers?</P>
    <P>These, I may say, are not so much <Col N="679" /> my own views as the views I have heard expressed by people who are very closely connected with education and who have evidenced a great appreciation of the efforts of the Department and everybody in the country to advance education, if possible.  What is our method of selection of teachers? At the moment I think we select something like a couple of hundred teachers per annum and we simply select the people who get the highest marks educationally.  We select just a bare minimum and we put them into preparatory schools for three years and educate them further there.  I do not know whether there is any method of selection so far as the makings of a teacher are concerned in the preparatory schools.  I understand there is not.  There are people who believe that teaching is not a profession in the sense in which, say, the Civil Service is a profession, that a teacher has a calling or a vocation.  That may be true, because I can recollect within a radius of ten to 15 miles around me in my own locality four or five teachers whose pupils always seemed to go ahead, whereas their neighbours teaching beside them under similar conditions and working on the same material never appeared to get any of their pupils anywhere.</P>
    <P>These are, I take it, the teachers to whom the Taoiseach referred last year &mdash;people who had a desire to impart to others the knowledge which they themselves had.  I believe he was quite right in that.  I knew some of those teachers to pursue their pupils long after they had left the national school, to pursue them into their homes and into the fields and to pursue their parents.  They had the pleasure afterwards&mdash;and it afforded them intense pleasure&mdash;of seeing very many of these children whom they pursued in that way climbing to fame, possibly in the Church, in the teaching profession itself or in various commercial walks in life, and some of them in foreign countries.  What strikes me is that perhaps when, on the basis of our original method of selection, we select a certain number over a particular standard educationally, it is quite possible that we leave behind people <Col N="680" /> just on the margin who would make much better teachers.  I am not suggesting that we ought not to accept the highest, but it is quite possible that, if we selected twice or three times the number we do select, and put them through some tests for a year or two years, we would get what we wanted at the end of that time, or at least we would get a much higher percentage of teachers with a real calling or vocation for teaching.  That point has been stressed by friends of mine who seem to think that that is followed in other countries to a much greater extent than here.  I wonder if I am interrupting the Deputies opposite in their conversation?  Are the Deputies finished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the suggestion forward as it was put to me.  There is no intention of casting any aspersion whatever on the teachers we have, but there is apparently a calling or vocation in teaching, from the words of the Taoiseach last year and from our own observations of how some teachers can make successes out of material out of which other people can make nothing. Everybody knows that that happens, and quite possibly those teachers who have made these successes were not brilliant as students or as educationists, but they understand the children. If the Department, instead of selecting just the required number and making no further selection from that number but simply educating them and teaching them to be teachers, were to make a further draw from them&mdash;in other words, if the standard was not originally so high&mdash;you might possibly get a greater percentage of teachers with their hearts in their work than at present.  The Minister, in fact, bore out that some of the teachers have not their hearts in their work when he said&mdash;Deputy O'Sullivan, I think, referred to the same matter&mdash;on page 7 of his introductory speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim of teaching Irish and teaching through the medium of Irish is the revival of Irish as a <Col N="681" /> spoken language....  The teachers are now well qualified for the task.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down on the same page, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Factors operating against a revival of the language as a spoken tongue are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The non-use of Irish as the ordinary medium of conversation between teachers and pupils during the school day;</P>
    <P>Failure to extend adequately the scope of teaching in standards IV-VIII, and</P>
    <P>The gradual decline in common of oral Irish for want of practice among teachers who have succeeded in obtaining the bilingual certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He tells us that the teachers are well qualified now and then he tells us that there is something lacking.  That is really discouraging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what we are looking for, but apparently there is something very unsatisfactory. These are the Minister's words, and as I said at the beginning, while I think the Minister's statement generally satisfactory, that feature, I think, is unsatisfactory.  On page 8, the Minister says with regard to the teaching of mathematics, that &ldquo;in a good many schools Arithmetic is not very well taught, the main reasons being (1) that not sufficient time is devoted to actual teaching, and, (2) the continued use of old fashioned textbooks.&rdquo;  Surely, No. 2, that is, the continued use of old fashioned textbooks, ought not to be allowed.  I think it ought to be very easy to deal with that.  With regard to the question of not sufficient time being devoted to actual teaching.  I do not know, of course; the programme may be too crowded and it may not be the teacher's fault at all.  Further on, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the teaching of Geography and Music there has been a noticeable improvement, due to the new methods of teaching these subjects <Col N="682" /> which are being generally adopted, but, in the teaching of English, too many teachers are too much inclined to adopt methods that were in use when they were in school themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, if we can get new methods for the teaching of Geography and Music, we surely ought to be able to adopt new methods for the teaching of English. There ought not to be any difficulty about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to repairs of schools, my attention was drawn recently to a matter which arose in my constituency and to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It appears that where it is necessary to have repairs executed at the present time the matter is, as usual, referred to the Board of Works, and the Board of Works proceed to make an estimate and specify certain timber that is required for flooring, and so on, and if that timber cannot be acquired, the work is held up.  My attention was drawn recently to a very old school which was in need of a new floor.  The building is a bad one&mdash;at best, it is a bad one&mdash;and it would not take a very good floor to outlive the whole structure. Notwithstanding that, because a particular type of board is not available, the school is left there.  That, of course, is because the Board of Works insist on the original specification being carried out, notwithstanding the fact that the materials are not available. Now, that ought not to be allowed to continue.  I think that where there is an old school of that nature it ought to be repaired in a reasonable time and ought not to be left in a very poor condition because they cannot get the first-class material which is usually specified for a school.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Book of Estimates that we are spending £74,000 per annum on training our teachers.  That is quite a large sum of money.  I am not at all saying that it ought to be reduced; as a matter of fact, the suggestions I have made would probably increase it, but it is a very large sum of money, and whether we are spending it in the best way is a matter that I think ought to be inquired into; whether our preparatory schools are <Col N="683" /> doing the work that is best suited for teachers in after life is a matter that, in my opinion, requires to be gone into very closely.  There seems to be an idea abroad that the primary school in this country, because it is an absolute necessity, because, whatever other education we have, we ought to have that as good as we can make it, since that is where the majority of our people will get their education, ought to have an agricultural bias.  Now, that has been debated up and down the country for some years past.  I was interested, on one occasion, when a paper was read advocating that that should be done.</P>
    <P>It was replied to and, I thought, ably replied to by a national teacher, to the effect that, after all, the primary school was the primary school and nothing else, that it just fitted the children to take up some walk in life&mdash; any walk in life&mdash;and that if the already overcrowded programme of the primary school had to include in it any type of work which would give it an agricultural bias, then it would have lost track of what its original vocation was.  I thought it was a good case, but I do not know that it was exactly true.  I think that there could be a combination of the two in our readers, and that everything pertaining to agricultural life in Ireland, that could be reasonably included in the primary school programme, should be included.</P>
    <P>I remember, when I was a little boy going to school, that one of the things that struck me was a map on the wall with &ldquo;British possessions are coloured red&rdquo; on it.  I was not a bit proud of the British, and I did not feel proud of their possessions, but looking at that map on the wall, with the inscription &ldquo;British possessions are coloured red&rdquo;, and looking at all the red dots and red spots all around the world, I thought to myself that if I were a little Britisher, I would be putting out my chest and feeling that we were big fellows.  Now, that is a very small matter, but we have not anything in our national schools that would give us that type of pride in our country or make us feel that there is an obligation <Col N="684" /> on us towards our own country. In going through the Estimate I find that in that respect, while we have, I think, about half a dozen organisers and assistants for music, and something like a similar number for domestic science and kindergarten, we have only one organiser for agricultural science.  I do not know whether the circumstances have been explored properly with regard to fitting, in some corner, into the national schools some kind of agricultural bias.</P>
    <P>It ought to be examined, if it has not been examined already, and the present time would be an opportune time for doing that.  We have had an intensification of the flight from the land, and I am afraid that no matter what we say here, no matter what may be published in the papers, you will still have that inclination to run after the bright lights and the glamour of the cities.  I do not think we are justified in sitting down and watching that happening, and I am afraid it is happening in the case of young people, practically, from their early 'teens.  I do not know whether we could combat it in the schools or not, but I do not think we have tried it, and it would be well worth trying, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is one of very large proportions and interests us all.  We are glad to see that it is proposed to carry out certain reforms.  I welcome them.  I hope that the suggestions I have made, particularly with regard to the panel system, will have some effect, and that some of the persons in authority will feel that children are being victimised.  That is not fair.  It is not a thing that we can stand over. There is no use in the Department saying that it is the fault of the managers.  The managers say that it is the fault of the Department.  This is our own country, and this is the people's Parliament where we make our own laws.  This agreement, that I have been speaking of, is one that was made between the managers and the Department.  If it is not working satisfactorily, and if the machine is bad, there ought to be a means of ending it. Quite recently an Act was passed in this House after a very serious and long debate, one to which many amendments <Col N="685" /> were moved, but, before it was put into operation, it had to be amended.  It still is not in operation. I refer to the County Management Act.</P>
    <P>Here is a panel rule, with certain clauses in it, made in a hurry to relieve a situation which, I am sure, it was felt at the time would soon end. I suppose it was thought that we were nearing the end of having redundant teachers, that probably the population was going in cycles, and that when the remedy appeared there would be no necessity for it, but the position is that we have this panel rule still.  It is working badly but, simply because it was agreed to, the attitude of the Department of Education and of the Department of Finance is: &ldquo;You must stick to it; we cannot depart from it.&rdquo; I think that is a disgrace.  We have the teachers, the managers and the Department of Education, and surely a way out of this situation could be found.  We ought not to throw up our hands in despair and say that we cannot solve it.  In order to save finance, we will, if we continue the enforcement of it, inflict injury on the teacher who has so many children that she cannot go away from home, or else we will inflict an injury on the school children by leaving them without a teacher. I do not think it is right that we should do that.  The Minister is a reasonable man, and the Department is reasonable, and therefore I think we ought to be able to find a way out.  Personally, I believe that if the Hierarchy and the managers put up a bold front they would get that done.  The position ought not to be left as it is.  It is a disgrace to have anything of the kind occurring, and the sooner it is ended the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions on the Education Estimates, I have drawn attention to the importance of taking steps to improve the standard of attendance at primary schools.  The Compulsory School Attendance Act has done much to bring us within hail of the standard towards which we should aim,. but there is still a lot of leeway to be made up.  Differences of opinion, chiefly in regard to the metropolitan area of Dublin, have been expressed in these debates in the past. <Col N="686" /> I have listened to certain Deputies make excuses for delinquency, and suggest that there should be a certain amount of laxity permitted, especially during the emergency period.  Others of us have pressed for a stricter application of the terms of that Act in these abnormal times.</P>
      <P>He went further and made forecasts that any relaxation of control would create further difficulties by retarding the courses of education, and possibly contribute towards an increase in juvenile crime.  We know it is rash to make forecasts, but I think time has fully justified our attitude, because unfortunately, there has been a certain amount of laxity on the part of those charged with the administration of the School Attendance Act in the City of Dublin.  The results of this mistaken leniency have revealed themselves so rapidly that it is easy to prove conclusively that this laxity was dangerous in its conception and, if allowed to persist, will be disastrous.</P>
      <P>This question of school attendance is increasing in gravity with each year, and I think the time has arrived to take the necessary steps to effect a definite improvement.  In not alone the metropolitan area but throughout the country there have been complaints during the past year about school attendance, and a reform, in the direction of having a tightening up, seems to be urgently necessary.  That is so particularly in the City of Dublin, due to the redistribution of the school-going population to outlying districts that has taken place, resulting in an inevitable amount of disorganisation.  I do not think that the steps taken to deal with school attendance while that redistribution of the population was being carried out, were adequate. Apart from a recasting of this system in the city there are other anomalies which almost border on the ridiculous. Take X and Y areas in the City of Dublin.  In X area you have a school attendance committee that does its work, and an attendance officer who does his work.  In that area you have X schools.  X attendance officer has jurisdiction over the pupils who reside in his area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next to that area&mdash;it may be only <Col N="687" /> across O'Connell Street&mdash;you have Y area in which the school attendance committee does not take the same interest in doing the work it was appointed to do.  As a result you have this situation arising: that pupils who live in Y district attend schools in X district, and that the school attendance officer in X district has no jurisdiction over them.  There may be three or four or five of these boys in one class and they very quickly get to know that the amount of laxity allowed them by the committee in their area permits them to adopt a certain attitude in the school they attend which is definitely not good for the rest of the boys.  They give bad example.  That is well known.  I suggest to the Minister that a circular should be issued to these committees to ensure that they will deal with that question.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies have stated here that some of us regard this question too seriously.  The school-going population in the City of Dublin between the ages of six and 14 numbers 75,000.  The average percentage attendance during the year 1941, which is the latest record we have, was 86 per cent.  Those of us who have practical experience of the possible goal at which we should aim in regard to school attendance suggest 94 or 95 per cent.  That means on every school day you have 9 per cent. of the pupils of the schools in the City of Dublin between the ages of six and 14 roaming about the streets getting into trouble.  On the figures I have quoted, and it will be found they are very approximate to the correct figure, there are 6,750 pupils roaming about the streets of Dublin on every school day.</P>
    <P>How can they avoid getting into trouble?  On the Estimate for the Department of Justice we had a reference by the Minister to the abnormal increase in juvenile crime.  How can that be avoided?  Can we take any steps to get at the roots of that problem?  I think we can.  The way to do it is to put into force, not new measures or reforms, but the machinery at present at the disposal of the Minister and of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this <Col N="688" /> question that may have escaped the attention of Deputies and others.  We have heard a lot about bread lines. Who are the people who compose a certain percentage of the bread lines in the City of Dublin?  The children of decent people who always attend school regularly have never had occasion to appear in the bread lines, but the &ldquo;mitchers&rdquo; who will not go to school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The ostensible and immediate reason for that was the change in the hours during which gas was available.  But I think that the remote and real reason for it was an unwise zeal for social reform bred, firstly, by a certain amount of war facts and, secondly, war fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been in operation now for some time.  The conditions at present are exceptional, but I wonder how many people, as a result of actual experience, would recommend that this innovation should become a permanent feature of our school life?  I take it that the people who are imbued with an exaggerated zeal for social reform know something about the conditions <Col N="689" /> in the workers' homes.  I take it that they took into account the fact that, when children are released from school at midday, in 49 per cent. of the workers' homes there is no midday dinner.  The father generally resides at a distance from his work and, in certain cases, the mother is not at home between 12.30 and 2 o'clock. Therefore that simply means the unloading of 75,000 children into the streets of Dublin at the busiest period of the day when traffic is at its peak point.  I contend that this innovation, no matter how well-intentioned, has not fulfilled its object, especially in recent times.  With the latest restrictions on the use of gas and cooking facilities generally, there does not appear to be any object in unloosing that number of children in a busy city.</P>
    <P>I am not going to refer to accidents that have happened.  As an aside, I could refer to these children going about and getting into trouble in different places in Dublin; there is always trouble waiting for them round the corner.  But I would say that even in the middle-class homes, which are popularly supposed to benefit as a result of this innovation, the fares have to be taken into account.  I know one home from which there are three people attending school at the present time; one of those arrives home at 3.10, another at 4.10 and another at 5.30.  How is that going to help the woman of the house?  It is only aggravating a problem which was there.  So far as the future is concerned, especially during the summer, I think that the best way to meet the situation would be to let the children go to school as early as possible, and let them get home as quickly as possible. In regard to the midday hour, I have already heard the argument advanced that the children will clutter up the traffic at that particular time.  They will not do it, because they will be going out of the city on buses which are normally, well, not empty, but certainly not full.</P>
    <P>If there was one regret that I had in connection with the recent Budget it was that the Minister for Finance did not see his way to put a thumping good tax on cinemas, or to do something which would at least restrict the <Col N="690" /> activities of the juvenile cinema-goer. That craze amongst our youth, even amongst those of the most tender years, has now exceeded all reasonable bounds.  It is not surprising that there should be evidence of a wave of juvenile crime.  It is not surprising that there is unnatural excitement amongst our youth, not to mention the amount of ill-health that follows close confinement, chiefly in fine summer weather, in the unwholesome atmosphere of the cinema.  I have not the faintest doubt but that a lot of our youth got the gangster idea which is so rife in the City of Dublin, not from the old parish rivalry which was there&mdash; that was a healthy thing&mdash;but from the &ldquo;pictures&rdquo;.  We have a censorship of literature; in our libraries there is a children's section, but, on the most important question of the whole lot, there is no censorship.  Even the most sophisticated of us who go to a cinema show know that there is something there which we, in the ordinary course, would not allow in our own homes, nor would it be allowed in our schools.  At the present time a boy or girl in our schools will produce, much sooner than a school book, an album of cinema stars.  The name of Ginger Rogers or Clark Gable means more to them than either Pearse or Markievicz.  We have it within our power to do something to curb that.  If we do not do it, the fault will be ours.  There is no use in spending £3,500,000 on education of the type that we want to see our youth getting if practically all that work is to be undone in the pleasure haunts.  It was interesting to see in the Press some time ago that the eight leading cinema stars in the world, four male and four female, are Irish.  It was very interesting, too, to read that Leslie Howard, who was so much fêted when he was over here, is keen on starting a cinema industry.  What is to prevent our doing that?</P>
    <P>If we can take £2,250,000 out of Irish industry in excess profits tax this year, what is to prevent our spending £250,000 in order to film our féiseanna, our Feis Ceoil, and our ceilidhthe? What is to prevent our helping the people who would come along and do that, when the virtual existence of this country as a nation is at stake?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> Speaking to certain industrial school teachers some time ago, I was asked to convey their thanks to the Minister for Education on having adjusted a very long-standing grievance, and I am glad to do that now.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding features in the educational life of Ireland last year was the 1916 and post-1916 Exhibition. Practically every child who saw that exhibition had something ingrained in the memory which would not come from actual tuition.  A teacher might talk for weeks and weeks, and perhaps a politician might do it also, without making any impression, but, in my opinion, the effect of that exhibition on the minds of Irish children was incalculable.  Anything that could be done or any expenditure that might be involved in enhancing that impression would be certainly justifiable.</P>
    <P>In regard to civics in the schools, I would suggest that the Minister should renew his appeals.  Only the other day near a certain railway station where there was a telephone box I saw a boy &mdash;he was &ldquo;a hard root&rdquo;, but I did not think he would go so far as he did&mdash; who was actually tearing the receiver down when I got after him.  I do know also that amenities such as are provided in the public playgrounds are not properly treated.  I think the best way of dealing with that matter would be by frequent circulars to the teachers, and by reserving, say, half an hour per week, perhaps in co-ordination with the Church authorities, for a lecture on that subject, not necessarily by a member of the schools staff, but by somebody from outside.  I think that would have a good effect.  They are good lads provided you take them in the right way, but it is extraordinary what fellows will do when taken the wrong way.</P>
    <P>On the question of the programme, I wonder if something could be done about drawing.  What set my mind running in that direction was the allotments scheme. It is terrible to see a drill of potatoes going round corners instead of going straight.  Something should be done, either through our educational system or by means of the radio, <Col N="692" /> to encourage our people to realise the beauty of form and the difference between a straight line and a circle.  I am sorry I cannot bear out the statement made by the Minister that in all schools in which there is central heating heat was kept on during the winter.  That is not true.  In fact, in certain schools children sat and shivered during the past year.  I know that a difficulty arises as regards coal supplies for schools in which there is central heating.  If something could be done to make a supply of coal available, that would clear up the situation from the Minister's point of view.  I was glad that the Minister, in his statement, referred specifically to the number of school buildings which have been put up and to the amount of money expended in this way during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt do mhúineadh na Gaedhilge ins na bun-scoileanna&mdash;i dtaobh na meán-scoileanna agus na scoileanna eile cloisimíd an iomarca, i gcomparáid len a n-uimreacha agus a gcuid oibre&mdash; is léir dúinn uilig go bhfuil an-obair dhá dhéanamh ann.  Tá cuid des na múinteóirí ann agus níl aon bhréag a rádh nó go bhfuil siad lán de chaondúthracht, lán dóchais agus grádha don Teangain agus nach féidir linn moladh ró-mhór a thabhairt dóibh. Múinteóirí an-dúthrachta, an-Ghaedhealacha ar fad iseadh iad agus is truagh nach bhfuil a thuile des na múinteóirí mar iad, ach ní féidir le gach duine bheith go hiomlán.  Is maith a chloisint ón Aire go bhfuil na múinteóirí go léir ag obair go héifeachtamhail agus go díoghraiseach.  Is maith freisin, a léigheamh i dtuarasgabháil an ghéarsgrúduighte ar theagaisc na Gaedhilge ins na bun-scoileanna, a bhí ar siubhal ag Cumann na Múinteóirí Náisiúnta, go bhfuil Múinteoirí na hÉireann i ndáiríribh ar an gceist seo agus go bhfuil sé ar intinn acu a ndícheall a dhéanamh chun na teangan d'aithbheódhadh chómh luath agus is féidir. Sa dtuarasgabháil sin cuireann siad in iúl do gach duine nach bhfuil aon amhras ar bith nó go bhfuil siad go diongmhálta ar cheist aithbheóchaint na teangan.</P>
    <P>Molaim go dtabharfaoi aire faoi leith don dtuarasgbháil sin.  Taisbeánann sé <Col N="693" /> na deacrachta a bhíonn i mbealach an mhúinteóra gach lá sa tseachtmhain agus taisbeánann sé toradh iarrachta an mhúinteóra ghnáthaigh agus isé an múinteóir gnáthach seachtó cúig faoi'n gcéad de mhúinteóirí na tíre.  Ba chóir go molfaimís go hárd na múinteóirí an-éifeachtacha agus is cóir toradh a gcuid oibre do bhronnadh orra.  Acht níl sé ceart in aon chor agus níl sé fadradharcach an múinteóir gnáthach nó an tuarasgbháil seo do chur ar leath-taoibh.  Molaim don Aire an tuarasghháil do chur faoi bhreithniú agus faoi ghéar-scrudú agus is dócha go bhfuighidh sé cuid eólais tairbhighe as.  Fuair an Cumann baramhla na múinteóirí ar cheist na simplidheachta agus coimh-ionannachta na Gaedhilge agus tá toradh an sgrúduighthe sin i gcló sa dtuarasgabhail.  Aontuighim le gach focal atá sgríobhtha annsin ar an gceist seo.  Tá sé in am dúinn&mdash;muna bhfuil sé thar am anois&mdash;an leasú so do sheóladh isteach.  Oibrigheann an litriú deacair agus na fuirmeacha graimeadaigh in aghaidh teagaisc na Gaedhilge.  I dteannta a bheith deacair níl siad coimh-ionann in aon chor. Agus mar gheall ar sin méaduighthear na deacrachta in aghaidh an sgoláire. Sé mo bharamhail nó go raghadh teagasc na Gaedhilge chun chinn i bhfad níos tapaidhe dá mbeadh an litriú agus na fuirmeacha graimeadaigh níos simplidhe.  Ba cheart go dtabharfaoi an-aire dos na molta sin sa dtuarasgbháil.</P>
    <P>Cúis áthasa do Ghaedhilgeóirí an ghluaiseacht nua sin&mdash;Brúgh na nÓg&mdash;a fheiceál.  Céim ar aghaidh seadh é. Beannuighmid dó agus tá muinghin againn go misneófar na daoine óga chun a gcuid Gaedhilge a labhaint agus a chongbháil i gcleachtadh.  Ní íongantach an rud é go dtéigheann roinnt múinteóirí in éadóchas ar shlánú na teangan nuair a fheiceann siad go leigtear i bhfailligheacht í taobh amuigh des na scoileanna.  Is oth liom tagairt a dhéanamh don gceist seo arís agus arís eile acht is mór an briseadh croidhe é do mhúinteóirí Gaedhilge nach gcuireann na daoine óga a gcuid eólais i dtaithighe san tsaoghal taobh amuigh den scoil agus sna gnáthcheárdachaí tar éis saoghal na scoile. Acht an orra atá an locht?  Ní cóir in aon chor an milleán ar fad do chur <Col N="694" /> orra.  Céard a chloiseann siad i ngáthchúrsaí a mbeatha acht an Béarla&mdash;sa bhaile, ar an tsráid, san Eaglais, ins na siopaí, san oifig, ag na pictúirí, san amharclann&mdash;an Beárla ar feadh an ama ar fad.  Sa dtalamhuíocht, i dTionnscáil agus Tráchtáil ní cloistear an Ghaedhilg.  Cuirtear d'iachaill ar an múinteóir a chuid Gaedhilge do leathnú agus d'fheabhsú.  Cuirtear chúca agus chuig na scoláirí imlitreacha, nótaí agus comhairlí gach bliadhain agus cuirtear milleán orra go minic.  Tuige nach gcuirtear d'iachaill ar roinnt eile des na daoinibh?</P>
    <P>Ní hé amháin nach bhfuil d'iachaill orra&mdash;ní hé nach bhfuil beagán tathainte ciúine orra&mdash;acht nach bhfuil meas na madaidhe aca sin ar an nGaedhilg.  Tá sé in am dúinn admháil nach rachaidh an teanga ar aghaidh i gnáth-chúrsaí na tíre go dtiocfaidh an lá nuair déarfaidh an Riaghaltas annseo: &ldquo;Ní rud gan fóghnamh í an teanga.  Cuirfimíd luach tráchtála uirri.  Ní hé amháin gur intleachtach agus gur tíorghrádhach an rud é an Ghaedhilg a fhóghluim agus a labhairt acht in a theannta caithfidh sí áit chiunte d'fhagháil i gnáth-cheárdachaí na tíre.  Tá an lá ag teacht go luath nuair a bhéimid in ann a radh, go bhfuil obair le fagháil i dtalamhuiocht, ins na hoifigí, ins na siopaí agus in gach ceárd eile sa dtír ag scoláirí na Gaedhilge.  Caithfimid bheith in ann é sin a rádh nó caillfimid an cath.</P>
    <P>Ach, faraoir, ní mar sin atá an scéal faoi láthair.  Rinneadh gearánta sa dTigh seo ó am go ham faoi chárta puist i nGaedhilg a cuireadh amach ó Roinn Riaghaltais éicint, ag admháil litre cur i gcás.  Raghainn níos fuide agus chuirfinn amach ó Ranna Riaghaltais i bhfad níos mó de litreacha sa nGaedhilg.  Ba hé gnó na ndaoine óga na litreacha sin d'aistriú nó bheadh sé ar na glacadóirí aistrightheóir d'íoc.  Ní fada annsoin go mbeadh meas ar an nGaedhilg. Acht roimh leanúint le polasaí den tsórt sin ba chóir go mbeadh aontú air i ngach áit sa dTigh seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Stáit-sheirbhís, cloisim gearánta nach bhfuil an teanga ag dul ar aghaidh ann mar ba cheart.  Nach náireach an scéal é go bhfuil daoine <Col N="695" /> óga ag dul isteach annsin gach bliadhain, cuid aca in a gcainntéoirí ó dhúthchais agus cuid eile in a gcainnteóirí sár-mhaithe, daoine uilig a bhfuair seans ina na scoilleanna nach bhfuaramar riamh agus nach náireach an rud é go bhfuil siad ag cailleamhaint a gcuid Gaedhilge mar tá siad 'ghá leigint i bhfailligheacht.  Ní ceart a rádh go bhfuil iarracht fhír-dhílis dá déanamh annsin.  Is fíor é a rádh go bhfuil daoine ins na háiteanna árda nach bhfuil go cáirdeamhail dos na Gaedhilgeóirí.  Is fíor, freisin, a rádh nach bhfuil an Ghaedhilg foiréignighthe chun árduighthe sa tSeirbhís. Chualas trácht le déidheannaighe ar scrúdú&mdash;sórt agallaimh nó interview a b'eadh é&mdash;i gcóir árduighthe i Roinn áirithe agus ní raibh an méid is luagha amháin don Ghaedhilg ar feadh an ama ar fad.  Nuair a fheiceann na daoine óga é sin is deacair iad a cháineadh.  Ag cainnt le Stáit-sheirbhíseach dubhairt sé go mbíonn sé ar buile uaireannta de thaobh faillightheachta na Gaedhilge. Do chomhairligh sé leis na comhoibrigtheóirí faoi n-a chúram agus fuair sé amach go raibh seachtó faoi'n gcéad aca in ann a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh tré Ghaedhilg.  Annsin do shocruigh sé go ndeanfaoi obair na hOifige sin tré Ghaedhilg.  Do mhol mé dó leanúint leis an gcúrsa sin agus do thosnuigh sé ar an ndeagh-obair, acht gach maidin a eirigheann sé bíonn faitchíos air go n-ordófar síos go dtí Ballydehob no b'fhéidir go Bealach a' Doirín é.  Do gheallas dó go mbeadh ruaille-buaille annseo dá dtuitfeadh sé sin amach agus beidh.</P>
    <P>Tá nidh eile ag obair in aghaidh labhartha agus usáide genereálta na Gaedhilge san Stát-sheirbhís chómh maith le áiteanna eile agus sé sin do réir deallraimh, go bhfuil sórt complex i mease Gaedhilgeóirí nach ceart an Ghaedilg a labhairt muna mbíonn sí go blasta, go líomhtha agus go hiomlán ag an gcainnteóir ins na focla agus na fuirmeacha agus na cora cainnte gidh go gceaduightear do dhuine ar bith an Béarla do mharbhú ar a thoil féin gan aoinne a bheith breitheamhnach no lochtach ina thaobh.  Tá's ag gach duine gurab í sin an fhírinne.  In ionad a bheith ag <Col N="696" /> lochtú iarrachta na nGaedhilgeóirí ba chóir dúinn misneach agus treóradh a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Bhuel, 'siad sin na gearánta agus na tuairmí atá agam anois ar an Meastachán seo, agus ar an mbliadhan seo chaithte.  Níl le rádh agam anois acht gur ceart dúinn a bheith fíorbhuidheach ins na amannta uathbhásacha seo go ndeontuightear dúinn leanúint le gnáth-chursaí an Oideachais le linn an méad sin de thíorthaí a bheith tré na chéile.  Le linn na lampaí léigheanta a bheith múchta ar fuid na hEórpa ba chóir dúinn a bheith fíorbhuidheach do Dhia go bhfuil síad ag lonnradh go soillsighe in Eirinn fós.</P>

      <P>I ngnaithe oideachais tá dualgas trom ar Rialtas ar bith atá i gceannas na tíre seo.  Tá sé socruighthe againn cheana féin go gcaithfear an t-oideachas so a bheith Gaedhealach ón bhunscoil go dtí an ollscoil.  Caithfidhmid greamú go dlúth don tsocrú sin.  Ná bíodh aon éalódh uaidh.</P>

    <P>Bhi muid fada go leór faoi réim na nGall&mdash;réim an dorchadais dúinne&mdash;an réim a phlúch agus a mhúch seanoideachas Gaedhealach ár sinnsir.  Níl <Col N="697" /> sé i bhfad ó fuair muid anál na saoirse linn; níl sé i bhfad ó bhris an solas chugainn.  Níl sé ach caoga bliadhain ó thosuigh gluaiseacht na teangan agus sé bliadhna fichead ó bhí Ais-Éirghe na Cásca againn.  Is feasach dúinn go léir gur imir an Piarsach cródha agus a bhuidhean a n-anamna ar son na hÉireann mar shúil go mbeadh Éire Gaedhealach i réim ina ndiaidh.  An bhfuilimid ag leanamhaint lorg na laochra sin?  Muna bhfuil, badh chóir dúinn ár gcoinnseas a scrúdú. Tá Rialtas Gaedheal i gceannas na tíre seo anois le fiche bliadhain agus tá tús déanta aca ar an tír ath-Ghaedhealú. Níl cumhacht níos láidre aca ná tá aca san oideachais má tá rún daingean diongbhálta air an tír ath-Ghaedhealú. Má sháruigheann ortha ní ar an Aire so a bhéas an locht.  Is trom an obair atá roimhe mar tá mórán constaicí ina chasán.  Tá Béarla agus Galldachas ina thuile ar gach taoibh dínn; chídhmid na scánáin, na páipéir nuaidheachta, an craolachán agus gléasraidhe go leór eile mar iad, agus is maith atá fhios againn a gcumhacht ar inntinn an aosa óig.</P>
    <P>Bhí muinighin láidir agam féin as múinteóirí scoile na tíre go gclaoidhfeadh siad an spiorad gallda so.  Níl ag éirghe leo chomh maith as badh mhian linn acht caithfidhmid foighid a bheith againn.  Is beag an scéal fiche bliadhain i saoghal náisiúin.  Bhí muinighin speisialta againn, agus tá, as na múinteóirí óga.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil baicle de na sean-mhúinteóirí againn go fóill nach raibh eolas ró-mhaith aca ar an Ghaedhilg i n-aon am.  Muna raibh fuath aca uirthi níor mhór a ngrádh ar an teangain mar thamhuigh sí obair dóibh nach raibh siad oilte fa na choinne.</P>
    <P>Ní hiongnadh ar bith liom go bhfuil an baicle beag seo anois ag clamhsán fá theagasc na Gaedhilge.  Is maith an scéal go mbeidh na sean-mhúinteóirí seo ag éirghe as an obair gan mhoill agus go mbeidh múinteoirí óga d'fhíor-shliocht Gaedheal ullamh oilte le n-a n-áit a líonadh.</P>
    <P>Is bocht suarach inntinn liom na ndaoine seo atá i n-éad le muinntir na Gaedhealtachta siocar an breis beag a tugadh dóibh sna colaistí ullmhúcháin. Níor cheart géilleadh don ghearán <Col N="698" /> sin.  Ró-fhada bhí muinntir na Gaedhealtacha faoi dhroch-mheas i gcúrsaí léighinn.  Tá súil agam go bhfuighidh gach páisde san Ghaedhealtacht a bhfuil an mheabhair chinn aige uchdach agus cuideadh ón Stát a dhul ar aghaidh le na chuid léighinn.  Agus isé a gceart tosaidheacht d'fhághail i dtoghachain ar bith do mhúinteoirí no do Stát-sheirbhísi.  Is fada sin tuillte aca.</P>
    <P>Anuiridh nuair a labhair mé ar an mheastachán so mhol mé don Aire gur chóir dó scoil ar leith bheith aige i ngach páraisde san Ghaedhealtacht ina mbeadh árd-rang do bhuachaillí agus cailiní a mbeadh dúil san oideachais aca agus ar mhaith leo leanamhaint leis an scolaidheacht.  Níl caoi aca dul go meadhon-scoil.  Ghní na Bráithre Críostúla an obair seo sna bailte móra agus na cathracha ach níl caoi ag an bhuachaill nó an cailín bocht san Ghaedhealtacht an léigheann seo dfhagháil.</P>
    <P>Cluinim go bhfuil dlús dá chur le leitriú na Gaedhilge a cháighdeanú. Is maith sin agus is mithid é a dhéanamh.  Tá súil agam nach ndéanfar praiseach den scéal agus an leitriú sin a bheith bunaighthe ar aonchanamhaint amháin mar tá an Ghaedhilg oifigeamhail.  Is beag mo mheas ar an Ghaedhilig sin&mdash;treasarlach nach bhfuil bun no barr uirthi agus nach féidir le duine ar bith í thuigbheál gan aistriú Béarla bheith léi.</P>
    <P>Má bhíonn an caighdeanú mar sin bhfhearr leigin dó no bogán a bhéas ann nach dtiocfaidh sliogán a choidhche air agus i dtaca le geint a bheith ann féin níl aon ghar a bheith ag súil leis.</P>

      <P>As has been indicated, the opinion is that this is the most important Estimate we could discuss, and the Taoiseach, in a special contribution on the Education Estimate last year, expressed that very definitely as his opinion.  I think it is a very important Estimate, too.  The more we look around us and see what is happening in the world and what may be our future, the greater will be the importance of the Department of Education, its outlook and policy, the <Col N="699" /> type of machinery it uses and the way it uses it, and the way it links together every section of the people concerned with education.  There are many things at the present time which make people stop and look around them and estimate what they are doing, but it it seems to me that the Department of Education has come to a stop, without being driven in any kind of way to look around and see what it is doing. It seems, as it were, to have lost all its administrative sense, lost all its sense of touch with the problems that are there and particularly with the problems that face people in afterlife. On various matters it has shown itself acting as a bureaucracy.  As I said last year, it seems to me that the Department of Education has gone underground.  It reminds me of a body gone into the catacombs, but without any vision and without any creed.  I do not think we can afford to feel that the Department of Education has done that.</P>
      <P>This country has gone through a very peculiar time in the last 20 years.  It has been torn by matters arising out of politics that have confused nearly the whole national outlook and almost our whole spiritual outlook.  There are many things that, in ordinary circumstances, we would be turning our backs on, in order to face a definite future; but the temper of the world at the present time is such that, if we never had anything in our past on which we should like to turn our backs now in order to start with fresh minds and bigger spirit, what is happening at the present would force us to consider what may happen in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not want to exaggerate any statement of the Taoiseach last year, or to suggest that it embodies his whole mind on this matter.  Speaking on the 27th May, 1941, in this House, however, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe fundamentally in this&mdash; and I think I can stand up in argument on the matter with anybody &mdash;that we can teach in our primary schools the elements of arithmetic, in whichever language we teach it, and even through Irish, so as to instruct children to add, subtract, multiply and divide, to do simple fractions and <Col N="700" /> decimals, and that is all I want.  We can do that in the school years.  We can teach them to write a simple letter in English and to do the same in Irish; we can teach them to read a simple book in English and to do the same in Irish; and we can teach them to carry on a simple conversation and express ideas in English and to do the same in Irish.  I believe that can be done within the time, but it is sufficiently big a programme not to allow of what I have several times described as frills.  There is no time for anything but absolutely fundamental and essential things, and, if we confine ourselves to them, we can get our work done, and we can have our reasonable tests at the end to see that it has been done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that that is the clarion cry or the scroll in gold letters that the Taoiseach should put over the front door of the Department of Education; but, coming from the political Head of the Government, either in the times of last year or in the times of this year, it is not sufficient for us in the realm of our education.</P>
    <P>Again, I cannot help looking to Great Britain.  One of the things about which there is most discussion there is the importance of education. Every aspect of education is being discussed: the question of enfolding it in a religious spirit and bringing back religion to the schools where religion may have been displaced; making school centres where idealism, hope and energy as well as technical efficiency are created so that people coming from the schools will have been taught to expect opportunity and to make the best of their opportunity. Every section of the various classes of people in Great Britain are talking about the present day and planning for to-morrow.  Education is very prominently before them.  When the Christian Churches came together there last year they added five points that they would regard as a practical epitomising of the points that Our Holy Father the Pope had announced as being the things that, from his point of view, should be kept most in mind in ordering the world in future.  One of the points mentioned in the statement of <Col N="701" /> the British Churches at that particular time was that every child, regardless of race or class, should have equal opportunities of education suitable for the development of his peculiar capacities.  Mr. Bevin made this statement&mdash;I think I have already called attention to it&mdash;speaking on the 3rd November last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we had had the vision to make the school-leaving age 16 20 years ago and had added technical training to the last three years of vocational and cultural education, we would not have had a skilled labour problem in this war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He had made up his mind to see that in future children should have a fair chance.  In <i>The Times</i> of the 28th May it is reported that the education advisory committee of the Liberal Party had issued a report headed: &ldquo;Education For All.&rdquo;  The following reference was made to it, although the report had not yet passed the annual assembly of the Liberal Party to which it was proposed to present it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The report affirms that the children of all must have equal access to good education under satisfactory conditions of staffing, equipment, and building... The school-leaving age should be raised to 16, without exemption or exception.  There should be three main stages in education: primary, secondary, and further, and a common form of education for primary stage.  In the secondary stage there must be considerable variety of schools.  The public schools should be preserved, but become an integral part of the national system, with roots in the localities in which they are situated. Private schools should be licensed. Family allowances, already approved by the Party, are essential.  From 16 to 18 there should be a complete system of continued education. Evening institutes and social centres should be linked up with further education.  A supreme effort must be made to fill up the gaps in engineering, scientific and art education and university education made more equally and widely available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are just points in what is a <Col N="702" /> regular movement throughout all political parties, throughout all classes. There is an acceptance of the fact that education must be the basis of their future prosperity and their future happiness in whatever kind of world they have to face.  The same applies to us. Various problems fell on the world after the last war.  The nature of them was not recognised until maybe ten years or more afterwards.  It is now recognised by those nations that have been engulfed in this war that if they had realised the changed economic conditions, the expansion in development and distribution of the world's resources, which created new types of unemployment, and if a little more thought and energy had been directed to a study of the situation and how to act in accordance with the facts, that with a fraction of the effort this war involves, with a fraction of the sacrifice, a fraction of the wastage of resources, people could have been provided with much of their material wants and the amenities that go to make life happier, and that better education would have enabled people to get more out of themselves spiritually and mentally.</P>
    <P>We are in the very type of circumstances in which other countries are, and in which other countries were, after the last war.  We have an opportunity of examining the situation with all the energy and all the thought that we can bring to bear on it.  Through the help of Providence we have, up to the present, an opportunity of examining these things without being invaded by the rough hand of war in the way that other countries have been invaded.  It is disheartening that so little energy and so little thought are, apparently, being given to the situation here through the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Estimate last year, I drew attention to the position that Deputy Mullen has referred to, that is, the position in the City of Dublin, not so much because young fellows were staying away from school when, according to the law, they ought to have been at school, but because young fellows were leaving school at 14 years of age who had no place in the world to turn to to find employment or occupation of any kind.  Where there was absence <Col N="703" /> from school that was irregular and contrary to the law, it was to some extent because of the fact that classes were too crowded and very often there was no attraction to bring the boys there and there was no power in the teachers to hold them there.  At a time when that was the case, we were shutting down our training colleges or half closing them, ceasing to utilise our preparatory colleges.  It was a time when we should be spending money, because it was one of the ways in which we could be spending money, in training our young people who are suitable for training, utilising our preparatory colleges and training colleges to the very full so that we might be strengthening our educational machine here.</P>
    <P>I drew attention at that time to the position and I summarised it in this way.  A short time before I had put down some questions with regard to 12 schools that I took at random on the north side of the city and I pointed out that in the case of boys 30.5 per cent. of the classes had more than 50 boys on the roll, that in the case of girls 66 per cent. had more than 50 on the roll, while in the case of infants 58.5 had more than 50 on the roll.  Out of 150 classes in these 12 schools, 55 per cent., or a total of 82 classes, had 50 pupils on the roll.  I raised the question that the classes were too large.  I could get no encouragement from the Minister that anything would be done to reduce these classes.  I was told that I was giving the figures on the roll and not the average.  I said that I was giving the figures on the rolls because I wanted to make a comparison with what had been done in Great Britain in the ten years before and I was relating the figures on the roll to those on the roll in Great Britain because the only figures I had for Great Britain were the figures on the roll.  I pointed out that in 1928 they came to a decision in Great Britain that they should reduce their classes.  I showed that, in 1928, in the schools in the various urban districts in Great Britain there were 22,173 classes, 7.9 per cent. of which had more than 50 children on the roll, and that by 1938 they had reduced that <Col N="704" /> percentage to 1.6.  Similarly, in the case of the county boroughs, where the number of classes in the year 1928-29 was 46,408, 10.9 per cent. of these classes had 50 or more children on the roll and that percentage was reduced to 2.4 by 1937-38.  In the City of London, where they had 15,129 classes in 1928-29, in 10.6 per cent. there were more than 50 on the roll and that percentage was reduced to 0.4 by 1937-38.</P>
    <P>On the other day, the 20th of May, I asked for similar information in respect of the same schools for which I asked information last year.  I have not yet got the information and, not getting the information, I took at random this morning one of the schools about which I had got information previously. I went up to the school in Lower Rutland Street.  It is not a school in my constituency, but it is not very far removed from it.  I selected it as a school that was compact, a school where there were boys' and girls' classes.  I wanted to see how we stood there from the point of view of the reduction of classes.  Last year in the girls' school in junior infants, Class A, there were 60 children on the roll and 50 in attendance.  To-day there are 85 on the roll and 69 in attendance.  In junior infants, Class B, there were last year 70 on the roll and 57 in attendance. To-day there are 73 on the roll. A similar position is disclosed in the other classes.  Senior infants, Class A, had a roll of 62 last year and 62 this year.  Senior infants B had a roll of 60 last year and of 63 this year. Class 1A had a roll last year of 48, of whom 45 were in attendance; this year it has a roll of 63, of whom 58 were in attendance.  Class 1B last year had a roll of 47, of whom 41 were in attendance.  This year it has a roll of 63, of whom 52 were in attendance. In Class 2 there were 43 on the roll last year, of whom 42 were in attendance; this year there are 42 on the roll and 33 in attendance.  In the case of the boys, in the junior infants, Class A, there were last year 68 on the roll and 56 in attendance; to-day there are 92 on the roll and 82 in attendance.  In junior infants B, there were 64 on the roll last year and 53 in attendance; to-day there were 88 on the roll and 72 in attendance. <Col N="705" /> In the whole of the infant boys school, last year there were on the roll 429 boys for whom there were eight teachers, that is, an average of 54 on the roll.  This year there are 486 on the roll with eight teachers, that is, an average of 61 on the roll, while the average in attendance was 54.</P>
    <P>Is it not an astonishing thing that we can sit here and stand over anything like that knowing the traditional respect of the Irish people for education, realising how short a time the primary programme runs, with the age limit for our primary schools at 14, knowing that so much depends on the efforts we make to provide these children with an adequate education within these years and knowing that so much in regard to character training and discipline depends upon that education? What kind of an attempt do these figures reveal at inculcating in our children a respect for national institutions, at teaching them to accept and to respect them?  What can we expect when we herd our young people into classes such as these&mdash;Infants A, 85 girls; infants A, 92 boys.  I appeal to the Minister to realise that we must try to remedy that situation.  When the Minister provides information in regard to the 12 schools for which I have asked information covering last year we can see to what extent the characteristics to which I have referred still prevail.  As I have said, I gave last year the percentage figures for the number of classes in which there were 50 pupils and upwards on the roll.  In some cases 30.5 per cent. had more than 50 on the roll, in others 66 per cent., and in others 58.5 per cent.  At the same time the British authorities pursuing through their various schools a system of reducing the numbers in classes to a figure under 50 had reduced over ten years the percentage in which there were still more than 50 pupils to 1.6 in the boroughs and urban districts, to 2.4 in the county boroughs, to 0.4 in the City of London and in the whole country to 1.4.</P>
    <P>There is something there that cannot wait, and that must be dealt with.  It can be faced by making proper use of our training colleges, by the proper utilisation of our preparatory colleges, <Col N="706" /> by taking some of our young people who to-day are wondering whether they can get a permit to go to England, and getting those suitably and properly qualified in character into our teaching corps.  We may be excused for not building houses, excused for not developing industries, and for not having great cereal production, because we cannot get manures, but we cannot be excused if we neglect our educational development.  I did hope when, by chance, I selected a school to go into this morning, to find one school in which not to be disappointed, particularly as I was going to a school that would naturally lose some of its children because of clearances in the neighbourhood.  It is true that there was other building going on in that neighbourhood, but I did hope that there were some schools in which there was improvement, but anyone would be shocked that the change for the worse was so bad.  I raised that matter last year but I got no sympathy from the Minister.  I ask the Minister if he realises what that means in a city where we give nothing to young people growing up except education.  Nothing is really the foundation of education but discipline and training.  I want to say that in schools of that kind young people can get neither discipline nor training.  It must be a shocking disappointment and a crushing burden.  I do not know how men and women who have to go as teachers can bear such conditions.  It is part of the complete detachment from the realities of things that I find about the Department of Education at present.  Last year I complained about the form which the report takes.  If there is any Department with a tradition for giving an annual report, it is the Department of Education.  There are a few other Departments which have a sound tradition of giving reports in detail on various aspects of their work.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Department of Education got from every one of its divisional inspectors detailed reports, and then pieced them together, giving a general picture.  On reading through it one was challenged here and there and the question arose as to how to follow particular lines of thought and <Col N="707" /> inquiry.  Now, the report has gone completely, and we get a series of statistics over a year or two.  I think very few are going to look at a volume of statistics. The Minister's annual review on his Estimate, if we take the general lines on which it went this year and last year, is not going to fill in the picture on questions to which we could direct our minds, either in the way of appreciation or useful questions.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks again of the importance of the Irish language.  Is there anything in the Minister's statement that gave us anything at all that could be called a picture, as to whether the language was either being strengthened or being weakened?  I put a question to the Minister the other day asking him, in respect of the position in June, 1941, how many schools in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht were doing all the work through the medium of Irish. He told me that in June, 1941, 174 schools in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht were doing all work through Irish; in the Gaeltacht, 75 schools; in the Breac-Ghaeltacht, 119 schools, and in the Galltacht, 255 schools.  In June, 1939, there were 172 in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht doing all work through the medium of Irish, so that there was an increase of two.  In the Gaeltacht in June, 1939, there were 102 doing all work in Irish, but by June, 1941, the number had fallen to 75, or a fall of 25 per cent. I do not know how the Minister differentiates between the Gaeltacht and the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  The number of schools doing the work in Irish in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht had fallen from 102 to 75.  In the Breac-Ghaeltacht the number fell from 125 to 119, a fall of six.  In the Galltacht the number fell from 305 in 1939 to 280 in 1940 and to 255 in 1941, so that between June, 1939, and June, 1941, 50 schools in the Galltacht doing work through the medium of Irish had ceased to be reckonable in that particular class.</P>
    <P>There are also schools that do their work partly through Irish and, if we look at the report of the Department of Education for 1938-39, we find that <Col N="708" /> there were 2,411 of these in the year ended 30th June, 1939.  If we refer to the report for 1939-40 the number was 2,205 or a decrease of 206.  Now, 206 schools doing work partly through the medium of Irish have gone completely out of that class in two years.  When you have a fall of 81 schools in two years in the class doing all work through the medium of Irish and a fall of 206 in two years in schools doing part of their work through the medium of Irish, a question arises in our minds as to what on earth is happening, and, both from the educational and national point of view, we ought to have some review of the situation, and that review should be such that it would be traceable to different localities and to different causes, because if the work being done for Irish is meant to have an educational effect, we ought to know something about why it is failing in this way and why it is being dropped.  Is it being dropped for better educational advantages?  If we consider the effect of maintaining the Irish language, of developing and using it and making it the medium of expression through which the nation can express itself, it is all the more serious that facts like these should show themselves and it is all the more important that we should get some explanation of them, but, as it is, these are all buried in statistics and we do not get even the meagre story which the summary of the inspectors used to give.</P>
    <P>I say that the Department has gone underground.  I had occasion in previous years to say that it had changed the whole position of the mathematics programme without any public consultation. The other day it introduced a scheme of superannuation for secondary school teachers without consulting the secondary school teachers' body about it and left out of the scheme things which these teachers, as a body, would have been prepared to pay for and wanted, that is, an arrangement by which they would get a gratuity on death, or on leaving the service, in the same way as the civil servant gets it. That superannuation scheme was put into operation without any consultation with them.  I pointed out, at great <Col N="709" /> length, the extraordinary action of the Department in adding 10 per cent. to the Greek marks after they had been published generally following the last intermediate examinations.  All administrative touch seems to be gone. There seems to be no directing policy and no directing spirit, and, as for giving us what the people of Great Britain are getting to make us enthusiastic about education, to get us into a stride which will overcome our weaknesses, our laziness and perhaps our lack of hope in what education can do, the Department is doing nothing.  It is doing nothing to guide or lead us in a vigorous and energetic way along the road we must travel, a road we must travel quickly and with a high heart and high hope, if we are to do the enormous amount of work that requires to be done.</P>
    <P>The latest sidelight on how devoid of touch and energy the Department is is shown by its attitude to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation in connection with their report.  The teachers, who are the people upon whom we are depending for the carrying on of our primary education, took the initiative themselves and set on foot an inquiry into a very important matter &mdash; teaching through Irish in English-speaking districts.  They spent a very considerable amount of time at it and their report was ready some time last year.  They arranged to have it printed in July last, and, having had it printed, they presented it to the Minister, without making in any way public the fact that they had been examining the question or had come to any conclusions with regard to it.  They realised it was an important matter and a matter on which there should, so far as possible, be no difference between the teaching body, the Department and the people as a whole.  They passed that report to the Minister somewhere about the middle of 1941. The official programme of the 74th Annual Congress of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, which was to be presented to their meeting in University College, Dublin, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 7th, 8th and 9th April, 1942, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The signatories to the report had <Col N="710" /> a long conference with the chief inspector and four other members of the inspection staff, at which the report was considered and discussed. The teachers' representatives were informed that the purpose of the conference was to have various matters included in the report clarified and, that having been done, the inspectors' views would be placed before the Minister.  At their next following meeting, held on 7th February, the executive decided to inquire from the Minister as to whether or not they might expect to be favoured with a statement of his observations on the report, pointing out at the same time that publication of the report had been held over in order to afford him an opportunity to consider it beforehand, but that the question of its issue could not be much longer postponed.  Up to the date of the preparation of this report, the Minister had not replied to the communication on the subject which had been addressed to him on 9th February.  At the meeting held on March 21st, it was decided that, subject to the approval of Congress, the report would be issued for publication following the first meeting of the new executive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that the teachers have had from the Minister is a letter dated 4th April, 1942, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to your letter of the 9th February last, relative to the report of the committee of inquiry into the question of teaching through the medium of Irish in English-speaking districts, I am directed to state that, as a result of the conference held recently, the representatives of your organisation are fully aware of the views of his Department, and the Minister does not find it necessary to add anything by way of formal observations.</P>
    <P>The Minister desires me to express to you his appreciation of your courtesy in holding over publication of the report pending its consideration by him and his Department.  The question whether the report should be published or not is, in the Minister's view, a matter which must be <Col N="711" /> left entirely to the discretion of your organisation.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Mise, le meas,</P>
    <P Just="Right">L. Ua Broin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If there is anything which ought, in the first place, to be taken out of politics and, in the second place, ought to be put in such a position that our people as a whole can have, if not complete confidence in the situation, sufficient confidence to say: &ldquo;Well, the best people, the people most qualified to do it, have decided this.  We know of no other qualified people to bring in on it, and we have to leave it in the hands of the people best qualified,&rdquo; it is this question of the Irish language. Now, I do not want to suggest that the Irish language is a matter of Party politics at the present time at all.  I think it is quite true that every Party in this House stands for the complete revival of the Irish language.  Nevertheless, it is a matter that is affected very much by politics.  People are afraid to discuss certain aspects of the teaching of Irish, lest it react on them politically.  I think that we have to take Irish completely away from that, and the only way that we can safeguard Irish against inhibitions that are brought about by political feelings is to decide, once and for all, for ourselves, who are the technicians in this matter of the Irish language, and to get the technicians to review the facts and to give us their opinions.  If either the Department or this House, reviewing the situation as other than technicians, but reviewing the technicians' opinions of the facts as presented by them, wish to modify the approach to the Irish language position in the schools or elsewhere, then we are at perfect liberty to do it, knowing, while we are doing it, that we have first had proper technical advice and a proper statement of the facts.</P>
    <P>When we look around, in order to see who are the people on whose technical efforts we are depending to restore the language, on whose technical advice we are depending to see whether the language is being restored or not, one group of people comes very <Col N="712" /> prominently to our minds, and these are the national school teachers. There is nobody, who has been in touch with the work that has been done for Irish in the last 20 years and longer, but must stand amazed at the amount of heroic work and at the amount of intelligent and first-class educational work that has been put into the teaching and the fostering of Irish by the national school teachers. We can say the same with regard to the secondary school teachers and other teachers, but I am discussing the national school teachers at the present time.  They have borne the hard part of the job.  In view of the extent to which their organisation went to select the particular type of teachers best qualified, in their opinion, because of the type of work they had been carrying on, if they do go to these people and get opinions from them as regards facts and as regards opinions, then they are going to the people who have done the hardest part of the job, and their opinions ought to be respected, as being sincerely given, and ought to be reviewed and commented on, and if weaknesses are detected here and there on the part of people who have been bearing the heavy end of the work, then, if necessary, they should be helped over some of the difficulties that they may be meeting at the present moment.  I think it is a shocking thing that they should be left in the position in which they are left at the moment by the Minister for Education, by the way in which this report has been accepted and treated.</P>
    <P>We cannot save the Irish language without the work of the national school teachers.  We cannot get the national school teachers to do their work unless there is complete trust, complete harmony, and complete understanding between themselves and the Department.  The very fact that the National School Teachers' Organisation has made a report which, it is suggested, is going contrary to the policy of the Department of Education, is going to have a shocking effect on the public mind, if that suggestion is to be left there.</P>
    <P>The report is written in such a way that you could take very many impressions <Col N="713" /> from it, and I want to suggest that there is one thing urgently necessary, and that is, that we should get an analysis by the Minister for Education of what the conclusions of that report are, an analysis that we can read on a sheet or two of paper.  Then we would get a reflection of the mind of the Minister on it, or the worked-out opinions of the inspectorate on it, but I do not think that that report can lie there without being epitomised by the Department itself, and without putting us here and our people into the position of having an epitome alongside it of the opinions of the inspectorate on the report, because if our teachers are one essential part of our technical personnel dealing with this matter, our inspectors are another. They may be more important in some respects; they are less important in others.  They are less important by reason of the fact that they have not the job of doing the detailed, slaving work.  They may be more important by reason of the fact that they can stand outside that work without being weighed down by the drudgery or the responsibility of handling it, and can give us a more detached opinion, say, than the person who is stuck into the work in a responsible way may be able to give.  So that we have our inspectors, then, as another part of our technical personnel, but at the present moment we have a report from the principal people concerned with the work and who have been concerned with the work for over 20 years.  Everyone of the people who signed that report is a person of high standing as a national school teacher, a person who has been connected with what we may call general, national work, outside his educational work, for many years.  I think that the average age of the five would be something like 44, and two of them have been presidents of the Irish National School Teachers' Organisation. Every one of them has been rated highly efficient during the whole of a comparatively long official career, and they have all been engaged in teaching through the medium of Irish. You have, therefore, ripe experience and responsibility; you have certified, efficient, educational service, and you <Col N="714" /> have a certain amount of general public experience and services given to what we may call the general, national cause.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, I do not think that that report can be left in the way in which the Minister has left it, and I bring forward this matter for the purpose of urging the Minister to give us a summary, as seen by him, of the conclusions that this report has come to, because that report will be misrepresented: you will get 47 different accounts of what it suggests, and our people, generally, ought not to be left in that position.  If the report is going to be left in that position, it will increase the very considerable amount of public dissatisfaction that exists already.</P>
    <P>Generally, on the question of education, I have repeatedly asked that subjects such as geography, history and mathematics should be taken, and that, three or four experienced national school teachers should be released from their work, one group being appointed to examine what the position of geography is in the national schools so that we might get a report on that and other groups to do the same in regard to history and mathematics.  If that were done it would give an opportunity of reviewing the whole of our educational position and programme.  That work would provide openings of employment for some of our unemployed teachers.  The main object I have in mind, in suggesting that, is to get a review that would be directly objective of the position with regard to particular subjects.  From a review of that kind you might be up against certain aspects of teaching through the medium of Irish, but it would be only as a by-product.  I have not any sympathy with the over simplification of the work that should be done in the primary schools.  In the beginning I quoted what the Taoiseach had said on that, but I do not hold him to it.  My opinion is that if we bow ourselves down to a complete and utter simplification of the primary school programme&mdash;to the level that is suggested &mdash;then we are going to take all hope out of our primary school life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> For a couple of years I have represented to the Minister that one of the things that is damaging the vivid life of the Irish language in the secondary schools is the fact that the alleged rule that the language of recreation and the language of outside school hours should be Irish, is not being adhered to.  I have urged that repeatedly.  The Minister, in a most unconvincing way, has said that what I urged is not true.  I want to repeat that what I have stated is true.  The one A school in the City of Dublin where that has been a rigid tradition up to the present&mdash;that Irish should be the language every moment of the day, the outside class language&mdash; is suffering to-day from a breakdown in that rule.  It is suffering in a way that is causing very great concern to those in charge of the school.  What had been a most rigid tradition for so many years in that school is now breaking down.  I do not know why.  If it is breaking down, I suggest that it is because that school has caught the disease from the other A secondary schools in the city where, for many years, the rule has not been observed, in spite of the Minister's protestations.</P>
    <P>I have urged before on the Minister that one of the things that is doing a very considerable amount of damage is that the work that has been going on for so many years on the Epistles and Gospels is not being speeded up so that we might have an Irish Missal.  I think that about four years before the former Government went out of office a sum of £1,000 was voted every year for the completion of Canon O'Leary's work.  Ten years have since passed.  In my view, one of the biggest blows that the language has received, in the case of secondary school children, is that at their age they get an English Missal into their hands.  If, instead, they had an Irish Missal they would have in their hands that whole treasury of literature and spiritual devotion which every secondary school child clings to.  If their introduction to that spiritual treasury is through the English language, then their contact with it is going to be through English.  The fact that the production of an Irish Missal has not been speeded up has been a very great blow to the work that <Col N="716" /> is being done in the secondary schools. It is also one of the things which has militated against the use of the language outside school hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that one of the great things that is wrong with the primary schools is the fact that the teachers do not use oral Irish sufficiently, but he did not indicate what he is doing to remedy that.  The main charge that I make against the Department is that it has lost completely its administrative touch and is not helping those who are bearing the burden of the day.  One of the tests that I put to the Minister is to show the way in which he is going to approach the situation caused by the publication of the report from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  It is essential that the language be spared the blow that would be given by a wrong handling of that situation by the Minister. I do not believe there is any real disagreement between the Department and the teachers.  I feel, however, that, in the report, there are elements which show that the people who have been doing the heavy part of that work up to the present are finding it a bit too heavy, and that it is time somebody would lift up their hands and encourage them.  It is time they would be helped and that whatever has to be done will be done after it has been fully reviewed by the technical people whom our people look to.  It is essential to take the Irish language away from being influenced in any way by politics.  It is essential, too, that people of all classes should know the importance of this work and see that it is being done on properly devised lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that we have under consideration the publication of an Irish Missal by An Gúm and I hope that, in spite of the difficulties of the war situation, it may be possible to get even a limited edition of this work published at reasonable prices.  The work of Canon O'Leary is in the hands of a competent editor who is closely in touch with the ecclesiastical authorities in Dublin and I think that work is going ahead.  Anything I can do to further it, of course, I will do.  As regards the A schools in <Col N="717" /> Dublin, there is, of course, a certain difficulty in maintaining Irish as the language of intercourse in A schools. The most successful A schools have been boarding schools, where the staff have the advantage of having complete control over the pupils at all hours.  If, for example, pupils from an A school in the city go out on to the street during the lunch interval or go home, it may not be easy to keep them from getting into an English atmosphere. I do not see that I can do very much in the matter, except to see that the regulations of the Department are carried out, so far as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the panel system and was followed by Deputy Brennan.  I do not think that the panel system really interferes with the managerial system, as the panel originated from proposals made to the Catholic Managers' Association by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. That was the origin of the panel.  The panel system was introduced to prevent teachers whom we were trying to maintain in their positions for a comparatively short period by giving them additional quarters, depending on their years of service, from losing their employment completely through falling averages in the schools.  I think the teachers are fortunate in the fact that the panel is not a national but a diocesan panel. If they were in the same position, let us suppose, as civil servants, they would have to go not alone from one part of the diocese to another, but from one part of the country to another.  They would also have to resign on marriage and they would not have the advantage of having representatives here.  I do not think there is any abnegation of the managerial system at all in the matter.  I think that the Deputies are under a misapprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the managers, through their association, voluntarily gave up the right of free choice to appoint whomsoever they wished to vacancies in their schools, and if we interfere with that and try to give the managers some freedom of choice, we will simply upset the whole system. We do try to make allowances, for example, <Col N="718" /> in the case of women teachers, who are generally concerned in those changes, where there are young children concerned.  In order not to compel teachers to move at awkward times, we try to give them a certain period before and after the birth of a child.  Periods of six months and nine months, respectively, I think, are allowed.  In addition to that, if the teacher is ill or has been recently ill, and it can be proved that the case is a <i>bona fide</i> one, we would be able to permit a teacher to remain in her existing school until such time as there was an improvement in her health, allowing her to appoint a substitute in the meantime.  I do not think there is anything further we can do in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the qualifications of secondary teachers.  I have indicated that that matter is under examination.  I do not think the position is bad, but neither can it be said to be entirely satisfactory.  The Deputy has raised a new question, that of having a teacher qualified in the particular subject he teaches.  That would, of course, raise a big question for a great many of our small schools. Eventually, if we are to proceed along that line, not alone of demanding a general level of competence, such as a university degree, but also qualifications of a fairly high level in the particular subjects which the teacher is to teach, certainly there will be a question of recompensing the schools for these rather stringent regulations. The schools will naturally approach the Department of Finance to know whether the necessary increases in their grants will be made to enable them to secure specialists.  I doubt very much if the scheme, even with a very generous Minister for Finance, will be possible in view of the small numbers in our smaller schools.  The matter is under consideration and, before taking any decision in the matter, we shall, as usual, consult the School Managers' Association.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the capacity of the teachers in &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; schools and seemed to think the schools are being unduly pushed on to teach all subjects through Irish.  I do not think that is the case.  If individual <Col N="719" /> inspectors are pressing the schools unduly in that manner, then certainly they are doing it without my authority and against the instructions which I have given the inspectors.  I have frequently spoken to the primary inspectors on that matter, and I think the secondary inspectors know the position.  As regards the standard of examination in the secondary branch, Deputy O'Sullivan felt that there had been some uneasiness.  His own personal experience did not seem to bear out that there was any reason for uneasiness with regard to the standard. In any case, that whole question of the standard of examination is at present under active consideration. The Deputy also referred to the school-leaving age and asked whether we proposed having consultations with other Departments regarding the matter. The school-leaving age question is largely one of finance.  It would mean an additional cost of £1,000,000 per annum to raise the school-leaving age to 16, and £450,000 is the estimate for raising it to 15.  There is also, of course, the question whether, in fact, the raising of the school-leaving age will relieve the unemployment situation. A good many persons approach the problem from that point of view. I think it is extremely doubtful whether there will be any relief in the employment situation, because the general age of entry into industry in this country is 16 years, so that in order to bridge the gap you would have to raise the school-leaving age to at least 16 years, and even then, as I say, you would not be affecting the supply of labour, nor would you be certain, if you were taking a certain number of juveniles out of the labour market, that you were replacing them by adult labour.</P>
    <P>There is also the important question of the application of the raising of the school-leaving age to rural areas.  Most of our rural schools are two-teacher schools, where each teacher has to handle three or four classes.  There is no provision, nor is it easy to see how, on the present system, a reorganisation could be made, by which pupils could be taken at 11 or 12 years of age and <Col N="720" /> put into a new environment, as most educationists would like, but we did hope that the vocational schools would be sufficiently extensive to give continuation education in a large number of areas.</P>
    <P>Of course, they are not sufficiently widely spread to give those continuation education courses in anything like the number of centres that we would wish.  There is the alternative of creating some other kind of school.  If we find that the basis of the vocational school system does not lend itself to setting up vocational schools in every parish, or in every small group of parishes, there is the alternative of setting up some other system of central schools, but I fear that, owing to the very small numbers we have in a great many rural schools, it would be very hard indeed to set up a system of continuation education schools in all rural areas to which all children, say, from 12 to 15 or 16 years of age would go. In the Department of Education the feeling that we have had is that we should approach the problem gradually by having this part-time experiment in the larger urban areas.  For reasons which I do not think I need go into at the moment, it has not been possible to get the scheme developed in the City of Dublin.  It would have been a very big financial undertaking, and there were other administrative difficulties.  But we got the scheme started in Cork and now in Limerick.  If we succeed in getting this part-time scheme, imperfect though it may be, into all the larger urban areas in the next few years, I think we shall be doing very well.  Later on, if the number of hours is increased, financial and other considerations permitting, that would be an additional advantage.</P>
    <P>We are in touch with other Departments about the general position.  I am deeply interested in the question of training for industry after the war, and in the question of apprenticeship. Those are matters into which the Department of Education will have to make special inquiry, and in order that the inquiry may be fruitful, it will be necessary to have the advice of other Departments, such as, say, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture, as <Col N="721" /> well as the opinions of industrial leaders and educationists outside the Department of Education altogether. Undoubtedly, the post-war period, in my opinion, is going to be very strenuous.</P>
    <P>There will be intense competition, and it will be necessary for countries like ours which, as Deputy Mulcahy rightly said, have little to offer our young people except education, to see that they get the best training possible for the difficulties that lie ahead of them.  In speaking to the teachers, I have emphasised the importance of their work in this connection.  I think we shall have to face the fact, as was pointed out recently by a speaker in another part of the country, that if there are hard and strenuous times before us, that will undoubtedly mean harder work, more application, and more thinking out of problems by our teachers and all those concerned with educational administration.</P>
    <P>I think that reasonably good work has been done in connection with school buildings.  Undoubtedly, when plans are being made for after the war, one of the projects that should commend itself to the Government is the entire rehabilitation of our school buildings. We have many hundreds of school buildings which have been condemned by the medical officers of health either as being quite unsuitable, or as being unsuitable, structurally or otherwise, for their purpose.  To replace those, even with much more generous financial provision, will take a period of years, but I think it is one of those matters which should be kept in mind in the post-war period, when possibly there may be serious economic depression and a demand for large scale public works.  With the limited amount of material available, we are doing our best to carry on with the programme of school building, but it is extremely difficult to get structural steel, for example, and I do not think we will be able to carry on building to any great extent in the future.  Perhaps all we may be, in fact able to do is to carry out urgent repairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the publication of theological works in <Col N="722" /> Irish.  I hope that that will be possible, and that they will have a much wider circle of readers than some of the very valuable works which we have published already and which, I am sorry to say, do not seem to be in demand.  The historical grant to which the Deputy referred, the grant to the Irish Committee of Historical Sciences, was reduced because there used to be an international conference on historical research held annually, and as this conference cannot now be held owing to the war, it is contended that there is a fairly sound reason for reducing the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>The question of the industrial school teachers is receiving constant consideration. A number of cases of teachers still remain to be dealt with, but a considerable number have been fixed up, and will come on to the pay roll of the Department of Education in the ordinary way.  It will be impossible, of course, to make allowance for exceptional cases.  I am sure that the inspectors, in assessing the teaching experience and competence of the existing teachers, have done everything possible to help, but if the inspectors definitely consider that they are not suitable and cannot recommend them for recognition, I fear that nothing further can be done in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan welcomed the announcement that the intention is to make the primary certificate examination in the national schools obligatory. For years we have been trying to get a scheme into operation by which we would have the full co-operation of the teachers' organisation, but we have not succeeded.  I hope it will be possible for the teachers, in the coming months, when they examine this question, to agree that such a scheme is necessary that children attending national schools are entitled to certificates to show that they have successfully passed the sixth or seventh standard.  I hope it will be recognised that such a certificate may be of the greatest value to children not alone in pursuing further studies but in seeking employment.</P>
    <P>The question of teachers is, of course, a very important one and one which must be constantly under consideration <Col N="723" /> in the Department of Education.  Whether we are getting the best teachers in our primary or other schools must, naturally, receive the most serious consideration. The position in the national schools is, I think, reassuring because we have now coming along for the first time young teachers who have followed a complete secondary course and who, subsequently, passed their examinations in the training colleges. They are tested in the preparatory college as to their ability and their suitability as teacher-candidates, and we are guided by the report of the principal of the college, aided by the advice of the staff.  If there is a question as to the suitability of a boy or girl we terminate the scholarship.  The training colleges are now getting candidates of a much higher standard of education than was formerly the case, with the result that there is more time than ever before to study teaching methods, to see that the teaching ability of students is fully tested and that they get every possible assistance throughout their course.  There are two examinations&mdash;one at the end of the first year and the final examination&mdash;and the inspectors of the Department come in on these examinations very closely, so that, I think, we may be assured that every reasonable effort is being made to test the teaching ability of our present teacher-candidates.  After they go out into the schools, they have, of course, to spend a period as probationary teachers.  They do not get their diploma in teaching until they have had two years' continuous service and have been reported upon by the inspectors.  Even after they are duly qualified and recognised as diploma-teachers, they have to run the gauntlet for a number of years.  All young teachers are subject to strict scrutiny and inspection by the inspectorial staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen referred to the question of school attendance in Dublin.  I think that there has been an improvement in that matter, but we have been considering amendments to strengthen the law.  It is, undoubtedly, a terrible state of affairs that nearly 7,000 children are absent daily.  Notwithstanding <Col N="724" /> that, we have to bear in mind that there has been a constant improvement in the attendance in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave the figure, I think, as 6,750.  Deputy Mullen also referred to juvenile crime.  There has not been an actual increase in juvenile crime, but there are tendencies in that direction.  It is noteworthy that under 14 years, and even under 12 years, we have had a certain number of convictions. It is not at all clear, therefore, that the parents are not more responsible than the schools.  As the Deputy seems to think that legislation should deal with this matter, I venture to say that the proper line of approach is to impress upon parents their duty towards their children and towards the community.  Furthermore, I feel that, under the juvenile instruction scheme which we have established in Dublin, it may be possible to do a great deal of valuable work through the boys' clubs, not to speak of the girls' clubs.  For the present we are concentrating on boys between 16 and 18 years of age who are at a loose end, and who possibly form the kernel of juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime.  We are trying to get at these through the clubs.  We are providing these clubs with instructors and facilities in conjunction with the Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  I am glad to say that the special committee of social workers who have taken up this matter in Dublin have approached the problem in a very earnest manner, and I am hoping that very good results indeed will accrue.  We have had the gracious co-operation and collaboration of His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin all the time, and it means a great deal for the ultimate success of the scheme that the Church authorities should be keenly interested in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there is as much foundation as Deputy Mulcahy would <Col N="725" /> lead the House to believe for his complaints regarding large classes.  As the Whit holidays intervened, I have not been able, during the short time at my disposal, to get returns in from the schools, but I would remind the Deputy that at this period&mdash;the last quarter of the school year&mdash;there is, generally, a very large influx of infants to the schools.  The next school year commences on 1st July and, normally there would be a re-arrangement of classes and children in the infant classes would move up.  At present we have in those classes infants who will be leaving on 1st July, as well as a large body of infants who have come in for the first time.  That swells the classes.</P>
    <P>I referred in previous years to the staffing.  The staffing in large schools works out as follows:&mdash;(1) seven assistants with the average attendance 300-340; (2) 12 assistants with the average attendance 500-540; (3) 17 assistants with the average attendance 700-740.  On the assumption that the principal does not take a class, this gives an average for each assistant in (1) of 43-49 pupils; in (2) of 42-45 pupils, and in (3) of 41-44 pupils.  As the school gets larger, the average attendance per teacher tends to fall towards 40.  In a circular which the Department issued in 1937, explaining to schools the necessity for careful organisation of these large classes, it was explained that the organisation of each school should be so arranged that, normally, the number of pupils enrolled in a class should not exceed 45.  That would give an attendance of 40-45 if the percentage of attendance were about 80.  I am informed that classes with more than 55 enrolments are seldom found in Dublin schools except in the infant classes during the last quarter of the school year, for the reason I have stated.  It is stated, also, that while the enrolment in such classes is high, the percentage of attendance is low, as the children, being of tender years, do not attend well.</P>
    <P>A report I have had recently from the inspectorate shows that the general efficiency of the schools and the welfare of the children have not been adversely affected to any appreciable <Col N="726" /> extent by the existence for a few months of these abnormally large infant classes.  Some of the new schools in Dublin, as Deputy Mulcahy knows, are doing remarkably good work, and there is a very high standard in the infant classes. Deputy Mulcahy complained that he was not getting the inspectors' reports.  I must say I am surprised if at least a résumé of the reports is not being published in the official report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be argued, however, that a résumé of all the inspectors' reports, given in the form of a single statement, is not very valuable, as, in the nature of things, one inspector's report must differ from another, and it is hard to convey the different impressions and the different opinions expressed by different inspectors, in a single document.</P>

      <P>It seems the shortage of paper is affecting us, but, if it is at all possible, the reports will be printed. If they cannot be printed, I see no reason why they should not be made available in the Library.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to the decline in the number of schools in which all the work is being done through Irish.  There has been a certain reduction, partly accounted for by a reduction in the total number of schools.  I think there has been a reduction of 100, roughly speaking, in the number of schools between 1937-38 and 1939-40.  We have also been emphasising to the schools, through the inspectors and through official circulars, that where the two conditions&mdash;of the teacher's competence <Col N="727" /> to give the instruction through Irish and the pupils' ability to receive such instruction&mdash;were not being fulfilled, that teaching through Irish should not proceed, with the result that undoubtedly there has been a decline in the number.  I think the decline of such schools in the Fior-Ghaeltacht was last year entirely due to a reduction in the number of pupils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is.  The Deputy referred to general lack of vision and lack of performance in the Department of Education.  I think, in spite of the times, we are doing reasonably well.  We have, as Deputy Brennan stated, introduced a number of reforms in secondary education which, we hope, will be very valuable and which have been accepted and welcomed by the schools.  We are making further investigations as to how the scheme of secondary education can be improved.  Unfortunately, in the case of additional examinations, a proposal that we have been contemplating very seriously, we find that the cost is prohibitive in present circumstances, so I am afraid it may not be possible to institute these.  Anything, however, that can be done administratively to secure a higher standard of efficiency, will be done, even if a certain financial burden results, so long as it is not an undue burden.</P>
      <P>Even in present circumstances I think the Government will feel that, since we are spending such a large sum of money on education&mdash;over £5,000,000 per year&mdash; it would be a mistake not to spend a few extra thousands if it were found necessary and if it can be convincingly shown that such relatively small expenditure is needed either to assess the value of what we are getting from the schools or to improve the efficiency of the schools generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the report of the inquiry carried out by the National Teachers' Organisation, the position is that the question of the revival of the Irish language is a very fundamental and a very grave one, inasmuch as <Col N="728" /> those who are charged with carrying it out, as the present Government and I are to a certain extent, know that there are very serious obstacles in the way, and that those obstacles can only be overcome by a clear realisation that we have got to accept this task of reviving Irish in a truly national manner. We have to see that all the belief in the revival of the language, for which all Parties in the House equally feel a responsibility, is not merely a matter of feeling that something should be done by somebody else, but that every possible effort should be made by everybody to carry the language revival through.</P>
    <P>It was recognised at an early stage that the chief instrument for the revival of the language was the schools, particularly the primary schools, and it was really as a result of the efforts of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation that a commission was set up in 1920 which recommended very drastic changes in the programme which the old National Board of Education had then in operation.  Following on that 1920 commission, a commission was appointed in 1925 which reported in 1926, and in that year its findings were sent to the schools, confirming in the main the findings of the then existing programme based on the commission set up by the Irish national teachers in 1920.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that neither the Minister nor the Department of Education is responsible for the programme.  The programme in operation has come from successive commissions, the first one appointed by the teachers, and on the second the Department of Education had not even a representative, and it could not be regarded by any stretch of the imagination as a departmental committee or commission.  The part played by the Department was simply to put it into operation, with modifications from time to time, if considered advisable and, perhaps, in conference with the other educational interests, certain amendments of policies.  The present programme is based on the work of the 1925-26 conference and the notes, circulars and instructions to inspectors issued since then have been all on the basis of that programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> I think I had better read an extract from the evidence given by the Secretary of the Department of Education to the Commission on Vocational Organisation, in which he set out the meaning of these changes in the programme.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The programme recommended by the Commission of 1925-26 was accepted by the Minister for Education and his recommendations as to the methods of carrying out that programme were put into operation as far as possible.  The recommendation that teaching through Irish should be introduced in a gradual and progressive manner was, perhaps, the most important of those contained in the valuable introductory statement and this recommendation was implemented by the Department of Education in a number of circulars.  In addition to this, instructions were issued from time to time to inspectors impressing on them that the teaching of other subjects through Irish should be encouraged only when it was perfectly clear that the teachers were fully competent to carry this out and the pupils had a sufficient grasp of the language to benefit fully by the instruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Deputies will consult the Department of Education circular of July, 1931, they will find given in detail there the instructions of the Department which make it quite clear that only where the teacher is competent to give instruction through Irish and the pupil is able to receive it, should teaching in Irish proceed.  Teaching through Irish is not obligatory unless the two conditions are fulfilled&mdash;that is, the ability of the teacher to give instruction and the ability of the pupils to receive it.  This is portion of what appears in the circular:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In making the suggestions in this circular in amplification of those contained in Section 6 of the general notes to the programme the Department desires it to be clearly understood that these suggestions are to be taken subject to the principle that even the partial use of Irish as a medium of instruction is not obligatory <Col N="730" /> unless the two conditions, viz., ability of the teacher to give the instruction and ability of the pupils to receive it, are present in sufficient degree to warrant the success of the attempt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The circular then goes on to point out that while the number of favourably-circumstanced schools for the purpose of teaching through Irish is not numerous, nevertheless, Irish as a teaching medium might be introduced. The actual wording of the circular is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the introduction of Irish as the teaching medium under this plan must be determined by a wise provision for the actual conditions of each school in accordance with the aims and principles previously enunciated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the circular, the following appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Should the teacher's performance, in the opinion of the inspector, fall short of the reasonable possibilities of his school, the inspector will indicate clearly in his report what the shortcomings are, and the teacher will not suffer in his rating until he has definitely failed within a year to make adequate improvements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is only where the inspector as well as the teacher is satisfied that the effort could reasonably be made in the conditions existing and that it was possible to carry our instruction through Irish.</P>

      <P>I am again indebted to Mr. O'Neill's evidence to the Commission on Vocational Organisation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In fact, the progress of teaching other subjects through Irish has been <Col N="731" /> so slow that in 1934, 12 years after the introduction of the first national programme, only about 10 per cent. of Standards I, II and III, about 2.5 per cent. of Standard IV, and not even 1 per cent. of Standards V and VI and VII were being taught through Irish in the English-speaking areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the latest figures that I have at my disposal, of 4,026 national schools in English-speaking areas on 30th June, 1941, only 255, or 6.3 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish only.  Of the remainder, 3,771 national schools, 828 schools, or 21.9 per cent. teach through Irish to infant classes only; 353 schools, or 9.3 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish up to First Standard inclusive; 417 schools, or 11.05 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish up to Second Standard inclusive; 101 schools, or 2.67 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish up to Third Standard inclusive; 69 schools, or 1.8 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish up to Fourth Standard inclusive; 27 schools, or .71 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish up to Fifth Standard inclusive; 6 schools, or .16 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish up to Sixth Standard inclusive; and one school, or .02 per cent., teach all subjects through Irish up to Seventh Standard inclusive.  It has to be remembered, in considering these figures, that the use of Irish as a teaching medium is more general in schools under religious communities than in ordinary lay schools.</P>
    <P>I think the first grievance one might have against the report of the teachers' inquiry is to be found on page 12:&mdash;&ldquo;It may be noted in this connection that out of 857 teachers replying to query 24 of the questionnaire, 525 stated that as a result of official suggestion and contrary to their own opinions they had taught subjects through the medium of Irish when the conditions set out by the Department were not fulfilled&rdquo;&mdash; namely, teacher qualified and pupil competent to benefit by instruction. We do not know what the type of official suggestion was under which these teachers began to teach through <Col N="732" /> Irish.  Apparently they were not very successful and the question arises whether the evidence, if it may be called evidence, of these 525 teachers, set out in the form in which it is in this report, can be considered as a fair commentary or whether they would be regarded as reasonably efficient exponents of Irish teaching, not to speak of whether, in addition to that, they were competent investigators of all the different aspects of this rather serious problem which they undertook to examine. The constitution of the committee of inquiry, although they had the benefit of a number of highly efficient teachers, is very striking when one has regard to the fact that although a great deal of the report is taken up with conditions in the infant schools, there is no woman teacher on this committee of inquiry and, so far as I know, none of the men teachers, however highly efficient they may be&mdash;I do not question their abilities as teachers&mdash; can be said to have great experience of the actual conditions in infant schools.</P>
    <P>Another point, of course, is that we have no evidence that the schools in which it has been proved that the teaching of infants in Irish has been successful or the schools in which the teaching of other subjects through Irish has been proved successful were visited by these teachers nor do we know whether the opinions of the highly successful teachers in the highly successful schools were picked out for special consideration.  One has the feeling that all the opinions of the teachers, efficient or highly efficient as they may be, were put in under a common denominator without regard to the actual conditions or circumstances of the particular school.  Nobody, no inspector or other person or independent person has had an opportunity of examining these teachers as to the statements they have made.  We find, for example, that the teachers are asked what is the relevant benefit to the child of teaching through Irish or teaching through English.  That question, of course, may connote different things to different persons.  We do not know what particular interpretation the average junior assistant mistress in a country school might put upon it.  I <Col N="733" /> think we must certainly feel that a number of opinions gathered together in this fashion would not be as valuable as a type of report which would give us the considered opinions, if possible under cross-examination by some expert teachers, of the relatively small number of teachers who are highly efficient and who have shown themselves to be highly successful in carrying out the programme.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education has never claimed&mdash;and I think a study of the instructions, some points in which I have read out to the House, and of the general trend of our work, will prove that we have never tried&mdash;to force teachers or schools to carry out a policy of teaching through Irish if the conditions I have mentioned did not exist.  But what we have believed, and what I think inspectors would be justifiably permitted to place before teachers and managers, is that we have a certain national policy before us: we have to endeavour to make that policy successful; we have accepted the position that the schools are the chief agency for making it successful and, therefore, teachers, if they are qualified for the work, should make reasonable efforts to carry out the programme of teaching through Irish, in so far as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the present Report, as I have said, shows a lack of acquaintance with actual conditions in infant schools, particularly infant schools, which have been successful in this work and which might be regarded as <Col N="734" /> examples of what could be done.  Instead of giving a picture of the work done in the best type of infant schools we have in the City of Dublin, for example, a great deal of the Report &mdash;pages 18 to 19&mdash;is given up to emphasising the strain on the children. Great stress is laid upon the physical and mental strain on the pupils.</P>
    <P>One wonders how the amount of this strain is assessed and in what way, if there is strain, it can be attributed to this particular cause.  It would seem to be a medical question, a highly technical one, to determine the amount of strain and what the cause of it may be.  No evidence is given as to the deleterious effect upon the physique of the child.  It is scarcely sufficient, I think, in a matter of this kind to say, &ldquo;One cannot fail to conclude that a certain position exists.&rdquo; The statement regarding mental and physical exhaustion, strain and repression, ought to be supported by some evidence, giving us an actual picture of the conditions in the schools where these things are said to exist.  I think it gives an unbalanced view of the situation when this element of strain is over-emphasised.  In the same way, one might come to the entirely wrong conclusion that if there were no Irish in the infant schools everything would be perfect; there would be no malnutrition, no ill-health, and that all the things which little children suffer from, under-nourishment and disease, would disappear.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Minister but the important thing to get at is, is there a difference in policy implied between this report and the policy of the Minister, and what is the difference?  That is the important thing that, I think, we have to get at.  The Minister says he has a line of policy.  What parts of that policy are challenged?  Is there a policy stated in this report?  Can the Minister say it clashes with his policy and, if so, where does the clash come?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the inquiry is a challenge clearly to the present policy of teaching infants in Irish or teaching other subjects through Irish in the schools.  I do not <Col N="735" /> think it would be to the advantage of the cause of Irish, or of education for that matter, to have a public controversy on this matter.</P>

      <P>The inspectors have met the teachers and have explained to them the Department's point of view. They have explained to them, for example, that in the remarks made in this report about the infant schools, an entirely unjustifiable and wrong account is given of actual conditions in infant schools.  I am quite sure the teachers have had an opportunity of telling inspectors where the conditions exist which caused them to make these statements.  All I can say is that if such conditions do exist&mdash;which I very much doubt&mdash;they are a proof that wrong methods&mdash;entirely wrong and unjustifiable methods, and entirely contrary to the instructions and the policy of the Department&mdash;are employed.  But I think it will be agreed that this report reveals a lack of understanding of the actual conditions in the best infant schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that when <Col N="736" /> changes in education are in contemplation, they can be made either by commissions or, like the changes we have made in connection with secondary education recently, more speedily and perhaps more efficiently if there should be a necessity for them, by conference and consultation with the other bodies represented.  We have always been in touch with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  In 1934, even though the programme had already been reduced considerably in 1926, following on a previous reduction in the number of subjects in 1920, we again severely reduced the programme to what I think might be described as the minimum that might be required in a primary school, in order to make room for Irish and to ensure that sufficient time was given for the very important national work of Irish.  As I say, no attention seems to have been given to the results that have been achieved in the schools where the programme has been made a success.  In fact, these results would seem to be denied.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
