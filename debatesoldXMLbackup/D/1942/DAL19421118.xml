      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the date upon which the last examination for clerical officers was held, and the date upon which the results were announced; if he will state whether he has received any complaints about the delay in announcing the results, and if he will state the cause of the delay.</P>

      <P>Since the year 1936, inclusive, the results of this competition have been available only on two occasions before the 10th October.  In the year 1937, the results were issued on the 3rd November.</P>
      <P>In the present year the competition was held about the normal time, in July, but it was only possible to issue the results on the 3rd November, owing to the fact that urgent examination work additional to the normal annual programme had to be dealt with during the period July to November.  No complaints of delay have been received.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that a number of persons who took out hawkers' licences for the year ending 31st March, 1943, are prevented by transport restrictions from carrying on their business.  There is no statutory authority for the repayment of hawker's licence duty where a hawker <Col N="2023" /> ceases trading during the currency of his licence, and I do not propose to provide for such repayment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the number and (b) the value of Swiss watches invoiced to Irish nationals now held by the customs section of the General Post Office; the period for which and the grounds on which they are so held; whether, if these goods are held on his instructions, he will state the grounds on which such instructions were framed, and the nature of the inquiries made by him regarding the <Col N="2024" /> effect such instructions will have on employment in the retail jewellery and kindred trades, and on the credit abroad of Irish importers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that in consonance with the existing restrictions in the public interest on the publication of detailed trade statistics, I cannot furnish the particulars sought in the first part of the Deputy's question. I understand that quantities of watches have been held by the customs authorities for various periods extending up to about five months awaiting release on payment of the appropriate customs duty by the consignees. Watches, as in the case of other customable goods, cannot be released except on payment of duty and in the circumstances no special instructions were necessary.</P>
      <P>I may add that I am satisfied that supplies of watches and watch parts in excess of normal requirements have already been imported during the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the consignor has indicated his willingness to accept a cheque payable on an Irish bank for the amount involved in this case; and, if so, what is the reason for the withholding of the watches in view of the fact that there is a duty of £10,000 involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the banks have been forbidden by his Department to buy foreign currency for the purpose of enabling their customers to pay for quantities of Swiss watches held for their customers by the Customs authorities; whether this prohibition was based on the grounds that the demand for foreign currency could not be met by his Department; and, if so, whether he will state why the Department refused later to release watches where the Swiss exporters have intimated their willingness to give delivery without any transfer of foreign currency or of sterling from this country; and, further, whether he will state why Irish importers are prohibited from taking delivery of goods already lying in this country in circumstances which do not involve the buying of foreign currency or the export of Irish currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the first and second parts of the question are in the affirmative.  In regard to the third part of the Deputy's question a payment to an account in an Irish bank in the name of a Swiss firm would create a liability to make a payment to Switzerland at a future date and is, therefore, open to objections similar to those which obtain in the case of a current payment in Swiss currency, having regard to the purpose and effect of Emergency Powers (Finance) Orders.  On the other hand, these orders would not apply to any cases in which delivery of the watches was secured on the basis solely of payment of the appropriate customs duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware <Col N="2026" /> that the frontiers of the country from which these watches come, namely, Switzerland, are now closed and that. these goods are irreplaceable at the moment and will be so for years to come?  In these circumstances, is he prepared to release these goods on payment being made in accordance with the arrangements already suggested to this Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why the old age pension of 6/- a week payable to Mr. Patrick Corbett, Moore Hall, Ballyglass, County Mayo, was withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person is one of a married couple living together, his means for old age pension purposes are taken to be one-half of the total means of the couple.  When Mr. Corbett's claim to pension was investigated, his wife was alive and he was regarded as entitled to this concession. Mrs. Corbett died before her husband attained the age of 70 and, in consequence, his means should have been calculated at their actual figure without any allowance in respect of the wife.  When the facts regarding Mrs. Corbett's death were ascertained, Mr. Corbett's old age pension was withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. Corbett has no means; that at one time he had a small farm which he assigned to his son; that, after that took place, he was awarded a pension of 6/- which he <Col N="2027" /> applied to have increased to 10/-; that it was increased by the local committee to 10/-; that an appeal was made to the Department of Local Government; and that the pension was swept away altogether?  Is it not as clear as daylight that Mr. Corbett is entitled not only to the 6/- pension but to the entire 10/- pension?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <P>It has been decided to arrange for the importation of oats from Canada to supplement the quantity of oats which may become available from the native harvest to meet the requirements of oatmeal millers.  It is not clear that the quantity of native oats delivered to millers will be adequate to ensure a full supply of oatmeal.</P>

It will, however, be available to supplement home-grown feeding stuffs in order to encourage a greater production of pigs.</P>

      <P>I am aware that permits for the purchase of anthracite for use in anthracite heating stoves have been refused not only in the case of national schools, but in the case of institutions generally throughout the country.  I cannot agree with the Deputy's assertion that turf or wood cannot be burned in anthracite stoves as experiments carried out by the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau at my request have established that slow combustion stoves are capable of burning low-grade fuels such as moist turf and sawdust without difficulty.  In fact, it appears from the tests that have been made that these fuels were burned more efficiently in slow combustion stoves than would be possible in an open grate.  The refusal of permits for the purchase of anthracite for anthracite heating stoves should not, therefore, as the Deputy suggests, lead to the closing down of national schools and I see no reason in view of the present critical position in regard to coal supplies to modify my present policy in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Emergency Scientific <Col N="2038" /> Research Bureau has, since its inception, been giving continuous attention to the problem of alternative fuels for motor transport and has concluded that producer gas plants form the only approach to its solution.  The bureau is making researches into the best solid fuels for this purpose and also into the question of the most reliable type of plant, and is in close touch with commercial firms who have successful producer vehicles in operation.  The greatest difficulty arises from the inadequate supplies of the necessary solid fuel in the event of a further reduction in the supply of liquid fuel.  Supplies of native anthracite, suitable for mobile producers, would be inadequate for the country's requirements if petrol went off the market.  The alternatives to anthracite are wood charcoal and turf charcoal.  Wood charcoal is at present being produced in fair quantities as the result of private commercial effort.  The Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, in conjunction with the Turf Development Board, is developing methods for producing turf charcoal both in a large experimental plant and by means of pits.  Consideration is being given to the production of turf charcoal by these means in various parts of the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the harbour commissioners in many of our smaller ports are unable to carry on owing to the cessation of shipping; that some ports are falling into disrepair and will require large sums to put them into proper condition after the war; and whether he will make a grant to harbour commissioners so circumstanced to maintain these ports.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the harbour authorities of some of the smaller harbours of purely local importance are in financial difficulties at the present time owing to the practical cessation of trading to these harbours. There are no funds under my control available for the assistance of such undertakings.

      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he is aware that in the case of the harbour in which I am principally interested&mdash;Westport Harbour&mdash;the funds are rapidly becoming exhausted and the harbour is going into decay?  A comparatively small sum, if expended at the present time, would prevent that happening, whereas, if the Minister dawdles, a large amount of money will be involved. I am aware that there is only a very small amount of money under the Minister's control for this purpose, but could he not apply for a supplementary grant in a matter of such importance as this, because it is a very important matter?</P>

      <P>The measures for the treatment of tuberculosis in each county and county borough, including the after-care of patients discharged from sanatoria, are under the control of local authorities. Patients who are discharged from central sanatoria to their own areas are advised to report to the local tuberculosis officer.  A patient may leave at any time on his own responsibility without being discharged, but if he does so he is advised to report to the local tuberculosis officer.  If patients in local sanatoria are discharged to their homes they remain under the care of the tuberculosis officer.</P>
      <P>Where discharged patients require artificial pneumothorax treatment the necessary arrangements are made by the local tuberculosis officer.  Discharged patients who are unable to attend at tuberculosis dispensaries are visited in their own homes by the tuberculosis officer and, in some districts, by the district medical officer of health, and by a tuberculosis nurse. Isolation, as far as possible, is advised. In the case of patients who are in poor circumstances assistance is given on the recommendation of the medical officer.</P>

      <P>The statutory conditions for a contributory widow's pension require a payment of 104 contributions at the rate proper to this country.  If an insured person fails to make the required number of payments, contributions paid while employed outside the country under the insurance scheme in force in that country cannot be reckoned for the purpose of assessing a pension under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  I am not aware, however, that the position in this respect is of such a general nature as to call for any action at present.</P>

      <P>There are four approved blind agencies which provide facilities for the training and employment in suitable occupations of blind persons. The nature of the employment consists of basket-making, brush-making, mattress-making, rug-making, knitting, re-caning and repairing chairs, copying and binding Braille books and Braille <Col N="2047" /> music writing.  The only representations received in my Department as regards the inadequacy of employment by approved blind agencies related to difficulties in procuring necessary materials for blind workers employed in the above occupations.  Local authorities have been advised to send to approved agencies blind persons suitable for industrial training, but in the prevailing conditions it is unlikely that the facilities for training can be extended or improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the medical staff of the local authority have made all the investigations possible to determine the cause of the occasional outbreaks of typhoid in the Allihies area and they have also taken precautions to prevent the spread of the infection.  Three cases of typhoid fever have occurred during the current year.  The local medical staff could obtain no evidence which would indicate a common source of infection in these cases from milk or water supplies, and in their view the contamination of food supplies by undetected typhoid carriers would appear to be the only possible cause.  There is always great difficulty in dealing with the typhoid carrier.  Instructions have been given by the local medical staff in regard to the precautions to be taken for the purpose of preventing the spread of infection and prophylactic inoculation has been given to contacts, and my Department has suggested that inoculation should be offered free to the local inhabitants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together as they relate to the same subject.</P>
      <P>The information in regard to the estimated weight of pigs available and the actual weight of pigs supplied to factories in each of the six months ended 30th September is given in the form of a tabular statement which will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The estimated weights of pigs for April, May and June include supplementary quotas.  Such quotas when issued were issued to all bacon curers. While there is an apparent discrepancy between estimated weights and the actual weights received at bacon factories, it will be appreciated that illegal curing was being done to a considerable extent during the period in question and also that pork butchers were free to take as many pigs as they could dispose of in the form of pork. As the Deputies are no doubt aware steps have been taken to suppress illegal curing and to limit the number of pigs purchased by pork butchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that as No. 6&mdash;St. Laurence O'Toole Hospital Bill&mdash;was regarded as controversial, it was not being taken during the session. I understand representations have been made to the Government that that was so.  Very strong views were held here that it was a highly controversial measure.  Why is it included <Col N="2092" /> now, having regard to the facilities afforded the Government since the emergency began?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy calls controversial business.  With all respect, I think that a Bill dealing with an urgent matter like the building of a hospital in Dublin cannot be regarded as controversial business.  We have had business discussed here during the past year that might, I think, be regarded as much more controversial than a Bill of this kind.  The Deputy has said more than once that he thought this was controversial, but that was never accepted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have drawn attention to the fact on more than one occasion that this was controversial. On the last occasion I instanced reasons for objecting to this measure. The Minister has referred to the need for building a hospital, as if anybody has any illusions regarding the possibility of building during the existence of the emergency.  I have pointed out that the hospital board which had run the hospital for something like 20 years was opposed to this measure.  I understand the case that is being made now is that the board has agreed&mdash;and for a very good reason.  The Parliamentary Secretary has discovered that the Minister has as much power over this hospital as he has over the Dublin Board of Assistance.  He has vacated certain seats and put on his own nominees, including a member of the House and a paid official of his Department. If that be regarded as a reason for urgent building and for the proposed transfer of a hospital that is in the city to a district that, until a few years ago, was outside the city, a district that is in the county, I can understand perfectly the desire that nothing should arise in the emergency to disturb what is euphemistically called national unity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anything the Deputy has said would convince anybody that the Bill was a controversial one in the sense that we generally accept controversial matters here.  For that matter, every Bill is <Col N="2093" /> controversial.  The last one I had to deal with was the Central Bank Bill, and I do not think you could get a more controversial measure.  There was no objection to that Bill on controversial grounds.  The Trade Union Bill was controversial, and the County Management Bill was controversial, much more so than a purely local Bill to deal with what I think is a very urgent matter.  There is nothing more urgent in the City of Dublin than the planning of a new hospital, and, even if this Bill were passed within the next three or four months, nothing can be done for a long time to implement it, because planning will be required.  It will take a year or two years to plan, and we cannot start the plans until the Bill is passed.  There is no legal power at present to spend a penny on putting the buildings, which are in a dangerous condition in that hospital, in order. That makes the matter very urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is insensible to the controversial nature of this measure, and if he stands on the point of its being very urgent, can we have any explanation of why we stopped consideration of this measure more than 12 months ago and why the House was asked to pay no attention to it during the period since?  I understand that the order is that we resume consideration of the Bill on amendment No. 16.  It is more than 12 months since we dealt with that amendment, which does not fit in with the Minister's statement that it is urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me; the Deputy did do that.  If the Minister will look up the point, he will see that in the original Act the section says: &ldquo;If a parent is providing suitable education otherwise.&rdquo;  Now only these excuses set out are allowed, and it does not come under Section 4 of this Act, which defines suitable education <Col N="2096" /> otherwise than in a suitable or recognised school.  There was provision for that case in the original Act, but there is no such provision here, and parents, if they do it, are violating the law and should be prosecuted, according to the Bill.

      <P>I know the Minister has not, but does he not see that that is my point?  He is making it an offence for parents to act as I suggest precisely because he has no power to act outside the State.  It is an offence under this Bill and he makes no provision for it.  People frequently send their children out of the State to school.  They have a parental right to do so, and I do not think the Minister should interfere with it; but undoubtedly he is making them commit an offence if they do so, because, as he says, he has no power to certify any of these schools as a suitable school.  That is his own statement. Which proviso of this legislation makes provision for such a parent? Surely not Section 4?  I object to the amendment, and I say that the Minister has no conception of the rights of parents.</P>

But he is now dealing with parents in this State, not outside the State, who send their children to schools outside this State, and he says that he cannot certify them.  In other words, they are not sending their children to a suitable school within the meaning of this Bill.  They come under none of the exceptions mentioned here; in other words, as a result of the legislation the Minister is proposing, they are committing an offence, and the only answer that the Minister gives when he does that is to say that, though they are committing an offence, it is to be overlooked.  That is decidedly bad legislation.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), (a), line 35, page 2, after the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;provided however that whenever a child has been prevented from attending school by sickness for more than one week, the parent shall forward to the principal teacher a medical certificate or certificates covering the whole period of absence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the reasonable excuses given for a child being absent from school is that the child has been prevented from attending school by the sickness of the child.  I propose to add, after the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; the words &ldquo;provided, however, that whenever a child has been prevented from attending school for more than one week, the parent shall forward to the principal teacher a medical certificate or certificates covering the whole period of absence&rdquo;. I submit that an amendment like that is necessary for a certain number of reasons.  Firstly, we are dealing here with compulsory school attendance.  I take it that we are dealing with that for a general, national purpose, and that you do not want to introduce another compulsion on parents, but I think that in so far as any additional influence can be brought on parents to see that children who are sick are medically attended, use should be made of any opportunities to bring about that influence, and therefore I think it is advisable, in the first instance, that a child who is sick for, say, a week, should have a doctor called in, and also that if a medical certificate is not produced, we should know up to what stage a certificate of the parents will be accepted that the absence of the child is caused by illness. I think that if the administration of the law is to be effective there should be no serious objection to the requirement, by statute, that absence of the child from school for a period of over a week, in the case of illness, should be covered by a medical certificate.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  I think it would add great difficulties to the administration <Col N="2100" /> of the school attendance code.  It would impose hardship upon parents of slender means, who would have to pay for these medical certificates. I do not think that any further steps are necessary, beyond the measures that have been laid down in the present Bill, and I do not think that this is one which should be added.</P>

      <P>If the Minister considers that he has given a considerable amount of thought to this, I have no desire to press the amendment, but you have the situation that a very considerable amount of attention is being paid now to the question of public medical services for children, and the necessity for doing that is becoming more and more apparent.  I do not quite see the Minister's point as to the expensiveness of having these medical certificates issued.  I think that if a doctor is attending a patient of any kind there is no very great expense in providing certificates for various purposes, and I do not think there should be very much expense involved in providing certificates to cover the absence of children from school.</P>

      <P>On Section 3, Sir. Sub-section (2) says: &ldquo;any of the following shall be a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with this section&rdquo;, and then paragraph (d) gives as one of the reasons that the child has been prevented from attending school by some other unavoidable cause.  I should like to ask the Minister what he has in mind when he uses the phrase &ldquo;unavoidable cause&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult to lay down the different causes which might be regarded by the court and by reasonable persons as being unavoidable. Complaints have been made from <Col N="2101" /> time to time that the existing provision is not sufficiently rigid.  On the Second Reading, Deputy Linehan suggested that if the day were a very bad one and the child had to travel a considerable distance, for example, in heavy rain, possibly not very well clad or shod, that should be considered as an unavoidable cause.  As matters stand now, that question will be left to the determination of the court.  It would not be feasible, I think, to put down an amendment setting out the different reasons, including even that particular reason of bad weather.  We are not blest with a very good climate and any suggestion that bad weather conditions would be sufficient reason for keeping children from school would, I fear, be taken advantage of by those who are anxious to get some pretext to keep their children from school.  I have given the matter a certain amount of consideration, but I have not been able to say what should be regarded as sufficient cause, so much depends on the particular circumstances, and I think that the court, which, presumably, will have all the facts before it, would be able to decide whether the cause in fact is unavoidable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position then is that this is the phrase which puts it in the power of a parent to come before a court and plead that a particular set of circumstances were an unavoidable cause for keeping the child from school, and the discretion is then left entirely to the court?</P>

      <P>Section 3 (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The parent of any child to whom the Principal Act applies shall, unless there is a reasonable excuse for not so doing, cause such child to attend a national school, a suitable school, or a recognised school....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would indicate the difference between a &ldquo;suitable school&rdquo; and a &ldquo;recognised school&rdquo; as referred to in this particular Bill.  From the point of view of this Bill, does the definition of &ldquo;suitable school&rdquo; or &ldquo;recognised <Col N="2102" /> school&rdquo; exclude a school on the other side of the Border, say, in Fermanagh, Derry, Down or Armagh?  Does it prevent a school on the other side of the Border being recognised as either a suitable school or a recognised school?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There are the ordinary national schools; there are other suitable schools, that is to say, schools which are certified by the Minister as suitable.  There are recognised schools defined in Section 2 of the Bill.  As regards the question of schools across the Border, that is a matter, as I have indicated on the last amendment, I fear it would be impossible to deal with, as far as I can see, in the present Bill.  The position has been there for the past 16 years.  I do not think it has given rise to any serious trouble and I do not anticipate that the present provisions are likely to give rise to any serious trouble either.  As I have said, I think, if parents are prosecuted for sending their children to school outside the jurisdiction of the State, the court will have regard to the circumstances.</P>

      <P>That is what we have got to now.  The answer is quite as intelligent as what the Minister gave up to the present.  The Minister says the position has obtained for 16 years, but the Minister does not recognise that he is now limiting and fixing what are recognised excuses. Before, there was a general clause as regards the child getting suitable education elsewhere.  That is gone. Under this Bill if a person in Inishowen sends his child to Derry, he violates the provisions of this Bill, and is liable to prosecution, and the only thing the <Col N="2103" /> Minister can say is that the court will ignore the Act.  I argued that already. I do not want to go into it again. There is no good in arguing the matter. The Minister says the position has been there for 16 years, when he is changing the whole business, and when he is limiting the power that was there under Section 4, sub-section (b) of the Act of 1926.</P>

      <P>We hear a great deal from time to time in this country about the curse of Partition, but here now, and almost unsuspectingly, this House is asked to pass a law under which if the Acts as we pass them were to be administered according to the letter and clear indication of these Acts, it would be an offence for a child to cross the Border to go to a school contiguous to its place of residence. We are putting it into the power and making it the duty of Civic Guards or school attendance committees to prosecute the parent of that child, and as far as the effect on the parent and child is concerned, we are leaving it to the district justice to shut his eyes to the wording of the legislation which is the only thing he is supposed to have regard to, if he wants to decline to penalise the parent for sending the child across the Border to school.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now some weeks since, on Second Reading of the Bill, I asked the Minister some questions.  I was hoping that he might answer them in his reply, but he has not done so.  Before I proceed to discuss the section, perhaps I might repeat the questions to him.  The Minister has had a couple of weeks to get the information.  Could he give me any idea in how many prosecutions under the Act of 1926 was clause 4 (b) pleaded as an excuse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister does not remember a single word of the speech that I made here on that occasion, because he did not deal with the points I raised.  Although this is a very important matter, I am not aware that the Minister thought it even worth discussing it in his reply. What I have in mind is the rights of parents, guaranteed not merely by the Constitution, but the natural law. One of the matters that I was particularly keen on&mdash;and one of the matters which I have no doubt the Minister will not look up in my speech &mdash;was what were the practical reasons that might induce him to take what seems to me to be a dangerous step&mdash; I do not want to say it is a direct violation, but I think it is decidedly dangerous.  It might have helped me <Col N="2107" /> in that case if the Minister thought it worth while to find out, when he was introducing Section 4 of the Bill as it now stands, how often, in fact, it had been pleaded that the parent was giving satisfactory education.  Does the Minister know?  I gather he does not&mdash; in other words, he does not know what are the practical reasons for introducing this clause, except a desire departmentally to tie up loose ends.  If there was a very wide evasion I could understand his anxiety; but whether even then the means proposed would be justified is another matter.</P>
      <P>Surely, when he was doing a thing of this kind, indirectly, as it seems to me &mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;cutting at the root of a principle formally proclaimed in the Constitution, and certainly, whether it was in the Constitution or not, a fundamental principle, as I hold, perhaps the Minister does not, of the natural law, he might, at least, have found out whether the clause as it stood had failed.  Has it failed?  The Minister does not know.  He has no idea how often clause 4(b) of the Act of 1926 has been pleaded by a parent who does not send his children to school.  He does not know, and yet he brings in an elaborate section here.</P>
      <P>I asked him also, on that occasion, as well as my memory serves me, what precise test he meant to apply.  Perhaps the Minister might tell me what is the educational test that the inspector has to apply to the child.  Will the Minister give me an idea of that before I go any further?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British, when they were here, dealing with primary education, laid down a bad principle and established a rather good practice.  Having laid down the principle that all education should be undenominational, as everybody knows, they set about establishing in this country what was, in practice, a denominational system of national education. What are we doing?  It seems to me we laid down an excellent principle in our Constitution.  I do not say that <Col N="2108" /> you are directly violating it and repealing it, but I think you are endangering it.  When, in other countries, I see people in whose welfare and future I am&mdash;perhaps the Minister might not agree with me and he might say I have no right&mdash;intensely interested, pleading as a justification for the claims they make in educational matters the primary duty and the primary rights of parents, I make bold to suggest to the Minister that before he did anything that could even seem to lead and, as I hold in this case, quite unnecessarily to lead, towards endangering these rights, I thought he would have paused.</P>
      <P>To tell me that the primary right is the right of the child does not bring me any further.  It is not the child who decides in this case.  According to my view, there are three people interested in the duty of educating the child. First and foremost come the parents, and then you have the Church and the State.  I hold that the primary duty is on the parent and the primary right is the parent's right.  I think the Act as it stood tried, as far as was possible, to recognise that right, not to endanger it, anyhow, and surely, before we should seem to run the risk of endangering it, a case should be put before us to show whether the Act in that particular matter had failed.  The Minister has been unable to do that. He does not know how often that was pleaded as an excuse, namely, that the parent was providing sufficient education otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not often raise matters of principle in this House except when they seem to be very fundamental.  I do not often speak of principles, but this is one of the principles to which I do attach great importance, because I see it violated, formally and openly violated, in many countries.  Because I think the whole tendency of modern legislation is a violation of that principle, I thought it necessary to intervene and utter some words of warning.  I am not pretending, as I said already, that there is an open kicking of the principle here, but there is a danger.  Why not leave it as it was?  You suspect that a parent is neglecting his duty. He pleads that he is giving sufficient <Col N="2109" /> education by, for instance, private tuition or otherwise.  Let him make that case before the justice.  On Section 3 (2) (d) which we have just discussed, the Minister had no difficulty in leaving the case to the justice.  Why not leave it to him in this case?</P>
    <P>I know that I am speaking, to some extent, as an isolated individual, judging from some of the speeches from different parts of the House, but I am not in any sense speaking on this matter as a person on the front Opposition Bench.  I am speaking, if you like, as a private Deputy who has a keen interest in this matter and who, possibly, may be unduly nervous of certain developments.  The Minister, possibly wisely, did not think it worth while to devote a line to the objections I put forward on Second Reading, but I felt it my duty to make them.  I feel that there is a danger and I do not like his step in that direction.  If this clause goes through, as I have no doubt it will, I should, personally, like to be taken as dissenting from it on the ground that it is unnecessary&mdash;at least, I have heard no case made for it&mdash;and, as I think, distinctly dangerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the Deputy referred to this matter on Second Reading.  I do not think any other voice was raised in the same complaint, and, in any case, so far as my recollection goes, the Deputy was very careful to explain&mdash;I hope I am not misinterpreting him&mdash;that while he recognised that I was fully within my powers under the Constitution in bringing in this clause, its introduction and passing into law might, as he has just repeated, lead to certain dangers, in his opinion.  It is always a question of opinion whether certain legislation will lead to certain dangers or not.  I think a great deal depends on the motives of the Government of the day.  If the Government of the day stands by the philosophy for which the Irish people are noted, and keeps in mind, as our Constitution does, these principles which are very sacred to our people, it is not very likely that any great dangers will arise, though I do not at all question that it is a very important matter which should be constantly kept in mind.  I, personally, and the Government, <Col N="2110" /> generally, would certainly regard it as a very important matter.  If there should be a Government not bound by these principles&mdash;I do not think there is much likelihood of such a Government&mdash;I do not think that the tendencies or nuances in the legislative Acts we now put through are likely to be the only excuses, if excuses are being sought.  The dangers the Deputy apprehends would really seriously arise only if we have a complete change, a very revolutionary change, of feeling among the common people of the country.</P>
      <P>May I suggest that the safeguarding of these principles is not entirely a matter for the Legislature?  There are protectors whose special duty it is to see that these important principles are safeguarded, and who, I venture to suggest, will not be lacking in that duty, but will see to it constantly.  The fact that particular things are happening on the Continent is not, I hope, to be taken as an indication that such things are likely to happen here.  The principle is undoubtedly a very important one, and I think that the section we are now discussing, while endeavouring to see that the basic minimum requirements which the Constitution prescribes as necessary for our children, are satisfied, safeguards the rights of the parents at the same time.</P>
      <P>There is the general right of the parent as laid down in the Constitution not to be compelled to send his children to schools or institutions established by the State or to any particular type of school, but, on the other hand, there is the provision that the State must see to it that, in view of actual conditions, a certain minimum education is required and is obtained by our children.  There is also, of course, the duty of seeing that every reasonable aid is given in respect of our young people receiving proper education, always having regard again to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section prescribes that a certain procedure has to be followed before a school can be recognised as suitable by the Minister.  It provides that, before issuing such certificates, the Minister may satisfy himself, by way of inspection <Col N="2111" /> or by way of the submission of suitable evidence to him, that in fact the education given in a school is suitable. Should he consider that, on that evidence or on his inspector's report, he is not in a position to issue a certificate, he shall first, according to the present provisions, communicate to the manager or conductor of the school, before refusing to issue it, the ground on which he proposes to refuse such certificate, and must give such parent, or, where appropriate, such manager or conductor, a reasonable opportunity of meeting the requirements of the Minister for the purpose of removing the said ground of refusal.</P>
    <P>I think that with the goodwill which that indicates, if there is corresponding goodwill on the part of the parent or parents, and the manager or conductor of the school involved, it ought to be the position, as the question will be a question of fact&mdash;whether the children concerned are actually receiving the minimum educational requirements laid down or not&mdash;that there cannot be serious misunderstanding.  It will, I imagine, come down to a question of whether, in fact, the education given comprises the basic requirements which the Minister for Education would consider necessary.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, so far as I remember, did not ask me how many cases there were.  Had he asked me specifically, I would have tried to get the information, although it might have been rather difficult.  He certainly did ask me what were the reasons for bringing in this proposal, and he now asks again whether the School Attendance Act might not be left as it is.  The position is that, in my view, the School Attendance Act has been found wanting. The meaning taken out of it by the Department was that the Minister had power to certify, or to refuse to certify, whether suitable elementary education was given in schools which applied for certificates of suitability.</P>
    <P>One particular case, at any rate, has arisen and has been the subject of legal proceedings, and a decision has been given upon it which suggests to me that the present provisions are defective. <Col N="2112" /> It may be a matter of opinion whether this situation should be remedied or not.  In my opinion, it ought to be remedied.  The decision in this particular case was to the effect that a child may be receiving suitable elementary education according to the provisions of the School Attendance Act, 1926, notwithstanding that the subjects in the ordinary curriculum, we will say, of the national schools are not being taught in such a school.  According to the present programme, the primary school subjects are: Irish, English (optional for Standard I), mathematics, history, geography, needlework for girls, and music. Therefore, I conceive it to be the policy of the Ministry, in determining whether a particular school which applies for a certificate of suitability is suitable or not, to consider the manner in which it endeavours to provide a curriculum of this nature.  If the basic subjects, for example, are not provided in the curriculum of the school, the question may very well arise whether the Minister would consider that he would be justified in giving a certificate of suitability.  In this particular case there was no doubt but that a very important basic subject was not being taught in a way to satisfy the Department's representative, and therefore, the question arises whether State policy in a very important matter can be entirely set aside, or whether we have not, at any rate, reached this stage, that we can see that these subjects which we consider are fundamentally necessary from the State point of view are taught in the schools which are to be recognised as suitable.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to deal with this matter.  It is a matter, as the Deputy has suggested, of great importance and a rather delicate matter.  I fully recognise the difficulties of it.  I would rather if it had not been found necessary to deal with it.  But, in my opinion, no loophole should be left in this very important matter.  The definition of elementary education received a great deal of consideration when the Bill was being considered for drafting, and it was found very difficult, in fact impossible, to arrive at a definition of elementary education which would be <Col N="2113" /> applicable and suitable in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Therefore, alternatively, the present provisions have been drawn up by which, in brief, the Minister has the right to inspect or call for evidence as to the type of education which is being provided in the schools applying for certificates of suitability.  He must then, as I have said, communicate to the conductors of the schools or managers that he is prepared to give a certificate or, if not, the reasons why, giving them in the latter case a reasonable opportunity of fulfilling the conditions that he considers necessary to enable him to grant the certificate.  I think, as I have said, that having regard to the provisions of the Constitution and to the fact that I hope we are all at one in trying to safeguard these principles and trying to prevent any creeping in of these detestable and harmful foreign doctrines which have been referred to, there is very little danger so far as one can reasonably anticipate&mdash;one cannot prophesy as I said in the beginning what may happen in the event of very revolutionary changes&mdash;that the provisions which are now set out in Section 4 could of themselves lead to any such dangerous situation as the Deputy thinks might possibly arise as a result of them.</P>

      <P>That is what I thought you had in mind.  Therefore, there may be any amount of education given to the child, but the examination may show that the child has not reached a certain standard.  Yet, the parent's right is denied in that case. Of course, the Minister has not even attempted to deal with the cases I put to him.  I do not intend to go over his speech.  It was quite characteristic and typical of the care that he has given to this question when he says that I did not raise that question or ask for information on the Second Reading. My speech was the first speech after he had introduced the Bill.  In column 1558 of Vol. 88, of the Official Reports there is the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I put to him this question first. Has this section been used?  How many parents roughly&mdash;I do not want it in statistics&mdash;have been brought before the courts, have pleaded that they are giving an education in their own homes, and have been dealt with by the magistrate on the grounds that they are not satisfying what the State is entitled to demand&mdash;a necessary minimum of education?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Yet, I am told by the Minister, who has given such great care to the objections made, that I did not ask him for that information, or otherwise in the interval he would try to get it for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had fears before the Minister spoke, they have been increased since. I take it for granted that it was not for mere show that this principle of the natural law was incorporated in the Constitution, that it was to see that it was observed.  The Minister was the first to rely on the hope that nobody in this country would think of violating these fundamental principles. That is no answer.  Others will determine whether this is a violation of the Constitution.  I never suggested that it was.  I gather that the Minister, at least, holds that it is the business of the court to decide these matters.  I have heard a different view expressed <Col N="2115" /> in this House by a different Minister. However, I shall leave that aside.  I am interested in the natural law, and I look upon this, no matter what confidence the Minister has&mdash;especially after his speech&mdash;as a decided step in the direction of interfering with the natural rights of the parent.  I am afraid that in this matter, whatever agreement may be expressed between the Minister and myself, we are speaking in different languages.  I have no hope of making him understand mine. I do not think it was any answer at all for him to suggest that I was the only Deputy to raise these matters. That has nothing to do with the case.</P>
    <P>I stated, and I state it again now, that I considered it a matter of conscience to raise this matter, even if I were the only Deputy in the House to do so, and I repeat that statement.  I gave examples, and if the Minister did not go to the trouble of listening to what I said, he can read what I said, and I think that if he were to do so he would realise the seriousness of the matters I have mentioned.  If the Minister denies that I raised these matters, then I consider that I would be wasting the time of the House, and also would be lacking in respect for things that I hold dear if I paid the slightest further attention to the way in which the Minister is conducting this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  Deputy O'Sullivan has raised a very important matter and has discussed, in a very clear way, the difficulty that he has in facing the passing of this particular section.  He bases his objection to the section on a danger that he sees in it to a fundamental, constitutional right of parents in this country.  He considered it a matter of conscience to deal with the question.  I consider it a matter of conscience to deal with another matter that has arisen in this debate, and that is the position of this House in discussing these matters. Arising out of the discussion between himself and the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan complaints that he and the <Col N="2116" /> Minister are speaking an entirely different language and, therefore, apparently do not understand one another. Now, we have a responsibility in this House, as representatives of all sections of the people, to understand one another when speaking of matters, generally, and if we cannot understand the Minister for Education when he puts a case before us in this House, then somebody else, on the part of the Government, ought to try to help the House to understand him. Every approach that the Minister has made to the various matters that have been discussed to-day has done nothing but increase our fears with regard to all kinds of matters.  After the Second Reading debate the other day, I thought that we would be coming in here now simply to discuss the Bill from the point of view of making this measure a better piece of machinery for the purpose of administering the School Attendance Acts, but now, if, as it happens, we find ourselves up against some fundamental considerations with regard to education, why should we not discuss them?  If also, we find ourselves up against what is perhaps not so important a matter, but still a vitally important matter to the country&mdash;that is, the proper carrying on of business in this House&mdash;then I think we should discuss that, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is proposed in a Bill to take powers to wipe out the rights that parents had in the past, I think it is a matter which requires discussion. The Minister put up one case of a school where, apparently, a decision was given that it was a suitable school for persons claiming that they were acting in accordance with the spirit of the compulsory School Attendance Act, and the Minister apparently, rather disagrees with such a judgement and implies that the work that was done in that particular school did not come up to the required standard.  The Minister mentioned that, according to the present programme, the primary schools' subjects are Irish, English, mathematics, history, geography, needlework for girls, and, I think, music.  He mentioned that these were compulsory subjects, but it seems to me that he rather implied that the <Col N="2117" /> Irish language was being left out.  I am prepared to consider that the Irish language should have a proper position in education, but I would ask the Minister to consider the position of infants, in the infant standard in schools, who have been sent into classes where there were 111 children or 90 children on the roll.  Is a parent to be forced to send children into a school like that in order to safeguard the Irish language?  We still have a Ministry that is proceeding in that particular way, and apparently having the spread of the Irish language in view, utterly ignoring the position of the Irish language when it comes to the matter of administration in the Irish-speaking districts, where hundreds upon hundreds of official are being allowed to discharge their duties in these districts although they have not lived up to the qualifications that were required for these particular positions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister tried to talk as mysteriously as he could, but I interpret his remarks with regard to such schools as meaning that Irish was not being properly taught in some schools.  I am speaking of the question of the rights of the parent, and if the matter of the Irish language is involved there, then why not tell us so?  I understood the Minister to say that he was dropping algebra and Euclid as subjects for entry to the preparatory colleges.  Why is that being done?  Is it because a number of schools in the country were not able to teach these subjects? Although the subject is called mathematics, apparently all that is left in some of the schools is arithmetic, and therefore, the Minister tells us that he is dropping algebra and Euclid as subjects for entry to the preparatory colleges. I should say that anything that could possibly be done to observe the <Col N="2118" /> issue here has been done by the Minister. Deputy O'Sullivan has been left to sum up the position by saying that the only reason he could give for this particular section is that the Department wants to tie up some loose ends.</P>
      <P>I do not think that this House should be left in the position that Deputies have to sum up in that way, particularly a Deputy so notably conscientious as Deputy O'Sullivan, who for many years was Minister for Education in this country.  It ought not to be left for any Deputy to endeavour to sum up out of his own imagination&mdash;in view of the lack of information&mdash;what the reason for this section is.  I again submit to the Government that if the House is going to pass this section after the points that have been raised by Deputy O'Sullivan on it, then we should have a complete explanation as to why this section is being put before us in this way and, in particular, why the section in the 1926 Act, which gave the parent power to look after the education of his child other than by sending him to a school, has been dropped in the way in which it has been dropped.  It is a vital thing that the Constitutional rights of the parent should be maintained, but in matters in which any Deputy in this House can say there is a vital principle involved, particularly when a Deputy who has been Minister for Education and who has served as a Minister of the previous Government can raise a question of danger to some vital interest for our people, it is of cardinal importance that there should be a clear statement of the position and the fullest possible explanation of the reasons why this question has been allowed to arise and the exact nature of the plans which the Government contemplate under the sections they present to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to add anything further except to put before the House the consideration, which perhaps has not been already suggested, that under this section the Minister has a very wide discretion.  Section 4 (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A child shall not be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be receiving suitable education in a manner <Col N="2119" /> other than by attending a national school, a suitable school, or a recognised school, unless such education and the manner in which such child is receiving it have been certified under this section by the Minister to be suitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) (a) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, before giving such certificate in respect of a child, require such child to be submitted by his parent to such educational test at such time and place as the Minister shall direct, and the Minister may refuse to give such certificate if such parent fails or refuses so to submit such child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that the Minister has discretion in this matter, and I cannot see any Minister for Education in the near future or&mdash;I hope&mdash;in the distant future, interpreting this clause, if it becomes law, in anything other than a reasonable spirit.  He will do what he considers himself in duty bound by the Constitution to achieve, that is, to ensure that all children attending such schools shall receive a basic minimum education.  There would be no other consideration in my mind certainly, and I hope it will never happen that any other consideration would be in the mind of any Irish Minister.  There would be no question whatever of interfering in any way with the legitimate rights of the parents or of inconveniencing them.  I am fully aware of the considerations involved.  They have always been referred to when this question of the recognition of schools has been under consideration. I am rather surprised that Deputy Mulcahy should gratuitously repeat that the Minister is out to take away the rights of the parents and to interfere with them.  That is not so, as I have already assured the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  As a matter of fact, Deputy O'Sullivan has left the House because the Minister made it impossible for him to see things through to a definite conclusion in which he could understand anything <Col N="2120" /> about it.  If I infer from the Taoiseach that the Taoiseach is now going to speak, my answer when you call the section is that I was going to call a division on this section as a protest against the way it has been made impossible for the House to discuss it because of the absence of reasonable explanation by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason that I intervene is this: I was here on the Second Reading and I heard Deputy O'Sullivan and, I think, after him, Deputy Dillon, speak about the rights of the parent and the danger there was in intruding upon these rights.  The Constitution was referred to a few times, and I would like to bring to the attention of the House what is in the Constitution in regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>Article 42 deals with education. Article 42, sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3), 10 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the prohibition on the State's interference with the lawful preference of the parents with regard to the education of their children.  That is Section 3, 10, but there is sub-section 2, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not merely that the State may, as guardian of the common good, require certain things, but that the State &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, because there is an obligation on the State to look after the common good, in this particular case, in so far as it is affected by the proper education of the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the speeches that were <Col N="2121" /> made by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Dillon on the last occasion, one would imagine that the State had no rights at all in the matter and, of course, the slightest thought would show that the State not only has the right, but that everybody agrees that the State has the right in a number of cases to interfere.  One would imagine that it was a crime for the State to interfere if parents ill-treated their children.  We do it.  If parents do not do their duty by their children, the State interferes.  In other words, the parents cannot do just as they please in an absolute way with the children.</P>
    <P>We have in this case the same sort of thing that we have in a number of other cases.  In the case of private property we have a similar position, in which the individual right and, what I may call the community right, that is the State right, sometimes cover common ground. In this, as in all other cases where rights overlap, if you can get both rights safeguarded at the same time, well and good.  We should aim at that in so far as it is possible, but occasionally you cannot do it.  If you have a parent who says: &ldquo;He is my child; I have a perfect right to ill-treat him because, in my opinion, that is going to make a man of him,&rdquo; well, you are not going to permit that. Common sense revolts against it.  The State, because it has a duty towards the child, can interfere and see that the parent will not ill-treat it.  Now, either of these rights can be carried to extremes.  You can carry the assertion of the parent's right to extremes.  You can undoubtedly carry the assertion of the State's right to extremes.  What we have tried to do here in regard to these rights is to walk on what is, on the whole, a fairly broad central path. What is indicated in the Constitution is that the State, in the actual conditions of the time, has the right to see that a certain minimum of education is attained by the child.  The State has left to itself to decide, in the interests of the common good, what is the minimum standard which should be secured for the child.  I take it that the purpose of this section is to see that the minimum education, as determined by the State in the interests of the common <Col N="2122" /> good, is given.  It has a duty to see to that.  If parents neglect to give that to the child, then it is the duty of the State to see that they will not be permitted to do so.</P>
    <P>There may be a question of difference between Deputy O'Sullivan and the Minister as to the distance which you have to go in all this.  The Deputy's position seems to be this: &ldquo;If there are not too many cases of this occurring we had better take the risk and let individuals, if they are not in large numbers, go.&rdquo;  I can see that a case can be made for that.</P>
    <P>People, in trying to complete and perfect a scheme, sometimes do harm in other directions.  That, really, is the case that is being made for it as far as I understand it.  If the Minister, on the other hand, takes a different view and says, in effect: &ldquo;I am not building on the cases that are occurring but on the cases that might occur.  If one sheep gets through the gap, a number of other sheep might follow&rdquo;&mdash;would not that be a very good reason for trying to close the gap?  I take it the Minister's attitude is that, even though we will admit that many cases have not occurred, there is a gap there, a gap which could be availed of by others.  What harm is there in closing that gap in time? I do not know if it is regard to the Irish language that Deputy Mulcahy said this gap is most apparent.  Neither do I know if the Minister and the Department think there are a number of people who are not prepared to accept the State's view of the common good and of the minimum of education that should be given to the children, of people who say that they do not want the Irish language taught to their children. If the State, regarding the matter from the point of the common good and of the interests of the citizens as a whole, says that Irish ought to be, and is, a compulsory subject, and ought to form part of the minimum of education that is given to the children, then I think that is a perfectly good reason for doing this.  Supposing there are parents who, through prejudice or some other reason, are not going to give their children an opportunity of learning Irish and of fitting themselves to be useful members of the community; <Col N="2123" /> and if we take it that Irish is part of the State policy, and if we regard it as part of the equipment necessary for a good citizen&mdash;if there are people who are likely to do that&mdash;then I think the Minister would be entitled to say that we are going to close that gap, and from the State point of view will insist on having a certain minimum of education given, in which a knowledge of Irish, which we think reasonable for children of that age, will form a part.  If there was a disposition on the part of parents to put up their particular view of things as against the view taken for the common good, then I think that the State would be perfectly within its rights, not merely within the Constitution but even if it were not stated in the Constitution, in doing that.</P>
    <P>I think I understand Deputy O'Sullivan's apprehensions that there is the modern tendency for the State to encroach more and more on things that formerly were regarded as matters for the private individual.  I share his views and his philosophy, if you like, as to what would be the ideal thing, but I feel certain&mdash;I am sorry that he is not here&mdash;that he would not deny the propositions that are laid down here in the Constitution as being right. All he would say is that there are dangers&mdash;and we will admit that is a danger&mdash;but there is a duty on the State to see that a minimum of education is given.  We may have different views on the question of education. There are no fixed principles as to what is the best education that can be given to the people.  There are people who doubt the value of the type of education that is given in the modern world. I take, as I said here on a previous occasion, a very practical view of that. I said there is a certain minimum of information and knowledge which is required of every person who comes to adult life and who has to take part in the life of a community.  There is a certain minimum required.  One of the things which, I think, we all agree on is that we ought to go in the most practical way to get that minimum given.  It is the duty of the Minister to see that the youth who are growing up will get that minimum, and that <Col N="2124" /> the very best type of machinery is there to see that it is given.</P>
    <P>I know it is true, in the case of Deputy O'Sullivan, that he sees the two sides because he was very cautious in the manner in which he spoke.  Deputy Dillon also spoke, and I am sorry that he is not here.  I think he went to extremes because if his words were to be taken for their face value the State would have no right to interfere with the parent who ill-treated his children, or who did a number of other things in regard to which the State has the right to interfere. I think we ought to have a sense of proportion about this particular question and not exaggerate what is involved in it.  As I understand it, it is a question of closing a gap.  It is no answer to the Minister, if he wants to close that gap, to say that many sheep have not gone out through it.  I say that if the gap is there it is a temptation and it is desirable to close the gap simply in order to remove the temptation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Act of 1940 came into operation on the 2nd September, 1940. It applies to cattle, sheep and pigs. There is a compulsory insurance scheme for these animals when exported through any of our own ports, but it does not apply to cattle shipped through the Six Counties.  Before that Act was passed, exporters had to seek insurance from various companies and, as far as we could gather, at that time the premiums charged ranged from 40/- to 67/6 per cent. per £100 value of the animals being exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A board was set up under that Act, consisting of eight members, seven of whom represented the cattle and sheep trade, with one representative of the pig trade.  That board has been extremely successful in its operations. <Col N="2125" /> It commenced business by imposing a levy of £2 per cent. on the value of the animals exported.  It reduced this to 30/- on the 30th January, 1941. There was a further reduction to 25/- on the 1st November, 1941.  It was reduced again to 20/- per cent. on the 25th January, 1942; to 15/- on 1st May, 1942, and to 10/- per cent., which is the present figure, on the 2nd November.  At the present time they have £187,000 in the funds of the company, if you can call it so, or the committee, and they have paid out claims during their tenure of office to the extent of £85,000.  They collected during that time something approaching £300,000.</P>
    <P>We may assume that if this arrangement had not been brought in, and if they were insuring with private companies, the premiums would not have been reduced to the extent that they have been, and I would not be exaggerating if I say that, as a result of this scheme, the cattle trade has been saved about £250,000.</P>
    <P>The Act applies only to exports through our own ports, but there are some exporters who live along the Border, particularly those who live in the north-west, who find it inconvenient to export through any of our ports and who would prefer to export through Derry and Belfast, as they always did.  This Bill seeks to apply the scheme to cattle, sheep and pigs exported through these ports or through any ports in the Six Counties. As I have said, the number of persons on the board is eight.  That will be enlarged to nine so as to give a representative to those who will be coming in under the proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity in bringing in this to bring forward certain amendments to the Principal Act, which have been found from experience to be necessary.  For instance, under the Principal Act, the valuation of the animals was left entirely to the exporter. Some exporters have been more or less evading the spirit of the Act by putting ridiculously low values on the animals going out.  Under this Bill it is proposed to give the board power to fix minimum values on <Col N="2126" /> various classes of animals.  Another point that requires amendment is this. The decision of the board of assessors who are set up to investigate a claim is final the moment it is given.  I believe it is feared&mdash;if it has not already happened&mdash;that it may happen that some valuable piece of evidence would not be available at the time they were giving their decision and the Principal Act is being amended so as to give the board of assessors power to re-investigate a claim for compensation within three months, and their decision then will be the same as if it were a decision in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will be made when this Bill is enacted to have the necessary stamps for export issued at convenient centres.  There is also an amendment to Section 18 of the Principal Act, which makes clear the point at which the insurance begins to operate.  There appears to have been some doubt in this matter; in fact, there was a court case.  There was, however, some doubt, and it is made clearer under this Bill that the insurance will operate from the time the animal is put on board ship.  Finally, the Bill, as drafted, has the approval of those interested in the live-stock trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the producers and the cattle trade generally, I welcome this Bill.  Everybody in the trade welcomes it.  It is a great boon to the producer and to people who ship cattle.  I should like to say that the scheme has been run in a very creditable way.  Before the Act came into operation, it cost from 10/- to 12/6 a head to insure animals that would be valued at £25.  The board has worked this scheme so well that at the present time you can insure a beast valued at £25 for half a crown, or a quarter of what it originally cost.  It looks as if in another year or so no insurance at all will be necessary, there will be so much money available.  All the people connected with the trade will.  I am sure, welcome this Bill, but I think that it would be advisable to amend it in some respects.  A large amount of money has accumulated because the board have managed the scheme so well. I am told that last year they paid over <Col N="2127" /> £19,000 in claims.  Then they managed things so well that they salvaged practically all the £19,000&mdash;they got it all back with the exception of about £4,000. I think that is an excellent tribute to their management.</P>
      <P>I think there should be some provision inserted in the Bill to prolong the life of the present board.  They have experience of the scheme and they have succeeded in accumulating a very handsome reserve.  In such circumstances, I think it would be advisable to prolong their existence because no one knows what type of board would succeed them.  We had experience of one body that remained in office for at least ten years and it carried out its work so well that there was no need to insure cattle.  They accumulated a fund that has been lying there for the last eight years.  I think the Minister should give serious consideration to the idea of prolonging the life of the present board, so that there will be no danger of a fresh board coming in, say, two years from now and perhaps not carrying out the scheme so successfully as the present board has done.</P>
      <P>The people in the North of Ireland are of the opinion that this measure will be a great boon to them.  It will probably help to swell the fund still more.  I should like the Minister to consider the point with a view to seeing if there is anything in the suggestion that, with all that money there, certain people may get on the new board, and, as a result of mismanagement, do away with a lot of this money.  Many people in the cattle trade seem to think it might be advisable and they asked me to mention it with a view to finding out whether it would be a feasible or wise step.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Bill and also to express my appreciation of the advantages of the old board to the agricultural community. Naturally, when dealing with export, when you can bring down the overheads, as was done in this case in relation to insurance, the advantages go to the producer indirectly.  I am very pleased to hear&mdash;it is very cheering news&mdash;that the members of the <Col N="2128" /> board have managed their business so well that they have now a substantial reserve.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to note that some of the amendments embodied in the Bill are designed to set right the position regarding the insurable value of animals.  In expressing my appreciation of these amendments, I am also expressing the appreciation of members of the present board whom I happened to speak to.  It seems that, formerly, a few, a very few, individual exporters took advantage of the position regarding the insurable value of exported cattle, and that, instead of basing the insurable value on something like the real value, they merely insured cattle on the basis of a few shillings per head instead of pounds. From what I can gather, this Bill does away with that position, and in future cattle insured for export must be insured on the basis of the real value.</P>
      <P>I think that these gentlemen had another rather nasty way of doing business which was not fair to the other members of the trade.  I understand that there is insurance in respect of fair weather and bad weather, and these people, when the weather looked fair and there was not much apparent danger of any damage to cattle by reason of weather conditions, insured for as low sums as, in some cases, 4/- and 5/- per head, when the cattle might have been worth £25 or £30 per head.  Then when rough weather came along, in order to take full advantage of insurance rates, they insured their cattle at the full insurable value.  The Minister's Department must have had regard to that position, and I am glad they have rectified it in the Bill.  I do not know whether Deputy Fagan's suggestion is advisable or not, but I should like to say this, that where you have a board which has managed its affairs so well with the funds at its disposal, I think it would be a pity and would be a loss to the country, if they were ousted from their positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that such a considerable sum of money has accrued to the credit of the board, and that they are now able to effect insurances of stock for export at as low as 2/6 <Col N="2129" /> per head on a £25 value, is sufficient proof that the board may have made a very great success of this scheme. There is no doubt that it has been very successful and very useful in every way. It has ensured that the money being exported in the past for this purpose can be kept at home and that people exporting cattle can have their stock insured at a very low rate.  This is a natural corollary to the Principal Act &mdash;that any cattle exported through Northern Ireland can be insured in the same way.</P>
      <P>I must say that great credit is due to the board in this case.  They have shown ability and business capacity, and have worked the scheme very successfully. The Minister was very lucky in the personnel he obtained for this board, and while I am inclined to agree with Deputy Fagan that it would be a pity if any change were effected in the present personnel&mdash;I suppose it would be rather difficult to provide for an extension of the period of office, as this is a democratic institution and people must be given an opportunity to change if they want to&mdash;on their record, there is hardly any doubt that on the expiration of their period of office, which I think is five years, it is more than likely that they will be reappointed in their positions.  Because of the success they have made of the business, it is unlikely that there will be any change. However, if it can be done, and if Deputy Fagan thinks there is any danger of undesirables getting on the board, which I think is unlikely, it might be well if the Minister examined that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is very wise in taking power to ensure that the board can fix minimum values, because I am informed that that feature of the present scheme has been abused by some individuals.  Where there is a door open for abuses of that sort, we unfortunately have people in the country who are always prepared to make use of the opportunity.  It is well that that door should be closed, and minimum values fixed for different classes of animals.  With the considerable sum of money the board has to its credit, and as the business of the board increases and the volume of traffic through <Col N="2130" /> Northern Ireland increases, there will be prospects of further reductions in the rates, but there is no doubt that the scheme has been an immense success, and is welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to raise.  Why this zeal to compel a man to insure his beast for more than he wants to insure it for?  If I have a beast worth £25, and I choose to insure it for £5 and to carry £20 insurance myself, why should I not do so? How is it going to hurt the fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>You will insure for the full amount if there is any damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose I do.  Suppose I have a particular cargo crossing from Ireland to Great Britain and I want to carry £20 of the risk myself and let the fund carry £5.  My contribution is proportionate.  If the ship founders and the cattle are lost, the fund will pay me only £5 in respect of each beast I have shipped.  My claim against the fund is proportionately low.  On the other hand, if I have insured for £25, I pay a higher fee, and I have a higher claim.  Unless there is something envisaged in this scheme which is not in any other insurance scheme, I cannot see what harm any man does by carrying portion of his own insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the man who is paying on the full value all the time irrespective of the conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is his business.  If he is a conservative person who wants to insure 100 per cent. of the risk on every trip, he may be a very prudent man, and I have no quarrel with him. He is entitled to pursue a conservative course, and if he wants to be ultra-conservative and absolutely secure, he pays for the luxury, whereas the man who is disposed to have a little bit of a gamble and carry part of the insurance himself benefits when the ship does not sink and suffers acutely when the ship does sink.  Personally, if I were a cattle exporter.  I would belong to the ultra-conservative crowd and be fully covered for every trip. But I can understand the frame of mind of those who are ultra-conservative, that they do not want the gay boys to get away with it cheaply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If every exporter took that attitude the rate eventually will be higher, because the contributions will be relatively less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not call it an insurance scheme, then, but a levy.  It is either an insurance scheme or it is not.  I understood it to be an insurance scheme.  If it is a levy scheme, why you should bless the Minister for exacting this levy on all the cattle going out I do not know.  I understood that it was an insurance scheme.  If it is an insurance scheme, it seems to me my contention is correct.  If it is a levy scheme, I think there are enough levies on the agricultural industry instituted by the Fianna Fáil Government without rising up to bless them for making another levy.  I take it to be an insurance scheme.  I was well in on this business when the first Bill was passed through the House and I understood it to be an insurance scheme.  If it is, I do not see why any man could not insure what percentage of his beasts he wants to insure.  If it is a levy scheme, then my view is that it ill-becomes the Fine Gael Party to be pouring praise on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme did not emanate from the Minister and I think the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a good insurance scheme as I understand it and I supported it in this House as an insurance scheme. If it is an insurance scheme, why does the conservative fellow who wishes to be 100 per cent. covered on every beast, want to be carried on the back of the enterprising fellow who is prepared to carry a little risk himself? I suppose, broadly speaking, those of us who are about 40 want to be carried on the backs of those between 20 and 30. That is a human reaction. But this is Dáil Eireann and it represents the fellows between 20 and 30 just as well as the fellows from 40 upwards.  It is one thing for an organisation to press a certain course of action on its members. It is another thing for Oireachtas Eireann to be legislating so as adversely to affect the interests of one group in order to advance the interests of another.  If this <Col N="2132" /> is an insurance scheme, I do not see why any man who wants to carry a share of his insurance should not be permitted to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to change the scheme.  Under the scheme as it operated for the last two years any man could insure his beast in any way he liked and still the rate was reduced from 2 per cent. to ½ per cent. Now we are asked to change the scheme which effected that reduction, and the ground upon which we want to change it is that we want to make the reduction which the scheme has already made.  The fact of it is that the conservative persons who have been insuring 100 per cent. are jealous of the young fellows who are carrying some of the insurance themselves.  The scheme as it stands at present, and which gave every man freedom to insure what proportion of his beast he wanted to insure, has already operated to reduce the rate from 2 per cent. to 1/2 per cent.  Why do you want to change it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of removing the discretion to insure a proportion of the potential risk would be to reduce the rate and to pile up an immense reserve as well.  If it is going to cost nothing after 12 months why do you want to put an obligation on everybody to insure 100 per cent. of his beast, if, after 12 months, they are going to be insured 100 per cent. in any case?  It is obscurantist and bureaucratic to poke your nose into your neighbour's business and make a neighbour do what you want him to do and not what he wants to do himself.</P>
      <P>Have we not enough bureaucrats in this country telling Deputy Fagan and Deputy Hughes and everybody else how to run their business without Deputy Hughes and Deputy Fagan turning themselves into bureaucrats and starting to tell their neighbours how to run their business?  Big fleas have little fleas on their backs to bite them.  If the big bureaucratic fleas are to have little fleas on their backs to bite the unfortunate citizens of the country, life will cease to be worth living.  I do not press the question about leaving a discretion with regard to insurance in the hands of the individual, because Deputy Fagan says that in 12 months time there will be no premium to be paid at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not come here as a representative of any vested interest, but as an independent Deputy.  The Deputy can explain his position at a suitable time.  The second point I want to raise is, if there is a very large sum accumulated in this fund and the board have by their action demonstrated their capacity to maintain it, I can understand the Deputy's point of view that he would be reluctant to see men go who have proved their worth.  But if this fund has been accumulated as a result of legislation that we passed there should be some means of ensuring that it shall not be devoted to any improper purpose. Ought we not to limit the purpose for which this fund may be used without further reference back to Dáil Eireann?  Instead of creating a situation <Col N="2134" /> in which you are afraid to see the personnel of the board changed lest the fund should be dissipated, is it not wiser to put certain controls and checks on the fund, so as to ensure that, no matter who become the administrators of the fund, it will be impossible for them to dissipate it?  What is the amount of the accumulated fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>About £180,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is as large a sum as that accumulated, would it not be well to say that it should not be distributed under any scheme other than that at present in operation, or an amendment of that scheme approved of by the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not prevent them from paying further handsome compensation if they wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood there was a board of assessors to determine the value of the beast.  I understood that the insurance element of the scheme provided that you valued your beast and paid your premium accordingly, and if there was a total loss they paid you the price at which you valued the beast.  There is no danger of dissipating the fund by paying compensation. The compensation is ascertainable from the amount set out in the policy, which is issued before the risk is undertaken.  I suggest that it would be well to insert something here to the effect that no new scheme can operate unless and until it has been approved by the Minister for Agriculture.  That seems to me to be a reasonable kind of safeguard, and, at the same time, it would leave it open to the cattle trade to elect members to this board with the same freedom as they did in the past.  Besides, as Deputy Hughes and Deputy Fagan have pointed out, it is highly unlikely that any change would be made with regard to the members who are on the board at the present moment.  Nevertheless, in case they should want to make a change, I think it should be left open to them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there were three points raised here.  The first point was with regard to this minimum levy, as <Col N="2135" /> it is called.  In answer to Deputy Dillon's point, I should say that I regard it, personally, as a type of cooperative insurance&mdash;it is called an insurance scheme, anyway&mdash;and the spirit of the scheme is that everybody who would be exporting animals would insure them on the basis of a reasonable or proper value.  If, amongst exporters, there are some who try to evade that, it is at their own risk, although I admit that, by doing so, these people would vitiate the purpose of the whole scheme.  However, when proposing this, I said exactly what Deputy Dillon has said: that if a person wants to evade it, and take the consequences, what does it matter to you or me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I thought it was better to put it on this basis of a minimum value because the people concerned look upon it as a kind of cooperative insurance and they thought that it was necessary to have this with a view to a possible reduction of the premium.  They did tell me of one case, which, I think, was more against their argument than for it, where one exporter was in the habit of valuing his animals rather low when the sea was calm, but when the boat on which his animals were went down, that particular exporter has since put a fair value on his animals.  I think that, on the whole, it would be better to let the matter stand as it is in the Bill, and let them have this power to put on minimum values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Fagan, as to the life of the board, I shall consider that matter.  I think it would be a disaster&mdash;a limited disaster, perhaps&mdash;if there were to be a complete clearing out of the present board, and, of course, that might happen if this whole business were to be taken over by a new group.  It must be remembered, however, that they cannot do what they like.  They are tied very much.  For instance, they must invest their funds in trustee securities&mdash;a point that was raised by Deputy Dillon.  They have a certain <Col N="2136" /> latitude with regard to compensation&mdash; limited compensation&mdash;as was mentioned by Deputy Hughes&mdash;but, taking it all in all, I should like to be allowed to look into the matter before the Committee Stage with a view to seeing whether an amendment could be put down to deal with that particular point.  Deputy Dillon is quite right in saying that no credit is due to the Minister for this.  It was put up by the cattle traders themselves, but it was passed by the Dáil, and every member of the Dáil should take credit for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and every member of the Dáil should take credit for it, just as they should take the credit or the blame for every measure that is passed through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, we should share the blame for 90 per cent. of the legislation that has been passed through this House in the last ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want every Deputy to share the blame for every faulty piece of legislation that we have put through, as well as to take the credit for any good legislation that has been put through.  However, I should like to sound a warning here, and point out that, although we hope that these premiums will be reduced more and more, still we must lock forward to the time when, possibly, they might go up, and the board will not be able to avoid that if things should go badly with them.</P>

      <P>I should first like to speak on the minor matter of what the Taoiseach said with regard to Irish.  If the question of Irish is at the back of this, as the Taoiseach implied, <Col N="2137" /> then we should expect that in such an important matter as is dealt with by the section the House would be told about it.  If Irish is at the back of it, take the case of St. Vincent's Convent, Senior Girls' National Schools, North William Street.  In the infant girls' school you have eight classes out of 18, in which the numbers on the roll, on 29th October, 1942, were 76 and 64 for the junior infants, 64 and 63 for the senior infants, 62 in two other grades and 59 in others.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But I should say that it is not a question of the teachers.  I am as anxious as the Deputy to remedy such conditions, and I am assuming that the Deputy is genuinely anxious to remedy them.  Supposing, however, that he were Minister for Education, he must know perfectly well that it is not merely a question of supplying either teachers or even money.  You have to supply space, and is it not a question of building new schools or making additions to the existing schools?  I, personally, am quite willing to admit that it would be an evil if you had classes which were too large.  I quite agree that the smaller the class, the more effective the control and the better the work of the teacher, but there are limits as to the distance you can go, and, assuming that it has happened that some of the infant classes are overcrowded, does the Deputy suggest that that can be remedied overnight? Is it not quite obvious that it is not a question of teachers only?</P>

      <P>If it is a question of bringing back Irish as the spoken language of this country, it is a very important matter, and there is a very substantial number of schools to which this applies.  If you turn, for instance, to St. Vincent's Convent, Junior Boys' School, you will find that at the same period the number of pupils on the rolls was as follows: Junior infants, <Col N="2138" /> 50, 72 and 71, in three classes, and senior infants, 61 and 62.  Irish ought not to be made the occasion of going out to grab another half dozen children, whether to take them into these schools or otherwise, when by doing so you run the type of dangers that Deputy O'Sullivan speaks about.  That is all I want to say on the Irish question.</P>

      <P>For two years, systematically, I have been after this, and this evening is the first time I hear about it as being a question of space, when it is a mere side issue of what we are discussing.  The Taoiseach is prepared to discuss this now, but he has sat there during the discussion on Section 3 when Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the same difficulties and discussed the same points practically, as far as he was concerned, with the Minister as have been discussed on Section 4.  The Taoiseach sat there and allowed a situation to develop in this House in which Deputy O'Sullivan left the House because of the impossibility of carrying on any kind of discussion here.  The Taoiseach did not intervene in the matter that Deputy O'Sullivan referred to.</P>

      <P>While Deputy O'Sullivan was speaking, even on Section 3, I was beginning to feel that the line the Minister for Education was taking with him had a sinister aspect and I felt that the silence of the Taoiseach during that discussion was sinister in itself.  The Taoiseach's silence had that effect on me, particularly when we were discussing Section 4, but I find his speech since Deputy O'Sullivan left even more <Col N="2140" /> sinister.  I consider the suggestion that the Taoiseach sees some bit of acting in Deputy O'Sullivan's attitude more than sinister.  I think to allow Deputy O'Sullivan, after discussing in a very serious and earnest way a serious subject, to leave the House without making any attempt to help the House to a discussion of this matter, was insulting to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) When a child to whom the Principal Act applies is transferred from a school (in this sub-section referred to as the former school) which is a national school or a suitable school or a recognised school to another school (in this sub-section referred to as the new school), the principal teacher of the new school shall request the principal teacher of the former school (who shall comply with the request) to furnish to him a certificate in the prescribed form stating the period during which the child was attending the former school, the number of attendances and absences of the child at or from the former school during the prescribed portion of such period, and the class in the former school in which the child was placed for instruction immediately before his transfer.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in sub-section (1) of this section as prescribed and the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; in the said sub-section means prescribed by such regulations.</P>
      <P>(3)  Until regulations are made by the Minister under sub-section (2) of this section, regulations made under the Principal Act for the purposes of sub-section (3) of Section 15 of the Principal Act and in force immediately before the commencement of this section, shall continue in force and be deemed to have been made under sub-section (2) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment imposes an obligation on the teacher of the school from which a child is being transferred to provide the teacher of the school to which the child is going with a certificate giving certain particulars regarding the educational standard and type of the pupil. The object of it is to assist teachers to form a correct idea of a pupil's <Col N="2143" /> attainments.  It has nothing to do with the legality of the transfer.  I think it will be found useful in making the administration effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points arise on this new section.  It says that the principal teacher of the new school shall request the principal teacher of the former school to comply with the request to furnish him with a certificate, etc.  I suggest the request ought to be in a prescribed form just as a certificate will be in a prescribed form.  A question arises as to whether a time limit should not be imposed under which the principal teacher of the former school should comply with the request.  I suggest that it might read: &ldquo;who shall comply with the request within two days&rdquo;, or, at any rate, within some prescribed period. The new section speaks of a certificate &ldquo;in the prescribed form, stating the period during which the child was attending the former school&rdquo;.  I think the Minister might consider substituting the words &ldquo;enrolled at&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;attending&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of the new section says that the Minister may make regulations, etc.  I think the Minister ought to outline what exactly he has in mind with regard to the things he will prescribe by regulation. Questions such as this will arise.  Is it on the application of the child or of the parent that a request for a transfer from one school to another is going to arise?  Will the application be made to the principal teacher of the former school or to the principal teacher of the school to which the child proposes to go?  The question of correspondence will arise if you have a large number of transfers.  If forms are not provided, and if there is a question of postage, I would like to hear from the Minister what exactly he thinks should take place as between the child, or the parent of the child, and the two teachers involved when an application is made.  Does the Minister propose to prescribe the form in which the application will be made, and will he say what exactly he contemplates under sub-section (2) of the new section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I want to protest in the most solemn form against any check or restriction being placed upon parents who deem it necessary, in the interest of their child, to move that child from one approved school to another approved school.  It is bad enough for this Government, or any other Government, to take over from parents the duty of seeing that their children get adequate education, but surely, when the State has gone the length of indicating the type of school to which a child must be sent, it ought to draw the line and say to the parents: &ldquo;Provided you conform with that general direction to give your child an adequate education, we are not going to hinder you or interfere with you in your discretion as to how best your child can get that education, whether it be at school A, school B, or school C.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I see in sub-section (2) of this proposed section a general power given the Minister to make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to in sub-section (1) as prescribed, and the word prescribed in the said sub-section &ldquo;means prescribed by such regulations.&rdquo;  It appears to me that in these circumstances the Minister might issue a regulation which would make it virtually impossible to transfer a child from one school to another.  I could proceed to particularise cases in rural Ireland, with which I am peculiarly familiar, in which it would be desirable to take a child from one school and send it to another.</P>
      <P>I know very well that many teachers want to create as many difficulties as they can for a parent who contemplates moving his child to another teacher's school lest transfers of this kind might affect the averages and possibly reduce the teaching staff in one school, while maintaining the teaching staff in another school.  I suggest that minor considerations of this character have no weight as opposed to the fundamental principle that a parent has the primary duty of educating his child, and that the less interference there is by the State in that duty the better it is for society as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the proposal to give the Minister general power to introduce new restrictions or new difficulties into the path of a parent desirous of changing his child from one school to another.  All of us are aware of the origin of this reluctance to facilitate that operation.  I am suggesting it ought to be facilitated in every possible way and that the Oireachtas has the duty to see that the Minister is not given power to make the operation unduly difficult or cumbrous.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with ordinary country people and, if they are confronted with difficulties and protracted negotiations between two teachers, both of whom will be their neighbours, they will be inclined to shrug their shoulders and say: &ldquo;If we move the child we will never hear the end of it; there will be letters passing between those teachers for the next six months and we will be cross-hackled and cross-questioned, so, for the sake of peace, it might be better to leave the child as he is.&rdquo;  The child ought to have the fullest freedom and every facility should be given to parents to transfer their children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You may think, in your personal judgment, that this constitutes no block, but I am entitled to think that it does, and surely I am entitled to make that case.  I am making the case that you are wrong in your interpretation of this section.  I think you fail to see the implications of this section.  I am speaking from my knowledge of rural conditions and I say that if the Minister makes a regulation relating to the information that must be furnished by one teacher to another teacher in the event of a child being transferred, a situation can be created which no country person can face and that person will prefer to leave the child in the school where he did not want to leave it rather than put the teachers to the rounds that they can be put to if they require to exchange too complicated a series of forms consequent on the transfer of the child.</P>
      <P>I object to that.  I say it is wrong. You will have all this abracadabra asking the teacher what class the child was in, the period he attended the school, the number of attendances and the class in the former school in which the child was placed for instruction immediately before his transfer.  What is the necessity for that type of &ldquo;codology&rdquo;?  If the child was coming <i>de novo</i> to that school from a school in England or Northern Ireland would not the teacher have to find out these things as best he could?  What is the purpose of creating this exchange of voluminous correspondence between the teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are further informed that, over and above these particulars, the Minister may stipulate for added particulars and he can prescribe the form in which these particulars will be furnished.  We were not born yesterday, and we know the horror the country people have of this interminable bureaucratic interchange of correspondence and their anxiety to shake themselves free from it.  I object to this further interference of the State in regard to how a child ought to be educated, and I say that the purpose of Section 6 is not to <Col N="2147" /> secure information for the teacher of the school to which the child is going, but to make the transfer of a child from one school to another more difficult. It is like saying: &ldquo;We are going to let you do it, but if you do there will be a hive of bees let loose around your ears and they will be buzzing for six months.  If you want peace, ease and quietness, leave the child where he is; if you shift him, make ready to have him made the subject of correspondence between two teachers until you are sick and tired of it all, until the child will be sick of it and the teachers will be disgusted with the annoyance brought upon them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe the <i>prima facie</i> purpose of this section is the true purpose of it.  I believe it is put there because national teachers and inspectors do not want to see transfers.  They allege, and possibly believe, that most of these transfers are done from a venal motive.  The truth is there will be half of 1 per cent. of the transfers in the country effected through a venal motive.  Perhaps a teacher will bring a child out of a school where it ordinarily would go, into his own school, in order to maintain the average.  Then teachers will take the view that if they have a quarrel with a child's parents, it is not a good ground for shifting the child from their school to another school.  I do not agree with them.  I think that one of the essentials of education is full confidence between the parents of a child and his teacher, and if there is a serious falling out between the teacher and the parents, the sooner the children are removed to the custody of another teacher, the better for the teacher and for everybody else.  I say that the purpose of Section 6 is to make that operation more difficult than it would otherwise be.  I object to it.  It is unsound.  It is a rotten principle and the House ought not to stand for it.</P>
    <P>The only information the teacher ought to be entitled to ask of any principal teacher is: &ldquo;Do this child's parents want this child transferred from your school to my school?&rdquo;<Col N="2148" /> If the answer is in the affirmative, the transfer should be made; if the answer is in the negative, the child should be sent back to the school whence it came. That is all they should be entitled to ask, and that is all they have any business to ask.  I think that any average, competent teacher will discover very rapidly what class a child ought to be put into within a very few days of its entering the school.  Let inspectors and school attendance officers worry themselves about the frequency with which the child attended its former school, or the frequency with which the child absented itself from its former school.  The only thing the teacher requires to know is that the parents of the child desire to commit that child to the teacher's care.  That being so, the teacher must do the best he can for it, and we ought to do nothing further to restrict the absolute freedom of the parent to move his child from one school to another, or to make any other amendment in the educational curriculum of the child for which he is responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputies are inclined to shake their heads and to say that this is making a great fuss about nothing.  That is all very well, so long as we continue to live in the atmosphere in which we live at the moment, where all the national schools are managed by the parish priests, where the whole principle of religious education is recognised.  The same was true in Austria where everybody thought it perfectly safe to carry on, that there was no necessity to be unduly alarmed, because after all it was the Church herself who was responsible for education, and it was unnecessary to dwell unduly on the responsibility of the parents, and so forth.  Are they saying that in Austria now?  If they had accepted in Austria this general principle that it was more and more the responsibility of the State, and not of the parents, to provide for their children's education, Catholics who would have accepted that doctrine have put themselves in the position now of admitting the right of a Nazi State to insist on their children going to schools where the name of God need never be mentioned, where the name of God must never be mentioned.  Catholic parents who would <Col N="2149" /> subscribe to this type of legislation implicitly admit the right of the State to impose such conditions.  The State has no such right, and never will have such a right, and we should not tacitly suggest that we acknowledge that right of the State by co-operating in the creation of unnecessary difficulties for the exercise of the parent's absolute discretion as to how best a child is to get education.  Section 6 does that. Possibly Section 5 did it to a greater extreme, but Section 6 is there for that purpose, I am convinced, and for very little other purpose.  On these grounds, I do not think that either the amendment or the section to which it purports to be an amendment, should be passed by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6, sub-section (4) of the School Attendance Act, 1926, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The parent of a child to whom this Act applies may transfer the child from one national school to another national school at any time either with the consent of the Minister or when the transfer is made because of a change of the ordinary residence of the child, but in any case a child to whom this Act applies shall only be transferred from one national school to another national school on or at the first opportunity after one of the following days, that is to say, the 1st day of January, the 1st day of April, the 1st day of July or the 1st day of October.</P>
      <P>That has been the law for 16 years and no change is being made in it now. We turn then to Section 15, sub-section (3) of the 1926 Act, and we find:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a child to whom this Act applies is removed from a national or other suitable school, the principal <Col N="2150" /> teacher of such school shall on demand give to the parent of such child a certificate in the prescribed form stating the period during which such child was attending such school, the number of attendances and absences of such child at or from such school during the prescribed portion of such period, and the class in the school in which the child was placed for instruction immediately before his removal from the school, and the parent of the child shall exhibit such certificate to the principal teacher of any national or other suitable school to which he applies for the admission of the child.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes, instead of the present arrangement whereby the parent has to ask the teacher for this certificate, to make it compulsory on the teacher to supply the certificate at the request of the teacher in the school to which the child is going.  The Deputy may see some interference with parental rights in this matter, or some bureaucratic interference, but the point is that there have been large numbers of children about whom precise details were not available who left one school and, for all we know, did not attend another school, and the present provision that the parent of a child should get this certificate is inoperative, if the parent is not sending the child, or trying to send the child, to another school.  If a child has left a particular school and is not going to another school, does Deputy Dillon think that such a state of affairs should be allowed to continue unremedied? That has been found to be the position.</P>
    <P>What will simply happen now is that the child presents himself, and the principal teacher in the new school to which he is being transferred will ask for this form.  That will give him the particulars of the child's educational attainments.  Is it not very reasonable that the teacher should get that in the speediest and most efficient manner, and that it should be made readily available to him&mdash;that he should not have to depend on parents who might not be in a position, or might not bother their heads, to get this certificate?  It is a matter of importance <Col N="2151" /> for the teacher, and the law will, I hope, insist on the teachers setting this matter between themselves and that the parent should not come in in connection with the form at all.  It has not been found satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is entirely mistaken if he thinks there is any prejudice, so far as the Department of Education or inspectors are concerned, against the transfer of children from one school to another.  Parents are entitled to remove their children for good reasons, but not for a mere whim, and when an application for the transfer of a child during the terms comes to me.  Sometimes the inspector is asked for his opinion.  The sole consideration is whether there is a good reason.  If parents have had a dispute with a teacher, or if they feel that a child is not making sufficient progress, or if another school would be more convenient&mdash;if, for example, there are other children of the family going to the other school&mdash;any ordinary, common-sense reason which would appeal to persons of common sense is accepted. But if there were not some safeguards, if transfers were to be given holus-bolus merely on the application of parents, without stating any reason, obviously schools might be closed down.</P>
    <P>It is not in the interests of the country, I submit, that we should have wholesale withdrawals, unless there are very good reasons.  We are merely, therefore, strengthening the provision which was there.  There is actually this form at present which parents are supposed to ask the principal teacher to fill up to give, presumably, to the teacher in the school to which the child is going.  That form will continue, or, if the Minister thinks it necessary, he will devise a new form and new regulations. If he thinks the existing procedure can be improved he will have power under the new section to do it.</P>
    <P>There is no intention whatever, I should like again to emphasise, of interfering in any way with parents transferring their children from one school to another.  After all, common sense ought to suggest to the Deputy <Col N="2152" /> that the teachers to whom the pupils are being transferred have an interest in the matter.  If the other teachers have a grievance, so far as the teachers' organisation is concerned, I am sure that the body of teachers to whom the pupils are going have also an interest in the matter, and it is not at all likely, even from the point of view of the teachers, that they would all take up the attitude that there should be no transfers.  What we have all been agreed upon, and what has been the policy of the Department since the original Act was brought in, is that once there is good reason, a reasonable cause given, the transfer must be granted, even during the term.</P>

      <P>On sub-section (2), the Minister suggested that he can make certain regulations.  Generally these regulations envisage penalties for noncompliance. If there are not penalties how will the Minister enforce the regulations? If there are penalties, we ought to know what they are.  If the section is not mere window-dressing, we ought to know how the Minister will make it effective; how he will compel a teacher to ask for a return or a statement or a prescribed form and the other teacher to give it.  How will he enforce that?</P>

I do not think that when a regulation of this kind, which is made in their own interests and to simplify matters in connection with transfers, is put into operation, the teachers are likely to refuse to carry it out.  I will consider whether anything in the nature of a penalty is necessary before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I raised some points which the Minister appears to have forgotten.  I asked the Minister to give us a picture as to what exactly happens when a transfer of this kind takes place.  In reply to Deputy Dillon he said that when a child presents himself at a new school the teacher will then make application to the former teacher for the necessary form.  When we passed Section 5, I understood that any child can turn up at any national school at the beginning of a recognised quarter and that he may not be refused by the teacher there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position then is that at the beginning of any quarter any child can turn up at a national school and, if the child is above the required age, then the teacher automatically puts through an application to the former teacher to which he has to get a reply.  That more or less answers one point.  At the beginning of a quarter a parent can take a child from one national school and send it to another, and that parent has not to go to the principal teacher or carry out negotiations with that teacher or the other teacher.  The child can be transferred in that way.  It is only when a parent wants to have a child transferred in the middle of a school quarter that the question of the Minister's consent arises.  Neither the Minister nor the teacher of any national school can prevent a child from going to a particular national school at the beginning of a quarter.  So that even if a question does arise, they can only hold up the child in the school to which the parent objects for whatever period is left of the quarter.  Then there is another question I want to put to the Minister.  If a child wants a transfer from one school to another, in what school is he enrolled while waiting for the certificate?  I take it that if he goes to a new school at the beginning of a quarter he is enrolled in the new school from the day of his attendance.</P>

      <P>The Minister rather undermines my confidence in my appreciation of the situation when he says that children cannot be removed for a mere whim, and goes on to say that schools must not be closed down.  When the Minister says that it is not in the interests of the country to have wholesale withdrawals from schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that seems to cut across my appreciation of what the section generally means because, as I read Section 5, if you have two schools three miles apart and for any reason the majority of the parents of the children in school A are dissatisfied with the position in that school and decide at the beginning of a particular quarter they will send their children to school B, the Minister's remark implies that he would be likely to step in to prevent these children being enrolled at school B.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have explained this properly.  Deputy Mulcahy brought out the point which I have emphasised that, of course, parents cannot be prevented from sending children to other schools, provided they do so at the beginning of the term.  No reason need be assigned. They are perfectly free to do that; no one can stop them.  I was explaining with regard to my own function in the matter that I find it necessary to inquire what the reason is.  Provided any commonsense reason is given, even for a transfer during the middle of the period, it is granted.  If the parents choose, they can wait until the beginning of a new quarter and they need not ask the Minister's permission at all.  I was merely explaining that some investigation is necessary by the Minister, and the practice is to send the case to the inspector, where necessary. But, normally, these transfers are granted almost automatically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I raised the question of whether there ought not to be prescribed forms of application by which the new teacher would apply to the old teacher.  From what the Minister says now it seems to me that the application and the report could be put on the one form, so that the old teacher could reply on the actual form of application that would come to him. Then I raised the question of who pays the postage.  It has been going on for a long time, and I suppose the postage is paid in one way or another.  I should like to know what fund it comes out of, or whether, if postage has to be paid, the forms might not be issued with a printed frank stamp in the way in which some envelopes used by certain Departments are franked, so that the teacher would fill up the form and post it, and the franking on the form would establish what it was for.  Then I raised the question whether there should not be a period inside which the new teacher would make his report.  I think that even though the fact is established that the child can be taken into the school without that certificate, it does not obviate the necessity for getting a report at the earliest possible moment so that whatever report comes from the former school will be a guide as to how the child will be placed in the new school.  Again, harking back to Section 5, sub-section (2) of that section refers to Section 15 of the Principal Act, and it is questionable whether that sub-section will have any validity if sub-section (3) of Section 15 of the Principal Act is annulled, as it will be annulled under this.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether there is any provision for children who may leave a particular school at the age of 12 or 13 because they are going to reside in another area, and then do not present themselves at any other school.  When they go to the new district who is responsible for seeing that they attend school?  I know of cases where children of 12 or 13 have left one locality for another and never attended school any more.  I do not see any provision in this Act or in the Principal Act for keeping in touch with such children.</P>

    <Col N="2156" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the duty of the school attendance officers in the cities and of the Gárda Síochána in country districts.  In the county boroughs it is the duty of the school attendance officers to see that all children there of school attendance age are attending school.  In the City of Dublin, in my view, it would be the business of the school attendance committee to see that they have accurate knowledge from the schools as to the pupils attending&mdash;that goes without saying&mdash; and also, through their school attendance officers, to get information with regard to children who were not attending school.  It is very difficult in the case of young children who, perhaps, have never attended school, to get information, and the co-operation of the police authorities would obviously be necessary.  If children have already attended school but, as Deputy Allen suggests, have left one district and gone to another, I think it should be the duty of the Gárda Síochána or the school attendance officers to communicate the particulars, where possible, to the area to which the parents have removed.  The provisions we are making with regard to vagrants, for example, will deal, I hope, with one particular class.  The difficulty that has arisen in Dublin is that parents may not be living in the particular areas where their children are attending school, and so on, and each area in the city is not self-contained in the same way as an area in a country district would be.  However, we are giving school attendance committees power to get additional information from the schools, and I am hopeful that in the future there will be comprehensive records in the hands of the school attendance committees of all the children who have attended school at one time or another.  In that way, it ought to be possible to trace whether such children, in the event of their parents changing their residences, have gone to another school or whether they have ceased going to school.  In the case of very young children, as I said, it may be difficult to establish when they first go to school, but it is largely a matter for the school attendance officers.  We are giving them <Col N="2157" /> general powers here, but we leave in their own hands, very largely, the collecting of information.  The teachers will co-operate with them in every possible way, but we can never be sure that the parents are co-operating, and we have to take special measures, as I already mentioned, to deal with particular types of parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think that that is a sensible provision.  I want to return to the words employed by the Minister for Education.  The Minister for Education, defining his attitude to an application for a transfer in the mid-quarterly period, says that he would give the transfer provided he was satisfied that it did not arise from some whim of the parents and that we had to bear in mind that it would not be a good thing if schools had to be closed down.  The first proviso I want to protest against most emphatically. What right, God-given or otherwise, has Tomás O Deirg, Aire Oideachais in this country, to determine whether the exercise of a Christian parent's discretion derives from a whim or not? I say he has none whatever.  If the Minister for Education for Ireland goes to a parent in this country, all that these parents should be required to say is: &ldquo;A hAire, be mhaith liom mo bhuachaill a bheith sa scoil sin&rdquo;&mdash; and no more.  I say that Tomás O Deirg has no right to go on to say: &ldquo;Cad thuige?&rdquo;  All he is entitled to be informed of is that the parents desire the child to go from school A to school B and, provided he is satisfied that the parents deliberately exercise that preference, a political Minister of State has no right to thrust his nose within the family circle and go on to say: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  I want to re-emphasise this fact, that if 20 years ago in Austria I had made the objection that <Col N="2159" /> I am making now, many a person would have said: &ldquo;Ah, that is all supererogation and getting excited over trifles.&rdquo; Would they say the same to-day?  I venture to swear there are schools in Austria at the present day&mdash;a country as Catholic as this country&mdash;one in which there is a vicious propagandist Nazi teacher, and the other in which there is a decent teacher who is trying to give the children as fair an education as it is possible for children to get under a Nazi dispensation.  If the Minister for Education in Austria went to a parent and said: &ldquo;Why do you want your child transferred?&rdquo; he dare not say: &ldquo;Because the teacher in school A is a violent Nazi, and the teacher in school B is a Catholic man doing the best he can within the educational system laid down under the Nazi dispensation that is thrust upon this Catholic country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Catholics in Austria 20 years ago had been thrown off their guard by the apparent peace and quiet that obtained in that country at that time, and tacitly consented to the right of a Minister of State to come to parents and say: &ldquo;I not only want to know that you wish your child transferred; I want to know why you wish him transferred&rdquo;&mdash;if they had admitted that right 20 years ago, then that admission could be quoted against them to-day as justification for the gauleiter for the district coming to a Catholic parent in Austria to-day and saying: &ldquo;We understand you want your child transferred to school B.  Why do you want your child transferred?  State your reason.  Because, remember, if the reason is a good reason, a patriotic reason, a reason that commends itself to the Fuehrer, certainly, no difficulty will be created, but if it is a whim, just peculiar to yourself, that is quite another story.  I am determined to know why you want your son transferred.&rdquo; I deny the right of the Minister for Education to ask that question. I deny his right to interfere thus far with the discretion of any parent in this country.  I say that although it may appear superficial, a very serious question of principle is here joined, and I decline to allow the slightest <Col N="2160" /> trespass to be made upon it without protesting most emphatically and most vigorously.</P>
    <P>The Minister then says: &ldquo;Of course you would not want schools closed all over the place through mass transfers.&rdquo; I remember a district justice in this city announcing that he was going to send three children to an industrial school because there were not enough children to provide capitation grants for the teachers in the industrial school.  He sent them to the industrial school and there was a fight in the appropriate quarters to get them out again.  He thought he was perfectly justified because he did not want the industrial schools closed.  Is the Minister going to take up the position now that he will allow his judgment to be influenced as to whether a child is to be transferred from one school to another by the question of whether that school is to be closed or not?  If a school goes down to the minimum number of children which will provide a teacher for it, are we to understand that thereafter there can be no transfers?</P>

      <P>Then what does the Minister mean?  Of course, when you put the question to him perfectly clearly, he runs away from it and denies the whole implication of his own words, but we all heard what he said: that if there was an application for a transfer, certainly, he would examine the facts, but he would not grant it if it was a question of some whim; he would grant it only if there was a good reason, and he wants us all to remember that it would not be salutary if there was a closing down of schools resulting from mass transfers.  What did he mean when he said that?  He says he does not mean the only thing any sane man would understand him to mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because I see that whole tendency creeping into the Department of Education that I shall continue to protest against any further attempt by that Department or its inspectors to poke their noses in where they have no business.  They are getting an idea in this country that they are the <Col N="2161" /> parents of the children.  They are not and they never will be.  The School Attendance Act of 1926 was pregnant with danger and there were some voices&mdash;I am happy to think&mdash;raised in the House at that time against it on the ground that it was pregnant with danger and it would merely be a new departure point for fresh inroads on to perhaps the most vital principle affecting the whole society of this country. Their apprehensions, I regret to say, are being vindicated.  So long as I am in this House, every attempt that is made by the Department or its inspectors to strengthen their grip on the essential rights of parents ultimately to determine the form and nature of the education their children shall have, I shall resist to the best of my ability. I warn Deputies of this House that if they allow incursions of this kind to be made, on the ground that, in the circumstances in which we are living in Ireland, no serious danger need be apprehended from them, they will live to regret the day.  In existing circumstances perhaps no serious evil will manifest itself as the result of this whittling away of parents' essential rights, but the time may come when many grave evils may follow and then it will be much too late to repair the wrong we are doing now.  It will never, however, be said that this line of country has been travelled with the unanimous consent of Dáil Eireann as long as I am in it.  It is not with my consent.  I think it is dangerous.  I think it is foolish.  I think it is unnecessary, and I think it arises from the bureaucratic passion of the Department of Education to poke its nose in where it has no business.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 15, page 5, to delete the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fourteen&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object is to secure that no person who has not attained the age of 14 years should be taken into employment. A certain amount of attention has already been drawn to the fact that 14 years of age is too early an age for children to leave the primary schools. Two reasons are given for that.  The first is the inadequacy of the education that can be given to children up to that age, and the second reason is the grave difficulty there is in finding employment for all classes of young people on leaving school.  I am arguing this matter from a city point of view. Even before the present emergency, it was heart-rending to try to get employment for youths of 17, 18 and 19 years of age.  If there is work, it ought to be so organised and distributed that instead of having children of 12, 13 and 14 years of age employed on it, it should be made available for youths of 16, 17 and 18 years.  The latter should be employed on it in <Col N="2163" /> preference to their younger brothers and sisters.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances we have the school day divided from 9 o'clock in the morning until 4 in the afternoon, with a break for a mid-day meal for both teachers and children.  The extension of the working school day makes it all the more necessary that children of school-going age, even with the low limit of 14 years, should not be allowed to absorb the small amount of employment that is there.  It is disastrous to have youths of 15, 16 and 17 years of age with nothing to do.  Admittedly, the type of work that children of 12 and 13 years of age can do is small and petty.  It would, I submit, be of great advantage to the elder children if they could even get that work rather than have them hanging around in idleness, and almost a blot on their homes.  There is nothing more tragic or demoralising in any home than the feeling that children of 15, 16 and 17 years of age can find nothing to do.  Even if they could only get this small petty work that the younger children are now employed on it might be the means of making suitable personal contacts for them and steering them into a better type of occupation.  The same fruitful result is not likely in the case of the younger children.  There are many people who would be glad to get in touch with boys and girls of 15, 16 and 17 years of age who are doing petty work because they would get a certain amount of experience of them, and might be in a position to find better openings for them.  From the employment point of view, on the one side, and from the educational point of view on the other, I think we should be prepared to accept it that 14 years should be the age at which young people should be taken into employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see from the Order Paper that I am accepting amendments in the names of Deputies Norton and Hurley to reduce the number of hours' employment permissible for children from 12 to 14 years of age on school days and on non-school days.  The function of the Minister for Education, I take it, ought to be to see that the attendance of the <Col N="2164" /> children is not interfered with, and that they do not engage in employment which would in any way prevent or interfere with their obtaining proper benefit from the advantages they receive from their educational course. I think that the amendments which I have put down cover the situation fairly well.  The original Act intended that regulations should be laid down dealing with this matter, but such regulations were never in fact made. As I said on the Second Reading, the general question of the regulation of employment for children is really a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, and the Conditions of Employment (Shops) Acts, 1938, children under 14 are prevented from engaging in industrial or shop work of certain kinds.  The present provision prohibits the employment of boys or girls between 12 and 14, and prohibits altogether the employment of children under 12.  The Minister may prohibit, under amendment No. 20 which I have on the Order Paper, the employment of either boys or girls in particular employments where their age is between 12 and 14, or he may restrict the hours of employment between those years, or he may prescribe conditions of employment. There is very wide power under which the Minister may make regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the district justice has power to lay down certain conditions in connection with the employment of children between 12 and 14 years of age.  That is in the old Section 7 (d). Even though he may not contravene any actual provision in the regulations, if the district justice is satisfied that a child's education is being interfered with, or that he is not receiving full benefit from his attendance at school, through some employment which he is following, he may lay down certain conditions governing it.  I think the Deputy will recognise that it would be impossible, as I indicated on the Second Reading, to cover the case of children working for their parents. The definition of employment is working for gain in pursuit of a trade.  It would be very difficult to frame a regulation&mdash;it <Col N="2165" /> may be possible in the future and if it can be done it will be done&mdash; under this provision.  In considering the provisions for the present Bill, I have not been able to devise any means of covering that particular type of employment. It would be impossible, I think, to cover up the loophole unless you could cover up that also.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in order to promote the development of agriculture and industry and to provide employment for our workers and remunerative prices for farm produce without adding to the burden on the taxpayer or the consumer, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should promote legislation taking power to issue for the benefit of the people money and credit on the security of the State.&mdash;(Deputy Cogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion, I find myself not perhaps 100 per cent. with the principle involved. Credit on the security of the State is a rather dangerous expedient by which to raise money, or what passes for money.  The criticism that was offered in this debate on the Currency Act of 1927 and the Currency Act of this year was, I thought, beside the point.  Since this motion was proposed, I looked up the note issue.  We have in this State a note issue of £22,000,000.  In Britain there is a note issue of nearly £900,000,000.  I am quoting from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 17th November for our note issue, and from the <i>Statist</i> of 14th November for the British note issue.  We are within the same currency system, and anything within the same currency system financially ought, like water communicating from different vessels, find a common level. In the last war, when we had a common level politically, we had in our portion of the country, as nearly as <Col N="2166" /> can be calculated a note issue of over £40,000,000.  The British note issue at that time did not exceed £600,000,000. Anybody who has studied the operations of banking and currency cannot but be amazed at the disparity in the note issues of to-day.</P>
      <P>The financial system reflects and equates wages better than any system I know.  Take a tradesman, who will command between £3 and £4 a week here.  He moves to England or Belfast, cities in the same financial system, and he will get about £12 a week there.  That represents the parity value of the paper money.  A man who makes here a similar effort to the effort he will make in Belfast, Liverpool or London will get only £3 or £4 a week.  In these other cities he will get £12 a week for that effort, because of the disparity in the value of money.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister believes in the quantity theory of money; the more money you have in circulation the greater the price, the more difficult it is to anchor it to gold, and the more difficult it is to stop inflation.  We hear very much to-day about the danger of inflation.  Britain never had her currency so inflated as to-day. Our currency that is not inflated, that is not half what it was in the last war, is made exchangeable for the British note that is nearly twice as much inflated as in the last war.</P>
      <P>This proposal is to give credit on the security of the State.  I should like to bring the Minister's memory back a few years.  I am quoting now from the &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Heads of Policy&rdquo;.  We are told here that Fianna Fáil stands for certain things, such as to establish a State bank with control of note issue; provide capital for national and industrial development at an economic rate by imposing, after due notice, a tax on the import of capital, such tax to be imposed on an ascertained percentage of the present export and to be maintained annually at a guaranteed scale until the necessary capital is made available.  That was what Fianna Fáil stood for 15 years ago, and the Finance Minister of a Fianna Fáil Government has now so hamstrung this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it here.  The Minister and myself stood on the same platform propounding that very policy. I could go into further detail if necessary, but I am sure the Minister will accept that.  It is inherent in the Currency Act that the Minister has piloted through the House that Britain controls our money, that the Bank of England is the central bank of this country, and that bank so regulates affairs that a man ploughing a field or assembling a machine in Éire will get X pounds per week or X shillings per week, whereas where the Bank of England has direct control and interest, a man ploughing a field or assembling a machine will get three or four times that amount.</P>
      <P>I do not want to discuss Currency Acts here, but, believing in the quantity theory of money, which I think is accepted by all bankers, I want to bring out that if we had an equal note issue, either per head of the population or per amount of business done in the country, we would have a note issue of about £80,000,000.  The credit which could be superimposed on that note issue would give us ample money facilities and accommodation.  I am very sceptical, and I am sure that the more the proposer of the motion considers the subject, the more sceptical he also will be, about giving Governments the power so to create money. I was amused more than impressed by the theories put forward by Deputy McGilligan when speaking on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that Deputy McGilligan, who espoused and supported the Currency Act of 1927, should now run practically in step with Major Douglas.  It is a very long step.  As I understand the position, if something <Col N="2168" /> is not done to give us the note issue required to carry on business, in the present circumstances of the world and the present circumstances of the currency and banking system, of which we form a part, I can see nothing but the bankruptcy of this country.  The Minister for Supplies and Minister for Industry and Commerce fears an economic collapse, and I am not surprised that anything he has a hand in should collapse, but I should be greatly surprised if the Minister for Finance will sit idle while this stranglehold is put on the country.</P>
    <P>We in this country are asked to do a job, while our neighbour on the other side of the street&mdash;for that is all it is from Dublin to Manchester&mdash;is also asked to do a job, and the same money centre which administers the money policy both here and there says: &ldquo;We will give more money for the same work in Manchester than in Dublin.&rdquo; The effort is the same and the remuneration should be the same.  If we had the gold standard operating freely, without any corner being made, the exchange would be against Britain and in our favour, just as, in 1921 and 1922, the exchange was in our favour, because what we exported, plus our foreign investments, exceeded what we bought.  Yet our currency was curtailed in sympathy with the general policy of Winston Churchill of getting back to the gold standard&mdash;the gold standard for Britain.  But we had the essence of the gold standard ourselves at that time inasmuch as our incomings exceeded our outgoings.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what power he has now. According to the report of the Midleton Commission on Finance and Industry, there are four essentials which a State bank must have: The right to note issue; the right to hold the reserves of the commercial banks; the right to buy and sell securities; and the right to discount.  When this war broke out, I asked the Minister in a Parliamentary Question whether he had been consulted with regard to the sudden jump in the discount rate here.  He said he was not and that the first he knew of it was when he read it in the papers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> I should like the Minister to tell us has he any more power now, and, if he has, from where does he get it? Has he the right to hold the reserves of the commercial banks?  Has he the right to buy and sell securities, the right to discount or the right of note issue?  Does our note issue not still remain in the position that it must be convertible into sterling?  Who decides whether it is convertible or not?  Who decides the amount of credit which can be given which, in turn, will give rise to an increased or decreased note issue?  If the note issue is to remain static, the giving of credit is attempting to put more water into an already filled bottle.  You must increase your note issue.  Increased credit will demand an increased note issue and if you do not hold the key&mdash;and I maintain that the Bank of England holds that key to-day&mdash;to increasing your note issue, your credit is going to hamstring the unfortunate man who gets it for either agricultural or industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the loss we suffer?  The currency notes we issue are backed by British securities. There is no need to go into all the ramifications, but it works out something like this, that it represents a free loan to the British Government at our expense.  The British Government has a free loan from the people of England of £900,000,000 for the note issue in Britain.  What have we here? I think it is very little, perhaps nothing at all.  We must take the bull by the horns and take complete control of our money and set up a central bank here absolutely independent of the British central bank, as independent of it as the Bank of France, the Bank of Berlin, or the other State banks of Europe.  Their exchanges had to move in sympathy with the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, but that was because that movement helped the trade of these countries.</P>
    <P>For instance, when Great Britain went off the gold standard in 1931, the Bank of Copenhagen went off the gold standard immediately.  But it went further than Great Britain went, so <Col N="2170" /> that the British £ had an appreciation of 25 per cent. in Denmark.  But did that operate on farming prices here? Every pig, or the product of a pig, that the Danes sent to Great Britain secured there 25 per cent. more than a pig from Ireland sold at the same price in Great Britain secured for the Irish farmer.  The Irish farmer was cut out. While we were flag-waving here and shouting &ldquo;Up the Republic,&rdquo; we were not getting the price for our pigs which we would have got if we had an intelligent business Government here.</P>
    <P>The credit that a central bank can give in my opinion is the only credit that will be of lasting benefit to this country.  On the 12th August, 1927, I made a somewhat similar speech here on the Final Stage of the Currency Bill of 1927.  As reported in column 1655 of volume 20 of the Official Reports, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the point of deflation, I doubt if it has yet come down to £12,000,000.  I speak subject to correction, but I think it is somewhere about £18,000,000 or £19,000,000.  If currency in this country is reduced to £12,000,000 we are going to have more unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was no prophecy.  It is a mathematical certainty that if you reduce the money circulating in a country, you reduce the credit in that country; you reduce employment; you reduce prices; you go voluntarily into a period of depression. I do not think anybody will deny that we have suffered from depression, that we have suffered from low prices, that we have suffered from unemployment, and that we have suffered from emigration since 1927.  That is 15 years ago.  Fifteen years hence, if we are still tied to the Bank of England control, the same sad story will be told, if we are able to maintain a national Government in this country at all.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy McGilligan in regard to that worn-out theory about banks creating money to the lavish extent he mentioned, and that we should get some of the profits which are going to the banks.  Every man who is not in business thinks huge profits are made by men in business. <Col N="2171" /> If business offers such a field for reward, why do not these theoretical armchair business men get into business and get the same reward?  It is not all sunshine in business.  In business you have to work and apply your talents, if you have any.  If not, you very soon come to an end.  The same is true of banking.  I do not believe in the theory that if a man deposits £1,000 in a bank, one-tenth of that is kept as a proportion and that the other nine-tenths are lent; that one-tenth of that again is kept by somebody else and another nine-tenths is lent, and so on until a huge castle is built on top of that £1,000, and that the State should handle it.</P>
    <P>Why does not the State take its banking system from under the control of another nation and control it itself?  That is the step I am interested in.  I do not advocate any particular type of control, but we should not mistake the type of control of the banking and money system that we have for Irish control, be that Government or private control.  I would be quite satisfied if we had Irish control. Whether it be State control, which I do not advocate, or whether it be private control, or a mixture of both, let us have it anyway.  If it must be State control, I would prefer Irish State control to Bank of England control.  What did the proclamation of the Republic visualise if it did not visualise Irish control of some kind or another of our money?  Supposing on Easter Monday, 1916, the British Government said: &ldquo;Here is your Republic, get on with it,&rdquo; would the Minister for Finance, if he were offered the portfolio then, go on his knees to the Bank of England and say: &ldquo;Thank you for so much, but we want you to control our money?&rdquo;  I wonder how long he would survive if he made such a proposal in 1916.  I remember the scathing comment made by the late Arthur Griffith, when in connection with the Home Rule Bill a very prominent public man at that time, when people adversely criticised the Bill and said it did not give us control of finance, said:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us have freedom first and <Col N="2172" /> control of finance afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that the late Arthur Griffith replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot have freedom without finance, for finance is the essence of freedom, and until we take control of our finances we are refusing to exercise the freedom that we should be enjoying.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that something must be done to provide credit if we are to have business expanded.  Some explanation is required, particularly from the Minister for Finance, as to how he expects the business of this country to be done to-day with £22,000,000 of a note issue while Britain has £900,000,000 of a note issue, whereas, in the last war, the same portion of Ireland had over £40,000,000 of a note issue&mdash;taking into account Irish bank notes and Treasury notes&mdash;at a time when the maximum British note issue was £559,000,000.  Why the disparity? I put it to the Minister that he must also accept or refute the proposition that the more money there is in circulation, the more employment can be given and the more business can be done.  Why does not our allowance of money at least equate with the British system, of which we form a part?  If it does not, it means that we are being tied down, by the voluntary act of our own Government, to work and do business for the benefit of Britain at a price that Britain would not dare to ask her own citizens to accept.</P>
    <P>I support the demand for credit, but I do not accept the idea that what is contained in this motion would be a cure.  I would be terribly afraid of credit of this kind, because, where it comes to the handling of more money and more credit, we have to go through the bottle-neck of a small note issue, and that cannot be done.  If the Minister does not see his way to work within the freedom that we have&mdash;particularly the money freedom and the control of our banking&mdash;then I cannot see any hope for this country.  I cannot see any reason why we should not control our money here, just as every other British Dominion controls its money. Some people will acquiesce in money control of this country by the Bank of <Col N="2173" /> England, but they feel offended if we call ourselves a Dominion.  We are the only Dominion in the British Commonwealth of Nations that has not control of its own money, or rather that is not exercising full and independent control of its own money, and the workers here are paid less because of that manipulation of our currency. Farmers in this country get a worse price for their produce because of that. There is less purchasing power to buy the products of agriculture and industry here and, consequently, there is less money to buy the raw materials for industry from abroad and we have to give our good, appreciated £ in exchange for the British depreciated £.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is no inflation. I should be very much interested to see the Minister applying himself to this subject of credit.  Of course, he knows pretty well that, in agriculture, there is very little credit to-day. That is due to a variety of causes which the Minister could not directly cure, and for which neither he nor his Government are directly responsible, but they are responsible for the restriction of credit.  Contrast the case of practically all of Europe, that is fighting to-day, with our case.  We are not fighting here.  We have a chance to work but we have not the credit to undertake big schemes of work and that is what is ham-stringing us.  What will be the position when this war is over, and when the millions of people who are fighting to-day, and destroying wealth, will start creating wealth?  Amongst the peoples of the world to-day, we have almost a monopoly of creating wealth, and yet we are not able to produce our own requirements.</P>
    <P>How will we stand when these people, who are now fighting, will start producing again?  Will we not be wiped off the map completely?  I say that the only lever to save this country is the money lever, which has been handed over to the Bank of England, and I would strongly advise Deputy Cogan to consider the question of credit on those lines&mdash;getting Irish control of credit: not the Douglas system <Col N="2174" /> or any other new-fangled system.  Let it be the old system&mdash;the gold standard system, if you like&mdash;so long as we have Irish control here, and then we can fight it out as to which is the best system for us.</P>
    <P>I do support the motion to the extent that we require credit for agriculture and industry here, but I do not support it in so far as it means that the creation of that credit should be handed over to the Government.  I am not saying that the present Minister for Finance is needy for money, nationally, but I do say that it is a dangerous thing to put such power in the hands of Ministers for Finance, Chancellors of the Exchequer, Secretaries of the Treasury, or whatever you like to call them, who might be anxious to get money, because it would be a terrible instrument to put in their hands and it might be abused.  We do want credit, however, and it is for our Minister for Finance to devise the best methods of finding it.</P>

      <P>It is an unusual way that the Deputy has discovered of seconding a motion, and then, practically, telling the proposer of the motion that he did not agree with him.  I think that that is practically what the Deputy has done in seconding this motion, and I think that he is right.  I know that he has studied this question of finance, perhaps, longer than Deputy Cogan, and, maybe, when Deputy Cogan has studied the matter as long as Deputy Belton has, he will see Deputy Belton's point of view which, to my mind at any rate, in so far as he has reserved himself in the seconding of this motion, shows a full appreciation of the dangers and difficulties of the free turning-out of unlimited credit, here or anywhere else, without due regard to the country's production.  Deputy Cogan asks that: &ldquo;in order to promote the development of agriculture and industry and to provide employment for our workers and remunerative prices for farm produce without adding to the burden on the taxpayer or the consumer, the Government should promote legislation taking power to issue, for the benefit of the people, money <Col N="2175" /> and credit on the security of the State.&rdquo;  Well, I think that if the Deputy looked over the record of this Government on the question of the provision of credit to provide work and to provide remunerative prices for farm produce, he would find that the Government has been liberal&mdash;I shall not use any stronger word&mdash;in the provision of credit.</P>

I do not object to Deputy Cogan putting down this motion, not at all, because I realise from Deputy Cogan's speech and from other speeches here that there is nothing on which we need more education than on this subject.  Some of us, inside and outside this House, are abysmally ignorant on this subject.

      <P>We made a free bargain.  Deputy Belton, a minute ago, said we should be as free as the Bank of France.  The Bank of France was a member of the sterling group.  All the Scandinavian States were members of the sterling group before the war.  I have a long list of them here.  I took it out of the League of Nations' book&mdash; I think it is the most authoritative book I could get.  On page 20 of the first volume for the year 1939-40 of the League of Nations' annual publication on money and banking, I got a list of countries constituting the so-called sterling group during the first half of that year, 1939.  They are: the Union of South Africa, Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, India, Irak, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, New Zealand, Norway, Palestine, Portugal, Sweden, Thailand and Yugoslavia. We are not free, of course, because we made a bargain and we made an arrangement with Britain.  Are any of these countries free?  Is Japan a free country?  They all made bargains with Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They all made bargains with Britain, just the same as we did.  The one thing that is a debatable point in this is, in connection with one or two items about the link with sterling or the rate of exchange, whether the Dáil should have the power to alter these things or, say, the central bank. I think, in regard to the link with sterling, a business arrangement affecting everybody in this country in some way <Col N="2179" /> or other, directly or indirectly, affecting all our trade, a fundamental thing, it is better that the Dáil should be the body to decide that issue, but I agree that we could argue as to whether the central bank ought to have the power. Deputy McGilligan holds, I think&mdash;and perhaps Deputy Belton&mdash;that the central bank should have the power.  It is an important power, and I think the Dáil, and the Dáil alone, should have the power.</P>

      <P>We can do it with all the speed necessary.  The fundamental economy of the State is affected by that link&mdash;that trade bargain&mdash;and it is so important that I think the country ought to be given the longest notice possible of any change which the Government of the day might ask the legislature to make in that direction. As I said earlier, I have no objection to discussing this question as often as is necessary in the House.  I am not in the least bit anxious to run away from it.  To-night, however, we have only an hour for the discussion, but I am sure we will have this subject before us again.  Deputy Belton, or Deputy Cogan, is sure to put down other motions with regard to it.</P>

      <P>It is hardly necessary, considering all the debates that we have had on this in our recent discussions on the Central Bank Bill. Next year, perhaps, opportunities may <Col N="2180" /> arise for that.  Recently we have had many discussions on it.  During the Committee Stage of the Central Bank Bill the House spent at least three days discussing a motion on this issue. The speech of Deputy McGilligan was, for a man who can be so clear-minded when he wishes, a curious jumble of mis-statements and contradictions.  In his last speech he made another mis-statement, like the one about the Bank of England being our central bank, when he said that this Party voted all other Parties in the House down on the question of the link with sterling during the debate on the Central Bank Bill.  The fact is that all the members of his Party who were in the House&mdash; front benchers and back benchers&mdash; went into the same Lobby with the Fianna Fáil Party to vote on that issue.  Nobody but the Labour Party and Deputy Cogan voted against.  Did the Deputy think he would get away with such a mis-statement of fact as that?  The more we discuss this question of the link with sterling, and what it means for us, the better pleased I should be because the truth will become known in the end.  Deputy McGilligan will get further opportunities of trying to educate his colleagues, particularly his front bench colleagues&mdash;and Deputy Cosgrave to begin with&mdash;on what a central bank ought to be.  On that there are no two men in this House, as far as one can judge, who are further apart.  They are poles apart. When it came to leading his Party into the Division Lobby on that issue, we saw that it was not Deputy McGilligan the members of it followed, but Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;all of them who were in the House.  In fact, the Deputy himself was not here to vote on that issue, important as he thinks it.  If he had been in the House he probably would not have gone into the Lobby with Deputy Cogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer Deputy Belton and Deputy Cogan to a sensible bit of advice that Deputy McGilligan gave in his speech on the last night we discussed this matter when he warned Deputy Cogan and the Labour Party against dragging in, and making comparisons with, present conditions in England.  He pointed out that in <Col N="2181" /> England there is control of a very strict kind on all expenditure.  There is control of wages spent.  Deputy Belton talked about the big wages paid there. Here, he said, a man might be paid £3 a week.  In England, he said, he would be paid £9 a week for doing the same job.  But of what use is the £9 to that man?</P>

      <P>It is not a wise comparison to make in present circumstances. If the trade of this country warrants a large increase in currency it will be provided.  Currency provision here has grown enormously in the last few years.  In 1938, the total money in circulation, including coins and notes of all kinds, in the month of June was £16,745,000.  The figure for June, 1939, was £17,504,000: June, 1940, £19,492,000; June, 1941, £21,495,000; and June, 1942, £26,316,000.  Because the demand was <Col N="2182" /> there, that amount of money was put into circulation, representing a 60 per cent. increase as between June, 1938, and June, 1942.</P>

I was in a certain tillage county on Sunday last&mdash;Deputies may know the county I have in mind&mdash;where I met several farmers.  I asked them how was agriculture down there, and how were they off.  Their answer was: &ldquo;Never better off in our lives.&rdquo;  One man told me that he had got £800 for his wheat this year.  In Cork last week Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;I read the official report of what he said in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash;referred to the comparative prosperity of agriculture. Agriculture is prosperous at present.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When was it as prosperous in our time?  Never.  It says a great deal for agriculture <Col N="2183" /> that the farmers are comparatively prosperous at present.  I never knew them to be better off.  Generally, they are not complaining.  The price index will show that prices have gone up enormously, and that there is more money in circulation amongst farmers than ever there was.  The price index in 1938, was 111.9; in 1939, 120.7; 1931, 120.7; 1940, 147.3; 1941, 162.3 and in 1942, 176.0.  I am not saying at all that they are too prosperous, but the more prosperity they enjoy the better pleased I shall be.  I hope they will become more prosperous still.  There is no reason for the grumbling and growling that I have heard from Deputies in this House, and that Deputy Cogan has referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On to-day's Order Paper there were two questions, one over the name of Deputy Davin and one over my name.  These questions related to the considerable embarrassment caused to watch importers through goods consigned to them from Switzerland being held up by the customs authorities, largely because of <Col N="2184" /> the interference of the Department of Finance.  The first question was as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the number and (b) the value of Swiss watches invoiced to Irish nationals now held by the customs section of the General Post Office; the period for which and the grounds on which they are so held; whether, if these goods are held on his instructions, he will state the grounds on which such instructions were framed, and the nature of the inquiries made by him regarding the effect such instructions will have on employment in the retail jewellery and kindred trades, and on the credit abroad of Irish importers.</P>
      <P>The second question was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the banks have been forbidden by his Department to buy foreign currency for the purpose of enabling their customers to pay for quantities of Swiss watches held for their customers by the customs authorities; whether this prohibition was based on the grounds that the demand for foreign currency could not be met by his Department; and, if so, whether he will state why the Department refused later to release watches where the Swiss exporters have intimated their willingness to give delivery without any transfer of foreign currency or of sterling from this country; and, further, whether he will state why Irish importers are prohibited from taking delivery of goods already lying in this country in circumstances which do not involve the buying of foreign currency or the export of Irish currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his replies, admitted that these goods had been held up for a period amounting, in some cases, to no less than five months, and he gave as an excuse for not permitting the goods to be paid for in the manner suggested by the importers that the payment to an account in an Irish bank in the name of the Swiss firms would create a liability to Switzerland at a future date.  In answer to that I would like <Col N="2185" /> to point out that the release of these watches would keep the jewellery trade in existence here, it would keep a large number of people in employment, and the money, having regard to the manner in which the payment was suggested, would be in an Irish bank under the control of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to observe that the Minister found no difficulty in permitting payment for a consignment of cigars from Cuba and wines from Portugal. Some of these cigars are retailed at as much as £4 10s. for 25. Surely nobody will deny that these come under the heading of luxuries. The Minister, in adopting this attitude in relation to the import of watches, is following the same lines as the Government followed two years ago in regard to tea, wheat, petrol and other commodities which are not now obtainable. In September, 1940, a tea importer asked permission to import a cargo of tea which he had bought in the United States, but permission was refused.  When the tea became scarce, the Government approached the importer, but tea was not then available. The position at the moment, in so far as the import of watches is concerned, is that the Swiss frontier is closed, and will remain so until the end of the war, and no more watches or clocks will be available for export.  The export of British and American watches and clocks has stopped.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Minister's replies to-day were evasive.  The Minister's explanation that these watches were being held because the customs duty was not paid is nothing more than an evasion on his part.  How on earth could the importers pay the duty?  The banks could not release the documents until they had permission to do so.  Of course, the moment the documents are released the Minister would collect no less than £10,000 in duty.  At the moment there are no less than £30,000 worth of watches in the hands of the customs authorities.  The traders are sorely in need of them in order to give them to their customers.</P>
    <P>It seems that the real position in this matter is that the Minister is not <Col N="2186" /> master in his own house.  I can well understand his difficulties in relation to sterling.  We know that he is acting under the direction of his unwhipped mistress, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.  Surely the Minister should make an effort to accommodate the watch importers in this country and maintain the employment given in this particular trade.</P>
    <P>It should be clearly understood in relation to this matter that the moment the embargo was put on by the Department of Finance these traders discontinued placing orders in Switzerland. Owing to the war situation, orders had to be placed for a very considerable time before consignments of goods could be delivered.  Many months elapsed between the time orders were placed and the delivery of the goods here in Dublin.  The whole position now is that these traders ordered their goods before any Order was made by the Department of Finance, before any embargo was placed on import, and the goods have been lying in Dublin for a very considerable time now.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that, having regard to the readiness of the Swiss firm to accept payment in the manner already indicated to his Department, he could, without in any way conflicting with the Order made by the Department some months ago, facilitate these importers in having the goods released.</P>
    <P>There is one final point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  Does he realise the damaging effect on the credit of firms in this country which have been dealing with firms in Switzerland in not paying for goods ordered by them?  Already there has been very considerable delay, and I suggest that if the Minister does not adopt the scheme or plan with which both parties are satisfied, he is doing an unnecessary, and a very grave, injustice to Irish nationals in this trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all admit that I have done any injustice whatever to any Irish national legitimately engaged in this trade.  I have been very generous and very lenient <Col N="2187" /> with a number of these people in not prosecuting them for disobeying the Orders&mdash;the Emergency Powers (Finance) Orders&mdash;issued immediately on the outbreak of the war, which made it illegal for these people to engage in trade involving us in the provision of foreign currency without prior sanction.  That is the Order, and the fact that, for some time, in relation to some of these cases, it was not enforced against them does not mean that the Order was not there, or that they were not breaking the law.  We have done all that was necessary for the legitimate traders in this business.  We have provided, and more than provided, for the normal trade of these people, jewellers and watch people in Dublin, importing from all sources and not from Switzerland alone.  What is now asked is that we should provide foreign Swiss francs to finance a trade five or six times as great as was done in any year before the war.  There are things more essential for the welfare of our people than watches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given details showing that, between the years 1938 and 1941, the amount of customs duty collected did not vary by more than about £2,000.  In 1941, the amount collected in customs duty was more than £2,000 less than the amount collected in 1938&mdash;the year prior to the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking a normal period before the war, and, over a number of years, the average importation of watches from all countries was about £36,000.  Now we are asked to provide Swiss francs for five or six times that amount for certain people in the watch trade.  We are not going to do it.</P>

      <P>I am in possession. The Deputy had his chance, and he could have talked for another quarter of an hour, if he had wished.  What is necessary for that trade&mdash;the normal trade and even more than the normal trade&mdash;we shall do our best to provide, but certainly we are not going to provide money for a trade which is not essential.  With the amount that has been imported already this year, there must be an enormous boom in the watch trade, and in addition to the men in employment previously, many others must have got employment in the watch trade, in the making and repairing of watches, judging by the amount of materials we have already provided francs for.  For this half-year just ended, more than ever was asked for in any year for 20 or 25 years before the war has already been imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>

      <P>We will use our credits in the way we think proper for the benefit of this State and to provide essentials for the people.  So far as we can get foreign exchange from Switzerland or elsewhere, we shall try to get it for essential things.  I have a doubt in my mind as to what happens some of these watches which have been imported to such an extravagant extent compared with previous years.  I do not think this is an essential trade.  So far as employment in the industry is concerned, there is plenty of material, and we shall see to it, so far as we can, that the legitimate trade will have all it requires.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy can point to any essential for the life of this community, if he should ask me to provide to the same extent as he is asking in respect of watches money for something which this country wants, such as tea, and, if we could get it from Switzerland, I should be happy to provide it, but not for this trade.  It <Col N="2190" /> is not an essential.  We have already provided for the legitimate trade vastly more than was provided in any other year.  In one half year, as I say, we have provided vastly more than was provided in any year for the 20 years before the war.  In doing that, we have laid in reserves for this trade, and I do not think anything more is necessary.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the personnel of the examiners who set the examination papers and supervised the marking of the candidates' answers in these subjects at the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate Examinations in recent years, except in French in 1942, when the inspector who set the examination papers was prevented by illness from supervising the marking, and his place taken by one of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>During the past year a scheme for the co-ordination of the Leaving Certificate and National University Matriculation Courses and examinations was adopted.  This scheme provided for collaboration between representatives of the Department and of the university (a) in the framing of the syllabuses in the various subjects and the selection of textbooks to be prescribed in the language courses, and (b) in the setting of the question papers and the standard of marking to be adopted. These arrangements came into operation in connection with this year's examination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state, in respect of the Leaving Certificate Examinations held in each of the years 1937 to 1942, inclusive, the date upon which the prescribed course for the examination was first made known to the schools, in respect of each of the subjects (1) Latin, (2) French, and (3) History.</P>

      <P>A new programme for secondary schools was introduced in 1925 and no changes were made in the courses set out in that programme in the subjects mentioned between that date and 1939.  For the year 1940 and subsequent years the courses in Latin and French were altered, and the former practice of prescribing certain textbooks as part of the course in each language was adopted.  The names of these textbooks were announced to the schools in each case before the beginning of the school year in which they were to be studied, viz., in June, 1939, for the 1940 examination, in June, 1940, for the 1941 examination, and in July, 1941, for the 1942 examination.</P>
      <P>A change in the History course was also made and announced to the schools in June, 1939, but it did not come into operation until the 1941 examination.  A further change, prescribing a more limited course in this subject for the 1942 examination, was announced to the schools in July, 1941.</P>
      <P>A rotation of texts in Latin and French, and of courses in History, for some years has now been settled, and particulars are published in the current programme so that schools will in future know some years beforehand the courses prescribed in the various subjects.</P>

      <P>109 school attendance areas were formed under Section 9 of the School Attendance Act, 1926. These areas are not defined according to counties but according to district electoral divisions which are, however, grouped as far as possible within the county area.  The enforcing authority for each of these school attendance areas is the Superintendent of the Gárda for the particular area.  Under sub-section (3) of Section 9 of the 1926 Act the Superintendent has power to delegate his authority to a member of the Gárda nominated by him.  The delegation of this authority has been made to members of the Force holding the rank of Gárda.</P>

    <P>Note 1.&mdash;The revision in this section of the rule introduced temporarily as from the 1st April, 1938, for a period not exceeding three years, whereby a seventh assistant teacher may be appointed in a school with an average attendance of 300 units, and an additional assistant teacher may be appointed for every 40 additional units &mdash;the figures operative prior to the 1st April, 1938, were 320 and 45, respectively&mdash;is being continued, as a further <Col N="2089" /> temporary measure, for an additional period not to extend beyond the 31st March, 1945.</P>
    <P>Note 2.&mdash;The Minister may sanction the appointment, in a temporary capacity and for a limited period, of additional assistant teachers to selected schools (in which progress in the teaching of Irish is hampered owing to the inadequate qualifications in Irish of a member or members of the existing staff), notwithstanding that the figures of average daily attendance given above have not been secured.  These temporary appointments shall be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the Minister in each case.</P>
    <P>*As a temporary measure, for a period not exceeding three years from the 1st April, 1941, the appointment of an assistant teacher in a two-teacher school in succession to an out-going assistant teacher may be made if the average daily attendance of pupils is not less than 45 units.</P>
    <P>(2)  To warrant the appointment of an assistant teacher or a junior assistant mistress in any school the average daily attendance must have reached the minimum prescribed in this rule (hereinafter referred to as the appointment average):&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for each of the two quarters immediately preceding the quarter in which the appointment is made;</P>
    <P Just="Center">or</P>
    <P>(b)  for the quarter immediately <Col N="2090" /> preceding the quarter in which the appointment is made and for the preceding calendar year;</P>
    <P Just="Center">or</P>
    <P>(c)  for the quarter immediately preceding, and for the year ended on the last day of one of the three quarters preceding the quarter in which the appointment is made.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section (1) and section (2) of this Rule are not strictly enforced in the case of schools newly recognised nor in the case of an assistant teacher reduced in status to the position of junior assistant mistress in the same school owing to a decline in the average attendance.</P>
    <P>Rule 83.&mdash;In the model schools, in research and practising schools in connection with a university, and in special schools for Irish speakers provided for in Rule 22 (4), the ratio between the staffs and the attendance of pupils is determined by the Department, and the teaching staffs are adjusted from time to time to the attendance of pupils as the circumstances of these schools demand.</P>
    <P>Rule 87 (1).&mdash;In any convent or monastery or other national school paid by capitation, the teaching staff is deemed sufficient if the number of recognised teachers, including members of the community engaged in teaching, in proportion to the average annual attendance, corresponds with the following scale:&mdash;</P>
