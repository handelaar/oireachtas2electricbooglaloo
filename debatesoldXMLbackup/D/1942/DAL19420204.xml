      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the danger of further disemployment of owners and employees of shops engaged exclusively, or almost exclusively, in the retail cigarette and tobacco business, he has considered the desirability of confining that retail business to such shops, or at least of excluding it from such concerns as public-houses, hotels and restaurants, which, previous to the curtailment of supplies, kept cigarettes and tobaccos mainly for the extra convenience of their customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received an application for a turf-removing licence on behalf of the Dublin Corporation, who have accepted an offer of 500 tons of turf to be delivered in Dublin at 50/- per ton; if he will say if the licence has been issued or will be issued at an early date; further, if he will say whether any other public board in <Col N="1711" /> Dublin has applied for a similar licence; and, if so, with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The application referred to is apparently one that was received from the Housing and Supplies Department of the Dublin Corporation on 3rd December, 1941, in respect of 500 tons of turf.  The application did not state the price at which the turf was to be bought.  Inquiries subsequently made of the corporation elicited the information that it was intended for general heating purposes.</P>
      <P>Similar applications had been received on the 18th October, 1941, and 29th November, 1941, from the same department and were refused.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in this case do not appear to differ in any respect from those of numerous similar applications from firms and establishments in non-turf areas requiring turf for the heating of premises.  The policy of the Government is to make provision for the needs of such consumers out of the total stocks of fuel available in non-turf areas; and for this reason the application of the Dublin Corporation was not granted.</P>
      <P>Applications of the same kind from the Dublin Board of Assistance on 27th June, 1941, and 26th August, 1941, were also refused.  It was stated in reply to a question by the Deputy on the 3rd December, 1941, that the prohibition on the removal of turf from the scheduled turf areas except under licence is part of the policy decided on by the Government, as explained to the Dáil by the Parliamentary Secretary in the debate on the adjournment on 30th October, 1941.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he intends to inform Dáil Eireann of the grounds on which he consented to the increased bank charges now in operation and whether in approving of these increases he adverted to the principle underlying Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, 1941.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1712" /> Supplies if he will state the grounds on which the joint stock banks were permitted to increase to their customers the fee charged for keeping current accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to enter into a detailed explanation of the grounds upon which the recent increase in bank charges was approved by me since to do so would involve the disclosure of matters of a highly confidential nature, affecting the affairs of the banks concerned, which were made available only for the purpose of the investigation carried out in my Department.  This decision is in accordance with the practice hitherto observed by my Department in connection with price investigations.</P>
      <P>In the course of the public announcement made following the decision it was pointed out that, making due allowance for all relevant factors including on the one hand the increase in the cost of carrying on the banks' operations and on the other the general reduction in the rates of interest which may be earned on the banks' assets, I had come to the conclusion, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, that I would not be justified in refusing to sanction the increased bank charges.</P>
      <P>In taking this decision the principle underlying the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, 1941, was borne in mind, but in the special circumstances of the case due regard had to be given to the terms and conditions of employment in the banks which, until February, 1941, were largely covered by the Arbitration Award of 1920, and since February, 1941, by the Wylie Arbitration Award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the joint stock banks have all paid large dividends in respect of the last 12 months, how does the Minister consider it just that employers, who are very often at the present time going virtually without profit to keep their own men in employment, should be <Col N="1713" /> saddled with additional charges on their bank accounts by institutions which are earning at the present time higher profits than almost any other institution in this country?  Will he tell the House how he can justify the wage-earner with £2 10/- per week being forbidden to get any increase whatever, except by his licence, and then a very small percentage, when he permits the banks of the country substantially to add to their revenues by imposing a new charge in this time of unprecedented difficulty on the mercantile community of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered the Deputy's supplementary question already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will tell the House some reason why he forbids, under the excess profits provisions of the Finance Act, individual merchants and business men from making more than 7 per cent. on their issued capital, why he forbids the working man who is in receipt of £2 or £2 5/- per week from getting any increase in wages, while he permits the banks to put a new burden on their customers, when they are in fact paying larger dividends than almost any other mercantile enterprise in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting that the facts are as stated by the Deputy.  I think they are all incorrect but, in reply to the general question, I can add nothing to what I have already said, that, having examined all the facts, I came to the conclusion that it would be unreasonable to refuse consent in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say that it would be unreasonable for the banks to bear any part of this charge out of the large profits which they are at present making, although every body else is put to the pin of their collar?  Surely these charges, if they did amount to £150,000 per year, could be met out of the very substantial profits the banks are making?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has seen the reports of the banks in respect of their 12 months' working, showing the volume of profits and the size of the dividends they propose to distribute to their shareholders?  Out of that fund, surely this money could have been found, without blistering the unfortunate citizens who are struggling with adversity at the present time, as the Minister well knows?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the effect of this increase on some struggling firms?  For instance, in the case of a creamery in my district, its charges have been multiplied 30 times by this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say why this principle was not adopted in the case of road workers in Cork County who got an increase of 2/6 a week and which increase his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, refused to sanction, although the chairman of the county council, who is also a member of this House, said that their average wages did not exceed 24/- per week, considering the number of weeks for which they were employed?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a part of this question which refers deliberately to Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, and which asks the Minister, for the benefit of the House and the country, to compare the attitude of the Government in regard to the joint stock banks and in regard to the 24/- a week labourer. Surely the House ought to be given the grounds on which the Minister permits an increase in the joint stock banks revenues, but prohibits, under Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, the 24/- a week labourer from getting an increase?  If the people are to go mad, they should be told that.  It is certainly enough to madden men who are getting 24/- a week.</P>

      <P>Forms of application for subsidy, together with explanatory <Col N="1716" /> instructions, have been distributed to the bakers licensed under the Emergency Powers (Bakers) Order, 1941. The first payment will be in respect of the period 13th October, 1941, to the 30th November, 1941.  Some claims have been received in respect of that period and are under examination.  It is expected that the payments will commence at a very early date.</P>
      <P>Subsidy will be paid at the rate of ½d. per 4 lb. loaf on batch bread produced and sold in units of 1 lb. in weight, or in multiples of 1 lb., by licensed bakers.

      <P>You can only import a quota article if you are on the register of importers.  If you are not on that register you cannot get a licence to import under the relevant section of the quota order, but while that is so there are hundreds of merchants in this country who could get stuff in from Northern Ireland and Great Britain. They are not able to do that because of the fact that they are not on the register of importers.  No matter what quantity of stuff may be permitted to come in under the quota, due to what I have stated, the position is that we have people who could get stuff and are forbidden by our own Government <Col N="1723" /> from bringing it in.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the basis on which the fixed prices of 44/- per barrel as a maximum sale price for seed barley and 31/6 per barrel for seed oats were arrived at, having regard to the fact that this represents an increase of 47 per cent. and 68½ per cent. respectively on the fixed prices paid to the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices of 44/- per barrel and 31/6 per barrel fixed for seed <Col N="1732" /> barley and seed oats respectively are not prices which must be paid but maximum prices which may not be exceeded. The object of fixing maximum prices was to prevent the charging of excessive prices such as took place last spring.</P>
      <P>In fixing these maximum prices regard was had to the prices paid to growers in the first instance by seed assemblers, the reduced weight of grain when conditioned and recleaned, handling and storage charges, the cost of transport to local merchants, and a reasonable margin of profit to the assembler and the retailer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In fixing those maximum prices, the Minister must be satisfied that there is some justification for arriving at a price which allows the percentage increase set out in the question.  I do not think that can be justified and I would like him to give us some justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in order to encourage winter production and feeding of fat cattle essential to successful tillage, he will state (a) what efforts were made by him to secure a higher price for exported beef for the month of January with a rising scale of prices to the end of stall-feeding season; (b) why, contrary to the interests of winter feeding, a flat rate was negotiated for the months November to March inclusive; (c) whether his Department undertook to supply a quota for those months; (d) why the export of store cattle was prohibited during the greater part of the month of January, and in making this decision what interests, if any, were consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.  Every effort possible was made over a prolonged period to secure a higher level of prices for fat cattle in the first six months of 1942, including the month of January.  The negotiations had not concluded at the end of December and it was found necessary to make on 30th December an announcement to the effect that there was no change in the price of fat cattle exported to Great Britain.  A flat rate was not negotiated.  The British Ministry of Food refused to agree to an increase in price of beef between 1st December, 1941, and 20th April, 1942, when the price will be advanced by ¼d. per lb. No quota was arranged but the Ministry of Food require a week in advance notification of the number of fat stock proposed to be shipped each week. The shipment of store cattle was stopped from 12th to 24th January, inclusive, in order to reserve all available shipping space for fat cattle. This step was taken because of the urgency of disposing of all surplus <Col N="1738" /> grass-fed cattle suitable for slaughter before they lost their condition and in view of the short supply of feeding stuffs available for cattle feeding and other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>When an increase in the price of exported beef was secured by the Minister's Department, was it conditional on our side filling the quota?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And when that increase was accepted was the price of stock for winter feeding adverted to?  In other words, did we accept a price in November, for beef off the grass in November and December, without taking into consideration that men who were going to put cattle into the stall for sale in January, February and March, would have to accept the same price for the cattle as that paid for cattle going into the stall in November?  If that is the attitude of the Minister, it is cutting across his whole tillage policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering questions Nos. 29, 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a surplus of bacon pigs within recent weeks in the Counties Monaghan, Wexford and Tipperary.  In County Mayo, however, it appears that one of the bacon factories is unable to get sufficient pigs for its own requirements.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have already been made by the Pigs and Bacon Commission to accept and pay for at the fixed prices all pigs offered to the commission's representatives in any county in which there are pigs surplus to the requirements of curers.  The returns received by the Commission of pigs accepted at bacon factories do not indicate that there is any standstill in the acceptance of pigs by the factories.</P>
      <P>As to pigs 17 stone, it is desirable that producers should realise that pigs of this weight are unsuitable to the present bacon trade, and that in view of the necessity for conserving feeding stuffs pigs should not be fed to weights greater than are suitable to the bacon trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of pigs which have been kept for an extra six weeks, what is their weight now, or where is the market for those heavy pigs?  Are the farmers to be penalised to the extent of 25/- or 30/-, in addition to the cost of the extra food which the pigs have consumed in the <Col N="1741" /> meantime?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, why on earth does he not increase the bacon curers' quota?  The bacon curers are very willing to kill the pigs and cure them, but the Minister will not allow them.  Instead, he is sending around the Pigs and Bacon Board officers to take the pigs at the factory, whereas if he allowed the curers to kill the pigs themselves they would do it willingly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (a) if it is a fact that the suppression by the Censor of portion of a book review referring to the revolt against popular government in 1922-23, to Mr. de Valera's denial of the Dáil's legitimacy even when he had taken his seat in the Assembly and to the Blueshirts' determination to preserve the right of free speech against organised rowdyism was justified by the Censor on the 13th November last on the grounds that, at a time when the unity of our own people was more than ever called for, it would be contrary to the public interest to allow a fresh controversy to break out in the Press regarding either the Civil War or the Blueshirt movement; (b) if the Censor in the course of such justification has expressed the view that this consideration could be urged in support of the suppression of all political controversy; (c) if the operating of censorship according to this standard is not a breach of the guarantees given in the Dáil in September, 1939, and (d) if he will ensure full freedom of political discussion unrestricted by censorship and will indicate to the Dáil the directions to this end given by him to those entrusted with censorship duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is untrue to say, as the Deputy alleges <Col N="1746" /> in the first part of his question, that the portion of the book review involved was &ldquo;suppressed&rdquo; by the Censor.  The facts are that the passage referred to, having been deleted by the Censor on duty on the night staff, the matter was brought to the notice of the Controller of Censorship who thereupon immediately authorised its publication in full.</P>
      <P>A letter from the Controller of Censorship to the newspaper concerned contained the words quoted by the Deputy in the second part of his question.  In the course of his letter the controller stated as one of the reasons why the particular deletions were made:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That at a time when the unity of our own people was more than ever called for, it would be contrary to the public interest to allow a fresh controversy to break out in the Press regarding either the Civil War or the Blueshirt movement.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He added:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Naturally the weight to be given to the last-mentioned consideration &mdash;which could be urged in support of the suppression of all political controversy&mdash;must depend a good deal on the circumstances of each particular case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the present circumstances, I do not myself feel that we are justified in going so far as to prohibit you absolutely from publishing the whole of the matter deleted if you feel that it is necessary to go into these matters for the purpose of refuting what you consider to be an unfair attack on your paper in the book under review.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the question of policy, the paramount necessity for the greatest possible measure of national unity in the present emergency is a consideration which the censorship is bound to bear in mind.  Speaking generally, and making all necessary allowances for the circumstances and context of an isolated reference or allusion, it is both the right and duty of the Censors to prevent a heated controversy about <Col N="1747" /> the Civil War or the Blueshirt movement from developing in the Press at the present time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the guarantees with respect to the censorship which were given to the Dáil in September, 1939, all I need say is this: that there was never any guarantee, express or implied, that in allowing full freedom for political discussion the censorship would allow any section of the community or the Press to undermine public morale or the authority of the State.  And, in my opinion, any attempt to revive, at the present time, the animosities and bitterness of the Civil War would be disastrous to public morale and national security.</P>

The answer to (c) is that the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i> was treated more harshly than the <i>Kilkenny People</i> because it was felt that maliciously disposed persons might attempt to undermine public confidence in the censorship if more drastic action was not taken in regard to the offence committed by the <i>Examiner.</i>  The answer to (d) is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and to (e) Clause 54.</P>

      <P>Publication of the news item referred to by the Deputy was prohibited in accordance with the general censorship direction which was issued, after the price of wheat had been fixed and debated in the Dáil, in relation to matter which might have the effect of discouraging farmers from growing wheat at the fixed price.  It was decided to prevent farmers from being discouraged in this way during the sowing season, because a shortage of wheat would entail taking drastic action hurtful to the interests of stock-feeding farmers and the community generally for the purpose of making alternative flourstuffs and foods available to the poorer sections of the people whose diet normally consists of a high proportion of bread.  The necessity of minimising the amount of discouraging propaganda reaching farmers arises from the fact that a number of them who are unfamiliar with the growing of wheat might be persuaded by those interested in creating a shortage of wheat here that it was foolish to attempt growing it, although the truth is that from their own point of view, in ordinarily fair arable land, it is the best paying cereal crop farmers can grow, and that from a national point of view it is the height of wisdom and patriotism to do all they can to make the country self-sufficient in wheat.</P>

It is quite legitimate to advocate changes in Government policy, and everybody who reads the papers every day in the week, or hears the wireless, can see that very many changes in Government policy are being advocated in the most strenuous, and sometimes extravagant, way, by Deputies and various people throughout the country.  But when <Col N="1754" /> this Dáil, which is the authority, decides a matter, or when a matter is decided in accordance with the powers given by this Dáil, in a time of emergency, that policy should go until it is changed in the ordinary constitutional manner.

Dempsey (Dublin Council of Action) and D.J. Hanly (I.N.T.O.), made a recommendation for a hot meal and a break of the day by one hour without any extension of the school hours so as to allow the children to take the meal in comfort; and if, in view of these recommendations and the fact that 67 schools in Dublin avail of the School Meals Acts and that 14 of these have been giving hot meals to the children for some time past, he will take steps to give effect to the recommendation.</P>

As regards the second part of the question, I have not received any recommendation from the special committee appointed by the School Meals Committee.  I may add for the Deputy's information, that managers of National Schools are at liberty, subject to official approval, to extend the interval allowed for recreation from half an hour per day to one hour, or more than one hour in exceptional cases, in order to facilitate arrangements for the supply of school meals to pupils, but not more than half an hour of the recreation period may be included in the minimum period of four hours' secular instruction which must be provided in accordance with the regulations for National Schools.</P>

Kyne (Record No. S. 7598) indicates a change of policy in <Col N="1758" /> respect of land acquisition for the relief of congestion; and, if not, will he say if evidence of the acute congestion existing on or in the vicinity of these estates was given to the tribunal; and can he say how it is now proposed to relieve it, if at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>No change of policy is indicated by the decisions of the Land Commission on the objections against resumption made by the respective tenants on the estates of O'Connor and Nolan and T. J. Kyne.  The particulars of congestion existing in the neighbourhood of these holdings were before the commissioners and the respective decisions were arrived at after full consideration of all the circumstances in each case. The Land Commission are fully aware of the congestion existing in the localities in question, and all such localities are always under consideration in their general policy of endeavouring to relieve congestion by the acquisition of suitable untenanted land or by migration.</P>

      <P>With reference, first, to the Mynish lands, could the Minister say if the tribunal was aware that there are 80 tenants on the fringe of this farm who have between them only 59 acres of the worst land, and that their forebears were dispossessed of this land in 1856?  Can he say also if the tribunal was aware that these applicants were refused housing grants by his Department until such time as this farm was divided amongst them? With reference, then, to the T.J. Kyne lands, can he say whether the tribunal was aware that the Land Commission actually pointed out holdings to congests as far back as 1936, and if it was aware that each of the owners gave consent to the acquisition of these estates by the Land Commission?</P>

      <P>The Land Commission court has been granted certain powers by the Oireachtas and is operating a policy which has been laid down by the Oireachtas, and I have no doubt but that the same procedure was followed in this case as in all other cases, and that full particulars of the circumstances, so far as local needs, from the point of view of the congests, were concerned, were in the knowledge of the commissioners, who are very familiar with conditions in both areas.</P>

      <P>County Wicklow is one of the counties in which the separate office of under-sheriff still exists.  The fees payable to an under-sheriff are prescribed by order, but any dispute in any particular case as to the exact amount is a matter to be settled between the under-sheriff and the person concerned and, if necessary, by the courts.  In general, my Department has no authority to intervene in such a matter or to examine an undersheriff's accounts.  I have, consequently, no official information as to the total amount of such fees in County Wicklow, but my Department is in fairly close touch with the actual situation and I am advised that no evidence of overcharging has come to the Department's knowledge.  If the Deputy cares to furnish me with specific examples I shall have them inquired into, so far as I have any power to do so.</P>

      <P>I am aware that supplies of dry batteries are running short and, in consequence, difficulties are doubtless arising for holders of wireless sets operated by these batteries.  I understand that the Minister for Supplies has had the question of procuring further stocks under special consideration but that, owing to restrictions on the export of zinc both in Great Britain and the United States, the efforts made have not so far been successful. While these efforts will be continued, the prospects at present do not appear to be hopeful.  The suggestion that battery sets which are inoperable should be exempted from licence fee is one which I regret could not be adopted.  Payment of the fee is a statutory obligation in all cases where wireless apparatus is held, whether a complete set or part of a set and <Col N="1764" /> whether workable or not, and the making of exceptions is not feasible.</P>

      <P>2. In page 8, before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Where the same day is the polling day at two or more referenda and the Minister is of opinion that it is for any reason impracticable or inexpedient to comply with the next preceding sub-section of this section in regard to those referenda, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the Minister may direct that separate ballot papers shall be issued for one or more or all of such referenda;</P>
      <P>(b) where the Minister gives such direction as is authorised by the foregoing paragraph of this sub-section, separate ballot papers shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the said next preceding sub-section, be issued in accordance with that direction;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1782" /> (c) where the Minister gives such direction as aforesaid and such direction does not apply to all of such referenda, then and in such case, if there is only one of such referenda to which such direction does not apply, separate ballot papers shall be issued for that one of such referenda, and, if there are two or more of such referenda to which such direction does not apply, the said next preceding sub-section shall apply and have effect in relation to those two or more of such referenda.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to meet a point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  He suggested that, while the Bill provided that if two or more referenda were to be taken on the same day only one ballot paper was to be used, it might, in certain circumstances, be convenient to leave to the discretion of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the question whether one or more ballot papers might be used.  These amendments are giving effect to Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion.  I move amendment No. 1.</P>

      <P>In the discussion on Section 35 Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out that where a petition against a referendum was presented by the Attorney-General no provision had been made for a respondent or some person to defend the result of the referendum.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 27, before rule 26, First Schedule, to insert a new rule as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>26.&mdash;(1)  At any time during the counting of the votes, the local returning officer may and, if so required by any person lawfully present, shall recount the votes recorded on all the ballot papers or on any particular parcel of ballot papers.</P>
      <P>(2)  If, on any first recount under this rule, the result of such recount is the same as the result of the original count, the local returning officer shall not be obliged to make any further recount, but if, on such first recount, the result of such recount is different from the result of the original count, the local returning officer shall repeat the recount until the results of two consecutive such recounts are identical.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to meet a point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, who suggested that rule 26 should be framed in such a way as to give to any person who might desire it the right to ask for a recount.  I pointed out that there would have to be some limit to that right.  This amendment gives to the person the right to ask for and have a recount, or permits the returning officer, if he himself desires of his own volition, to have a recount; but it limits the number of recounts which may be given as of right by this condition, that if the results of two successive recounts agree or two recounts agree, then the right to ask for a recount will be exhausted and the last agreeing recount will be taken as the definitive recount.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate was necessary because the original Estimate introduced for the year for the unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance services contained no provision for the administrative expenses arising in connection with the food voucher scheme.  The expenses in connection with that scheme fall to be met out of the Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance <Col N="1785" /> Vote.  It is not anticipated the amount of the expenses which will arise will involve any excess on the sum originally provided, and this is just a token Supplementary Estimate necessary to provide the authority required to charge the account of such expenses against the Vote.</P>
    <P>As, however, this is the first occasion upon which it has been necessary to come to the Dáil since the initiation of the food allowances scheme on a matter associated with that scheme, it might be of interest to Deputies if I were to give a brief review of the progress of the scheme to date.  The first issue of food vouchers was made on 4th September last year.  It was made on that date in respect of dependents of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, and the first issue was made on 5th September to other qualified classes of persons.  In every week since then, food vouchers have been issued in respect of approximately 84,000 persons resident in urban areas.  These 84,000 persons can be sub-divided as follows: Dependents of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, 34,000; old-aged pensioners, blind pensioners, and their dependent children, 24,000; widows and children who are beneficiaries under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 22,000, and recipients of disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, who are in necessitous circumstances, 4,000.</P>
    <P>Of the total of 84,000, very nearly half, that is 39,000, are resident in the City of Dublin or the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  The weekly allowances in kind which are provided for each qualified person are 3½ pints of milk, a ¼ of a lb. of creamery butter, and 2 lbs. of batch bread, so that the quantities of food made available each week under the scheme are 36,750 gallons of milk, 187½ cwts. of butter, and 84,000 2-lb. loaves.  The scheme provides that shop-keepers who exchange food vouchers for the specified quantities and kinds of goods may present them at the appropriate cash value to the wholesale suppliers of food, and the wholesalers are obliged to accept these food vouchers for encashment when so presented and will receive the cash from the appropriate branch of the Department <Col N="1786" /> of Industry and Commerce The arrangements made for the prompt encashment of these food vouchers have proved satisfactory, payment normally being made within one week of the receipt of vouchers.  In conclusion, I should like to express a special word of thanks to both retailers and wholesalers for the way in which they have co-operated in ensuring the successful working of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter, generally, was drawn attention to before we entered on the budgetary position last year, and certain undertakings were given by the Government that additional assistance in the matter of relief would be given, and subsequently this order was made.  I would suggest to the Minister at this stage, however, that a full review of the whole situation will be necessary before the presentation of the budgetary position and the financial proposals for the coming year are made, because anybody who knows the circumstances, and a lot of people who do not know the circumstances, fear what the exact position is, that is, that between the various payments that are made, unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, national health insurance and, possibly, outdoor relief and all that, there are very many cases in which there is inadequate provision if we are going to maintain people who are below the poverty line in any kind of an efficient physical state, not to talk about the moral state, and as between these gaps there are various cases in which hardship arises with which there is no means of dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance and the people who are in receipt of poor relief, again there are very many cases in which the provision is not really adequate for the physical needs of the people or for maintaining in any way their self-respect.  With the rise in prices at the present time, and particularly with the difficulty, as a result of the unsuitability of the fuel available, of getting the best out of even the food that is available, the distress is very much increased.  I have not the order with me, under which <Col N="1787" /> there is a restriction as to the number of dependents in respect of whom these allowances can be made, but the Minister is probably aware that a person with six dependent children can get six allowances for these children, but if he has eight or ten children he still can get only six allowances.  There is some queer rigidity of mind, on the part of whomever framed the order, which ignores the circumstances in which the person with a large family of ten or 11 children finds himself. That person is told in an arbitrary kind of way: &ldquo;You may have ten or 11 children, but you are only going to get food vouchers for six.&rdquo;  Under the present circumstances you have people, depending on unemployment assistance, having to go then to the relieving officer to get outdoor relief, and, very often, to the charitable societies to get additional assistance.  I think the whole situation should be brought more closely under review when we face the proposals for the next year, with a view to seeing what we are going to do to maintain people, who are below the poverty line, efficiently, and to see, particularly, that all the children, whether there be six, eight, ten or 12 in the family, are adequately looked after and that a child is not penalised simply because he is the seventh or the eighth or the ninth in the family.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister here that he has given us figures with regard to those who are in receipt of relief under this voucher system, in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, old age pensions, blind pensions, and so on, but it implies that no arrangement has been made by which these vouchers will be given to people who are in receipt simply of home assistance.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that people in receipt of home assistance can get these vouchers and, if not, whether he thinks that it ought to be extended to such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse Deputy Mulcahy's appeal to the Minister for a general review of this whole matter when we come to deal with the general Estimates for the coming year, <Col N="1788" /> particularly in regard to many people who are what might be called borderline cases and who are left out. Deputy Mulcahy referred to the fact that these food vouchers are only supplied for six children in a family, and that there is no relief for children over that number.  Obviously, that is a matter that calls for serious attention, with a view to seeing whether the relief could be extended to all the children in the family.  Another hardship is that the vouchers are only available in certain urban areas.  Immediately outside the fixed or marked urban boundary you will often find the same density of population and the same poverty as inside the boundary, and yet these people are excluded from the benefit of these vouchers.  I think that is a matter which should be dealt with in the forthcoming Estimates, as it is one that calls for immediate attention because many of these people have been removed from the city and are in dire poverty.  Some of them are widows, perhaps, and some are living on home help from the county authorities, but just because they are located outside the fixed mark they are excluded from participation in the voucher system.  I think the obvious thing would be to grant these people the same facilities as their immediate neighbours.  There is another point I want to put to the Minister, but I am not so sure about it.  I think that this is not available to widows drawing the non-contributory pension.</P>

      <P>I had complaints from some of these people and I was not quite sure for which reason they were excluded&mdash;whether it was because they were outside the area or for the other reason.  I think that the fact that the pensions that are available to them under the non-contributory scheme are so meagre, makes them all the more deserving of the vouchers which their fellows are getting.  I trust that these matters will receive the Minister's favourable consideration when it comes to a revision of the provisions of the food voucher system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to <Col N="1789" /> appeal to the Minister to have provision made in so far as people living immediately outside the urban areas are concerned.  Those people who are living just on the borders of the town, but immediately outside the borough or city boundary, suffer the same degree of poverty, and have to pay the same for food stuffs and the other necessaries of life as the people living inside the boundary.  When they do work, their work is inside the town, and when they are unemployed, they are treated differently from those who live inside the city or town.  I came across recently a great many instances of hardship in the case of people who live on the outskirts of the town. Personally, I am of opinion that those vouchers should be made available to people who live in the rural areas and who draw unemployment assistance, in the same way as they are available to people living in urban areas and drawing unemployment assistance; but if the Minister cannot see his way to extend them to the whole of the rural areas, I do think there ought to be a prescribed radius outside each of the towns and cities, and that the same conditions should be applied to people living there as apply to people living inside the towns.  The same degree of poverty exists there, and there is the same necessity for those vouchers.</P>

      <P>I think it is no harm to have it on record that there is very little complaint about the manner in which the scheme has been administered. In fact, the complaints are remarkably few, having regard to the nature of the scheme and the innovation it constituted in the social services provided by the State.  I do not know what review of the position in respect of social services Deputy Mulcahy desires to have.  It is, of <Col N="1790" /> course, always possible to contend that the assistance provided for destitute persons, or others who are near destitution, by means of the social services is insufficient.  Obviously financial considerations primarily determine the extent of the assistance that can be provided.  There may be other considerations also, but it is primarily the matter of cost that prevents the extension of those services in the manner which is always suggested by Deputies when they come up here for discussion.  I do not think, however, that we should, in any review of the social services, leave out of account&mdash; as some Deputies are disposed to do&mdash; the activities of the home assistance authorities.  In the framing of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, and other social service legislation, the existence of the home assistance authorities and the responsibility which they have to relieve destitution arising in their areas was taken into account.  It was always realised that any State scheme administered in accordance with the principles laid down by Parliament, and confined to persons who come within certain defined categories, would leave gaps which could only be filled by the home assistance authorities.  Every State scheme of social relief can apply only to certain easily definable classes of people, and it is not always possible to extend those definitions so as to ensure that nobody will be overlooked. We had in mind, in framing those measures, the possibility that there would be individuals or even small sections of people who would be overlooked, but we kept in mind the fact that the home assistance service was there, that there was on the home assistance authority the obligation to relieve destitution, no matter from what cause arising, and that they would fill in those gaps by giving special assistance to those who were not provided for under State schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the precise point made by Deputy Mulcahy that there were gaps in the social services.  To fill those gaps the home assistance authority exists, and in many respects a scheme of unemployment assistance or other State scheme for the relief of distress is not complete in the sense that it does not cover everybody who could possibly be brought within the category of persons for whom the scheme was intended. Reference was made by Deputy Mulcahy, for instance, to the fact that there is a limit to the number of dependents in respect of whom unemployment assistance is paid.  It is the limitation, imposed by the Unemployment Assistance Act, that imposes a similar limitation on those food vouchers.  When the Unemployment Assistance Act was before the Dáil as a Bill that matter was adverted to.  It was explained then that the Government contemplated that, in the case of families of larger size than the maximum entitled to the assistance provided under the Act, the home assistance authority would supplement the amount of unemployment assistance payable, in order to give to that family the greater amount of assistance which its larger size obviously necessitated.  That applies also in respect of those food vouchers.  The home assistance authorities operate a food voucher scheme of their own, and that answers one of the queries raised by Deputy Mulcahy.  To enable them to do that, the State provides a subsidy of £400,000.  The persons receiving food vouchers from the local authorities are, of course, additional to the number I have given as representing the persons who are receiving food vouchers under the Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not, therefore, rigidity of mind which limited the scope of operation of the Unemployment Assistance <Col N="1792" /> Act and consequently of the food allowances order, or any other social service.  It was the knowledge that any State scheme, to be effectively administered and to avoid the possibility of abuse arising, had to be so framed that it would apply only to persons who could be easily defined and brought within clearly recognisable categories, and that those persons who could not fit themselves within those definitions or categories had to be provided for otherwise.  Of course the home assistance authorities are in a better position to provide for those people because they can carry out an investigation of the individual circumstances in a manner which is not possible under any State scheme.  It may be true that circumstances have so changed that the adequacy of the assistance provided under the various social services requires reconsideration.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the multiplication of those services has created a situation which is causing concern in the minds of some people, concern which has already had expression in the newspapers.  Cases have arisen where the heads of families in receipt of unemployment assistance and food vouchers, plus a contribution from the home assistance authorities and occasionally an additional contribution from a charitable organisation like the St. Vincent de Paul Society, have found that the total income of their household when not working was as great, if not greater, than the income they would have when employment became available to them.  Cases of that kind have arisen, and while I do not say they are numerous or sufficiently serious in character to cause any great perturbation, it is quite obvious to anybody that a further extension of the social services of the State or an increase in the individual assistance given under those social services could create a situation which would cause anomalies and difficulties of a new kind.  If anybody criticises our existing social services because of a few instances of that kind, the criticism can be answered on the ground that the individual needs of the person concerned were examined by competent officers <Col N="1793" /> both of the local authority and of the charitable organisation, and that those competent officers, having carried out that examination, arrived at a conclusion as to the minimum required to enable that particular family to be maintained, and anything less than that minimum would be inadequate. So that even if the head of the family were to get work at a lower wage than the aggregate of the contributions he received from the various public and private authorities, that wage would probably require to be supplemented by some of those charitable organisations to enable the family to be maintained.  I think, however, it can be said that the provision of this food allowance scheme has gone a long way to ease the situation which was arising in the cities and towns and has nullified to a large extent the fluctuation in the price of foodstuffs, at any rate so far as the unemployed are concerned, and also the other classes of persons to whom the scheme applies, because, of course, these food allowances are made irrespective of the price of the various classes of food supplied at any time, and that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>It is true that the food allowance scheme applies only to urban areas at present.  The decision to confine it to urban areas originally was due to the fact that the Government appreciated that the special circumstances of the time were more likely to cause hardship and difficulty in the towns than in the rural areas.  I think everybody recognises that that is the case.  It was the knowledge that the people in the towns, the workers and unemployed in the towns, were likely to be more seriously affected by the adverse conditions existing that led the Government to the decision to supplement the assistance then being given in those urban areas.  It would be a matter of administrative difficulty, apart altogether from the question of the desirability of it, to extend the food allowance scheme to rural areas. But, clearly, so long as you have a differentiation between urban and rural areas, a borderline case will arise.  No matter where you draw the border, whether you draw it at the borough <Col N="1794" /> or urban boundary, or a mile beyond the boundary, there will always arise the case of the man just outside the boundary who is consequently deprived of the same measure of assistance which the person who is just inside the boundary is entitled to receive.</P>

      <P>That may happen undoubtedly. It does exist in acute form in some districts where borough housing schemes have to be extended outside the borough boundary.  But I think we should not lose sight of the problem which arises when an attempt is made to depart from recognised boundaries in matters of this kind, and the borough authorities could ease the situation for themselves by taking whatever measures are open to them for an extension of the borough boundary to include those urban workers within the borough area.  I do not know what the difficulty is in getting an extension of the borough boundary.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that it will take some time.  I often thought that the problem which arises in the case of the City of Cork, where a large part of the city's housing activities were carried out outside the city boundary and a large number of the city workers moved outside the boundary, could and should have been resolved before this by an extension of the boundary.  I could not understand what is the difficulty in proceeding in that way.  It is true, of course, that these workers are not now at any disadvantage, because the city authorities have decided to supplement the assistance they receive from the State to the extent that the total amount they get is, in any event, what they would get even if the boundary had been extended to include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> I do not want Deputies to lose sight of the problem which would arise so long as there is any differentiation between one part of the country and another in administering a service of this kind.  I do not think there is much likelihood of the Government's deciding to extend this scheme to rural areas at present.  I think that the special circumstances which seem to require exceptional treatment for the urban areas will continue, and in fact will become more noticeable as time goes on, for the duration of the emergency.  However, we can discuss this general question of the adequacy of our social services, and the possibility of or the need for extending them in one direction or another, on a more appropriate occasion.  I have merely to report to the Dáil that this particular service, the food allowance service in urban areas, has been in operation, that it has provided considerable relief in the areas in which it has been in operation, and that, judging by the representations made to the Department, no real administrative problems in connection with it have arisen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill had its origin in the building dispute in 1937.  In connection with that dispute the question arose, during the negotiations which led to the settlement of it, of the loss suffered by building trade workers when their employment was interrupted by inclement weather which made it impossible for outdoor building operations to be continued. One of the demands made by the workers' side in those negotiations was for payment during those periods of stoppage due to inclement weather. In the course of the discussions it was agreed, on my suggestion, that we would consider the possibility of preparing an insurance scheme against the loss of employment due to inclement weather amongst building trade workers and, subsequent to the termination of the dispute, a number <Col N="1796" /> of meetings were held between representatives of the employers and the workers at which the details of a scheme providing for such insurance against intermittent unemployment due to inclement weather were worked out.  That scheme was embodied in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced in 1939 with the intention of arranging for its discussion in that year.  But, shortly after its introduction, the war began and the pressure of administrative affairs following the war made it impossible to proceed with the Bill then. Subsequently, as Deputies are aware, further difficulties emerged for the building trade from the circumstances of the war.  Building activities became considerably curtailed and shortages of various building materials made it evident that building work on any scale was not likely to be resumed while the war lasted.  I felt, therefore, that it was undesirable to deal with the Bill without giving the parties who were associated with the working out of it an opportunity of reconsidering it in the light of the new circumstances. I felt that there might be reasons why either of the parties would prefer a postponement of the measure until the emergency had passed.  I arranged for consultation with them and found that that was not the case; that they still wished to have the Bill proceeded with and a scheme of insurance against intermittent unemployment, due to inclement weather, brought into operation. I therefore arranged for the submission of the Bill to the Dáil with a view to its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish, for manual workers in the building trade, a scheme of insurance against intermittent unemployment resulting from stoppages of building work due to inclement weather.  It also provides for the extension of that scheme of insurance, at the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to other trades.  I may say that it is not proposed to extend it to other trades at present until some experience of its working in relation to the building trade has been obtained.  Clearly, there are other classes of workers besides building trade workers who are liable to be intermittently unemployed <Col N="1797" /> due to inclement weather, and if a case can be made for insuring building trade workers against that loss, a similar case can, presumably, be made for insuring other classes of workers against similar loss.  It proposes, for the time being, to confine the scheme to building trade workers until experience of its operation has been secured, and, in the light of that experience, to consider its possible extension to other trades which are carried on, in the main, out of doors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want, for the moment, to suggest other classes to whom the scheme might be applied, but many such classes will occur to most Deputies.  The scheme provides that insured persons and their employers will provide, by means of weekly contributions to a fund to be established, the means out of which payments will be made to these insured persons while they are intermittently unemployed.  The State itself will not contribute to the fund.  The undertaking which I gave and the arrangement which has been entered into provides that the administrative cost of carrying out the scheme will be met by the State.  While the entire revenue of the fund will be available for the payment of benefits, the administrative expenses, which it is estimated may amount to about £10,000 per year, will be met by the State, and that will constitute the State's contribution to this scheme for the betterment of conditions in the building trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund will be under the management of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who will decide all questions regarding the scope of the scheme.  For the purpose of administering the scheme, the Minister is authorised to appoint local officers, insurance officers, courts of referees, an umpire and inspectors&mdash;the umpire and inspectors appointed under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  It is considered that the administrative expenses will be reduced and, in any event, a more satisfactory arrangement is to use the machinery already in existence under the Unemployment <Col N="1798" /> Insurance Acts for the determination of all questions of dispute that may arise under this Act.  Therefore, when any dispute arises, the procedure will be the same as that now followed when a dispute arises under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  A decision will be made by the appointed officer; there will be an appeal from that officer to the court of referees; and from the court of referees, on matters of law, to the umpire, the same court of referees and the same umpire as function under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>In justification of the introduction of the Bill, I would say that the activities of the building trade are, in particular, influenced by the nature of the weather at any particular time, and employment in the building trade is, or can be, at periods of the year, very adversely affected by weather conditions. What is commonly known in the trade as wet time, that is to say, hours or periods during which building activities in whole or in part must be suspended, owing to rain, frost, snow, storm and the like, are frequent occurrences. Workers in the industry are generally paid upon an hourly basis, so that they are unable to foresee from week to week, or even from day to day, how their earnings will be affected by weather conditions.  Housekeeping on incomes of such a varying and uncertain nature is a matter of the greatest difficulty, and sometimes even a matter of embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The problem constituted by that intermittent unemployment in the building trade has concerned building trade employers and the leaders of building trade unions for some time past.  In Great Britain, just before the war, arrangements had been made for the introduction by the industry, for itself and without the support of legislation, of a scheme of insurance against broken time through bad weather, but the introduction of that scheme was, I think, prevented by the war and has been deferred until after the war.  So far as I know, this is the first attempt anywhere to make provision against loss of employment in the building trade through inclement weather by means of legislation and, consequently, <Col N="1799" /> the measure must be regarded as being, to some extent, experimental.  There was not the precedent of successfully operated legislation of a similar kind in other countries to refer to, but I think I can say that the scheme of the Bill, which took a long time to prepare and which was discussed in every detail with the representatives of the employers and workers, appears to be reasonably good.</P>
    <P>There has been an opportunity afforded since the Bill was first introduced in 1939 to examine how precisely it would have worked out if it had been enacted in 1939.  The experience of the building trade, such as it was, during these two years&mdash;it was not a normal experience because of the special emergency circumstances&mdash;was recorded and an account made of the payments that would probably have to be made out of the fund if the Bill had been in operation.  From the results of that investigation, it does appear that the scheme of the Bill as it appears at present is reasonably sound, that the contributions payable under the Bill would be adequate to provide for the payment of the benefits contemplated, but not more than that. The Minister is, however, given power in the Bill to vary either the rate of contribution or the rate of benefit. It is quite clear that the scheme must be financially sound, if it is to work, that the total of the contributions payable in any year must be equal to the amounts of benefits that will require to be paid in that year, and we cannot, on the basis of the very limited and rather experimental records that were kept, say with certainty that, in normal circumstances, these contributions will enable these benefits to be paid.</P>
    <P>If experience should show, over a period of time, that the contributions are insufficient to enable the benefits to be paid, either the contributions will have to be varied upward or the benefits downward.  If, on the other hand, it appears that the contributions are more than sufficient to enable these benefits to be paid, then the reverse process will be possible.  The fund, of course, can be allowed to run into debt, although it is not desirable that it should, but if a deficiency should at <Col N="1800" /> any time appear in the fund which was likely to be only of a temporary character, it can be met by borrowing. I should hope, however, that the fund would, in the course of time, build up a reserve which would always be available to meet the circumstances of a particularly wet season during which the claims for benefit would be more numerous.</P>
    <P>The scheme of the Bill is one of compulsory insurance.  It will be obligatory upon all employers and all workers in the building trade to participate in the scheme.  The contributions made will be recorded by means of stamps, as in the case of unemployment insurance, and the obligation to make a contribution will rest upon the employer who may recover the worker's share by a deduction from wages.  The payment of benefit will also be made by the employer.  It is only in cases where dispute exists, or where other difficulty has arisen, that the benefits will be paid through the employment exchange.  In practice, it is contemplated that the employer will pay to the worker who has been disemployed for a period owing to bad weather the proper rate of benefit, and will then recover from the fund the amount of the benefit so paid. It is necessary, of course, to provide various safeguards against abuse, although it must be recognised that the greatest safeguard against abuse will be, firstly, the disinclination of workers to accept benefit instead of wages, if it is possible for them to be earning wages, because the rate of benefit is lower than the standard rate of wages in the building trade and, secondly, the fact that an employer who makes a payment will have to recover the amount paid, and if there is any question as to the right of the employer to make that payment, having regard to the weather conditions of the time or other circumstances, he risks the loss of the amount, or, at any rate, he risks failure to recover from the fund the amount so paid.  It is a fact that the best safeguard in the interests of both employers and workers will be to ensure that the payment of benefit under the scheme will be kept at a minimum.  It is, of <Col N="1801" /> course, necessary to supplement a safeguard of that kind by various checks, and the Bill provides for these checks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is left to him to decide.  Of course, the worker has the right to appeal if, in fact, circumstances arise during which he finds that he is unable to work because of the inclemency of the weather and fails to get payment from the employer. In that case the employee has the right to appeal.  The rates of contribution, and the rates of benefit, are set out in the Schedule to the Bill in respect of a skilled worker.  The term &ldquo;skilled worker&rdquo; is defined in the Bill as Deputies will notice.  The contribution by the insured person will be 8d. per week and by the employer 8d. per week.  The rate of supplementary benefit payable to a skilled worker who becomes intermittently unemployed is a 1/- per hour.  In the case of unskilled workers, the contribution from the worker is 5d. and from the employer 5d., and the rate of supplementary benefit 7½d. per hour.  In the case of young persons, the rates of contribution are 2d. for the employer and 2d. for the young person, and the rate of supplementary benefit 3d. per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, perhaps, attempt to forestall any comparison between the rates of benefit payable under that Schedule with the standard rates of wages for skilled and unskilled workers in the building trade, say, in Dublin, where the rates are high as compared with the rest of the country.  This is a national scheme that is going to be applicable to the whole country, and hence the rates of benefit payable under it must take into account the rates of wages of men not merely in Dublin, but throughout the country as a whole.  We cannot, of course, risk a situation in which there might appear to a worker to be an advantage in <Col N="1802" /> being unemployed and in drawing supplementary benefit rather than in earning wages at work.  It is, therefore, essential, from many points of view, that the rates of benefit should be less, substantially less, than the actual rates of wages, so that the tendency on the part of the worker will be to be at work, except when weather conditions render work impossible.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, of course, that the fund should be built up to some extent before benefit will become payable. Consequently, the Bill provides that no man becomes entitled to receive benefit until 12 contributions have been paid in respect of him.  That applies not merely to existing workers, who have been insurable, but under the scheme, as soon as it comes into operation, it will also apply to new entrants to the industry under the Bill.  New entrants will not become entitled to receive supplementary benefit unless and until they have had 12 weeks' work in the building trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as he has 12 contributions paid, he will be entitled to receive supplementary benefit.  In that respect the scheme under this Bill is not the same as that under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, which take into account the fact that people go out of insurable employment altogether. In this case, the individual worker is being insured against that type of unemployment.  His right to benefit, for which he is insured, depends solely on the fact that contributions in respect of a period of 12 weeks have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that it is proposed to bring this measure into effect as soon as it becomes law.  I would like to give notice at this stage that it is going <Col N="1803" /> to take some time, after the enactment of the Bill, before it can be brought into operation.  The preparations for doing that will include the printing of the stamps, which is a difficult and tedious matter in any circumstances, and particularly so in present circumstances.  That will take some time.  There are technical difficulties which make it impossible to speed it up, so that it is likely to be some time, after the Bill has passed, before the scheme can be brought into operation. The Bill provides that the scheme will come into operation on a date to be fixed by order by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is clear, therefore, that one cannot tell in advance the date from which an insured person's right to receive benefit will come into operation.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other aspect of the scheme that it is necessary for me to refer to.  I have given a general picture of what the Bill contemplates. It is a matter of some consolation to me that I can come to the House with such a Bill and announce that it is practically an agreed measure so far as both parties in the industry are concerned.  In fact, to a very great extent, the Bill is their own product, in so far as the general scheme of the Bill, in its main provisions, was drafted in consultation with the employers and workers in the industry. The scheme under it was prepared by them.  It was approved by me, and was then put into the form of a Bill by the Parliamentary draftsman.  Even at that stage, the parties in the industry had another opportunity of considering the draft of the Bill.  They have approved of that draft as giving expression to what they intended to create in the matter of an intermittent unemployment insurance scheme for the building industry.  There are, perhaps, some details of it which require, and should get, the careful consideration of the House.  I have had discussions already with individuals who are perturbed about some of the sections, and rather dubious as to how they will work.  It is desirable that we should give all these sections very careful examination, because I believe that if we <Col N="1804" /> can make this Bill workable, if we can so frame it that the benefits it will confer will be obvious and that the administrative problems will be few, then the question of the extension of this method of insurance to other industries will become easier, because both the employers and the workers in those industries will have less difficulty in facing up to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement that this is an agreed Bill alters very much one's criticism of the measure, but on its face it does not appear to be financially sound.  The contributions which are to be paid weekly by both employers and employees amount to 1/4, so that three weeks' contributions would leave a credit of four hours for any individual. Four hours in a period of 140 hours does not appear to be a very elaborate estimate of a possible loss of time.  It may be that in respect to quite a number of operatives some of them would never draw benefit.  It is quite possible a number of those engaged in the building trade, the majority of the trades involved, might not be so subject to weather conditions as others, and in that respect it may be that the balance will be in favour of the estimate being better than what it appears to be on its face.</P>
      <P>The proposal to increase or decrease the contributions paid by an order of the Minister is not a very acceptable one, but, as it affects only the persons concerned and they have agreed to it, it does not look as if we should interfere with that proposal.  The Minister said there would not be an insurance year.  Possibly Section 9, which refers to an insurance year, deals with the balancing of the accounts for a particular year.  Some period must be taken in which it would be desirable to have an account of the year's incomings and outgoings.  I take it that, so far as Section 9 is concerned, it is for that purpose the insurance year is mentioned and not for the purpose of interfering with what a contributor would be entitled to draw in the event of having stamps to credit.</P>

      <P>There is, of course, provision for an insurance year.  A person <Col N="1805" /> who has left the building trade, in the sense that no contributions are paid in respect to him for a year, ceases to become entitled to benefit.  That provision is there to that extent, and perhaps I may have misled Deputy Corish, because a person must have contributions in respect to him during the year in order to become entitled to benefit. The person who has no contributions paid is deemed to have left the scheme.</P>

      <P>That again is a slight shock, but if they have agreed to it, it is their business.  There are some exclusions, very few, but in a matter of this sort the fewer the exclusions the better.  If there are persons who, by reason of whatever place in which they are employed, are less liable to interruption than in other places, it would be only fair that their contributions should also go to make up the fund for those who are less fortunate, and taxing them, if one were to employ the term, in that respect, would, I think, be rather fair, having regard to the position in which they would be placed. The principal exclusions, I think, are under Section 11, and probably the reason for that was that there is not any broken time under State employment. I do not think that is a very good reason.  We should take the employers as a whole and, if there are those operatives who are particularly fortunate, there is no reason why they should not bear their share in contributing to their less fortunate brethren.</P>
      <P>This measure was circulated only last week.  I read it, perhaps hastily, on the morning it came, but, as well as I can remember, there was nothing in that section which empowers a Minister to avail of the order about informing the House of events, such as laying a Paper on the Table. I think that ought to be done.  I am quite sure, although this clause is so worded to increase or decrease, that the Minister's advisers were not of the opinion that there was likely to be a decrease in the contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to make a suggestion to the parties concerned, who have agreed perhaps on everything, it is that they might consider the advisability of allowing the fund to be made up to <Col N="1806" /> deal with special circumstances which occur in a country now and again.  For example, nearly 50 years ago there were seven weeks of frost here, and a thing of that sort would interfere very seriously with a measure of this kind. If a fund were built up, it would be of advantage to those in the trade.  It is satisfactory to know that in one trade, at least, there is agreement between employers and employees, agreement which finds its way here in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure. I consider it a very laudable attempt to stabilise the position of the unfortunate people who are employed in the building industry and who have suffered so much through the vagaries of our climate.  As the Minister said, it must be to a very large extent experimental, because there is no very reliable data on which to go.  I am sure this measure will also be welcomed by other members of my Party. I am delighted to see that it is being made compulsory, because if it is not so made there might be very little hope of its success.  I had a question on the Order Paper to-day suggesting that steps should be taken to require employers to cover by insurance certain risks under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  We are aware of the conditions that exist, and I am afraid they would be much the same if we did not have compulsory insurance in this type of intermittent scheme that is now being proposed.</P>
      <P>I think it would be worth the Minister's while, for the sake of the more equitable and speedy working of the scheme if, in connection with the machinery he proposes, he would bear in mind the idea of vesting more authority and discretion in the local exchange managers.  I suggest that most matters in relation to which there might be some dispute would be matters of fact.  I do not know what disputes one could visualise at the moment, but I suggest that they would have relation primarily to matters of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly there would be the danger of collusion between an employer and the workers, but, if the matter is to go through the routine that we have at <Col N="1807" /> the present time, and has to come up here to the officers in Dublin, it will mean delay.  To a big extent, obviously, it will not be so much a question of interpretation of laws as a question of matters of fact, which would be better known to the man on the spot, and I think it would be well to try to have this thing work as smoothly and expeditiously as possible.  There is one point that I am not quite clear about. If a man has not paid his contributions for 12 months, then I presume that he goes out of benefit in the same way as under the ordinary unemployment insurance, but in this case does he lose the advantage of the stamps that he has to his credit?  For instance, he may have worked for five years intermittently and none of his lost time might be due to the weather, but he would have contributed his stamps.  He was only knocked off because of the completion of the job and he has a pile of stamps to his credit without ever having drawn from the fund because of loss of employment due to inclement weather.  Now he loses 12 months, and will they be lost to him also?</P>

      <P>What I want to know is whether, when he gets employment again, he can revive the value of his stamps.  I appreciate that it is difficult to know what the rates will be or whether they will be equitable in comparison with the benefits that are paid, and I take it that there will be revision in that respect, because it is more or less a gamble whether the 8d., or whatever it is, will work out to leave a balance on one side or the other.  I take it that an early opportunity will be taken to have a revision of these figures so as to have a scale, either up or down, as suggested by the Minister. This is a difficult Bill to criticise and, as the Minister says, it will call for <Col N="1808" /> careful discussion on the Committee Stage, but I think we can say that we all welcome it and we hope for the cooperation of all Parties in making it of benefit for the building-trade workers and others of a similar character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a few comments I hope the Minister will not say that I am making points which would be better raised on Committee, because there are many people who are wondering where they stand, and the sooner they can find that out the better.  The Minister says that the Bill is an agreed measure with the builders, and I think that is perfectly correct, but I hope the Minister's purpose is not to bring in a whole lot of other people who have to contribute but probably will never draw a penny in benefit.  I would like to point out that I take it that in this insurance there are really two things that affect the weather as far as the builders are concerned, namely, rain and frost. Different trades are affected differently by both of those.  I think it will not be disputed that the first and the biggest casualties due to the weather occur in the case of bricklayers.  The bricklayer, by the nature of his trade, is out in the open the whole time laying bricks and, of course, very bad, wet weather or heavy frost affects him. Bricklayers are affected to a very great extent.  I suppose that next in the line would come builders' labourers, and, probably next in the line, there might be a dead heat between the carpenters, who put up casings, and the painters who work on an open site, and some other tradesmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister has drawn Section 3 very much wider than the builders.  I would like to call his attention to Section 3 (d) which says: &ldquo;all work in the manufacture, alteration, fitting or repair of articles of wood, worked stone, marble&rdquo;, etc. The section speaks of work in the manufacture, and so on, of articles of wood of a type commonly made in builders' workshops or yards.  I would like to point out to the Minister that under that a wood-cutting machinist employed by a timber merchant would be affected.  Does the Minister seriously <Col N="1809" /> suggest that that man should make a contribution?  If so, I should like to say that it is really on the principle of putting something into the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; because he will never draw anything out.  A terrazzo worker would also come in under that clause 3 (d)&mdash;well, I think he would really come in under 3 (a)&mdash;but does the Minister suggest that a terrazzo worker is laid off because of inclement weather?  I think that if a terrazzo worker were to be affected in that way it would mean that they were building the house upside down and putting on the roof last.  Another person about whom I should like to ask the Minister is a brass finisher who visits a site to put a brass grill, say, in the offices across the street.  Does the Minister suggest that that person should be brought in?  When I say &ldquo;that person&rdquo; I mean a member of the brass-finishing trade.  Another section that could be brought in under clause 3 would be practically all the labourers employed by timber merchants and saw millers throughout the country. They would be engaged in the &ldquo;manufacture, alteration, fitting, or repair of articles of wood&rdquo;.  Certainly, the men who carried stuff to the machines would come under that category.  I am not sure whether the pilers would not also be affected, on the same principle that Deputy Byrne spoke about the sand men who would be laid off, not because of inclement weather but because the builder's job had stopped. Of course it might be argued that it was due to inclement weather, but I think in that case it would be inclement weather once removed&mdash;that is, unemployment.  However, that is merely illustrating the difficulty of drawing a line.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister&mdash;I do not suppose he could have done it in any other way&mdash;that this is the third column of additions and the third column of substractions from the wages of the employee that the employer will have to have in his wages book.  It is the third book of stamps that he will have to keep and lick. The Minister spoke about the administrative cost.  I think he has shoved about 98 per cent. of the administrative cost on to the employer.  The employer <Col N="1810" /> has to contribute the stamps, deduct the stamps, and make up the stamp book.  He has to pay the man the money, and he has to furnish a claim to the Department, which, if it is not absolutely in order, will be thrown out. I do not suppose that after a time there will be very much difficulty about that, because I do not think there can be any dispute about the employer wanting to stop the job and the men wanting to go on.  I never heard of an employer who stopped a job when the men wanted to go on.  It is more a matter of common consent.  But I am just wondering if a dispute could arise in the City of Dublin when one builder had stopped work on a site, and it could be thrown in his teeth that another builder only a short distance away had not stopped the job.  I am just wondering if controversies like that could arise.</P>
    <P>To get back to the administration, I think I have mentioned about the three columns, the addition and subtraction, and the furnishing of the claim.  The Minister's Department has only to O.K. that claim.  If the Minister measures the cost of that at £10,000 per annum, I should like to suggest to him that there is a very much greater administrative cost which must be borne by the employer, and ultimately by the building owner, whoever he may be, whether private or public.  However, as the Minister said, it certainly is an agreed measure between the builders and the workers, the Government having given the pledge that the Minister spoke of, so that I am merely sounding a note of warning to the Minister that he cannot put in many more columns of additions and subtractions. I should like the Minister, when replying, to mention, as far as possible, the points which I have raised, and to give us some reasonable period between now and the Committee Stage, so that the various interests who are involved or think they are involved can go into the matter and see where they stand.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell's picture of the employer spending all his time licking stamps and putting them on the various cards is a rather distressing <Col N="1811" /> one.  I am sure there is nobody who has interested himself in the development of social services who has not at the back of his head an ideal system by which one stamp on one card would provide all the benefits contemplated by the State for all workers. That is an ideal which I think we are not likely to realise for some time. There are obviously many difficulties in securing that complete administrative unity in respect of all the social and insurance services available to workers, and I hold out no hope of being able to overcome them in the near future.  I appreciate that those extensions of the legal requirements of employers in respect of their workers impose administrative costs and administrative difficulties upon the employers, but I do not think they are of such a character as to deter us from proceeding along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of the inadequacy of the contributions to pay the benefits contemplated by the Bill, and Deputy Keyes referred to the fixation of those figures as something in the nature of a gamble.  While that is true to a certain extent, it is not altogether true.  From the day upon which it was contemplated that legislation of this kind would be introduced, records were taken and information was obtained from various employers in relation to their own individual experience over the years 1938, 1939 and 1940, and earlier years in respect of which records existed, and from various local authorities and other sources, to enable some fairly reliable calculation to be made as to the probable incidence of intermittent unemployment amongst building trade workers.  It was not merely a guess which resulted in those figures; it was a calculation based upon all the available information.  It is, of course, recognised that the information cannot be 100 per cent. reliable, and that only experience over a number of years will in fact determine what contributions will permit of the payment of those benefits, or what benefits will be payable from those contributions.  I can, however, say that there are good grounds for believing that the contributions contemplated in this Bill will <Col N="1812" /> be sufficient to pay the benefits indicated. A lot will depend, of course, upon the experience in the earlier months during which the Bill is in operation.  If an exceptionally bad year should be experienced at the beginning, then the finances of the fund will be upset.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, an exceptionally good year is experienced, then the fund should be able to build up reserves which will enable the bad years later to be successfully encountered. The Bill proposes to fix those contributions and certain benefits in the light of experience.  There is a proposal that those benefits or contributions can be varied.  To answer Deputy Cosgrave's point concerning the submission to the Dáil of any proposals for variations of contributions or benefits, I would draw his attention to a general section which provides that all regulations made by the Minister under the Bill must be submitted to the Dáil in the usual way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would, by order, make regulations providing for the alterations of the contributions or the benefits.  Any such order made by the Minister must be laid before the Dáil, and could be annulled by the Dáil.  That is provided for in Section 13 of the Bill.  While, therefore. I cannot say with any definiteness that those contributions or benefits will never be altered, I think they are more likely to prove accurate than not, and the experience of the two years during which the Bill has been in existence but not introduced would rather confirm that judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have misled Deputy Corish by a statement I made to him concerning the circumstances under which a worker ceases to be entitled to benefit, by making him think that the Bill was wider than in fact it is, and I may have misled Deputy Keyes by making him think it is narrower than in fact it is. When a worker comes into the building trade for the first time, he must have <Col N="1813" /> 12 contributions on his card before he becomes entitled to unemployment insurance.  If in any insurance year&mdash; defined in the Bill as from one October to the other&mdash;no contributions at all are paid in respect of a worker, then in the next following year he will not become entitled to benefit until 12 contributions have been paid.</P>
    <P>It follows therefore that a worker may have been out of employment for two years before he becomes disqualified. A person making a claim in September, 1942, would be entitled to receive benefit in September, 1942, if 12 contributions had been paid in respect of him since October, 1940.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty occurs in the second year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Then, of course, he again becomes entitled to benefit if 12 contributions have been paid.  It is not an unreasonable assumption that a person who is out of the building trade for so long has in fact ceased to be a building trade worker at all and must be regarded as a new entrant to the building trade.  From the point of view of an individual, it can be said that he is making contributions against which he will not be entitled to benefit.  But, of course, what the Bill does is to put the contributions of building trade workers in any week against benefits which have to be paid to workers in the building trade in that week.  In other words, it is not merely an individual insuring himself against intermittent unemployment, but all the workers in the trade are insuring all the workers in the trade against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to a man who built up a residue of stamps for himself which he had never drawn upon and had no opportunity of drawing upon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not merely a question of the value of the stamps. There is this difference between this scheme and the unemployment insurance <Col N="1814" /> scheme, that when he becomes qualified to benefit, that is, when he has fulfilled all the conditions and has 12 current stamps to his credit, he is entitled to get benefit against the period in which he loses employment. He does not exhaust his right to benefit if he is qualified in the same way as is the case under the unemployment insurance scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Once he qualifies for the payment he is entitled to get it; once the circumstances entitle him to it.  Deputy Keyes suggested that difficulties should be left to the local officer of the Department to settle on questions of fact, such as the state of the weather, so as to expedite payment. That is, in fact, what the Bill contemplates.  It may be that the Deputy will be able to suggest some method of making that clearer, but that is, in fact, what is contemplated and what Section 31 is designed to ensure.  If the Deputy will raise the matter again on the Committee Stage we will give special attention to the point, because I am in agreement with him as to the desirability of proceeding in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell is not going to lead me into the discussion of a number of hypothetical cases as to the classes of workers to whom the Bill may apply. I recognise that there will be a number of cases concerning which <i>bona fide</i> doubts will exist as to whether the workers concerned are within the scope of the Bill or not.  Section 10 provides the machinery for the determination of this question.  That section sets out that the Minister may decide or, alternatively, that the Minister may refer such question for decision to the High Court; and any person dissatisfied with the Minister's decision, assuming he chooses to decide himself, can appeal to the High court.  But I contemplate that, in the course of time, we will have a number of recorded decisions which will in fact operate to define with reasonable accuracy the classes of workers to whom the Bill applies and to whom it does not apply.  It is almost certain that in the first year of operation there will be a number of <Col N="1815" /> cases referred to the Minister or the High Court for decision under Section 10.  That section was put in because we knew we could not define precisely those to whom the Bill would apply and those to whom it should not apply.  We had to have that fairly elaborate machinery in order to enable those doubtful cases to be determined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the exclusion of certain classes of building workers from the Bill.  The Bill does contemplate that a person who is in regular permanent employment, who is not liable to loss of earnings because of interruption of employment through inclement weather, and who has been in that employment for a reasonable period of time may be excluded, as workers at present can be excluded from the payment of unemployment insurance contributions under similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there are certain classes of workers who are certified to be in permanent employment, and not liable to the risk of unemployment. After a number of years of such employment, those workers are excluded from the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Somewhat similar provisions are being followed here.  The Minister can give a certificate which declares that the persons to whom the certificate refers are in permanent employment, that they have been in such employment for a period of time, and that they are not liable to any loss of earnings because of interruption of work through inclement weather.  Those certificated workers are excluded from the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is only in respect of precisely the same type of worker that Section 11 operates.  That section relates to employees of the State, and provides that the Bill shall apply to employees of the State engaged in building operations, except they are in this type of permanent employment and not liable to unemployment or loss of earnings.  It is intended that a building trade worker engaged on any of the types of activity set out in Section 3, but employed in the circumstances contemplated in Section 5, can be excluded from the Bill, and in the same way employees of the State can be excluded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> It is probably true that there will be workers who will not be excluded, who will be more or less permanent in employment, and whose work will be of such a character that they are not liable to loss of wages because of inclement weather, and who will still have to make contributions.  That is recognised; just as it is recognised that there will be some classes of workers who will be claiming on the fund much more often than those, and whose contributions will probably be insufficient to meet the amount of their individual claims.  But one balances the other, and the workers' representatives and the employers' representatives agreed that the whole lot of them should make contributions, and that the whole lot of them should have equal rights to benefit.</P>
    <P>We did not discuss precisely those excepted persons such as Section 5 provides for; but I think it is not unreasonable that we should have some procedure by which we can exempt from the scope of the Bill those who are defined there; that is persons who, having regard to the normal practice of employers, can be classified as being in employment of a permanent character, where no deductions are made from their wages on account of time lost owing to inclement weather and whose other circumstances of employment are such as to render it unnecessary that those persons should be insured under the Bill. We did contemplate various classes of workers who can conform to those conditions. If they do conform to those conditions then, having been employed by such employer for three years or more, they can be excluded by a certificate from the Minister.  However, as the principle of the Bill has secured general acceptance, discussion at this stage is of no particular value.  It is obviously a Bill which requires careful examination in matters of detail, and the most important discussion upon the Bill therefore will take place in Committee.</P>

    <P>(a)  Corresponding figures for 1st January, 1942, are not yet available.</P>
    <P>(b)  The figures shown represent the number of officers serving in a substantive capacity in the grades on the first working day of the calendar year.</P>
    <P>(c)  The figures given for the grades of Principal and Assistant Principal are not strictly comparable from year to year for the reason that numbers of posts formerly designated by various other titles were subsequently re-named Principal and Assistant Principal posts in the course of Departmental recorganisations extending over a number of years.  Only those posts designated as Principal and Assistant Principal on the relevant dates have been included in the statement as after the lapse of years the identification of the several re-named posts is not practicable.</P>
    <P>(d)  Cadets serving in the Department of External Affairs who are on the same scale of pay as Junior Administrative Officers are included under this heading.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state in respect of each county health district the amount of rates paid in respect of agricultural land in each of the years ended 31st March, 1932, 1939, 1940, and 1941, and the total amount paid in each of these years.</P>

      <P>In county councils' accounts the rates collected are not segregated according to the type of rateable property in respect of which they are assessed.  The information which the Deputy asks for is not, therefore, available in the Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) the number of officials and employees, permanent and temporary, employed by local authorities in the years 1931, 1932, 1939, and 1941, and the amounts paid by local authorities in salaries, wages, allowances and expenses in the financial years 1931, 1932, 1939, and 1941, respectively.</P>

      <P>Particulars of officials and employees of local bodies, permanent and temporary, are not kept in my Department.  Returns of permanent staffs are obtained from local bodies from time to time.  The compilation of statistics in the form required by the Deputy would involve a detailed examination of records of local bodies, and the time and expense <Col N="1778" /> which would be involved would not be justified.  There is a summary of expenditure on salaries, wages, etc., by local authorities contained in the annual returns of local taxation which may be of service to the Deputy.  The returns for the three years first mentioned have been published.  The returns for the year 1941 will not be ready for publication for a very considerable time.</P>
