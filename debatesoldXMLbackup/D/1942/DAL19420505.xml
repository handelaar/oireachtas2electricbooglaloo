      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what progress, if any, has been made in the preparation of a satisfactory compensation measure for those serving in the A.R.P. services, and if rescue workers of the services are included, and to what extent are they covered; if he is aware of the discontent caused by the delay in the introduction of such proposals; whether he is further aware that no replies have been received to letters regarding the matter addressed to his Department; and, if so, if he will explain this failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of compensation for members of the A.R.P. services must necessarily be related, as the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, to the scheme of compensation for civilians who suffer personal injuries through bombing and kindred incidents.  A revision of the latter scheme, providing for an improved measure of compensation, has for some time been proceeding and it is anticipated that the revised scheme will be released at an early date.  On its completion a revision of the A.R.P. scheme, also providing for improved terms, will be set in train forthwith.  Rescue workers, in common with other A.R.P. workers, are covered by the original scheme and will be included in the revised one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, I am informed that some discontent <Col N="1470" /> has been caused by the delay in introducing a new compensation scheme for A.R.P. workers.  Acknowledgments have been issued to any letters addressed to the Department of Defence on the subject but no particulars of the proposed revision could be made available until work on the civilians' scheme had been completed. It is, of course, intended that the improved terms of compensation will be applied with retrospective effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies (1) if he has yet concluded the investigation into the method of the distribution of sugar referred to by him on November 12th, 1941; and, if so, if he is now prepared to permit deliveries to retailers on the basis of the ration allowance for each of their registered customers; (2) if it is proposed to make any special allowance of sugar for jam making this season, and (3) if no such general allowance is proposed, if he will make a supply available to those who, through the present unequal distribution, have been unable to secure their full ration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation has been completed. Existing arrangements are such as to ensure that every licensed sugar retailer should be in a position to supply each of his registered customers with the authorised sugar ration. I have, however, deferred a final decision as to whether the present system should be altered until the distribution of ration books has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the second and third parts of the Deputy's question, I am glad to be able to say that it has been <Col N="1471" /> found possible to make a small allowance of sugar available from about mid-June to any householder who possesses home-grown fruit for conversion into jam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the allocation of that small amount of sugar, will the Minister bear in mind the people who have not yet received their ordinary full ration of sugar and who, therefore, have been unable to accumulate any supplies for the purpose of jam-making?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the necessity of conserving existing stocks of rubber as far as possible for the manufacture of tyres for heavy transport, the amount of rubber which it has been possible to allocate for cycle tyres and tubes is comparatively small.  It is hoped, however, that this year and next year approximately 25 per cent. of a normal year's supply of tyres will be available and this will be distributed among cycle dealers in proportion to their 1940 turnover.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Great Southern Railways Company that fish for the Dublin market is not available for transport from Clifden before noon each day.  It is taken to Galway by railway lorry leaving Clifden at approximately 1.30 p.m. and is dispatched to Dublin by the passenger train from Galway at 11 a.m. the following morning.  Should the fish be available for transport by 8 a.m. the company would be prepared to arrange a road freight service to catch the 11 a.m. train on the same day, in which case fish could reach Dublin on the day of dispatch.</P>

      <P>Food vouchers are normally exchangeable for the appropriate quantity and kind of food within one week from the date of issue of the vouchers. In the exceptional circumstances of the past few weeks in regard to butter supplies, I am examining the possibility of arranging that holders of out-of-date butter food vouchers will be enabled to exchange those vouchers for butter when the supply position permits.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether applications are invited for the position of commissioner to administer the affairs of a local authority; and, if so, in what manner; whether the appointment of commissioners in these cases is made on the recommendation of a selection <Col N="1473" /> board; and, if so, whether he will say how the board is constituted and by whom; if the selection of persons to act as commissioners is not made by selection board, whether he will state what steps are taken to ascertain the fitness and suitability of the persons appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions 6 and 7 together. The reply to question 6 is in the negative. The selection of a person or per sons to act as commissioner or commissioners for a local authority rests entirely with the Minister.  The persons selected by him are chosen by reason of their capacity to discharge the duties of the local authority. There are no statutory conditions as to age or retiring age.  The commissioners for the Dublin Board of Assistance are rendering whole-time service.  The chairman, who is a civil servant, is being seconded while he is discharging the duties of commissioner. One of the other two members who holds an appointment under the Electricity Supply Board is also being similarly seconded.  As regards the period for which the commissioners have been appointed, I would refer the Deputy to Sections 45 to 48 of the Local Government Act, 1941.</P>

    <Title>Referendum Bill, 1941&mdash;From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad to the Referendum Bill, 1941.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8.  In sub-section (1), page 4, all words from and including the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 41 to and including the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in line 44 deleted and the words &ldquo;it shall be lawful for the Minister to&rdquo; substituted instead; and in line 46 the words &ldquo;such referendum&rdquo; deleted and the words &ldquo;the referendum on such proposal&rdquo; substituted instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion here on the Bill and also in the discussion in the Seanad, the point was made that Section 8 and Section 10 of the Bill, as originally drafted, contained a provision which might be held to be repugnant to the Constitution, in so far as it gave to the Government the power to determine whether or not a referendum on a proposal to amend the Constitution would be held or not.  Consideration was given to the arguments which were advanced both here and in the Seanad and as a result amendments Nos. 1 to 4 were brought forward in the Seanad and were accepted by that House.  Amendment No. 1, of course, is the principal amendment, the others being more or less consequential upon it.  If No. 1 is accepted, it merely <Col N="1475" /> means that it would be lawful for the Minister for Local Government, who is considered to be the appropriate Minister in the matter, to fix a date for the taking of a referendum and, accordingly, there will be no question of a determination by the Government as to whether a referendum should be taken or not.  Naturally, the Minister being a member of the Government, and having collective responsibility, would, no doubt, be guided by the advice of his colleagues in a matter of that sort.</P>

    <P>This amendment deals with a point which was raised in the Seanad, where it was pointed out that if the Dáil were dissolved and if a referendum were <Col N="1477" /> taken at the time, there would be no members of the Dáil existing at that date and, therefore, the provisions of the Bill in relation to the appointment of personation agents by members of the Dáil could not be given effect to.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, page 4, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) For the purposes of the selection by the Local Appointments Commissioners, in pursuance of sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the Principal Act as amended by this section, of a person to be recommended by them for appointment to the office of the first county manager for a county or for each of two grouped counties, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  no person shall be taken to be the county secretary of a county except the person (if any) who is the permanent county secretary of such county at the passing of this Act and is still such permanent county secretary at the time of such selection, save that the person (if any) who is the permanent county secretary of a county at the passing of this Act shall, for the purposes of such selection in relation to the office of the first county manager for that county or for each of two grouped counties of which that county is one, be deemed to be the county secretary of that county if, at the time of such selection (having then ceased to be such permanent county secretary), he holds an office under any body which is a local authority for the <Col N="1479" /> purposes of the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1941;</P>
    <P>(b)  no person shall be taken to be the secretary to the board of health of a county health district except the person (if any) who is the permanent secretary to such board at the passing of this Act and is still such permanent secretary at the time of such selection, save that the person (if any) who is the permanent secretary to the board of health for a county health district at the passing of this Act shall, for the purposes of such selection in relation to the office of the first county manager for the county in which such county health district is situate or for each of two grouped counties of which that county is one, be deemed to be the secretary to such board of health if, at the time of such selection (having then ceased to be such permanent secretary), he holds an office under any body which is a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Acts, 1925 to 1941.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to preserve in those counties in which the appointment of the first permanent manager is deferred the priorities for appointment which the Principal Act gives to the county secretary and the secretary of the board of health.  In view of the postponement of appointments of the first permanent managers in certain counties some of the county secretaries or secretaries of boards of health in these counties may possibly go forward for other counties and be selected and appointed.  In that event, as the Bill stands, these officers would lose their priority in their own county, and a new county secretary would get it.  The amendment will prevent that and will preserve the priority they have, so that they will be considered in the same order as if the permanent appointments in their own counties had not been postponed. When the time would come to reconstitute the county council, of which the officer concerned had been secretary at the date of the passage of this Bill, he might desire to exercise the right conferred <Col N="1480" /> on him by the Principal Act&mdash; that is to say, the right of being considered on the ground of suitability and of priority over other candidates&mdash; and this amendment seeks to preserve to him the right to apply for the post of county manager in what I might describe as his own county with exactly the same rights as under the Principal Act.</P>

      <P>(3) A commissioner who is or has been a member of a body which is a subsidiary body (within the meaning of Part IV of the Act of 1941) of the body for which such commissioner is the commissioner or one of the commissioners may, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 70 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), be appointed to and hold the office of the first or any other county manager or assistant county manager for a county or each of two grouped counties, or the office of Dublin Assistant City Manager.</P>

A county commissioner is usually appointed to represent the county council for which he is acting <Col N="1481" /> on joint bodies such as a joint committee of management of a mental hospital.  Such appointments have been made by the Minister under sealed order.  The commissioner thus becomes a member of a local authority and, as the law stands now, he could not hold the office of temporary county manager or assistant county manager of the county in which he is acting as commissioner. It is necessary, therefore, to remove the disqualification in Section 70 of the Act of 1925 so far as it affects the appointment temporarily of commissioners to the two classes of offices created by the County Management Act of 1940. The amendment is designed to secure that such disqualification will not happen in the case of those who are acting temporary county managers&mdash; that is, the disqualification from acting on the committees of management of mental hospitals and such institutions.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is intended to give legal sanction to measures already taken by county councils to provide seeds and fertilisers on loan terms for cultivators who are unable to provide them in the ordinary way out of their own resources.  The continuance of emergency conditions makes it desirable that a Bill of this sort should be in operation, and it is necessary to legalise the measures which have been taken already by local authorities to provide seeds and <Col N="1482" /> fertilisers.  Under the Bill, the county councils can exercise their powers in two ways: they can sell seed on loan terms, provided by Section 3 of the Bill, or they can give guarantees to seed merchants, under Section 5.  The Bill is in similar terms to the measures which were passed last year with the exception that this year there is an additional provision, contained in Section 6, respecting the partial recoupment by the Minister for Finance of losses, which have been unavoidably&mdash;if I might put it that way sustained by the county councils in the operation of the Bill.  The total amount to be provided by the Exchequer under this section is limited to £25,000 and is to be allocated in accordance with the terms set out in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Under Section 3 it would appear that the county council, having got a certain number of individuals to buy their seeds and fertilisers, may review the whole proceeding, and if it should transpire that the sales to these persons were at a cost below the inclusive cost to the county council of all the seeds or fertilisers, they are empowered to apply to each person who has purchased seeds or fertilisers for the extra sum involved. If I read that section correctly, it appears to me that that is the intention and, speaking as a person who has had some experience of business and who knows the objections that people have to the State or a local authority getting greater power than a person in business has, I would say that that is an objectionable intrusion. It is a retrospective charge, and if that is the intention, it seems to me to be a strange procedure.  There is no earthly reason why either the State or a local authority, in parting with goods, should not have the correct price marked on the goods they are marketing and ensure from the commencement that there will be no loss.  The Minister knows quite well that if one <Col N="1483" /> were to sell seeds to a person in February or March or even in October or November, and within 12 months were to send a further account to that person, it would give rise to very grave dissatisfaction.  I think that the section ought to be reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to enable sales to be made on credit.  The section provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever the council of a county has, during the period to which this Act applies, provided a supply of seeds and fertilisers or of seeds only or of fertilisers only for distribution in such county or in any particular portion thereof, it shall be lawful for such council to sell any of the seeds and fertilisers or seeds or fertilisers (as the case may be) so provided to any occupier or cultivator...</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the council of a county has, in the period to which this Act applies, provided and sold under this Act seeds and fertilisers or either of them, such council may ascertain the total amount of the costs and expenses (other than the price paid by such council for such seeds and fertilisers or seeds or fertilisers, as the case may be) incurred by such council in respect of the provision and all sales of such goods in that period and may apportion such amount amongst the several persons to whom such goods were so sold in the said period...</P>
      <P>The purpose, of course, as far as it can be secured, is to sell the seeds at what they cost the council.  This provision is drafted in this way to enable a person who, in the first instance, is not able to purchase seeds immediately or to pay cash for, to obtain them wherever they can be obtained in present circumstances, and then to have the expenses incurred in working the scheme allocated over everybody who has benefited under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The way that the ordinary man in the country looks upon this scheme is that he has to look for a so-called loan which he does not get.  If the seeds are supplied to him by a local merchant he has to get some local person to go security for him to ensure that they will be paid for.  I think that explains why the scheme is not being availed of to a larger extent.  In connection with these seeds and manures the purchaser has to get, as I have said, a local person to go security for him.  The local authority does nothing except to guarantee the seed merchant the cost of the seeds and manures.  The purchaser has to pay the ordinary price for the seeds and manures.  This provision of compelling the recipient of them to provide security for their payment acts as a great deterrent, and explains why so comparatively few people avail of this scheme.  I wonder if the Minister could do anything to improve that position.  After all, there are many people who want these seeds and manures, and in these times it may not be easy for them to get neighbours or others to go security for them.  The security is required in order to recoup the county council against loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill, which now comes annually before the House, the members of this Party have always availed of the opportunity <Col N="1485" /> which it presents of pointing out to the Government that in their opinion the scheme in operation is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the agricultural industry, or to deal with the type of credit that is required.  I want to avail myself of this opportunity again to point out to the Government that in this time of emergency this scheme is altogether inadequate to meet present requirements.  Farmers are expected to till 25 per cent. of their arable land.  That, as Deputies know, involves a very considerable amount of capital expenditure.  Very few of our people are in a position to-day to provide the capital involved in carrying out that amount of tillage.  The Minister must realise that the advances that are being made under this scheme are relatively small, and that the people who usually avail of them are the smaller type of farmer and cottier.</P>
      <P>We have always insisted that what is required is a scheme to cover a different type of man altogether.  I think that one of the reasons why this scheme is not being availed of to a larger extent is the amount of publicity involved.  That tends to keep back many people, who otherwise would do so, from making applications. It is hardly fair to throw on the local authority the responsibility for financing a scheme of this sort.  Undoubtedly, you have a number of people who are not prepared to have their cases submitted to the sort of public examination which is involved when an application under the scheme is sent in, because it means bringing a man's private affairs before 20, 30 or 40 members of the local authority.  It means that a man is making application for credit and that all his neighbours will know about it.  We know that our people are a proud people, and that many of them are not prepared to have it said among their neighbours that they are looking for credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is the proper way to operate a scheme of this kind. People do not like asking their neighbours to go security for them.  Some other method, I think, should be adopted of providing credit for farmers <Col N="1486" /> during this time of emergency&mdash; through the joint stock banks or some other source&mdash;to enable them to meet the very substantial capital outlay that is involved in carrying out the extra tillage operations.</P>
    <P>The Minister must appreciate that a man who has not been tilling to any extent has to provide the equipment and buy the necessary seeds and fertilisers, if there are any to be had.  If an examination is made into the capital commitments necessary to carry out the Compulsory Tillage Order the Minister will appreciate the necessity that arises in a great many cases for the provision of considerable credit. This type of Bill does not help that sort of person at all.  In fact, it is only a very small credit advance that is covered by a Bill of this sort. Coupled with that, as I said, you have the fact that many of our people, because they are proud people, are not prepared to have their private affairs submitted to examination by a public body.</P>
    <P>I think the principle of the Bill is all wrong.  If the Government are anxious to provide credit, it ought to be provided in a totally different way altogether.  Certainly it is unfair and unreasonable to expect a man to make an application and have his whole case submitted to public examination and his affairs discussed and talked about, particularly by his neighbours.  A great many people will try to raise the money privately before they will submit to that sort of thing.  That is the reason why the operation of this seed and fertiliser scheme has been a failure.  If the amount of help and assistance afforded by it is to be gauged by the amount of advances made by the different counties, you must come to the conclusion that the operation of the scheme has been an absolute failure, and while it is operated as at present it will continue to be a failure.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons, in my opinion, why we have had such tremendous difficulty in making the Compulsory Tillage Order a success as compared with Great Britain, Northern Ireland <Col N="1487" /> and other places, is that we have not given that attention to credit and other details which is necessary if its operation is to be a success.  This is merely an excuse.  It is not in fact making any attempt to provide the sort of credit that is essential at present.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider this whole matter. It is probably too late to do that this year.  But this emergency is likely to continue for a considerable period, and I think the Minister and the Government ought to consider a different type of provision altogether, some sort of provision which will be really useful and of which the people will be prepared to take advantage.  As I say, this simply covers very small sums. Again, I think it is unfair to throw the responsibility of providing credit facilities on the local authorities.  It is not really their job.  I would therefore appeal to the Minister to have this whole matter considered in the light of that consideration.  Very substantial sums by way of credit are essential if our campaign for increased food production is to be a success.  Certainly you can never make it a real success or provide sufficient credit on the lines of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this Bill is merely tinkering with a very big problem and that it is not the Minister for Local Government who should be introducing a measure of this kind. It is a matter which has to do with agricultural production and it should be the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to make all the necessary arrangements in regard to the financing of increased agricultural production. There are probably no bodies in this country with such slender financial resources at their disposal as the county councils.  From one end of the year to the other it is an intense struggle on their part to make ends meet or to make their accounts balance.  Their supreme consideration is to avoid having their liabilities increased or having to increase the burden of local taxation upon the ratepayers.  For that reason no local authority can accept a measure of this <Col N="1488" /> kind and the liabilities which it involves with enthusiasm.  The result is that when a county council is called upon to formulate a scheme the natural tendency is to limit the extent of the scheme as far as possible so as to avoid incurring heavy liabilities. In many counties the average amount of loan granted does not exceed £10. For the average farmer who engages in wheat growing £10 is of very little use.  It will only seed three or four acres.  For that reason the scheme is one of very limited value.  I understand that there is provision in this Bill for recouping the county councils to a very limited extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent.  That is not a very limited extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent of 50 per cent., but the amount for which the State will accept liability is very considerably limited.  I notice that in County Carlow the total amount of liability which the State will accept is £335 and in County Wicklow £507.  I do not think that a scheme limited to that extent can be of any far-reaching value.  In promoting increased tillage you have many things to consider besides seeds and fertilisers.  In many cases farmers require credit in order to procure the necessary equipment and for the provision of equipment a scheme of this kind would be absolutely useless.  If a scheme for the provision of the necessary equipment were to be visualised it would be a very far-reaching one and would not only have to provide long-term credit but also some security that the price of produce would remain stable and economic for a period exceeding the period of the emergency.  That would be a matter altogether outside the scope of the Local Government Department or the county councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or of this Bill.  I just want to mention that this Bill does not deal with the problem with which it purports to deal, because when we talk of credit for farmers we are immediately met with the answer that there is a seeds and fertilisers scheme <Col N="1489" /> which provides ample credit for farmers.  I want to assert that this measure does not provide anything like adequate or ample credit for the development of increased production. As Deputy Hughes pointed out, we also have the publicity involved in having applications dealt with by a local authority on which there are local representatives whom the average applicant might not wish to have investigating his financial affairs.  There is also the disadvantage of having to secure very substantial security.</P>
      <P>I do not think that that provision is altogether necessary.  I think that some alternative might be found, such as a recommendation by the local rate collector, who would be the person best qualified to judge the character and finances of the applicant.  The local rate collector is the person who would subsequently have to collect the repayments, and I think a recommendation from him would be the best way out of the difficulty, instead of having to drag in two or three of the applicant's neighbours.  The Bill does not meet the situation, and I think something more in keeping with the needs of the situation will have to be thought out immediately.  In the matter of credit, it might be well for the Minister to consider what is being done and has been done for the past 15 years by the Irish Sugar Company, which not only provides growers with seeds and manures, but also provides a loan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The sugar company, of course, has control over the marketing of the crop, and I believe that the average farmer would prefer to offer the same security as the beet growers offer in exchange for a similar advance. I think that, if some provision were made by which the farmer would guarantee to sell the crop to a certain appointed agent, in consideration for having secured an advance for his seeds and manures and to enable him to harvest the crop, it would be a much better solution of the problem, and would be more attractive to the average farmer than having to seek <Col N="1490" /> sureties from amongst his neighbours, and have all the publicity of having his case investigated by a locally elected body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the purpose of this Bill has been misunderstood both by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan.  It is not a Bill to provide agricultural credit in the broad general sense of that term.  If it were, it would not have been introduced by the Minister for Local Government.  This is an enabling Bill; it is a Bill which is designed to permit county councils to provide credit for people who might be described as purely and simply subsistence farmers, people who have a little patch of land, and who want to put in a crop to feed themselves in the first instance, and, if they have any surplus, which is perhaps unusual, to dispose of that surplus.</P>
      <P>The mere consideration of the fact that, in general, the seeds and fertilisers are provided for the purpose of growing food for the household rather than food for sale would show how impracticable is Deputy Cogan's suggestion that the farmer, the man who borrows £6, £10, or £15 as sometimes is the case under this legislation, should give the county council a lien on the crop, or that this would be a better way of securing the county councils and the local ratepayers against loss than the method which is proposed in the Bill.  As I said, to that extent Deputy Cogan has misunderstood the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the delicacy of farmers in a matter of this sort.  We have been told that the provisions of the Act are being nullified by reason of the fact that people do not want to disclose their position when they seek a loan.  Naturally, that is human and understandable, but are we going to make the position such that any man who wants a loan, which his neighbours as ratepayers have to guarantee to pay, can go and negotiate that transaction behind the backs of his neighbours?  What would happen if we did would be that any number of people who did not in fact require the assistance provided <Col N="1491" /> under this Bill would take advantage of it because they were freed from the obligation of getting the guarantee of substantial people that what was advanced to them would be repaid.  We would be simply giving public money out by a back door, and I think Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan will agree with me that that would be a very undesirable proceeding.  What is, in fact, required under most of those schemes?  First of all, as in Mayo, that the merchant who proposes to sell the seeds and fertilisers should be so assured of the good faith and honesty of his customer that he would be prepared to act as a surety for that man if he applies to the county council for a loan.  Is there anything unreasonable in that provision, which is designed to safeguard the community against fraudulent practice? We know that it would be quite possible for a person to buy £5 worth of seeds or £5 worth of fertilisers under this Bill, and then instead of using it on his own land to proceed to trade in it, selling it perhaps for a fraction of what he paid for it, putting the money in his pocket and then snapping his fingers at the county council.</P>
    <P>All that is asked in Mayo is that the merchant who engages in such a transaction with a person who has to have recourse to the county council in order to be able to finance it should be able to say: &ldquo;I think this man is credit-worthy to the extent of the value of the goods which I am prepared to sell him,&rdquo; and that the merchant as a surety should be backed up by another ratepayer, a friend of the person who is anxious to borrow the money.  I cannot see anything very vexatious or unduly exacting in a transaction of that sort.  I think we would be very foolish indeed if we put the county councils in such a position that they would be compelled to give those loans without asking for a surety, or without the members of the council themselves &ldquo;vetting&rdquo; the transaction and being responsible for it.  After all, if the county council incurs any losses, the members of the county council will naturally have to meet those losses at the ratepayers' expense.  It is just as <Col N="1492" /> well, therefore, that we should not put them in a position to say: &ldquo;If we had known that So-and-So was getting a loan under this Act we would have stopped it, because we knew that he would not use the money properly and that he would not repay it.&rdquo;  As matters stand at the moment, those applications come before the members of the local authorities, and any member present when they are under consideration can express his opinion as to whether the loans should be given or not.  I think it would be contrary to the ordinary dictates of prudence to adopt any other attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just about to come to that.  It has been said that this legislation has not met the position, and that in fact it has been signally unsuccessful.  The code, as you know, was in operation until 1933, then it fell into abeyance and was revived in 1939.  In 1939 the scheme was adopted in only 12 counties. The number of people who were recipients of loans then amounted to 2,624, and the total cost was £7,331.  In 1940 the scheme was adopted in 20 counties, at a total cost of £17,044, and the number of recipients of loans was 3,022.  In 1941 the scheme was adopted in 26 counties. The total cost was £55,503 and the number of recipients had jumped to 9,314.  The average cost per recipient in 1941 was about £6.  Those figures speak for themselves and, I think, will contradict the statements made by Deputies Hughes and Cogan.  Bearing in mind that this scheme is designed mainly to help the small man, the man who wants to provide seeds and fertilisers in order to grow food primarily for himself and his family&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In present circumstances the substantial farmer has the joint stock banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation to avail himself of, and, as the much-abused Banking Commission pointed out, so far as credit-worthy farmers are concerned, there are few countries where credit facilities are so adequate as they are here.  But, that is outside my function.  I am mainly concerned with this Bill, not as a measure to provide credit for agriculturists generally, but as a social measure to enable the small man, the small landholder and the cottier, to finance the growing of food for themselves and their families.</P>

They may not be able to get them.  I fully realise the necessity that exists for some security, but it is in order to simplify the situation that I suggest, where parish councils are working, it would be worth while considering an amendment of the legislation so as to give county councils authority to make loans of that description.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the £25,000 is a fairly substantial sum and it certainly ought to meet all unavoidable losses; but on this point of losses to the county council, there should not be many, because every smallholder that this scheme is intended for, and every owner of a labourer's cottage and plot, before he can get any seed, has to comply with certain regulations. The amount of seed he gets is confined to so many stone of wheat or oats or potatoes.  He cannot get very much and for whatever he does get he has to fill a form, a form which is almost as difficult as the income-tax form. Having filled the form he has to get two solvent ratepayers to act as guarantors, so that the county council will have adequate security.  That being so, there should not be what the Minister terms unavoidable losses.  I know that at least 15 per cent., if not 20 per cent., of the guarantors have had to pay and if the money is not paid in the ordinary way the amount is assessed upon the demand notes of the ratepayers who act as guarantors and it becomes part and parcel of their rates&mdash;the amount they owe to the county council.</P>
      <P>At the spring time of the year, when everybody is putting in crops&mdash; and this year and last year, in particular&mdash;it is very hard for any substantial ratepayer or farmer to refuse to go security for these people.  They say: &ldquo;There is my cottage plot; if I had so much seed I could do so-and-so. The whole object of the Government and the people at the moment is that everybody should try to grow their own food and produce wheat sufficient for the family.&rdquo;  The result was that it was almost impossible for a neighbouring farmer to refuse to sign a form for one of these people. He says that it is only a matter of form, but when the rate collector comes along with a demand note it is much more than a matter of form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be better for the Minister to set out some scheme by which a sum of £25,000 would be utilised to recoup the ratepayers who lost on that particular transaction.  The Minister <Col N="1497" /> may shake his head and say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but if he does not do it and leaves a lump sum of £25,000 in his own hands to apportion&mdash;as he said a moment ago&mdash;between the councils who lose, he will have some councils that will make a success of it and others which will make a total failure of it, and those who make the total failure will be paid by the Minister. I think that will lead to very grave abuses.  Before the Minister decides that any such sum is available, he should have the whole matter examined.  He should get reports from the secretaries of the county councils upon the actual working of the scheme and with particular reference to the method of repayment and see whether the repayment was made by the person who got the seeds or by the guarantor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I am in order or not in bringing in this matter on this discussion. The operation of the seeds and fertilisers scheme this year is difficult in some counties as a result of the fixing of the price of seeds.  In practice, the fixed price became the minimum retail price although it was intended to be the maximum wholesale price, with the result that when some people went to purchase seeds they could not get them as the local agents in those counties could not be expected to pay this price to the wholesale merchant and supply the local body and at the same time be put to all the expense of carriage and distribution themselves.  I know that this difficulty arose in my own county and that there was a lot of trouble in getting over it and I believe it arose in other counties as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I really cannot appreciate Deputy MacEoin's point of view.  I am told that, simply because people will not have the moral courage to refuse when a person comes to them asking to be guaranteed in regard to a loan&mdash;a person whom they feel they cannot safely guarantee&mdash;and when they give such a guarantee against their better judgment, the State should hand over to the county council enough money to reimburse the guarantor for his own loss, the loss which his own foolishness has involved him in.  We could not possibly carry on our everyday lives on that basis&mdash;that a man should solemnly guarantee that a person will meet his obligations and when his guarantee has been abused and the obligations have not been met, the guarantor should be allowed to walk out.  That would not be practicable at all.</P>
      <P>I do not see how we could possibly change the whole basis of the Bill, which is that the county councils are empowered to adopt schemes for making advances to people.  The general assumption is that the county council, when making the advance, will have an adequate assurance that the advance will be repaid.  It gives the advance, in the first instance, upon such credit as the borrower in the case may have.  We must bear in mind that the fact that the Bill is necessary indicates that the credit of the majority of these borrowers is far from good.  The next thing is that some councils ask the merchant who sells the seeds or fertilisers&mdash;and who will get his ordinary profit on the transaction&mdash;to share the risk with the county council and with another guarantor, a friend of the borrower, or a person who has sufficient confidence in the borrower.</P>
      <P>I think there are many people who, if they had to make good the guarantee in one or two cases of this sort, would think that the money was well spent, if they could then say: &ldquo;it is not a matter of form to give this guarantee as I have discovered to my cost.  It has cost me a couple of pounds in giving guarantees of this sort, and I know it is not a matter of form, and I am not prepared to lose on it again.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Maybe so, but even amongst neighbours there must be a certain amount of backbone.  That is apparently what Deputy MacEoin thinks we can find a reasonable substitute for at a cost of £25,000 to the State.  It would be very bad business and would destroy the whole basis upon which the rural community has to exist&mdash;the basis that people will try to meet their obligations.  I think I have covered, so far as I can, the point which the Deputy has made.  I do not see that it would be reasonable at all to ask the Government to give grants to the county councils to enable them to dispense with sureties in transactions of this sort.</P>

In that particular area the average valuation is under £5, as the Minister is probably aware from the records.  I cannot understand how any such figure was arrived at for that county taking into consideration some of the allocations made to other counties.  Having regard to the valuation that exists in the county I think the amount should be considerably increased, and as a matter of fact should be nearer the £700 mark.</P>

It seemed to me that the reasonable way was to divide it over the counties in proportion to the rural population.

      <P>The Minister should take note of a few things to which I wish to direct his attention before the Bill passes.  All over the country, mushroom building societies have been established and it has been brought to my notice within the past two or three months that, in cases where houses have been built and the Local Government Department has made the appropriate grant, months and months elapse before the member of the society gets credit for the grant. I know two cases in which the money was issued by the Local Government Department as far back as last October and in which it has not yet been brought to the credit of the members in question.  The building society in the country is of mushroom growth. It does not build the house at all.  A person becomes a member of the society and then proceeds to build a house.  The building society makes the application for the grant, but the house is built by the member of the society himself.  The society gets a grant of £80 and the member is entitled to from £72 to £75 of that sum.  To my own knowledge, some of these societies received the grant last October and have not yet given the member the <Col N="1504" /> benefit of it.  I think that the Minister should cause stricter supervision to be exercised over the activity of these societies, both rural and urban, but particularly rural.  They were organised when Fianna Fáil was in the heyday of its youth and a number of people were anxious to help the Government in their housing plan.  At the same time, they were anxious to get an honest penny in an easy way.</P>

      <P>This Bill relates only to permanent building societies, of which there are only a few in the country. The matter to which the Deputy refers is one, I think, for the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The societies affected by this Bill make advances to members on the security of house property.  As I understand, if a grant is provided by the Local Government Department, it is paid to the member and not to the society.  The type of organisation with which this Bill deals is different from that which the Deputy has in mind. There is only a limited number of these societies in existence.  They are really banking organisations which take money as an investment from members and lend it to other members on the security of house property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Theoretically, they are all supposed to do that.  They have all to make returns to the Minister's Department.  The societies to which I refer are limited liability companies and are covered by this Bill. They must hold a statutory meeting, present a balance sheet and make a return to the Minister's Department. They are, however, so loosely worked that it is months after a grant is made when it is credited to the member.  I do not say that they do not build at all but the amount of building they do is very light.  The member of the society does the building but the society gets the money&mdash;not the individual. The application is made by the building society and the pay order is issued to it.  Then, by agreement, the building society is supposed to pay over to the rural applicant the amount he has received, less a deduction for their costs.  Before the Bill passes, I should like the Minister to give an <Col N="1505" /> undertaking that there will be stricter supervision of these societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  When we passed the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, we made provision therein for the payment of subsidies to the company to be established under that Act for the operation of air transport services.  The Act provided that these subsidies should be paid for a period of only five years.  At that time, there was very little experience of the financial results of the operation of air transport services from this country, and it was not known whether or not the circumstances would permit of these services being placed on a paying basis which would avoid the necessity for any subsidy.  The general idea was that if, after five years, the situation had not developed to the point at which subsidies could be dispensed with, the Dáil should be again consulted on the question of the continuance of these subsidies.  That is what the introduction of this Bill involves.  Although air transport services have developed considerably&mdash;in fact, the existing services are unable to cater for the traffic offering&mdash;the difficulty of getting equipment to extend the services, and other problems arising out of the state of emergency, have made it impossible to contemplate dispensing with the payment of subsidies at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, consequently, proposed to amend the law so as to permit of the <Col N="1506" /> continued payment of subsidies.  It is not necessary to amend it in any other important respect.  The actual limit placed upon the amount that could be advanced by way of subsidy to the company by the Act of 1936 has never been reached.  That situation is largely due to the fact that war conditions have prevented the development contemplated in respect of transatlantic services and confined us to those at present operating to Great Britain. The total effect of the amendment contemplated by this Bill is to permit of the continued payment of subsidies to the Air Transport Company established by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law, it is necessary that a subsidy order should be laid before the Dáil and approved before coming into operation.  That procedure has involved considerable delay in the actual payment of the moneys and considerable inconvenience to the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Air Transport Company. It is proposed to amend that requirement so as to provide that subsidies can be paid when the order is made and that these orders will then be brought before the Dáil, which will have power to annul them, if it so desires.  These are the only two changes in the Principal Act which this Bill contemplates.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £30,207 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1943, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Vote on Account, Deputy O'Higgins drew attention to the fact that there was a big increase in the cost of the Office of the Minister for Justice as compared with the year 1927-28.  Of course, that is correct if he looks merely on the face of the Estimate, but there is a reason for it which I intend to go into.  The Deputy referred to the fact that the cost of the Civic Guards, which is practically the same in numbers, has increased by £500,000.  As far as the Office of the Minister for Justice is concerned, I think I can say that there has been a reduction, although there has been an increase in the cost of the Department, due to the amalgamation of other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very large proportion of its staff is engaged upon more or less routine work such as paying salaries and keeping accounts, particularly the pay of the Gárda Síochána.  This is essential <Col N="1509" /> work and the cost of doing it can be closely estimated and controlled.  It is not affected by the policy of the particular Government which happens to be in power at any particular time.  As far as the office is concerned, there is no reason why there should be any increase in cost.  In fact, I will be able to show there has been a reduction. For instance, under-sheriffs have been reduced from 26, in 1927-28, whose salaries amounted to about £10,000 a year, to seven, whose salaries amount to £2,900.  The work which was formerly done by the 19 under-sheriffs who have ceased to hold office is now done by the county registrars. In 1927-28 there was a separate office for the administration of the District Court, the estimated cost of which was £3,000.  That office has ceased to exist.  Its staffs and duties were absorbed by the Office of the Minister for Justice.  There was a Prisons Board in that year, the estimated cost of which was included in that year's Estimates, as part of the Prisons Vote, at £8,997, practically £9,000.  That board has disappeared also.  In these circumstances, it is clear that a correct view of the position can be obtained only by taking the Votes for the Office itself, for the Prisons Board, for the Circuit Court and for Under-Sheriffs all together, so that what I call &ldquo;the net result of trading&rdquo; may be seen.  If this is done the result shows a large reduction since 1927-28&mdash;something in the neighbourhood of £40,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>A saving of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is, joining them all together, that is what the saving amounts to.  I am sure Deputy O'Higgins did not realise that.  That is the explanation.  A considerable portion of this decrease is due to circumstances outside the control of the Department.  It might have happened the other way, without any blame to the Department, but as it happened, the cost decreased.  There has been a lot of new work added in the meantime, such as the censorship of publications and things of that kind.  As an indication of the spirit of economy <Col N="1510" /> that is displayed in the Department, I may say that in 1927-28 there was provision made for three principal clerks on the scale of £600-£800 per annum. Notwithstanding the increase since then in the work of the office and the taking over of numbers of subordinates who formerly worked in separate offices under their own chiefs, the office has now only one officer of that rank and he has been on loan to another Department since the beginning of the present emergency.  I do not think we could be accused of extravagance.</P>
      <P>As regards the Gárda Síochána, it is true, as Deputy O'Higgins said, that the Estimate now before the House exceeds the Estimate for 1927-28 by the large sum of £500,000.  It is only right that this fact should be remarked and explained.  The total strength of the Gárda Síochána on 1st April, 1928, was 7,176.  At the corresponding date in the present year, 1942, it was 7,168.  The latter figure includes all the members of the Taca Síochána, who were absorbed into the Gárda Síochána on that date.  It will be observed that the figures are almost identical.  There is, in fact, a decrease of eight.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the figures again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1928 the number was 7,176.  This year it is 7,168.  The main reason why the cost has gone up is that in the meantime the members of the force have been progressing steadily along a scale of salary which in the case of ordinary Gárdaí&mdash;the great majority of the force&mdash;began in 1922-23 at 50/- a week and has now reached the figure of 80/6 a week.  A very large number of Gárdaí are at their maximum now who were only beginning at that time.  That makes a tremendous difference in cost for the same number of men.  The full difference between starting point and the present point for 5,500 ordinary Gárdaí would be more than £400,000 a year.  The actual difference as between 1927-28 and 1942-43 is much less than that, for two reasons: first, the men were not at starting point; the majority had already reached the figure of £3 6s. or £3 8s. a week and, secondly, since then a large number of the men have dropped out and have been replaced <Col N="1511" /> by new recruits who started at the bottom of the scale.</P>
      <P>Even allowing for this, the actual difference as between 1927-28 and 1942-43 may be put in the neighbourhood of £200,000&mdash;an automatic increase which we cannot prevent.  Of course, we do not wish to prevent it; the men must get their increments. Secondly, in 1927-28 only about 1,200 of the force were married and entitled to rent allowance.  Now the figure is over 5,000.  The difference in cost for that item alone is over £100,000. Thirdly, this year's Estimate includes, at sub-heads O and P, sums amounting to £128,268 towards the maintenance of the L.S.F.  There was, of course, no such item in the 1927-28 Estimates.</P>
      <P>I may perhaps add here that the sum of £57,168, which is estimated at sub-head O, for clothing and equipment for the L.S.F., should be taken as conjectural.  The actual expenditure will depend on how much material we can get and its cost.  The estimate was based on a proposed issue to all active members of the force of the overall type of uniform in blue denim which has already been supplied to a number of members in the Dublin area. At present, however, it looks as if that cannot be done because the material is not available in sufficient quantities. Also, there is a complaint that the material, even if available, is not strong enough and that uniforms similar to those supplied to the L.D.F should be supplied to the L.S.F.  This would about double the cost but here, too, the question arises of whether the material is available, having regard to the needs of the Defence Forces.  I cannot say at present what the upshot will be.  I am very anxious to do anything I can to meet the wishes of the L.S.F. in the matter but I have to have regard to the kind and amount of material actually available.  Members of the force are asking for the better class uniform all over the country but it is a question of whether we can get it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer here to one other item of the Gárda Estimate, sub-head M, Compensation, amounting to £12,000.  The corresponding item in <Col N="1512" /> the 1927-28 Estimates was £200.  The increase is due to the fact that, by an Act passed last year, the State assumed liability for the payment of compensation to members of the force who are maliciously injured or to the dependents of those who die as a result of such injuries.  The compensation in such cases was until last year a charge on the local ratepayers and the cases in which compensation could be awarded at all were more restricted. The provision made in the present Estimate was exceptionally high because at the time when the Estimate was settled, there were several cases outstanding and awaiting decision in the High Court, in some of which it was certain that substantial compensation would be awarded.  I am glad to say that no crime giving rise to such a claim has occurred since August, 1940.  I hope that the Estimate of £12,000 provided for the present year will prove to be excessive, but so long as the necessity for making such provision exists at all, it is an item as regards which I am sure every Deputy would desire to be generous.</P>
    <P>In the course of the comments to which I have already referred, Deputy O'Higgins said he presumed that there was no more crime in the country than in 1927.  I am sorry to say that is not a fact.  Since the beginning of the war, there has been an increase both in the activities of unlawful organisations and in ordinary crime.  The increase in ordinary crime is particularly noticeable in the case of all kinds of theft&mdash;larceny, housebreaking and burglary&mdash;and is no doubt due mainly to the scarcity of certain commodities which used to be plentiful.  That is the only explanation I can get of the increase in this form of crime.  More commodities of all kinds are being stolen and by people, who, so far as the Guards are aware, were never in the habit of stealing before.  There has been an extraordinary increase in that form of crime.  It has almost doubled in Dublin since the war started and it is increasing in the country.  Coal and even such articles as wrapping paper are being stolen.  The Gárdaí are doing their best to cope with these criminal activities, but, instead of there being less Gárdaí, we would want <Col N="1513" /> more.  We shall have to get people to take far more care of their property. There has been undoubtedly an alarming, almost a baffling, increase in that type of petty crime.</P>
    <P>The increase in crime has naturally had some effect on the Vote for Prisons.  Deputies will observe that this year's Estimate has been based on an anticipated average of 615 prisoners a day as compared with the average of 525 which appeared in the previous year's Estimate.  The cost of food has also risen from £16 4s per head to practically £21 per head.  The combined result is an increase of £4,400 in sub-head B and there are also increases in sub-heads C and E due to the same considerations, viz., that more materials and supplies of all kinds have to be bought and that they all cost more.  The net Vote for Prisons is up by £7,000 as compared with last year's and down by £36,000 as compared with 1927-28.  As I have already explained, about one-fourth of the decrease since 1927-28 is due to the fact that my Office has taken over the duties of the Prisons Board.  The balance of the decrease is mainly due to reductions in the number of staff, effected by closing of local prisons. A good number of these prisons have been closed.  The estimated cost of staff in 1927-28 was £75,700; for 1942-43 it is £51,015.  Here again it has to be remembered that the pay of the staff remains on the basis of cost of living of 85.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimate has been prepared, however, it has become evident that the increase of 90 in prison population, which has been provided for, is an underestimate.  We had actually 700 persons in custody on 31st March, 85 more than the figure of 615 which appears on the face of the Estimate. The majority of the prisoners are serving sentences imposed by the ordinary courts, but the figure of 700 includes the following classes, viz.: Serving sentences consequent upon conviction by the military court or the Special Criminal Court&mdash;(a) penal servitude, 75; (b) imprisonment, 10; detained under internment orders, 19.  In addition, there were in military custody 449 <Col N="1514" /> persons detained under internment orders and 48 persons sentenced to imprisonment by the Special Criminal Court.  The cost of maintaining and safeguarding these 497 people does not appear on the Prisons Vote.</P>
    <P>At sub-head A (4) in Vote 32, Deputies will observe an item of £300 for legal and technical assistance.  This sum is an instalment of fees payable to counsel who is assisting the Supreme Court Rules Committee in the preparation of a complete new code of Supreme and High Court Rules.  The work has being going on for some years and has, I think, been about two-thirds completed.  The Rules Committees of the other courts have also been busy.  In the Circuit Court, a complete new code of rules under the Workmen's Compensation Act has been prepared and published and, in the course of the work, the committee observed and reported on certain points in the relevant Act which they thought might be considered with a view to improvements.  That, I think, is a matter which falls within the province of the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than in mine.  I should like to say that the preparation of these Workmen's Compensation Rules has been a very arduous piece of work and that great credit is due in that connection to the committee and in particular to its chairman, Judge Davitt, and to its secretary, Mr. Séamus O'Connor, the County Registrar for Dublin.  The committee is also engaged on the revision of the Circuit Court Rules generally, and I understand that they are considering in particular the complaint which has been made from time to time that costs tend to be too high in the Circuit Court. In the District Court also the committee is engaged on a revision of the rules.</P>
    <P>In the District Court Vote on page 157 of the Estimates Volume, Deputies will observe that provision has been made for one chief probation officer and five probation officers, all of whom are employed in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  In the year 1927-28, the corresponding provision was for two probation officers.  This is a considerable <Col N="1515" /> increase but, large as the increase is from the purely arithmetical point of view, it is in fact not nearly large enough in itself to meet the needs of the situation.  The system of putting offenders on probation, under supervision, is now used in Dublin to a much greater extent than it was formerly. The total number of persons on probation is round about 1,000, of whom about half are boys under 16. Even in favourable circumstances, a probation officer cannot be expected to exercise continuous and personal supervision over more than, at the most, 70 persons, and I think myself that in the actual circumstances in Dublin, a probation officer who would personally look after 50 persons would have his hands full.</P>
    <P>The obvious criticism of the Estimate is, therefore, not that it is extravagant, but that it is entirely inadequate and should be multiplied by about three.  I think that such a development should be avoided if possible, not only on the ground of expense, but because, from a broad point of view, it is thought that better results would obtain if a number of volunteers, working without financial reward in a spirit of charity, could be organised to assist the regular probation officers.  This scheme has been in our minds for a considerable time, but for one reason or another little or no practical progress was made.  A main difficulty was to get helpers, who were not only well fitted for the work and anxious to do it, but who were also willing to do it in a regular, systematic way, in close co-operation with the regular probation officers and subject to the control of the court.  That involves a considerable sacrifice of time and a readiness to accept directions, and to subordinate one's personal views so as to fit in with the general scheme. We have now succeeded in enlisting the services of a group of such persons. It is much too soon yet to judge the results.</P>
    <P>There are indeed persons of experience and goodwill who have no great hopes of it: they think that it will impose a strain on the voluntary <Col N="1516" /> workers which these workers will discover to be too great. That may, unfortunately, prove to be so, but I take the more optimistic view, and I should add that we would never have got as far as we have got without the assistance of His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Reverend Doctor McQuaid.  We owe him a debt of gratitude for the help he has given us in this matter, and not in this matter alone, but in every aspect of the problem of juvenile delinquency.  He has, for instance, been active in providing for evening classes for youths on probation. This scheme also is only just starting, and it is to be hoped it will be a success.  If I say no more on the subject of the assistance His Grace has given us it is not because I could not say a lot more, but because I know that His Grace does not want thanks or praise.</P>
    <P>We also propose to establish the Children's Court in Dublin in separate premises, away from the ordinary courts, with office accommodation for the probation officers.  If no set-back occurs, we hope to have this arrangement in being before the end of the summer.  The provision of new premises for the Borstal institution has also been under consideration for some time.  It has not been an easy question. It means either building new premises or finding existing premises which can be used for this purpose after suitable alterations.  The ideal solution would be a new building, but this would mean postponement, certainly until the end of the present emergency, and perhaps until long after it.  We are, therefore, at present going through a list of existing buildings which might be made available.  It has now been decided that the institution should be, if at all possible, in or near the City of Dublin, although this will unfortunately mean a break with the voluntary committee in Cork which has done very fine work indeed.</P>

      <P>The Minister very nicely moved his own Vote and then forgot all about it.  He never said a word more about it.  He told us the reason for the increase in the Civic Guards, and for this, that and the <Col N="1517" /> other, but surely he should tell us a little bit about what the situation in the country is, generally, from the point of view of observance of the law. He might, I think, take time to explain some of the rather peculiar prosecutions that have taken place throughout the country.  You can see certain things being bought and sold in the black market, and fortunes being made overnight.  However, I shall not enter into particulars with regard to these sales, because the Budget is coming to-morrow and it might only induce the Minister for Finance to take cognisance of what the people are prepared to pay for these things, but it is rather disturbing to see turf sellers, who, from time immemorial, have been engaged on a certain type of work, being prosecuted for carrying on their ordinary, legitimate trade.  As far back as the scenes described in <i>Knocknagow</i> turf was drawn to Clonmel a certain distance, and it is a well-known fact that for years past turf drawers have drawn turf from Kildare to Dublin.  Yet, because they followed their ordinary trade they have been prosecuted and put to a great deal of expense, while a certain amount of ignominy has been thrown upon them, as if they were highway robbers and thieves.  I think that that is a very bad state of affairs to allow.  The Minister and his Department may say that that is a very trivial matter, but I want to assure the Minister that the rights of the most insignificant of our citizens are more precious than those of the wealthy, because the wealthy are well able to look after themselves, while these people are not, and there should be more care exercised by the Minister for Justice on behalf of these people than on behalf of the wealthy people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that there was an increase in crime.  He told us that there was an increase even in ordinary crime, such as stealing things that were in short supply, and so on.  I presume that he refers mostly to the bicycle stealing which, apparently, has become a regular racket, not only in the city but down through the country. It has been brought to my notice that even bicycles that have been locked in a barn at night are not safe.  Of <Col N="1518" /> course, that is rather a serious matter, but there should be some method of registration of bicycles, in my opinion. Again, of course, when you speak of a matter like this, you have always to keep in mind the fact that the Minister for Finance might be thinking, like the Minister for Supplies, that to register anything means money, because at the present moment, as I may say in passing, when the Minister for Supplies wants to register a trader for some particular purpose there is always a rake-off, and the Budget, which should show what a citizen is likely to have to pay in the year, does not do so at all, because goodness knows what regulation may be made to-morrow under which he may have to register and pay a fee.  At any rate, there should be some method of local registration of bicycles whereby they could be identified and the thieves easily brought to justice.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that that increase in what might be called petty crime is developing, but there are other activities that the Minister barely mentioned.  He just mentioned one, and I think he should give the House an indication as to what the situation is in that regard.  There is a good deal of heart-searching by a large number of people in the country, people who are supporters of the Government and of the State, as to certain things that have happened.  I know of a case myself where a man was convicted of a certain offence and executed while, on the other hand, there were persons who boasted of what they had done, and there was not a word about them.  I think the Minister should give us some indication that he was satisfied that he had the matter well in hand.  He does not do so, however, but simply says that it is increasing, especially since the war; nor does he say whether he is doing anything about it.  It may be that he thinks that certain people in opposition are informed about the matter, but I think that is not fair to the country.  Of course, it is the Minister's responsibility, but if I were in his place I think I would inform the country and would not put a tooth in it.</P>
    <P>Now, on the question of the Gárda Síochána, I am not satisfied with the <Col N="1519" /> situation.  I have no reason to complain of the administrative activities of the Commissioner or the officers in charge of the Gárdaí, but somehow or other there is a feeling through the country that everything is not quite right.  For instance, you have what you might call sporadic changes and transfers of Gárdaí, for no reason whatever, apparently.  Now, at a time like this, when everybody&mdash;even, I am sure, the Minister himself, although he is Minister for Justice&mdash;has his back garden or little plot planted with something, nobody would like to be thrown out of it in the morning.  The Gárdaí are human like everybody else, and they have their gardens tilled and their turf cut in their spare time, or they have got people to do it for them, and yet, overnight, they get what is known as their &ldquo;route&rdquo; and have to leave for some other place.  They cannot transfer the stuff or bring it with them, and they have to try to sell it on the spot for whatever price they can get.  I think careful consideration should be given to every transfer of Gárdaí at the present moment, and that a Gárda should not be transferred simply for the sake of transferring him. If a transfer has to take place, it should only be for some disciplinary cause, and the Gárda concerned should get some indication as to what the indiscipline consisted of.</P>
    <P>To come back to some of the reasons given by the Minister for the increases in his Vote, part of it, as he told us, is explained by the abolition of the Vote for the Prisons Board and some others. Still the Estimate appears to be pretty high.  I am satisfied, however, with the Minister's explanation for the increased cost.  I am also satisfied with regard to the increased cost for the Gárdaí because, of course, we would have an extraordinary state of affairs if all the members of the force remained single.  I think the Minister is quite right to encourage marriage amongst them, even though it may cost more to the State.  I agree that he should not put any restrictions in their way, and that housing grants and allowances for married members of the force should be made available.  If a <Col N="1520" /> Gárda does not get married it should not be the fault of either the Government or the Department, but rather the man's own.  I think that marriage tends to steady men and helps to make them more capable.  Of course, if we go back to the question of transfers, there is more baggage to be removed in the case of a married man than of a single man.  I suggest that the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister, should see to it that transfers do not take place except over distances that are considered to be absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>As to the work done by the probation officers in the courts, I think it is of very great importance, and I want to pay tribute to His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin and to all the social workers who are assisting in that particular kind of activity.  It is social work of a kind that should be encouraged. Even though some officers in the Department may think that those people are not able to do the work with 100 per cent. efficiency because they cannot give their whole time to it, still I am of the opinion that their services should be availed of. The work of those voluntary probation officers should be well organised, and their services encouraged as much as possible.  Did I understand from the Minister that the Workmen's Compensation Act rules are now completed?</P>

      <P>The Minister does not seem to be too sure of that. That, also, is important.  I want to <Col N="1521" /> remind the Minister about certain things that his predecessor and himself promised, and to bear in mind what was said on that matter.  In my opinion the Circuit Court rules should be overhauled again because there is no doubt that, in some cases, the cost of litigation is altogether out of proportion to the issues involved.  In one or two cases that came under my notice recently, the issue involved was not more than a £5 note.  In a wild moment, a man may claim £25 damages in a suit, and, as often happens, the costs in the case may be more than £25, so that in order to have a suit decided on its merits in court a man has to come to a determination as to whether it is better for him to suffer his loss or go to court.  That, I think, is bad.  Of course, I would not like to see it made too easy for people to go to court, but, at the same time, if the necessity arises, the cost of bringing an action in court should not be made prohibitive or be the means, as happens in a number of cases, of reducing people to a state of bankruptcy. How to get over that I am not going to deal with at the moment, but I think the Minister should do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I referred to the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. Since then no great speeding-up seems to have taken place in the work of these Departments.  A person may be waiting a week or so for copy of a deed and when he rings up he is told that the order of priority for each case has to be observed.  The delays that occur are apparently due to lack of staff.  It is very important, where registered deeds or land registry deeds are required urgently, that there should be no great delay.  The Minister should either increase the staff in these Departments or adopt what is a common practice in the Civil Service, namely, second the staff from offices where there is not any great pressure of work.  On a previous occasion the Minister and his predecessor said that the law relating to charitable donations and bequests would be reconsidered.  I do not know if I would be in order in advocating a change of the law on this Vote, but <Col N="1522" /> I suggest to the Minister that he should acquaint himself with the many shortcomings that are to be found in that particular code, and see if its administration does not require some alteration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was sorry to hear the Minister state officially that crime was on the increase, particularly of the petty theft variety.  I think what the Minister said is true.  We have evidence of it in the case of bicycles, and of other articles that are getting scarce. The Minister mentioned coal and papers.  I think there are a good many other things he could have mentioned. At any rate, it is very necessary that public opinion should be strengthened in the matter of having the law obeyed. If this petty thieving were to extend in the country it would create a very serious situation.  Everybody must be made obey the law.  A great deal of what is happening now is due to the fact that so many commodities are getting scarce in the country, and that we have coming into existence what are known as racketeers and operators in the black market.  Until they are got hold of and brought to justice, it is going to be very hard to induce the less fortunately situated members of the community not to engage in petty thefts and things of that kind.  If one goes up to the Border, one hears the most extraordinary stories there of lorries not being prepared to go across the Border with a load unless there is a load to be brought back.  Once you get that sort of spirit abroad, once you get people at the top with money to spare not respecting the law, it is bound to go down through all the classes and all kinds of people.  In that respect I think that the enforcement of the law should be tightened up all round.  Probably the Minister and his Department would not have such difficulty in enforcing the law as regards minor thefts and things of that character if he would do something about the racketeers and the black market which everybody knows exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I should like to mention a very deserving class of the community who, I think, are deserving of consideration at the hands of the Minister and his Department, but because they form <Col N="1523" /> such a small class of the community and because their grievances only occur from time to time, these grievances are perhaps not suitably ventilated.  I refer to the country jurors who serve on criminal cases in the Circuit Courts and elsewhere.  Even when transport facilities were normal, these jurors had considerable difficulties to deal with in regard to getting home at night.  With transport facilities as they are at present, I am afraid that their difficulties have been increased one hundredfold. These jurors perform a very useful service in the enforcement of the law. They decide very difficult cases on issues of fact as to whether a prisoner is guilty or not, and I think they deserve consideration.  Where a criminal case continues at hearing until, say, 6 o'clock in the evening, I know that men who live perhaps 30 or 40 miles away are left stranded in a town. In many cases they cannot afford to put up for the night.  That is a very serious grievance which has never been properly ventilated because there are so few people involved and each person is only involved for an interval of time. I think it is a matter to which the State should give some consideration and that it comes properly within the Minister's Department.  First of all, there is the question of a subsistence allowance when they are kept out at night, and there is also the question of some sort of travelling facilities.  I have known of a man having to get up at 3 o'clock in the morning to go a great distance across country to get to the nearest train or bus in order to be in court at 11 o'clock.  If he is not there he is liable to a fine.  He has no excuse unless he can plead that he was ill.  In these hard times, particularly, I think something should be done about that by some form of executive order or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I should like to refer to, and I think it comes under the Minister's Vote, is the censorship of books and periodicals, and the composition of the Censorship Board.  I feel that the censorship is operated too strictly.  Some time ago I saw the names of the persons on the board published.  I am not acquainted personally <Col N="1524" /> with any of them.  I am certain they are all very estimable people who are doing the best they can.  But, after all, we are an intelligent community, and I think that the censorship is operated too strictly; that a great many books are excluded that could very well be included and used with very great benefit in this country. The nature of the personnel of the board might be extended a bit.  If I might use the expression, I think they are nearly all of the professorship variety, while the general public would, I think, like to have the class of literature they are entitled to read censored by some persons belonging to the general community and not entirely by persons who are graduates of universities.  After all, there are a great many very intelligent men with experience of life who have never been through a university.  Therefore, if there were on the board a person not quite so academically-minded as some of those at present upon it, it would, I think, be for the benefit generally of literature and knowledge in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I had to make a complaint with regard to the administration of the collection of the arrears of land annuities in County Wicklow. I had to complain of the conduct of a man who persisted in brow-beating and bullying country people, and afterwards embezzling the money collected from them.  That man was subsequently convicted.  Now I have another complaint to make in regard to the collection of land annuities in that county and the methods employed in this particular branch of the Minister's Department. When the recovery of arrears was taken out of the hands of the courts and entrusted to the sheriff without legal proceedings, we were told that this was for the purpose of saving money to the annuitants concerned.  So far as Wicklow is concerned, I find that there has been no saving whatever.  As the Minister knows, Wicklow is a fairly large county, and it has the added disadvantage that it is very mountainous and is not too well served with roads in many parts.  The result is that the distances to be travelled are very great. <Col N="1525" /> The special unit employed for the collection of arrears of land annuities are stationed in Bray, at what I might call the right-hand corner of the county. From Bray they travel to the southwest, a distance of 70 or 80 miles.  In many cases it would be much more than that, as they have to make journeys through the mountains, and the distance is added to in various ways. Some of the roads are not suitable for motor traffic in the winter time, and this also adds very much to the distance to be travelled.  I understand that the charge which the special unit may levy is 6d. per mile.  If you take a place which is 80 miles distant, the cost of travelling there and back is a very serious expense to have piled up on the person in arrears.  I have never heard of more than 35/- being charged against any defaulting annuitant, but even that was a very large sum to inflict upon a very small farmer for a matter of £7, especially when he was only six months in arrears.  I think that was an excessive charge to levy for mileage when you take into consideration that the expenses of the warrant and the sheriff's fees brought the total up to something like £3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that that system of collecting arrears is justified.  In the first place, there is no reason why this special unit should be stationed in the extreme corner of the county.  Again, there is no reason why there should be only one court messenger appointed for an entire county.  I think a few part-time officers, each dealing with a small district, could carry out the work much more cheaply and efficiently. Lastly, I do not think there is any reason why high-powered cars should be used for this purpose, involving a huge consumption of petrol, which is so scarce and expensive at present. Owing to the mountainous nature of the country, such a system of collection is not suitable in any sense of the word.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should dispense with this method, and appoint spare-time court messengers in each district, just in the same way as we have rate collectors dealing with each district, and giving satisfaction.  There are added reasons why this system would be more satisfactory. <Col N="1526" /> In the first place the official would be known to the people, and would be less likely to embezzle their money or to commit any offences of that nature.  I think the whole system of sending a stranger to those country people to collect money from them was bound to lead to the misappropriation of the money and to the various unsatisfactory elements of the situation which arose last year.  I make this suggestion in all sincerity to the Minister. I think it would greatly reduce the expenses of collection, and would save those small farmers from heavy imposts.</P>
    <P>I have also to bring to the Minister's attention a complaint in regard to the operations of this special unit.  I must say that it was not during the administration of the present official, but I think it is a case to which the Minister's attention should be directed.  It was a case in which a special unit drove their car at high speed into a farmer's yard, with the result that the farmer's wife, who happened to be in delicate health, received a severe shock, became an invalid afterwards and suffered the loss of her child.  I think that was a matter which no Government Department could stand over, and it caused very great resentment in the district where it occurred. Only last week I had a report of another case of what I would call a violation of the law or, at least, an ignoring of the present emergency situation by the special unit.  Having made their seizure in a tillage district the unit brought their car to a shop in Glenealy and loaded it up with flour and other commodities which were exceptionally scarce in the village. The people were finding it very hard to get their weekly supplies, and resented the taking away from their little village of some of the meagre quantities that were available.  I think if this force is to be stationed in the big town of Bray it should be the duty of the town to supply them with their ordinary requirements; they should not have to make raids on smaller towns where supplies are so scarce.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I also drew the Minister's <Col N="1527" /> attention to the case of the seizure of horses engaged in farm work in the County Dublin.  The Minister, in reply to the question, stated that he had no power to intervene, and that even if he had he would not intervene in that particular case.  I do not think that is the proper attitude for the Minister for Justice to take up.  The country at the present time is crying out for food and there are no means of producing food except by ploughing the land.  It is altogether unwise, unsound and unreasonable, even though the person may be in default, to seize horses which are engaged in the work of producing essential food. I also had brought to my notice the case of a farmer who was not in default in respect of annuities or anything else, but who had taken land by conacre in County Wicklow, and had a tractor engaged there, which he left on the land at night.  Fortunately for himself, he received information that if was about to be seized, and by going there at night and removing the tractor he managed to save it.  I think there should be a definite regulation that horses, tractors or farm implements engaged in the cultivation of land should be immune from seizure.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that crime is on the increase.  I think most country Deputies will bear out that statement.  Quite a considerable number of farmers have suffered very great loss as a result of the stealing of poultry, and in many cases other property as well, but mainly poultry. I think, as far as that is concerned, there should be a definite regulation that those engaged in the purchase of poultry should keep some kind of record of the persons with whom they do business.  I think that might afford protection to the farmers to some extent.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to repeat a complaint which I made last year with regard to the housing of the Gárdaí.  I think that the State, which is paying out a considerable amount of money to its servants, should not allow that money to be short-circuited into the pockets of profiteers who happen to own house property.  I think the Guards are entitled <Col N="1528" /> to houses at reasonable rents.  If such houses are not available it is the duty of the Minister's Department to erect new houses and let them to the Guards at reasonable rents.  As I pointed out last year, that would be much more satisfactory than the present system by which Guards have to seek houses from private landlords, because, in the first place, it would ensure that the houses would be of a good type, and, secondly, that they would be convenient to the local station.  I think this is a matter which the Minister should take up with the other Departments, if necessary, in order to see that proper houses are provided.  Although supplies of certain building materials may be very short at the present time, there is no reason to doubt that such shortages might be overcome by the substitution of native materials.</P>

      <P>I want to make that point clear.  I take it for granted that, as there is no provision made, the Minister is under the impression that he has done whatever he considered it his duty to do in that particular matter.  It might be well to make that clear; it may help to remove any unrest there still may be in certain quarters.  Leaving aside the Taca Síochána, the Minister intends to <Col N="1529" /> recruit, roughly, 100 members for the Gárda Síochána.  I understand that there will be a rather severe test for candidates and every effort will be made to select men on the grounds of merit.  It might be helpful if the Minister will state what steps are to be taken to secure that very desirable object.  I want to give him an opportunity of stating that, because I think that also would be helpful.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to an increase in petty crime, especially in relation to objects that have become scarce.  I heard to-day that already there is thieving of discs from motor cars.  I think that is getting rather quick off the mark on the part of a number of enterprising people in the City of Dublin.  I cannot say that the object there has become scarce, because it is barely in existence, but at all events the cause of it, namely, petrol, has become scarce.  I do not know whether the thievery I have referred to could be regarded as slackness of duty on the part of the Guards, or, what is more serious, as an increase of crime on the part of elements of the population.  It may be the latter, but I should like the Minister's opinion on that matter.</P>
      <P>I really want clarification on a few points in the Estimates.  If we turn to the Estimates relating to prisons&mdash;I think attention was called to this elsewhere, but possibly the Minister was not present&mdash;and if we look at the headings: B&mdash;Victualling; C&mdash;Clothing, Bedding, Furniture; and E&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water, Cleaning Articles, we will find that an interesting comparison can be made with other years.  In the year 1938-39 victualling cost, per head, £10 19s. 0d., and in the Estimate for 1942-43 the amount is practically double&mdash;£20 19s. 6d.</P>

      <P>There may be some improvement so as to improve the health of the prisoners, but otherwise am I to understand there is no change so far as the fundamentals are concerned?  This represents the bare living cost in order to keep the men healthy and to keep them from being too uncomfortable?

      <P>From the Minister's answers, I draw the conclusion that the cost-of-living figure has gone up tremendously.  I merely wanted his confirmation for what we suspect.  I wanted certain points clarified, because I understand there will be a Budget statement to-morrow.  The only thing I shall ask the Minister to do, seeing that he has now clarified the position most satisfactorily for me, is to take an opportunity of indicating the measures which will be introduced to secure that only the best men will be selected to fill the 100 vacancies in the Guards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be advisable for the Minister's Department to consider the question of rearranging Circuit Court sittings all over the country.  Owing to the scarcity of petrol and the fact that no private cars will be allowed on the roads, it will be very difficult for litigants, in some instances, to get to the Circuit Courts. I was thinking that, with the consent of the judiciary, it might be possible so to arrange Circuit Court sittings as to minimise the hardships that must inevitably be imposed on many members of the general public, including members of the legal profession. There are counties where only one Circuit Court is held.  In those counties people would have to travel 20, 30 and perhaps 40 miles in order to attend the court, and the bus and train facilities at the moment are limited. The present cost of travelling is 1/6 a mile, and 30 miles each way would cost £4 10s.  In those circumstances, I think, it would be well if the Circuit Court sittings were rearranged, with the time and venue altered to suit the convenience of litigants.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether any arrangement has been made to include State solicitors and coroners in the essential service category.  I think those people are engaged in very essential State work.  They have to travel all over their counties from time to time in connection with State business and I think a petrol allowance should be given them to enable them to carry out their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> As regards the 100 men who will be recruited for the Guards, I should like to know what the standard of the examination will be.  My reason for asking that is that, in my opinion, if the standard is too difficult, it will rule out the poor man's son, the son of a man who would not have the means, or may not have had the means, to send in his sons for secondary education. The standard should not be any more difficult than seventh class at a national school.</P>
    <P>I would like to inquire as to the position which the Irish language is being given in this examination.  The time has come when we should be a little more exacting in our demands from the people regarding it.  I have said already that I would not like to see the standard of this examination too high, for fear it may rule out the poor man's son.  At the same time, everybody nowadays should be in a position to pass a fairly stiff examination in the Irish language.  Therefore, I hope the Irish language will play an important part in this examination, and in every succeeding one, for the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether there is any provision for the recruitment of Guards from the Gaeltacht.  Vacancies occur in the Gaeltacht from time to time, and it would not be right or fair or helpful to the Irish language if people from the Galltacht were brought to deal with the duties of the Gárda Síochána in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, it is very much to be regretted that there is an increase in crime of all sorts in the country, particularly in petty thefts.  I agree with the Minister that this means the Gárdaí will have to exercise much more vigilance in the future and that our people will have to be advised to take greater care of their property.  This is a natural corollary to the situation existing at the present time, where many essential articles are in short supply.  The Minister laid particular stress on bicycles. I agree that these thefts are occurring in every county.  There is something to be said for the suggestion made by Deputy MacEoin that there should be <Col N="1533" /> some form of registration.  It is unfortunate that very few people take the numbers of their bicycles, and I suppose the only proper way to do that would be by registration.  Then the number would be available and the bicycle could be traced.  The people might be advised, but I am doubtful if they will act on that advice, or take the precaution, until it is too late and the cycle has disappeared.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy MacEoin that the cost of litigation is altogether too high and in abnormal proportion, sometimes, to the amount involved. While that has been stressed here for a number of years, the Minister does not appear to have done anything about it.  In the case of costs of collecting arrears of annuities, it is a very serious matter.  Deputies who have been brought into contact with this matter, where adjustments have been made to spread out the payments, know that people who are in arrears find the great problem is that of costs, as they are out of all proportion to the amount in arrears.</P>
      <P>There does not appear to be any attempt by the sheriffs or county registrars to reduce these costs to a minimum.  Court messengers are sent out periodically; they simply call on a man and report back as to whether there are goods or not.  They take small amounts of money, but these are accompanied by charges for the court messengers' visits, and there is also the cost of the warrant and the sheriff's expenses.  One finds very often that the costs amount to 20 or 25 per cent. of the sum involved. Where there are arrears of annuities &mdash;particularly at the present time&mdash; there is usually some very good reason for the arrears.  Very often the economic position of the farm is bad, the type of land is poor, the fertility is low and the family is in struggling and difficult circumstances. It is really for want of money that they fail to meet their liabilities in this respect.  In such a situation, these very severe costs are piled up on relatively small sums.  I would ask the Minister to have this whole matter examined, with a view to reducing these costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Deputy Cogan mentioned a case of embezzlement in County Wicklow.  I think that is not an isolated case, by any means.  I do not wish to stultify the argument I have just made, by advocating an increase in the salaries of certain clerks in county registrars' offices, but I understand that these men are very badly paid.  They are handling considerable sums of money, particularly for the Land Commission.  Some of them, who are married and have families, are trying to exist on a small salary, and it is a very serious temptation. It is unfortunate that some of them have yielded to the temptation. I think that is because of the fact that they are underpaid.  It is notorious that these men in county registrars' offices are very badly paid.  I understand that the amount of income into these offices, from fees accruing from the collection of annuities, is very considerable and probably more than sufficient to pay the cost of the office.  One cannot understand why men in fairly responsible positions, handling these considerable sums of money, are not paid decent and proper salaries.</P>
    <P>If the income is sufficient to pay the cost of administration of the office, there is room for a revision of the costs, particularly on the collection of annuities, and if the sums accruing from the collection of annuities are considerable the whole question of fees should be reviewed.   In many cases of which I have had experience this has entailed very severe hardship on small farmers, living on poor land with big families, where the cost of collection is out of all proportion to the amount due.  The county registrars do not seem to worry as to the number of visits a court messenger pays to a particular individual. He is simply sent out automatically to make periodical visits, and reports back that he cannot collect any money, or that there are &ldquo;no goods&rdquo;.  Any person handling warrants issued by the Land Commission, who examines the items from the county registrar's offices, must be amazed at the percentage of costs piled on to unfortunate people who are not in a position to meet such charges.  This is a hardy annual, but nothing has been done about the matter.  I should like if the <Col N="1535" /> Minister would give the House a promise to have it examined with a view to a reduction of the charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some things have been said on this Vote that impel me to intervene.  Deputy Hughes and Deputy Coburn gave some examples of the cost of collection of land annuities. I take it that their references apply to small farms, and to the economic conditions obtaining there, leading to arrears of annuities.  I should like to think that that is the position.  If Deputy Cogan is serious, as a representative of farmers, I ask him to do his best to urge that there should be a revision of the system of collection. Before the 1933 Act was passed it was patent to anybody who knew anything about the legal or the business side of these charges that the system that was then introduced would impose a burden on farmers who might be unable to make these payments.  I could give what I believe are some startling figures, but they would not be exactly accurate.  Perhaps the Minister would give figures dealing with the cost of collection.  Really there is no other name for the present system but a racket.  The Minister might take four or five typical counties, and tell the House what the cost of collecting land annuities amounted to. The former system was a simple one, but this House, after the usual display by banners and bands, set that system aside.  The State now collects the annuities.  Previously, if farmers owed annuities and could not pay at once they could call on solicitors and tell them that they had cattle for sale and ask that proceedings should not be taken until the cattle were disposed of.  That was generally done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens now?  The Land Commission sends a certificate to the county registrar, or to the sheriffs, where there are sheriffs, and then the racket starts.  The Fianna Fáil Government, in order to save the farmers, laid down a scale of fees under the 1933 Land Act.  My information with regard to the charges imposed on farmers who are unfortunate enough to owe annuities is somewhat startling when a comparison is made with the <Col N="1536" /> amount charged under the former system.  I suggest that the present system of the collection of land annuities should be reviewed over a period of ten years, because some Deputies are satisfied that the farmers concerned have been absolutely skinned.  The Minister should introduce some new machinery to deal with the collection of these debts.  Having examined the position in, say, half a dozen counties, I think he will agree with me when I say that the figures and facts will disclose a really disgraceful position.</P>
    <P>Considerable emphasis has been laid on the growth of petty crime.  That is a disturbing situation, but I am very much more concerned about graver crime.  We have all been greatly perturbed at the manner in which law-abiding citizens have been treated by this Government in relation to the possession of ordinary arms and sporting guns for use about farms, and with the licence given to some people to get and to keep arms that could be used for illegal purposes.  A case occurred in the city in the last few months which was certainly startling.  I remember about the time that the Blue Shirts were in existence, a Civic Guard arrived at my hall door one Sunday evening and demanded a little toy pistol, with a dummy barrel, that I had for training a couple of young dogs.  I was rather nettled when I heard what he wanted.  I told him he was not going to get it then but to call some day other than Sunday.  I had occasion to leave home the following day and nobody but a maid was in the house when two officers, in civilian dress, called for this dangerous weapon.  They called on the following day again. That is by the way now.  The weapon was useless, but there was all this furore, and officers calling to my house, while I never committed an illegal act in my life.  I saw that in the last few months a case occurred in which, unfortunately, tragedy followed, where an irresponsible man had a revolver and ammunition, apparently without any licence.  That struck me as a shocking state of affairs.  I should like to know what the principle behind it is.  If I had sufficient sense of citizenship to walk to Donnybrook barrack and take <Col N="1537" /> out a licence for a toy pistol in order to conform to the law, I cannot understand why a young man, who was able to walk about the streets of Dublin, and who took out a respectable man's daughter and shot her dead, afterwards shooting himself, should be entitled to have arms and ammunition without a licence.  It is common property that there are lethal weapons held by people who should not have them.  These people are a menace to law-abiding citizens.  I should like to hear from the Minister&mdash;he is the one man in this Government to whose word I pay some attention&mdash;that the gloves are coming off in this matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the petty offences which have been referred to, neither the Department nor the Gárda can do anything to prevent the stealing of bicycles unless people take the simple precaution, when they buy a bicycle, new or secondhand, of entering up the number of it so that, if it disappears later, they can give the number to the Guards.  There are probably over 1,000 stolen bicycles in Dublin Castle and nobody knows to whom they belong.  There has been talk about the cost of litigation.  Nobody is obliged to go to law.  Contrasts are made between the cost of litigation and the value of the rights of property involved. The water of a stream which is supplying a man's land is of very little value, but the benefit of that water to the farm, over a long number of years, would be worth a very considerable sum.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the new system of petrol distribution and the licensing of motor cars, I should like to know if the Minister has done anything to get petrol for coroners, who may be either doctors or laymen.  In a county like my own, it is almost impossible for a coroner to hold inquests without a motor car.  The same applies to County Galway, County Kerry and County Cork.  Unless stern arguments are put up to the Department of Supplies by the Minister, a serious position will be brought about regarding the holding of inquests.  It is all right to take the bull by the horns in connection with petrol economy, but the Department of Justice will have to <Col N="1538" /> take some practical step to secure that coroners will be able to travel by motor car.  A doctor or a solicitor who is coroner cannot afford to spend two or three days travelling to an inquest which may occupy only half an hour. As regards this question of petty theft, I should like to know if it is, in the main, confined to juveniles or if it is also prevalent in the case of adults. I should like to know, too, if it consists mainly in the larceny of bicycles.  If it did, it would not alarm me, because people will take care of their bicycles when they realise that they are valuable.  They will not throw their bicycle beside a door so that somebody will ride off on it when they realise that it is as valuable as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there has been some talk about the cost of litigation in the course of this debate.  I have heard only the few remarks made by Deputy McMenamin which were, as usual, very commonsense and to the point.  I imagine that there is no subject on which a greater degree of nonsense is talked than the cost of litigation.  To the public, the cost of litigation is confined to the cost of the services of the legal gentlemen involved in it.  If the matter is properly analysed and sifted, it will be found that the costs incurred in these cases&mdash;in the country, in particular&mdash; consist largely of witnesses' expenses and the cost of retaining professional witnesses such as engineers.  Compared with the total cost, the cost of the legal people involved is very small. As the Minister probably knows, the question of cost is being revised by the rule-making authority.  One of the matters the legal profession, generally, is most alive to is the necessity for keeping down the cost of litigation. The more litigation, the more money they will make and the greater the cost of litigation, the less litigation there will be and the less money the legal people will make.  It is only right that any sort of loose talk which may have been indulged in this debate regarding the cost of litigation should not give the public the impression that these costs are incurred by lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be remembered that the <Col N="1539" /> people of the country who litigate water rights or the right to discharge water on to another person's land or rights of way, regard these matters as of vital importance.  It is not merely to them a matter of 1/- damages or £50 costs; it is a matter which involves perhaps the entire value of their land and which may involve, to a large extent, their local prestige.  They think it well worth while to litigate these matters at considerable expense. I was engaged recently in a case in Cork in the High Court on circuit, and one of the witnesses put this matter very accurately and very concisely. When he found that his water right was being interfered with by his neighbour, he said: &ldquo;If you do not immediately stop that gully, it will cost you a couple of cows.&rdquo;  They have a very keen appreciation in the country of the cost of litigation and, in representing the cost as that of the price of a couple of cows, this man was putting the case very neatly.  They would consider the money well spent in cases of that kind.  I think that the Minister ought to put an end to this ridiculous talk about the cost of litigation.</P>
    <P>That there is undue expense in connection with litigation is undoubted. That the legal people involved are, by the machinery of the Rule-Making Committee, endeavouring, so far as they can, to meet that situation also ought to be known.  Those people who practise in the city here and in the country know perfectly well that the real cost of litigation arises in witnesses' expenses.  The expense of bringing a troop of witnesses from Skibbereen to Cork City and keeping them there for four or five days is pretty staggering, having regard to the amount involved, but when ordinary people talk of the cost of litigation, they mean what goes into the hands of the lawyers.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters that I wish to refer to very shortly on this Vote.  The Minister and Deputies will have noticed, as the public have noticed, in the course of the last year, considerable discussion in our criminal courts as to the manner in which Guards have taken statements from accused people.  We all know and <Col N="1540" /> appreciate the difficulties the Guards have in investigating crime.  We appreciate that, to a considerable extent, at all events, they are endeavouring to be fair to people who are charged or suspected of committing crime, but, perhaps, from over-zeal, perhaps, in some instances, from a desire to secure conviction at all costs, even of an innocent person, there are often cases where statements have been improperly extracted from accused persons.  I do not wish for one moment to suggest that this practice is either widespread in the Gárda or deliberately adopted by particular Guards for the purpose of securing their own advancement in the force or for the purpose of securing a conviction at all costs in order to bring themselves to the notice of the authorities.  I only mention this, in passing, for the purpose of emphasising to the Minister that it is better that some persons, even if they are guilty, should be acquitted by a jury and that the proper and due administration of the criminal law, as we know it, should be maintained, even in existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is very bad example to the public to have these matters discussed in court and to find that statement after statement in certain cases have been excluded from the consideration of the jury by reason of the manner in which these statements have been taken.  It tends to bring the administration of justice into disrepute and tends also to allow people, who perhaps were not entitled, to go scot-free from the charges that were preferred against them.  I think the Minister ought to take particular care to see that the Guards are properly instructed as to the circumstances in which statements may be taken from accused persons and particularly as to the manner in which those statements should be taken.  I think it will tend to the proper prosecution of crime, to the securing of convictions in cases where they ought to be secured and to greater respect for the criminal law if particular care is taken to see that convictions are not secured by reason of zeal, or for any motive, in ways that the law does not countenance.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to my hardy annual on the discussion of this <Col N="1541" /> Estimate.  I have been for years directing the attention of various Ministers for Justice to the practice obtaining in connection with the investigation of motor collision cases.  Perhaps it is futile for me to talk about them now in view of the possible disappearance of this lucrative source of revenue for the members of my profession. At all events, let us hope there will be still some cases drifting into court and let us hope that the war will be over very shortly and that we will have our motor cars again on the road.  However, I suppose in the ordinary course of modern traffic, accidents will happen even on the disappearance of the motor cars.  We had the unusual spectacle last Sunday of a horse running away on its way to Portmarnock Golf Club.  In some form or another there will be collisions or accidents to be investigated by the Guards.  It is the ordinary practice, as the Minister knows and as Deputies probably know, for the Guards to come and investigate the accident, take measurements and take statements from the persons involved and from witnesses.  The origin of that practice, of course, was with a view to considering whether or not criminal proceedings would be taken against one or other or both of the parties involved in the accident and, therefore, so far as that object was the primary purpose of the investigation by the Guards, neither of the parties would be entitled to get copies of the statements that were made by their opponents or by independent witnesses.</P>
    <P>A development of that practice has taken place by reason of the very great increase in the number of motor-car cases in the civil courts and in ordinary cases one of the usual witnesses and one of the essential witnesses in a collision case is the Guard who investigated it.  Very frequently, if not always, the result of the case depends upon his powers of observation, the accuracy of his observation, his recollection and the fairness with which he gives his evidence in court.  It has been the rule, not merely of the present Minister for Justice, but of his predecessors and generally of the <Col N="1542" /> Department, for a number of years, not to give either party to civil proceedings any sight or view of the various statements made by the parties to the collision or by the independent witnesses immediately after the occurrence.  I can understand that if there were criminal proceedings pending, but I cannot understand it where, (1) criminal proceedings are not being prosecuted by the Guards after consideration by the authorities and, (2) where the criminal proceedings have come to an end, because the Guards are always subpoenaed to court and bring these statements with them and, invariably, the judge directs them to produce the statements and they can be made evidence, sometimes in evidence in chief or more frequently on cross-examination if a witness gives a different account of the occurrence from the account he has given to the Guards very shortly after the accident.  It is a matter that relates very closely to the ascertainment of the truth of an occurrence and the account that is given by a person immediately after the accident is very much more likely to be correct and accurate than one made some months, or even years, afterwards, when the civil proceedings come to be heard.</P>
    <P>I will say, after pretty fair experience of these running-down cases, that there are very few cases in which deliberate perjury is committed.  In most cases we find witnesses trying to tell the truth.  In many cases we find people who are honest people but who, by dint of thinking over particular events and their recollection of the events have persuaded themselves that a particular set of things happened some months before when, in fact, nothing like it happened.  They are perfectly genuine and honest and have persuaded themselves of the position.  Witnesses vary in their recollection and in their powers of observation. It is a difficult task for a judge and jury to sift from that mass of chaff the particular grains of wheat which will grow into the truth.  The point I wish to make is that both parties to a civil action should have the right to see and, if necessary, take copies of, the statements made by <Col N="1543" /> their opponents and by the independent witnesses to the Guards after the occurrence, once criminal proceedings have been determined or once it has been decided by the authorities that no criminal proceedings will be instituted.</P>
    <P>The Minister, last year, when I raised this point on his Estimate, was good enough to say that he would look into the matter, and he did me the courtesy of writing me a letter about the matter afterwards, having consulted the Attorney-General.  I have also consulted my colleagues in the Bar Council and elsewhere on this matter, and for the reason that we are still dissatisfied with the practice and with the explanation the Minister gave, after consultation, I think he said, with the Attorney-General, I again raise the matter for his serious and earnest consideration.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I want to refer, that is, in connection with the prosecution of children for offences.  I know, of course, that there is one view of the criminal law: that the criminal law is a machine inexorable in its working, and that once an unfortunate citizen, whatever age he may be gets into the clutches of this huge machine, the machine must work inexorably to its logical end&mdash;conviction or acquittal.  I never took the view at any stage, even when I held an official position in this country, that it was the purpose of the criminal law, even where an offence was clearly committed, that there should necessarily and inevitably be a prosecution.  The purpose of the criminal law is not merely to punish but also to deter and if possible to bring about a change of heart in the criminal.  Very frequently that end might more easily be attained by mercy before the matter is brought into court.</P>
    <P>I do think that the Guards ought to have considerable discretion particularly in the matter of dragging children to the courts, even to the children's courts.  A prosecution inevitably makes a very serious and deep impression on young minds, sometimes a bad impression.  An offence may very frequently be committed by a young person <Col N="1544" /> in a spirit of bravado and, although at the time a certain degree of shame and ignominy may attach to a prosecution even in a children's court, possibly in association with his pals afterwards the young delinquent will act the part of being a big fellow and the result may be serious on his character and on that of his associates.  I personally knew of one case where a young boy got into trouble merely because one of his pals said he was &ldquo;yellow&rdquo;, and he felt that he had to do something, not a very heinous crime, to prove that he was not, but it involved him in a prosecution and, in fact, in a sentence. I think that the Guards, or at least the officers of the Minister's Department, ought to have some discretion in dealing with such cases.  If a youngster simply raids an orchard, for instance, he should not be straight away pounced upon with all the mighty force of the law, dragged into court and, as frequently happens, sent to a reformatory for a long period of years.</P>
    <P>I must say that whenever I have had to approach the officials either of the Minister's Department or that of the Department of Education, in reference to cases where district justices had exercised their power of sending children to reformatories for petty offences, they met my representations very sympathetically.  There was one case where I remember something like 5/- worth of apples was taken from an orchard and for that offence a boy was sentenced to three years in a reformatory. I think that sentence would shock the conscience of anybody except that of the particular justice who had the effrontery to send the boy to the reformatory.  I am glad to say that in that case a successful appeal was made to the Minister and to his colleague, the Minister for Education. A colleague of mine made the comment in connection with that case that if for every time he had raided an orchard he were sent to a reformatory, he would be still in the reformatory, that is, if the age for detention in reformatories were increased beyond the maximum at which it is now fixed by law.</P>
    <P>A matter of some considerable importance arising out of that is that I noticed the other day that a charitable <Col N="1545" /> organisation or another society is being formed with a view to assisting the very large number of children who are on probation.  That, of course, is very useful social work, but I wonder if it would not be possible to arrange that before these children are brought into the clutches of the criminal law, they ought to get some sort of chance so that they should not be inexorably condemned to arrest and prosecution where there is a technical offence or a small offence such as raiding an orchard.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the epidemic of bicycle stealing that exists at present.  In that connection I want to express some sympathy with the Guards who are faced with the task that confronts them at present. Thinking over the matter quite recently, it occurred to me that it is a matter of the most extreme difficulty for the most law-abiding citizen to go through his hours of waking without committing an offence against some statute or Order.  My study is piled high with Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act and I am absolutely convinced that every Deputy, at some stage or other in the week, commits an offence against one or other of these Orders and probably does not know it.  I think it is taking too strict a view of the criminal law that Gárdaí should be engaged in pursuing with vigour and determination the unfortunate citizen who perhaps unwittingly commits a minor transgression of the law.  The duty of the Guards is to go after serious crime; their efforts should be directed to the eradication of the most serious class of crime and not to minor breaches of the law.</P>
    <P>We are in a condition at the present moment in which, if I might use a colloquialism, certain things might be winked at.  In that connection, I think the Minister's Department, and indeed the citizens generally, ought to give the Guards every possible assistance in bringing this epidemic of bicycle stealing to an end.  I was told recently of an incident where two young ladies had the unfortunate experience, after a short walk, of seeing their bicycles, which they had hitched together and <Col N="1546" /> thought quite safe, being loaded on to a lorry, so that it seems that bicycle stealing has developed into the stage of an industry in this city.  While we have the greatest sympathy with the Guards in the task with which they are confronted, I think that every effort should be made to bring this particular industry to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely desire to say a few words on the administration of the Food and Drugs Act.  The Act is administered by inspectors who are members of the Gárdaí, and I want to suggest to the Minister that if a copy of the certificate furnished by the analyst were given in each case to the person from whom a sample was taken, it would be a great advantage to farmers, milk vendors and people who sell butter.  I think it should not be an impossibility to have that done.  A farmer may not know that his milk at certain times of the year is not up to the legal standard, and if a copy of the certificate given by the analyst were furnished to the person from whom the sample was taken it would be of great assistance.  Deputy Costello was rather indignant about some reference here to the cost of litigation.  We all know that the general feeling amongst the mass of the community is that the further everyone keeps away from the lawyers the better for himself.  I think that goes without saying.  There is one aspect of the cost of law which affects a large number of people, and that is the cost of transferring property.  I refer particularly to small farms. There are tens of thousands of small farms in this country on which administration has never been taken out because of the cost, and these cases are increasing in number yearly.  If the Minister were to examine the records of the Land Registry he would find that in the case of one-third of the farms of this country administration has not been taken out, and that is because the owners of these small farms are afraid of the cost of transferring their farms, taking out registration of title, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why these people are afraid to go to a solicitor to have proper administration taken out and their <Col N="1547" /> title registered.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation and similar bodies, when they need to ascertain the proper title to land, find every day in the week that many farms have no proper title at all; they have to go back two or three generations to find out title, and the cost is prohibitive.  I have known of cases where farmers have been made bankrupt as a result of taking out administration. That is a matter that the Minister should consider seriously. I think he should take it up with the Incorporated Law Society, or whatever body it is that deals with the fixing of fees, because these fees are prohibitive and have become more so since the 1924 Act.  I am told that previous to that Act the fees were not anything like what they are now&mdash;not 10 per cent. of what they are now&mdash; and that is something that needs the serious consideration of the Department of Justice.  I hope the Minister will have that matter reconsidered, because it is a burning question in the country and one that stands in need of solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give us any figures as to the number of bicycles that were being stolen in or around the City of Dublin, and some other Deputies mentioned that there had been a spread of this unfortunate evil through the country.  That sort of thing usually occurs during war time, when there is a general tendency towards demoralisation of one sort or another, but it also accompanies the kind of thing to which a new term has been applied&mdash;that is, the making of money by people through the black market.  I think it would be well for the Minister to have that examined scientifically to see what effect the one has on the other.  Quite a number of people who bend their minds towards this subject of breaches of the law by people who can get away with it are of opinion that one has a bearing on the other.  It is felt that if people are allowed to make considerable sums of money through the black market, then the people who are engaged in taking bicycles that are not their own are inclined to salve their consciences by <Col N="1548" /> saying that there are others who are not prosecuted.  Now, it is very inadvisable that this evil should spread, and it ought not to be beyond the wit of the Gárdaí, those who are engaged in crime prevention, to devise means towards stopping it in some form. There are various methods adopted by other Ministers.  I do not know whether it is for the purpose of better administration of the law or not, but other Ministers adopt the method of licensing people, so that every sale that takes place must be by a person who is in possession of a licence, and a record must be kept of the sale.  It might be well if that side of the question were examined by the Gárdaí with a view to making it more difficult to trade stolen bicycles.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin drew attention to the fact that there are prosecutions for such minor things as moving turf from Kildare to Dublin.  I think that that kind of thing is largely a waste of time.  If we are to prosecute people at the present moment for bringing in fuel from one part of the country to another, where there is a great demand for it, it looks as if the Gárdaí have not enough work to do.  Another prosecution that might reasonably have been avoided was where somebody brought in four tyres from Northern Ireland and, if my recollection is correct, was fined £200.  In a week or ten days, a prohibition against the importation of tyres was passed under an emergency decree, and from the point of view of the administration of the law it does appear to me to have been a much smaller offence to bring tyres into a country that needs them than to steal a bicycle from an unfortunate typist, artisan or labouring man, who depends upon it for a livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that I should like to put to the Minister is in connection with prisons.  Has he considered the general question of the form of treatment that is given to prisoners in this country, and is there in prospect any change in the system that has prevailed for the last 20, 30 or 40 years? I think that the present system is not a good one and that it is unlikely to effect the purpose which is in mind in connection with those matters, and <Col N="1549" /> that is the prevention of crime rather than mere punishment for having committed a crime.  There is then the question of what is to become of those people after they have served their sentences.  As far as I know that work is left almost entirely to a charitable organisation.  Now, is the work that they do within their means?  If we consider that, owing to present times, charitably disposed people have not got, perhaps, as much money as they would have in normal times, we will realise that charitable organisations are probably suffering from lack of funds by reason of that.  Would the Minister give that particular phase of his departmental activities some attention?</P>
    <P>Now, it will be said of us that whenever Estimates are brought up here, practically every suggestion that is made involves further expense, but if this matter were handled in the way I have in mind, and which I am quite sure the Minister would appreciate, it might lead to a lessening of expense eventually.  If it were possible to lessen the amount of crime in the country and turn the minds of evilly-disposed persons into more constructive channels, so that they might become useful citizens, the Minister and his Department might have to spend less money on his police and his prisons.  I fear, in consection with the epidemic of stealing bicycles, that it is possible that that may spread into other channels.  Times are difficult for people, and while they are waiting outside certain shops for goods that they cannot do without, it is natural that they should feel resentment and that they should be indifferent to what are called the higher ideals of citizenship.  Now, the fact that there are those difficulties does not give these people a licence to commit crime, but the less of those troubles there are at the present moment&mdash;and to a very large extent the Government has the responsibility there&mdash;the less temptation there is for these people, because this is a time of very great tribulation and want for many families and it is all the more necessary that we should do whatever we can do to alleviate their troubles; it is our duty to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost every Deputy who spoke was alarmed about the position with regard to petty thefts.  Unfortunately, what Deputy Cosgrave said may happen is already happening in connection with bicycles, and there are other things in short supply also, but I think it would be fair to say that, as far as we know, it is not the people who are most badly in need who are doing the stealing.  It is a new class of people who are not prepared to suffer any privation who are doing it.  Unless the people co-operate with the police, I am afraid that we will not be able to do very much about it.  People will have to be more careful, too, in leaving their bicycles and other articles about.  If they see anyone stealing an article they should help the police, because, without the people's co-operation, it is practically impossible for the police to detect all the petty crimes that are going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My secretary, when going home one evening, saw a man who was going into St. Vincent's Hospital to see his wife, leave his bicycle outside.  The man was not well inside the hospital door when a young ruffian came along, got up on the bicycle and rode away on it.  My secretary did his best to catch him but failed.  The bicycle thieves have now adopted a new technique by taking the parts which they are able to dispose of in the black market.  Deputies know as well as I do that activities in the black market are carried on secretly, and that, unfortunately, there are persons who are prepared to pay exorbitant prices for the articles offered there.  You have even very respectable people who are prepared to pay almost any price for petrol and for other commodities.  The police cannot act unless they get evidence, so that if they do not get co-operation what can they do?  If people are prepared to pay almost any price for things, I am afraid crimes of the kind we have been speaking of are going to increase rather than decrease. All sorts of complaints have been made to me since I became Minister, but when the people were asked to put them in writing they simply said they did not want to be brought into the thing at all.  That is the position we <Col N="1551" /> are up against.  All that we can do is to appeal to the people to help.</P>
    <P>The black market seems to be baffling Governments in all countries. I do not know how you are going to get rid of it as long as articles are scarce and people are prepared to pay almost any price for them.  I really think that the main cause for its existence is that people are not willing to help stamp it out.  As long as you have a shortage of goods that people were in the habit of getting and you have people who are prepared to pay any price for them, what can you do?  I can assure the House that the police are doing all in their power to get a hold of those who are stealing bicycles and other articles.  Yet, in spite of their efforts, the stealing goes on.  In some parts of the country the percentage of detection is very good. In a big city such as Dublin, detection is much more difficult, of course.  The percentage of detection in the city is not very high.  In my opinion that is not the fault of the police.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider introducing amending legislation to provide for the imposition of higher penalties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises another question, of course.  After all, when a district justice hears a case he should know what penalty to inflict.  I do not agree with fixed penalties.  I am sure the district justices consider all the circumstances of the cases that come before them and act accordingly. If this thing goes on we will have to do something drastic, but what that is I cannot say at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question asked by Deputy Cosgrave, I am not able to give the exact number of bicycles that have been stolen, but the number is considerable.  Unfortunately, a register of the numbers on bicycles would not be enough to prevent what is going on.  I know plenty of people who were able to give the numbers of their bicycles to the police, but that proved no use in helping to recover the machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also spoke about <Col N="1552" /> our prison system.  Some changes have been made.  Formerly, prisoners were not allowed out after 4.30 p.m., but now they can remain out until 7.30, after which they get a light meal. Wireless sets have been installed in the prisons so that prisoners are able to hear the news, and gramophone records are provided.  That also is a difficult problem.  If you make it too easy for people sent to prison, what are you going to do?  The same thing applies to children.  Some people say that if you catch a child and bring him to the children's court instead of to the ordinary court, and in that way give him a good fright, it may have a good effect.  Deputy Costello spoke of the law being inexorable, and urged that a discretion should be vested in the Guards or in some officials in my Department, to see that these children's cases were not taken to the courts.  I think it is well known that they are not all brought to the courts, and that the Guards use a discretion in that respect.  The probation system, to which I referred in my opening statement, does represent an attempt to deal with that problem.  After all, if children set out on a career of crime, I think it is better that some steps should be taken to frighten them rather than allow them to go unchecked.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the probation system will produce good effects.  Up to the present we have not got enough officers.  I do not think, even if you were to multiply the number of permanent officers by three, that you would do near as much good as we hope to do now with the help of the voluntary social workers.  They are devoting a lot of time to the work and belong to a social service organisation that I think will give good results.  There is a good number of them who have been assigned to specified districts.  As I said earlier, this effort would not got been possible at all if we had not got the active co-operation of His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, and of the workers who have come forward.  We have about 1,200 probationers.  Some years ago they would have been sent to prison, but now they are out on probation. In the case of female prisoners <Col N="1553" /> on remand, instead of being sent to Mountjoy, arrangements have now been made to send them to a home.  All that, I think, is very helpful.</P>
    <P>I will look into the point Deputy Allen raised about getting a copy of the analyst's certificate, and see what can be done about it.  Deputy Costello raised a point about the police reports in motor accident cases. I went into that fully last year with the Attorney-General.  I sent the reply to the Deputy, who was not satisfied with it.  I was just wondering what his own attitude on the matter was when he was Attorney-General.  Maybe things have changed since then, but, as he has asked me to go into it again, I will have another consultation with the Attorney-General.  As far as I can see, I do not think there is much chance that he will change his views on the matter.  He dealt with the question of costs.  I think there was a lot in what he said.  A lot of people consider their cases are very important and will go to no end of trouble and expense to get the very best counsel and engineer's and other expert witnesses.  If people do that I suppose they will have to pay for it.  My advice to them would be to keep away from them as much as they can, and then they will not have to pay the costs.  We always hear that it is an expensive matter to go to law. Some people make it even more expensive by employing the best counsel and expert witnesses.  It is not an easy thing to deal with.  It is being considered as Deputy Costello said.  The barristers themselves are alive to the matter, and the Rule-Making Committee are considering the question of the reduction of costs to see how it can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane raised the question of holding courts in different places.  I do not think it would be an easy thing to do that.  I have been considering the matter and I will consider it further.  It may be possible for courts to sit at a greater number of places than at present.  Nearly every town in the country is asking to have a court held there.  That would be impossible. It means changing the staff around and bringing the records, etc.  I do not <Col N="1554" /> know what number of officials would have to go.  The question of their travelling back and forward would arise.  It is a question presenting many difficulties and we will have only to do the best we can in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the expense of the jurors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only arising now. We will have to see what can be done about it.  The whole idea about the jurors is to have independent citizens who go there to discover the facts.  A question has been raised as to an allowance in certain cases.  It may be possible to do that; I do not know, but I will look into it.  There is no doubt that the problem is arising very acutely now on account of the shortage of petrol and the transport difficulties.</P>
      <P>As to the collection of land annuities, I have not the figures at hand.  If Deputy McMenamin wants accurate figures as to that, I am afraid he will have to put down a question.  Both Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Cogan dealt with that matter of the collection of land annuities.  I have suggested every time the question of the arrears of land annuities was raised, both while I was in the Department of Lands and while I have been in my present Department, that people who are in arrears should try to make a settlement with the Land Commission.  They can always do it; I have always found that. But if they are determined not to pay, something will have to be done about it.  We all know that if one or two people get away without paying, there will be an epidemic of it.  One man will say: &ldquo;Why should I pay if my neighbour does not pay?&rdquo;  It may, of course, cost money to make people pay who will not make a settlement.  I think these are the only class of people who are proceeded against; in fact I am practically certain of that.  When I was in the Land Commission I went into the cases very carefully and I know that the present Minister also does that.  We found that it is people who are determined not to pay who are causing all the trouble and expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  Part of the cost of collection is due to sending out to people who will not pay.  I know that Deputy McMenamin objects to the new system.  I do not.  I think it is a first-rate system and that it works very well.  As a matter of fact, if we had not adopted that system, I think there would have been a breakdown due to the non-payment of annuities campaign.  Thousands of people would be waiting outside the court for their cases to be heard.  One-hundredth part of them could not be dealt with, and there would have been a complete breakdown.</P>

      <P>There is one car operating in Wicklow, I think.  I do not know whether there is a car employed anywhere else; there may be another one.  In that case I want to say that there has been definite evidence of an organised attempt not to pay.  That is all about it.  In the case where the horse was seized, I am informed that a slogan was painted on the horse's side before the sale.  If that sort of thing were allowed to go on, it would make it impossible to continue either local government or central government. If Deputy Cogan will try to get these people not to persist in their attitude of non-payment and to be reasonable and make a fair offer to the Land Commission, I think he will find it will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin mentioned about a gun being carried by an unauthorised person and the terrible tragedy which occurred recently on a Sunday.  Surely he will not say that the Guards or anyone else could have stopped that? If there was any idea that that man had a gun, I can assure the Deputy that it would have been taken off him and he would have been dealt with. Anyone who is found carrying a gun without authorisation is dealt with. A gun can be so easily secreted, and there have been so many in the country that it is not possible to keep track of all of them.  Everyone regrets that a thing like that should happen.  It is one of the things which occur from time to time, but, thank God, not very <Col N="1556" /> often.  To suggest that it could be avoided by anything we could do is, I think, going too far.  Any person who carries a gun without authority is committing a crime and all such cases have been dealt with, and will be dealt with.  I do not know what the Deputy meant by what he said.</P>
    <P>As to the provision of petrol for State solicitors and coroners, the Department is taking up that matter with the Department of Supplies.  I do not know what we can do about coroners, but we will have to do the best we can about them.  Deputy Hughes spoke about the remuneration of clerks in registrars' offices.  So far as I know, they are fairly well paid. I have been making inquiries and have been informed that where there have been defalcations the persons concerned, like some of those people who are carrying out thefts in towns, were not persons who were in want.  Very often people who were fairly well paid have been carrying on these defalcations, not the badly-paid people.  That very often happens.  They are people with expensive tastes who are not prepared to live within their means and have to get the money somewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Kissane and other Deputies asked about the Guards who are being recruited.  The procedure is that the Commissioner has a selection board who will go through the number of candidates who are called.  I need not tell Deputies that there are far more applications than there are vacancies, and everyone who applies will not be called up for examination, because there would be too many.  They go through the list and select the most suitable men and try to allot them fairly amongst the different counties.  So far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, I do not think there can be any complaint.  I think a fair proportion is always taken from Kerry and the Gaeltacht districts generally. That is how it is done anyway.  The number is confined to 100 this time, and the Commissioner does not want to bring up more than he wants.  In order to get 100 men, he may require to call up about 200, because applicants may be turned down for one reason or <Col N="1557" /> another.  It may be a health reason or it may be the educational standard or something of that kind.  These officers are pretty well experienced in this matter.  They go through the list and pick out the people whom they think are most likely to be suitable.  As to the programme, there is a syllabus in the <i>Gárda Síochána Directory</i>, and any Deputy can get a copy of that. That is the best way I can deal with that.  As to the standard, it is not a very high one, but it is fairly high.  A Guard has to be pretty well educated now, as he has to deal with so many Acts and other matters.  He has to know his business.  Naturally, if the Commissioner finds a lot of well-educated men applying for vacancies in the Guards he will take them, although it may be hard luck on the man who has only got a 7th standard education. I think if anyone else were in the Commissioner's place, he would pick the best men he could get.  That would be only natural.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the Censorship Board.  He said they were too strict.  Some people think that, but on the whole I think they have done extraordinarily good work, and very difficult work, for which they do not get very much thanks.  I have not had much opportunity of saying what I think about them, but I really think they have done very excellent work. The original members of the Board were reappointed, but as there was a vacancy in the chairmanship we appointed another clergyman to fill that position.  I was told about a few books which it was, alleged should not have been censored, and I went to the trouble of reading them right through. I am not a very literary man, but I think I am of the type of the ordinary man in the street whom Deputy Esmonde had in mind, and I agreed that the board was right.  There was one book in particular that I heard a great deal of talk about.  I read it right through and decided that the board was perfectly right.  I think anyone who takes the trouble to examine the matter dispassionately and fairly will agree that they have done their work very well indeed.  It is not a position that everyone would <Col N="1558" /> wish for either.  I am sure of that. They get more blame than otherwise.</P>
    <P>With regard to political crime in the country, I think the House is well aware of what the position there is.  It is reflected in the statement that there are over 400 interned, and that a large number have been sentenced and are in jail.  I am sure the position would be very much worse if they were out. At present, there seems to be a bit of a slackening off, but a feature about this particular movement is that it flares up and dies down and flares up again.  We can never be sure.  That is why it is necessary to keep a very tight watch on it.  When we come across any persons who are considered dangerous, we simply get after them. In the case of those who are not considered dangerous, we let them go and keep an eye on them.  I do not think the position is very menacing at the moment, largely due I think to the fact&mdash;I may be proved wrong in this &mdash;that we have most of the really dangerous people tied up.  I think that is commentary enough on the situation.  I cannot say any more about it.  I only hope that those people will get a bit of sense, and realise that we are very lucky to be in the position we are in at the moment.  We might be a thousand times worse off. If a lot of those people got their way we would be in a very much worse position.  They do not think so, but if they had sense they would be thanking their lucky stars that the country is getting on as well as it is at the moment.</P>

      <P>As far as I know there is not a great number of transfers.  The Commissioner sometimes finds it necessary to change a man, and when he does he has to change somebody else as well.  That is the trouble.  I do not think there is very much changing <Col N="1560" /> going on, but undoubtedly, when one man is changed, it necessitates the changing of another also.  That is all that is happening, as far as I know.  As Deputies are aware, the Guards themselves sometimes ask to be changed, for health or other reasons, and then the Commissioner tries to facilitate them.  I do not think there are many other changes, except for disciplinary reasons.</P>

      <P>There is one point which I want to raise, and I am going to raise it on the question of prisoners. I have received a complaint that when a prisoner in, let us say, X., is written to by some of his relatives to do something, that letter is censored by the competent authority, but, unfortunately, before it reaches the prisoner it is censored by somebody else.  I <Col N="1561" /> think the Minister should take particularly good care, where the responsible officers decide that a letter contains something which should not be brought to the notice of others, that there is some method by which that letter can get to the prisoner without any third party or any fourth party seeing it.  I am satisfied that if that course were adopted the number of prisoners might reasonably be substantially reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be regretted that the activities of the Land Commission have been reduced so much.  In the past, even at the hottest of times here, I think the Minister will agree that, amongst others, I have paid tribute to the very great work being done by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion and the improvement of estates and farms.  At a time when the land is required to produce more food and more of the necessaries of life than it ever produced before, it is a mistaken policy on the part of the Government to reduce its activities.  The story that the Minister has told us of the reduction of the improvement grant by £128,000 and the practical cessation of acquisition of any further lands, under any circumstances, is an indication of a very grave mistake.</P>
      <P>In various parts of the country, there are farms of land becoming available, for many reasons, that in the ordinary circumstances would not be on the market at all.  There are many large holdings where, owing to compulsory tillage and for other reasons, the owners have thrown up their hands in despair and are prepared to hand them over.  The only action that can be taken now is that the Minister for Agriculture could step in and set the lands, and the owner could be left high and dry.  It is a well-known fact that, if the Land Commission were still functioning, and these particular farms became available and were distributed to the small holders in the district, or alternatively, if the holdings were available for young unmarried men and others of a suitable type, the rush from the land would be eased.  There is no alternative now, or apparently for the duration of the emergency. When boys come to 24 or 25 years of age on the farm, there is nothing for them to do, and if one of them gets married the others must clear out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last 15 or 20 years, under the activities of the Land Commission, <Col N="1572" /> when a holding was taken over, a certain proportion of it was given to landless men, and this worked out well generally.  I think it is a mistake that, when these holdings are available now, the Land Commission should not be allowed to go back to their original plan.  The interest of the country would best be served by a return to their normal activities.  Where they are satisfied that the case is made and the land is available now for distribution and they can get it, notwithstanding any difficulties which may be in front of them, they should be allowed to take it over and divide it in the best interests of the people, as they know how to do it.</P>
    <P>I freely admit that the Land Commission has been, like Caesar's wife, above reproach in all activities like land division, land improvements, and so on, and it is too bad that that particular type of work should be stopped. At least the nucleus of it should be maintained.  There are some outstanding cases in which judicial decisions were given and the vesting orders have not been completed yet, although this has been going on for seven or eight years.  I do not wish to go into the details, but I think this should be speeded up. Then there is the question of people who are entitled to receive moneys from the Land Commission for land taken over already.  It was slow enough before but now, apparently, it is slower. A man whose estate was taken over five, ten or 15 years ago can get neither principal nor interest, because of some particular difficulty.  That is not as it should be.  If a man were in physical possession and not able to prove absolute ownership, though enjoying the land at the time it was taken over, and if there was nobody to question the title, he should at least get the interest, pending establishment by him of his title to the principal.  I think that particular aspect of the Department's work should be speeded up.</P>
    <P>On the question of migration from congested areas, I consider that the Minister has not been fair to the House, and that he should tell a little more about that scheme.  It commenced some years ago, and he should be able to make some survey of it by indicating <Col N="1573" /> whether the money expended on such activity has been well spent.  He might give a word-picture as to how these people are now living, if their condition has improved generally, or how they have reacted to the generosity of the Government that initiated the plan for their improvement.  As we hear all sorts of rumours I should like to hear a positive statement of the facts from the Minister.  I do not think he has done himself justice or been fair to the House by explaining whether the scheme has been a success.  If it has been a failure, or only a partial success let him say so and explain what are the causes that led to that result. Of course if it has been a success he has nothing further to say about it.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties confronted by those who are concerned about land annuities.  A substantial number of farmers have never really recovered from the economic war.  I am sure we would all like to forget about that, and also the Government, but the fact is that these farmers have been unable to meet their obligations for the past five or six years.  I agree that the Land Commission have been willing and anxious to help them if the people could help themselves, but when there was no stock on their holdings, or when everything had been removed, they were in such a position that they could not recover.  Then there are other farmers with small holdings whose instalments are in arrear.  This year is better than last year, but they had to buy seeds and, in some cases, horses with which to carry out tillage operations.  As a result they are not even able to meet the current annuity instalments.  Some method might be devised by which the banks would accept, say, £1 or 10/- a month towards paying off whatever sum a county registrar considered it possible for a tenant to pay, instead of having the account placed in the hands of whatever official is responsible for the collection.  If a man could go into a post office with instalments of 5/- this week and £1 perhaps next week towards payment of the debt, it might be helpful.  At present if the receivable order is not brought in within the time specified the bank cannot take the money.  The tenant must then wait <Col N="1574" /> until he receives a six days' notice, and if the amount is not paid within that time, the bank cannot take it and the matter goes to the county registrar. The result is that these unfortunate people have to go to somebody they know to write a letter to the Land Commission and to send on a postal order.  They do not like telling their circumstances or that they cannot pay their rent.  It would be an advantage if there was some method, when a county registrar makes a return saying that he is satisfied that a John Brown could pay 5/- a month, whereby the tenant could go to the nearest post office and have payment accepted and entered on a card.  It may be argued that that would multiply the difficulties of accountancy, but it would make things easy for people in arrears and enable them to get out of their difficulties.  It would be a good day's work if such persons could be restored to a feeling of responsibility as owners of their farms, and owing the Land Commission nothing.  I admit that the Land Commission are anxious and willing to give all the time that can reasonably be given for payment, but it is too great a strain on Deputies to have to write letters and, if they have cheque books, to send on the amounts owing, even though these people pay for the cheques.  It means that the Deputies have difficulty in keeping their accounts. There should be some simplified method of having payments made at the post offices or banks.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government, for reasons that I do not know, have stopped the acquisition and division of land.  Where representations are made to them in exceptional cases I suggest that they might reconsider the matter, particularly where the representations come from members of the different Parties.  A special effort should be made to meet such cases because those who make the representations have responsibilities and would not intervene except in well-founded cases.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think that the reverse should be the case.  My county has experienced more land division during the past 25 years than any other county.  As one who is living in the midst of a large number of new homes, I say that land division, as carried out, is nothing more than a waste of public money.  Anybody would think that, after such a long time, the Land Commission would realise that tearing up the rich lands of the midlands and dividing them in scraggy patches amongst people, who, in most cases, have not a shilling in their pockets, is unfair to the country and to those who helped to make the country free.  In my county, there is really more destitution in the newly-divided farms than there was in the west of Ireland, whence they brought the people.  The Land Commission requires a re-shuffle.  There must be some old cronies there who are anxious to see land division a complete failure. I know that there are some splendid men there who would like to see things going well, but I fear that some people there are urging the Minister to keep on dividing land into scraggy patches, so that it will be proven that the British ranch system of 50 years ago was the right system and that there is nothing to be done but go back to that system.  The Land Commission will have either to stop land division or undo the work they are at present doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes asked: &ldquo;Why cannot a family live on 20 or 25 acres in Meath when you have families living on four or five acres in Clare and Kerry?&rdquo;  They are not living on the land in these counties.  They are living on money from emigrants in Britain and America, on fisheries and on poteen.  We, in Meath, have to live solely by the land.  Five acres in Kerry might be worth 70 acres in Meath.  It is unjust to compare farms in Clare and Kerry in size with farms in Meath.  Let the Minister go down <Col N="1576" /> and ask the majority of the people who have been settled in Meath if they are satisfied or if they are living by the land.  Most of the people I know who got land were ordinary workers, living by their day's labour with the farmers. In many cases, the land they got has been set back to some farmer and they are working either on the roads or bogs or with farmers.  They are not living by their land.  If the Minister says that that is successful land division, I say it is not.  When land is divided, it should be in such a way that a man, his wife and family will be able to live on it in comfort and will not have to be cringing to his neighbour for a day's wages.  Not one of the farms divided by this Government would carry two horses.  They have to rely on an old pony and they can never have their crop in in time because they have to wait on their neighbour to get his crops in.  You find them ploughing lea land when they are late and, as a result, they get very poor crops.  We should not let it be thrown back in our faces by people who were ejected from the country 25 or 30 years ago that their ranch system was a success and that our small farms are a failure.  The small farms which are being divided now are bound to be a failure and, unless that system is ended, the ranch system will be proved to have been a comparative success.  No farmer, no matter how good he is and no matter how hard he works, can live on a farm of less than 30 Irish acres.  On anything smaller than that, he is only a labourer. That should be dinned into the mind of the Minister.  The Land Commission must be dunderheads if they do not realise that.  If they come from farming stock, I wonder what kind of farm they were reared on.  It was not a 20-acre farm.  It was probably a 40-acre or 50-acre farm.  It is all nonsense talking about land division by the present system.</P>
    <P>I want to show the Minister the way the ordinary midland men are being treated as compared with the men brought into the county.  When the Land Commission divided a farm in Meath, most of it went to migrants. They sometimes left three or four farms for uneconomic holders in the <Col N="1577" /> vicinity and for the herd.  I am aware of estates round about me on which land was divided about four or five years ago.  The migrants got everything. Everything the Land Commission could shower upon them was given them and they were placed there in their houses.  On these estates, houses were marked out for local men but the foundation has not been laid yet.  The new men from the west and south have been living in their holdings for three or four years while the Meath men, born and reared there, who are entitled to a preference, have to live in neighbours' sheds and in condemned houses while waiting for the Land Commission to come and build houses for them.  It is a disgrace and a shame to make such a difference between people.  If you build a house for a man from the West of Ireland, why not build it for a man on the lands of Meath?  I ask the Minister to say that there will be no more of this unfair treatment but that there will be fair play and justice for all.</P>
    <P>We have no grievance against these unfortunate men who came from the West of Ireland.  They have a difficult task in front of them.  The Minister said a few years ago that they were quite happy, were doing well and that their farms were quite economic.  He said that the new farms extended from 22 acres up.  That is altogether wrong. Farms of 19¼ acres of bad land have been given to men who are expected to rear eight or ten children on these scraggy patches.  It is nonsense to tell the people that these men are living in comfortable and happy surroundings. The Minister may have seen in the papers reports of these men marching through the streets, stopping at the General Post Office and demanding economic farms.  Are these the people the Minister told us are living comfortably and happily? They are certainly not making a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on the farms and they are not living by the farms.  Nearly every family has two or three members in England and others have members working on the roads and bogs.  They are not getting their living by the farms.  If ordinary times were to <Col N="1578" /> return, the migrants who have come to Meath would flee like locusts.</P>
    <P>Within ten years there will not be a quarter of the migrants there that there are to-day.  They are only waiting for the chance to get back to their old surroundings or to go to America.  They are completely &ldquo;fed up&rdquo; with their present situation.  Although they got horses and sows and cows, oatmeal and wheatmeal and everything the Minister could think of, they are dissatisfied and are depending on their neighbours or on Britain, or on the bogs or roads for a living.  They cannot live on their uneconomic holdings and they were quite right to march through the streets and demand their due.  I would support these people in looking for their rights.  When you brought these people to places like Meath, I was against it.  I found that many were as decent as I am myself and that is fairly decent.  They are honourable people, but they were completely fooled.  The people I am talking about are 100 per cent.  Fianna Fáil.  There is not one here or there who might be thinking my way.  They are 100 per cent.  Fianna Fáil and they are completely dissatisfied, and the scheme is going to be an absolute failure.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to stop this nonsense of saying that he is dividing the land.  He is destroying the lands of Meath.  I want to know why it is that the Land Commission will not divide estates that were taken over five years ago.  Year after year they are set to the big rancher, and he has his bullocks on it.  In many cases the ditches are left without being repaired.  The Land Commission have set this land for the last three years in tillage.  I know one man, a herd on an estate, who got what he is told is an economic farm.  He got 25 acres of stubble that was in its third year, which contained nothing but thistles.  Of course, he was a Meath man.  He has to develop that 25 acres into arable land, and there is not a perch of that land suitable for a cow. Then he is told he should be content and happy because he got land for nothing.  No such thing.  Most of the <Col N="1579" /> divided land is at altogether too high a rent.  In fact, the rent is abnormal that has to be paid for the lands of Meath.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister why it is that the Fowler Estate in Rathmolyon that was taken over five years ago, which we were told was to be divided immediately, has not been divided.  It was to be divided three months ago, but the inspectors changed their minds and it was put up for public auction and let to a man in the locality at a fair price.  The people of Rathmolyon could always get grass for ten to 25 cows on that estate.  Every man who wanted grass for a cow could get it. When the Land Commission took over they gave the tenants half a day to get their cows out.  They are still waiting for land on which to put their cows and they cannot get it.  The Land Commission will not facilitate them, but they facilitate the bigger people by setting the land to them.  There is not a pound of butter or a cup of milk in Rathmolyon because of the blundering of the Land Commission.  They took the land from the gentleman who had looked after the rights of the people living in that little town and they forget about their rights.  The result is that people are starving in Rathmolyon to-day.  A herd who worked and lived on that estate for the best part of 20 to 30 years now sees the land that he may get, and perhaps may not get, on the third year of stubble.  It has not been properly manured, but has been ploughed up all the time.  That is the treatment the people of Meath are getting. I would prefer that the Minister would speak in a language that we understand, not in the Irish tongue.  He is using that language for the purpose of covering up a lot of things.  He slipped it across us this evening.  I would like to know Irish.</P>

He has told us everything he should not have told us.  I hope that next year we will have a general review of the whole thing.  If this Minister does not want to give us satisfaction, let us hope some other Minister will be put in his place and that the Land Commission will wake up.  The people of Meath will see that they wake up.  They are getting rent and taxes as fast as we can pay them, but we are getting no satisfaction.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission inspectors come 30 times to an estate.  They were able to get enough petrol to run an army.  They come several times to map land that could be mapped in five minutes.  I think it is making a good job for themselves they are.  Two or three inspectors would do, instead of five or six.  Let them do decent work, not mapping land, leaving it for three years and coming and mapping the very same land over again.  They listen to the story of every Tom, Dick and Harry, but they will not go near the parish priest in the area because he will tell them the truth.  The political hacks must be satisfied.  I may be told that that is untrue, but I say it is not untrue.  In my part of the country there were men for whom I was getting home help for the last three years.  I blessed myself when I saw them signing for land.  They thought they were made up when they got land. They forgot that when they got land they would lose home help and would lose the services of doctors, nurses and dentists.  They have their land now, but the nation is the poorer and they are also the poorer.  They are nothing more than labourers.  They are told they are buckshee farmers. They are not farmers.  They cannot live on the land.  They have not a penny for themselves or for the people who should be getting employment on the land.  Then we are told the scheme is a success.  I saw a huge heading in the <i>Irish Press</i> four years ago.</P>

      <P>I do.  I read all papers, because I want to get both <Col N="1581" /> sides of the picture.  The heading was to the effect that the O'Sullivan Beare from Cork comes back to his native soil in the rich lands of Meath under the hills where the kings of Tara walked long ago.  There was a great preamble, a fanfare of trumpets and torchlight procession.  The O'Sullivan Beare did come from Bantry, County Cork, and found himself on a farm in the Gibbstown Estate, County Meath, but the O'Sullivan Beare was not left very long on that estate and he did not get the chance of going back to his native Cork.  Where is he to-day? The O'Sullivan Beare and his six children, his wife, and his old mother, 82 years of age, are to-day the guests of the county poorhouse in Trim.  They are there for the last ten months, at the expense of the ratepayers in County Meath.  I brought his case before the Minister on a few occasions and he gave me a fairly long, considered reply, but I say that no man who has met this gentleman is satisfied that he got justice.</P>
      <P>In our opinion the Land Commission are a bigoted set of cranks and when they make a mistake they cover it up at somebody else's expense.  It was a whole series of blunders on the part of the Land Commission that brought that man into the poorhouse.  He is there at the expense of the ratepayers.  The board of health can do nothing.  The man himself can do nothing.  The home he left in Bantry will not be given back to him.  I would ask the Secretary of the Land Commission, who is now in this House, to make full investigation of his case.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  I would ask the Minister to give this man a hearing.  I asked him to give him a hearing by an independent court and the Minister would not hear of it. The Minister is taking the story from the inspectors.  The blunder was not made by the O'Sullivan Beare; it was made by the Land Commission and he is a victim.  He was mulcted in costs in the courts.  It would be only right that he should get a fair chance.  Every <Col N="1582" /> Deputy listening to me, including Deputy O'Reilly, and Deputy Kelly, knows that this man received unfair treatment.  It has destroyed the whole idea of bringing migrants to County Meath or the Midlands.  What can people say when they see a most respectable and decent man thrown on the side of the road, his mother thrown out of a sick bed, living as a pauper?</P>
      <P>Five years ago the <i>Irish Press</i> had the heading: &ldquo;The O'Sullivan Beare comes back to his native soil.&rdquo;  God save him from the treatment he is getting on his native soil now.  This is his case and I want to see it fully investigated. I am not going to say whether O'Sullivan or the Minister is right. Let him state his own case, and these are the facts as I got them.  He came up from a village near Bantry in the year 1937.  His father died in 1936 and his mother signed the place over to the son, Michael O'Sullivan Beare after the father died.  When the Land Commission were looking for migrants, this man applied and out of 70 applicants from County Cork and that vicinity, there were two picked.  O'Sullivan was the first man picked because he seemed to be the most suitable for the purpose. He was brought up and handed over the key in 1937.  A short time afterwards an inspector called on him and said: &ldquo;You were not the rightful owner of your place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to say that O'Sullivan had documents showing that the place had been assigned to him a year before.  He was in this holding in Meath when the Land Commission alleged that he was not the rightful owner of his father's place.  They went in on his holding in Meath, upset his way of living and brought him to the poorhouse.  If there had been a mistake in accepting him as tenant for this place in Meath, they should have stood over their mistake instead of evicting him.  I am informed that his mother had no right or title to the holding.  I am not, however, his legal adviser, and I cannot decide this matter.  The mother is an old illiterate woman over 80 years of age who could not even sign her name, but he states that the place was assigned to him by his mother after the death of his father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> He was brought to court by the Land Commission and the judge said that as there appeared to be a misunderstanding between the Minister's Department and O'Sullivan, they ought to come together and settle it.  The Land Commission piled up the expenses until they reached £25 or £30, and said to O'Sullivan: &ldquo;Before we fix you up, you will pay that.&rdquo;  Like the man he was, he would not pay that amount and the Land Commission would not settle with him.  A decree was then got against him for something like £200 or £300.  Of course he could not pay it, as he had not the means to do so, and they evicted him and never gave him back even the key of his own holding. The buildings on his old holding in Cork are now in such a condition that all the windows and doors are gone, but he was told to go back there even though the Land Commission had the key.  That is the treatment the migrants get when they do not stoop to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission then auctioned all the farm implements.  They told him he did not own the horse, the plough or anything, but when it came to the auction, they put them down in Michael O'Sullivan's name as if they were his property; yet he did not get the money for them.  Neither was he let get any of the mangels, turnips or oats he had sown, and there was no value placed on them.  These crops were allowed to go unsaved because there was no one to save them.  The Land Commission lost hundreds of pounds in that way.  They would not give anybody a chance of making money on them; they would not give O'Sullivan a chance of even clearing off the crops.  They were like bloodhounds watching to see that he would not get anything out of the place.  They put them up for the highest offer.  No one would offer anything for them, as nobody was going to be a scab in County Meath.  The day of the scab is gone there.  O'Sullivan offered £80 which was three times as much as anybody else would offer, but the Land Commission refused it, and said: &ldquo;You must get out.&rdquo;  The Land Commission could not get anyone in the vicinity to undertake the saving of the hay or the <Col N="1584" /> oats and they had to go to my end of the county, which is 30 miles away, to get a horse to cut the hay and to harvest the oats.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us the amount of money expended in dealing with cases like this.  The expenses must run into hundreds of pounds and I say it is a waste of public money.  It was only the other day that Michael O'Sullivan, now an inmate of the poorhouse, got a demand for rent for the land from which he was evicted years ago.  Where does that unfortunate man stand at all?  He either owns the land or he does not own it. If he has been put out of it, why is rent demanded from him?  Probably the worst thing that could happen to him is that I have brought up his case in this House as that very fact may mean that he will not have any chance of getting fair treatment now, but I say that if the Minister is a good Irishman, as he undoubtedly is, he should see that this man is given fair play.  I ask him to meet O'Sullivan face to face and discuss the case with him.  There is no use in acting the aristocrat by leaving him to officials who have at their disposal legal advisers and others who can put the case from their side perfectly to the Minister and say: &ldquo;It is clear as A, B, C.&rdquo;  Poor O'Sullivan merely wants to knock at the door, to beg admission for a few minutes to enable him to put his case to the Minister but he will not be allowed by the Land Commission into these great buildings&mdash;buildings of iniquity I call them, because I think more impudence comes from the Land Commission offices than from any other building.</P>
    <P>It is terribly unfair that the Irish peasantry are looked upon as nothing but serfs in that Department and that they have to bow and scrape to officials before they can get anything.  I am not saying that that is true of every official, but I say that the Land Commission needs a cleaning up for the sake of Ireland and the tenants of Ireland.  In putting things strongly in this manner, I may be doing myself a lot of injury, but I do not care a hair. I say there is too much of the old British garrison still there.  I want to see young Irishmen who were bred and <Col N="1585" /> born on the soil of Ireland, who were reared by struggling parents in bad times, planted there.  Let some of these people be put in charge of the Land Commission and we shall have some hope for the future.  As things stand at the moment there is not the slightest chance of making land division a success as 80 per cent. of the people given land are nothing more than State paupers.  I know that in many cases the land is given to political hacks.  Whenever land was to be divided in my constituency, I could almost tell beforehand who would get land and who would not and I was nearly always right.  I think it is time to realise that the people of my county and of the midlands in general want to see farmers' sons, who can put up £100 or £200 of their own, placed on the land.  Men of that type will be able to make some good use of the land and will be able to give employment in the busy times of the year.  Instead of that, you have land given to men who, instead of working it, will set it to neighbouring farmers and will go out working on other farms.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission will not even erect proper fences, with the result that these men do not know their bearings, and there is endless trouble between them.  As things stand at present in many cases their lands are merely a common age.  Another grievance is that a large number of these men were promised that pumps would be erected for them when they took over the land, but they are waiting for the pumps still.  Not one pump has been erected for them.  These people have to go four or five miles to draw water for their cattle; the land is worth nothing to them, because you cannot keep young cattle on a farm in summer without water, and I think the way the people are being treated is very unfair.  In the case of the migrants, however, a new house is erected for them before they come in at all; new pumps, new piers, new gates, yards, haggards, and all the rest of it, are provided&mdash;everything is done for them, and at endless expense, but the unfortunate farmer's son has nothing at all done for him.  He is told, in effect: &ldquo;There is your scraggy bit of land; <Col N="1586" /> you can do what you like with it, but, you had better make sure to pay your rent when it is due.&rdquo;  I say that that is unfair, and it is time that somebody should voice the opinion of the people, because the people are in an uproar about it.  These people are good farmers and they would rather that an acre of land was never divided than see it destroyed.</P>
    <P>Now, I cannot understand why it is that when a contract has been given out for the building of a house, over four years ago, it is not built yet.  If it is not built, why are not the inspectors of the Land Commission getting after the contractors concerned and either taking the contracts away from them or else seeing that the houses are built?  There are cases in my locality where they have been waiting for the last four or five years for houses to be built.  In the case of some houses and sheds the timber is put on and the slates are left off both winter and summer, and that timber, in the winter, is swelled by the rain while, in the summer, it is parching and drying. Yet, some of these contractors are working 50, 60 and 80 miles away building houses in other counties; they will not answer the letters from people begging them to build the houses.  The Land Commission do nothing about it.  The unfortunate people write to them asking them to do something for God's sake, but all they may get in reply are a few words in Irish that they have to get the school teacher to translate for them. The whole thing, in my opinion, is a waste of money and an insult to the people, who are living, as I have already said, in shacks and sheds and condemned houses, while rearing five or six children and doing their best to carry on.  They are living in these shacks and condemned houses four or five miles away from the farms they are supposed to work.  I say that land division, as it stands at present, is a farce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to two speeches: one from the Front Bench, by Deputy MacEoin, congratulating the Minister on the acquisition and division of land, and another from <Col N="1587" /> the Back Bench, by Deputy Giles, saying that the division of land under both Governments has been a failure. One thing that we heard from Deputy Giles I never heard before, and that was, in effect, that five acres in Kerry were worth about 30 acres in Meath, and he supplemented that by telling us that in places in Meath there is neither butter nor milk and that farmers are in the county home.  If that be the case in Meath to-day, I wonder is it not time for the country to waken up, particularly when we have been talking for years about self-sufficiency and the necessity for using the lands of Meath for supporting the country in its present emergency?  According to Deputy Giles, neither the last Government nor this Government should interfere with Meath: we should leave everything to the farmer.  I wonder if Deputy Giles has really considered the position of the country as a whole or if he realises that it is quite possible that within the next few months we shall be in a state of siege in this country?  Does he realise what the effect will be if there is neither milk, butter, eggs nor bacon &mdash;because the one follows from the other&mdash;while these people go off to their dog racing and their horse racing and leave the land to go wild? The Deputy talks about not being able to get a strand of wire, but where is it to come from nowadays?  Fences can be made by other means than by wire, and there are Government grants for the reclamation of land and for increasing its fertility, but we are told here by Deputy Giles: &ldquo;Hands off Meath; our farmers are all right, and leave them so.&rdquo;  If the picture of the situation drawn by Deputy Giles is correct, I suggest that the Minister should take serious notice of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacEoin about the slowness of the Land Commission in the division of lands.  I know that there are difficulties, but there are some things that should not be allowed to drag on too long, particularly when it comes to the case of an estate where names were taken and inquiries made, and all the rest of it, five years ago, and still the lands have not been divided.  In the case of an estate at <Col N="1588" /> Ballymahon, in Westmeath, it is more than five years ago since division was decided upon by the Land Commission, but nothing has been done.  It was to have been done two years ago, it was to have been done 12 months ago, but the land is still undivided.</P>
    <P>I think that in view of the present circumstances of the country there can be no excuse for delay in a case like that.  I think there is no Deputy here to-day but realises how serious the situation is, if he really wants to think of the country now and in the near future.  The war is all around us and, whether we are in Opposition or not, we are driven now to talk about self-sufficiency. We are driven now to make the best use we can of the land. I do not agree with people who talk about the farmer being beggared nowadays. Any farmer, if he is industrious to-day, can make good.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say much more on this, except that I would like to see the industrious, hard-working farmers, who have been referred to by Deputy MacEoin, put in charge of the land, because they have the training and the experience, and the time has come when this House should consider whether they should give any farms to people who are not using them in the national interest.  We have the Department of Agriculture and the Land Commission taking over occupation of certain farms at present, and I think that it is only right that such action should be taken because it is necessary to save the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two questions I want to raise on this Vote. One is the question of the flooding of the lands on the banks of the River Suir.  I begged, implored and beseeched the Minister and the Land Commission officials to let us know what is going to be done in connection with this matter.  We hear, up and down the country, about the tilling of land, the use that should be made of it, the scarcity of food, and all that sort of thing.  Now, there are 1,000 acres of land going to waste on the banks of the River Suir, particularly in two places. One is the old hardy annual, Tybroghney, and the other is Portlaw.  I think that the condition in which these lands <Col N="1589" /> are at the present time is a disgrace. They are good for nothing; the River Suir is running in on them, and at the present time the bank at Tybroghney is merely slob-land and mud, for around about 400 acres.  Quite recently, during the past winter, a breach has occurred on the opposite bank of the river, on the County Waterford side.  Neither of these is in my constituency, but I had to turn back on the road recently because of the flooding that occurred there.  I know that the Land Commission view is that, under some Land Act or another, the farmers took responsibility for the upkeep of these banks.</P>
      <P>I believe that is disputed in the case of the banks on the County Waterford side.  The position at any rate is that something should be done about it immediately. There is no use in thinking that the farmers at this time are going to remedy the position on their own initiative and at their own expense. All I know is that it is a disgrace to see it.  We hear of the bad times in the days of the landlords.  These lands were reclaimed in those days and were kept up by the landlords.  But now, when we have a home Government, nothing is being done.  It is terrible to think that we have there 1,000 acres of good land which is being flooded.  I saw tillage on it myself.  To-day all that land is fit for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that the Drainage Commission which sat a few years ago would have recommended a solution of this problem.  I want to know definitely from the Minister what are the possibilities of doing something in connection with these particular banks. There is no use in telling me that it is the owners' responsibility to maintain them.  That would be too big of an undertaking for the owners.  As far as they are concerned, we have been told that all the land belongs to the State, and would be directly used in the interests of the State.  But whoever is responsible, something ought to be done.  Even if a new code of laws be required to meet the position in regard to these embankments, it ought to be brought forward.  I ask the Minister to take this matter up himself. He knows as much about it as I do. Some of this land is in his own constituency, and more of it is not far <Col N="1590" /> away from it.  It is up to him to put pressure on the Land Commission or the Board of Works to have something done, and see who will bear responsibility afterwards in connection with it.</P>
    <P>The other matter that I want to deal with is the question of land division to which reference has been made by some previous speakers.  I want publicly to protest against the division of land that is being carried out in my constituency in Emly.  I am informed that, although there were plenty of local applicants, only two from the locality got allotments on the worst part of this estate, and that outsiders were brought in and given the remainder. The result is that this 400-acre farm has not been divided.  So far as I know, the land is there derelict.  I know that certain things have happened there&mdash;that fences have been thrown down.  I do not agree with that.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that when people in a locality resort to such steps there must be something wrong, and that a great injustice has been perpetrated on the people. The Land Commission are not able to get anybody to do anything on this land.  I read recently in the newspapers an admission by the State Solicitor that they could only get a caretaker there.  They will not get men to work on the land.  It is no wonder from what I have heard, although I have not been to Emly.  I know that members of every Party in this House have been there and have condemned in the strongest possible manner the action of the Land Commission in connection with the division of that estate.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is unique in the history of this country to have a local agitation, backed up by the priests, being carried on there at the present time. I would advise the Minister, even at this late hour, to have a redivision of this particular holding.  It is said that some of the local people were not worthy applicants: that they were probably from the towns, and so on.  I fail to believe that.  I know that is not true.  I do not think that the priests of a parish would associate themselves with anything which was not fair or reasonable where the interests of the people were at <Col N="1591" /> stake.  That is the situation there at the present time.  The priests of the parish have been backing up the local people for the redivision of this land and trying to right the wrongs that have been perpetrated in its division. I would advise the Minister in the future, whatever he or the Land Commission may do about other counties, that when they are seeking to divide land in Tipperary they will have a better regard for the interests of the people in the locality before setting out to bring in outsiders.  That is what I am told has happened.  If the Minister reads some of the speeches made by members of his own Party he will find that they were as strong in condemnation of the policy of the Government and of the Land Commission as were the speeches made by members of other Parties.</P>
    <P>It is not my fault that I have not been to Emly.  If I had been there, I would have associated myself with the people's protest.  I would advise the Land Commission to reconsider this whole matter and not to treat the local people as they have treated them.  Out of this 400-acre holding the local people got only 33 acres of bog in the corner of it.  The Tipperary people will not have that, no matter what the Minister or the Government may try to put across them.  From what I have read in the local papers, I suggest to the Minister that it would be better in the interests of the Land Commission, of the people of the locality and of Tipperary as a whole that this matter should be settled amicably, because there is no one, no matter what Party he belongs to, who stands for or sympathises with what the Government have done in this case.  I am not standing up here to talk on this as a member of the Opposition. There are Fianna Fáil T.D.s who stood up in Emly and condemned it just as I am condemning it here. Members of the Labour Party have done the same.  When you have that state of affairs existing, backed up as it is by the priests of the parish, one can say that the Land Commission are up against it and are not going to get away with it.  I hope that the Minister, <Col N="1592" /> in his wisdom, will impress on the Land Commission that they should have a redivision of this particular holding.</P>

      <P>I agree that migration is necessary.  In examining the land problem in this country, no matter how many Fianna Fáil T.D.s were at the meeting in Emly and no matter how many parish priests were there, if they were there, to protest at a local agitation, that does not make the policy of migration wrong. If it has been right in the last 20 years to migrate people to Leix, Offaly, Meath, Westmeath and Dublin, then it is right to-day, and migration is just as applicable to the County Tipperary as it is to the County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Giles when he says, in effect, that the Land Commission cannot make a ditch.  They never could, and they have never learned anything about making a ditch.  It seems a small thing to them, but it is an essential boundary between one man's holding and another man's. Deputy Victory spoke of the sod fences. They take off a quantity of sods and heap them on top of one another and put a strand of wire on top of that. Two or three cattle come along and shove against that and knock it down. The ordinary farmer who is given the job of making a ditch makes a ditch which will remain for generations.  But the Land Commission geniuses know more than anyone else.  I have been <Col N="1593" /> protesting in this House for the last 15 years about the kind of ditches they have been making, but it is all in vain; they will go on taking the sods.  These alleged ditches are monuments to their inefficiency all over the midlands as well as the rest of the country.  However, we must make our protest against the kind of ditches they are making.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the Deputy about the way the houses are built by the Land Commission.  I think they should remember the motto, that the dear thing is the cheap thing in the end, and that they should give the contracts for the building of houses and out-offices to contractors of repute and not to the cheap contractor, the new man who starts out by employing unskilled labour and in the end does not complete the houses.  You have that occurring in Meath and Westmeath.  I wore my boots out going to the Land Commission protesting against the contractor employed on the Sheridan estate at Griffinstown near Kinnegad. The contractor there employed a lot of youngsters at scab wages whom he housed in a hut and provided with food.  Then when he had put up a number of houses he cleared out.  No one listened to me when I made representations in that matter.  There were contractors of repute all over the midlands who would have done the job efficiently and well if the Land Commission had paid any attention to the representations made to them.  That is only one example.</P>
    <P>On account of the number of officials transferred from the Land Commission to the Department of Supplies and other Departments the work of the Land Commission is slowed up.  In the meantime the sale of land is going on all over the country.  Recently a company has been registered for the purchase of farms all over the midlands.  I know of one farm of 450 acres which they acquired recently and I believe they have acquired a number of other farms.  I know that a north of Ireland crowd are purchasing farms in every second parish in Meath and Westmeath. During the last war a number of these hard-headed northerners came from County Down and bought up farms in the midlands.  At the end of the war they put up these farms for auction <Col N="1594" /> and doubled their money on them.  The people who bought these farms have never got out of the clutches of the banks since.</P>
    <P>When we were in opposition I remember asserting to the then Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Land Commission, Mr. Roddy, that under him the Land Commission were paying too much for land and making the annuity of the incoming occupants too high. Mr. Roddy produced a set of figures to prove that for a period of years they paid fairly level prices for land and were not influenced by the outside market prices; that they were influenced by the quality of the land and what the annuitants had to pay.  As I say, farms are now being bought up by this company and other people.  I know of one farm four or five miles from Mullingar which, in the month of January, was sold for £5,000 to a man in Kilcock.  Two months afterwards he put it up for auction and got £7,000 for it.  This speculation in the sale of land is going on, and I should like an assurance from the Minister that when the work of the Land Commission is resumed it will not be influenced in the purchase of land by the inflated prices which now obtain and will obtain when the war is over; that the level of prices will correspond to the level that obtained before the war and, consequently, that the annuity on the incoming tenant will be about the same as it is for annuitants at present.  That is an important matter for the Minister and the Land Commission to look into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles referred to the treatment accorded to the migrants in contrast with a man in County Meath who gets a farm.  He stated that the migrant has a house and out-offices built for him, a yard laid out for him, his tillage done free for him for a year, and that in addition he got a weekly sum for a certain period, and certain stock.  I am not against that.  That is the right and proper way to settle people on the land.  But the County Meath man should get the same treatment. If a man is moved from Bohermeen down to Oldcastle and given a farm there, he should get the same treatment as a migrant from another <Col N="1595" /> county.  A number of the migrants have not a word of Irish and yet they have all this done for them.  The Meath man, who is also an Irishman, should get the same treatment as the migrant from any other part of Ireland. Therefore I join in the plea made for him by Deputy Giles.</P>
    <P>When I spoke about the company which has been registered for the purchase of farms in the midlands I had in mind a farm for which they are negotiating at present.  That reminds me that there are a number of farms up and down the country belonging to people who were not really depending on farming.  They had incomes from England, Burma, and other places abroad and because the sources of their income have gone west they are now compelled to sell their farms.  In many cases, as the result of local agitation, the Land Commission at one time had these farms inspected, and when they saw the amount of labour given and the work done on these farms decided that it was not in the national interest to acquire and divide them.  Now new circumstances have arisen and these people are putting the farms on the market.  Where that happens, the Land Commission, if there is any staff available, should step in and acquire these farms and divide them.  In the case I have in mind the result of the sale will be that 25 workmen will be knocked out of employment. These men have the grass of a cow and a calf, meadowland and turbary, and all that will go by the board and 25 heads of families will be put out of work.  The incoming firm which gets this farm employs nobody but a herd, and it is a case&mdash;I am sure there are several similar cases&mdash;where the Land Commission should intervene.  They should concentrate whatever staff they have on those cases where big farms are on the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice I had occasion to refer to the question of land annuities in County Wicklow.  The Minister made the point that the amount of arrears outstanding in that county was much greater <Col N="1596" /> than in other counties.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Lands when he is replying what is the percentage of collectable rents outstanding in County Wicklow, and how that percentage compares with other counties. From the information I have, I do not think that the amount outstanding in County Wicklow is substantially higher than in other counties.  We have to take into account the fact that Wicklow is for the most part a county of mountains.  It is a county which, by reason of the mountainous nature of the land, was exceptionally hard hit by the economic war.  The people are engaged for the most part in the rearing of store cattle and sheep, and those two industries were very adversely affected.  In 1933 there was another calamity.  A large amount of the herds and the sheep in the county were wiped out in the snow-storm of that year.</P>
      <P>Taking all those circumstances into account I think the Minister would not be justified in taking any more drastic action in dealing with County Wicklow than with any other county. I have had brought to my notice cases which were sent to the sheriff by the Land Commission, where the amounts of £6 or £7 involved were not six months overdue.  In cases like that it cannot be contended that there was any very serious default or any attempt to evade payment, particularly when we have regard to the fact that last year the sales of cattle were held up because of the foot-and-mouth epidemic.  I think the Minister should look into those cases and see if I am correct in stating that there are no excessive amounts of arrears, generally speaking, in County Wicklow as compared with any other county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is to be deplored that the division of land has been suspended during this period of emergency.  Whatever circumstances may have moved the Minister to suspend the division of land, I think he should reconsider that decision, taking into account the number of people who are unemployed, the amount of unrest which prevails generally, not only in this country but outside it, and the need for settling a larger, and still larger, <Col N="1597" /> number of our population on the land. When we consider the situation which may develop after the war, when numbers of people may be forced to return to this country from Great Britain; when numbers of young men may be disbanded from the National Army, and when there will be numbers of people unemployed in industry, surely we must realise that it would be prudent for us now to inaugurate an intensive policy of land division.  I would ask the Minister, now that there is a full in the division of land, to investigate all the circumstances in regard to land division over the last 20 years, and to find out to what extent the policy of land division may not have been well-advised. Having thoroughly investigated the whole matter, and having consulted with independent advisers representative of every Party and of every viewpoint, he should immediately inaugurate a widespread and far-reaching measure of land division.</P>
    <P>This question of the most suitable and most economic size of land holdings is one which has come up for discussion almost every year on this Estimate. I do not know exactly what principle guides the Department of Lands in deciding upon the size of holdings. I presume their idea is to allot a sufficient amount of land to provide for the maintenance of one family.  I do not think that should be the main consideration.  I think the aim of the Department of Lands should be to establish the most economic holdings that can be provided.  The question of what is the most economic holding requires a good deal of consideration, and I think that any practical farmer will advise the Minister that an economic holding is not merely one which will provide for the maintenance of one family.  An economic holding is one which will enable the farmer to keep the minimum amount of stock and implements necessary to enable him to work that holding to the best advantage. You cannot plough without a pair of horses, and you cannot keep a pair of horses on the type of holding that is parcelled out by the Land Commission. I think the fundamental object of the Land Commission should be to establish holdings which will enable the farmer to keep a pair of horses <Col N="1598" /> and all the equipment and implements necessary for the efficient working of that holding.  Such a holding would, I believe, not only provide maintenance for one family but for two, or at any rate, it would provide employment for an agricultural labourer in addition to the owner of the holding.  That would be a much better type of holding for the country in general, and for every section of the community.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on that matter.  Such a holding, as some Deputies have suggested, should consist, I think, of about 30 Irish acres of fair land.  At the present time, this question is receiving a good deal of attention.  We have the armchair agriculturists and economists telling us that we ought to merge all our farms into big collective farms, and that those would be more economically worked with tractors or other mechanical power.  I do not agree with that view. I think that the type of farm that would give the best results to the farmer, the worker and the nation is the type of farm I have indicated&mdash;a farm which will provide maintenance and employment for the farmer and his family, and, in addition, constant employment for an agricultural labourer.  That type of farm would be better for the nation and would ensure a more equitable distribution of the land than would the collective or communistic farms which are being advocated by our economists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing on which I agree with Deputy Cogan.  I think it would be wise if, in the light of experience, and possibly also, so far as that is feasible, in the light of the problems that we will have to face, there was a thorough investigation into the question of land division.  But, unlike Deputy Cogan, I have not the answer ready to hand before the investigation has started, because I gathered that, having invited the Land Commission to make a thorough investigation as to whether the practice was a good practice, he immediately proceeded to announce that there should be a more thorough system of land division.  I got the impression on a previous occasion, in discussing some aspects of this Vote, that apparently the Land Commission <Col N="1599" /> went on the line that its business was to acquire and divide farms&mdash;it was a definite Department of Government, and that was one of the jobs imposed upon it by the Legislature, and it was doing that job.  As to what effect that would have on the agricultural position of the country as a whole, that was not the job of the Land Commission and, therefore, they were not bound to take that consideration into account, and they did not.</P>
      <P>I cannot take the quite optimistic outlook that Deputy Cogan takes that the small farm of 30 acres will be economic in the future, and furthermore, that some kind of closer co-operation between neighbouring farms of 30 acres may not be forced upon them, whether they like it or not, by the very conditions that may prevail after the war.  I think there is a case to be made, now that there is, so to speak, a pause in this particular work, for the investigation of this problem, not from the point of view of any individual or set of individuals, but of the country and the agricultural prosperity of the country.  It is, I think, rather doubtful policy, when you consider, not the interests of a few individuals who might benefit or not, as the case may be, according to their capacity, but of the general agricultural outlook.  For a number of years past I did get the impression that two Departments of Government&mdash;which is not rare amongst Departments of Government&mdash;were more or less holding each other at arm's length and that the Land Commission went on without any general consideration of the effect on agricultural development of the policy it was pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no good in our burking the fact that, whatever be the result of the present war&mdash;nobody would be rash enough to foretell that &mdash;there will be a big change.  It will affect every walk in life.  There are men who describe themselves as being traditionally out and out capitalists in matters which, up to the present, they would have regarded as matters strictly for purely new enterprise; yet I see men like that, in a neighbouring country, realising that that system in all its completeness would have to go. <Col N="1600" /> They do not want Communism, or anything like it: in fact, they want to avoid that, but the only way it seems that they can avoid it is by meeting the situation that arises.  Whether we like it or not, we must face that.  As I am speaking on this question of land division and Deputy Cogan's remarks &mdash;which I confess I find it difficult to weld into anything like a consistent whole; it was his remarks that brought me on to this question at all&mdash;I would like to know whether there is really a pause as a matter of policy or whether it is all due to the explanations the Minister set out in his opening statement&mdash;lack of building materials and lack of officials&mdash;or whether the Government wishes to slow down the pace while they are thinking over the matter.</P>
    <P>There are other matters to which I should like to call the attention of the House.  There are some Votes of which I cannot help thinking as anything but token Votes.  There is a Vote of £500 for the maintenance of embankments. There is a rather mock Vote for £100 for carrying out the provisions of Section 37 of the Act of 1933, that is, where there is to be an abatement of the land annuity if there is permanent flooding.  The very fact that one sees very much the same kind of figure year after year raises the suspicion that not much work is going to be done in either of those directions.  We have Ministers quite properly going through the country impressing on the people the necessity for more production.  I presume they mean production from the land.  If you approach any of the Government Departments whose business it is to deal with the question of putting certain land in a cultivable state, you are told that is not their business, that it is the business of another Department.  You go to the Land Commission and they tell you calmly that the question of arterial drainage is a matter for the Board of Works, and that they have no responsibility. You go to the Board of Works and they admit they have not been able to do anything in the matter, last year or the year before that, or the year before that, or next year or the year after, or the year after that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> One Government Department sends you to the other Government Department, but the result is that, as every Deputy knows, nothing is done.  There is no money in the Land Commission to do it, and the Board of Works cannot do anything because they have not the necessary legislation to allow them to carry it out.  Instead of being reclaimed, the land gets worse, with more and more flooding year after year.  If you approach the Land Commission, you are liable to be told even that the breaking down of the banks of the rivers really means that much less land is being flooded.  Being people of a simple form of mind, we receive that statement with surprise, but we must not think of questioning it.  At a time when Ministers are impressing on everybody the necessity for more production, the two Departments concerned are able to do very little.  I do not know what use is made of Section 37.  Apparently a certain number of cases have been dealt with, but considering the few cases that were dealt with and considering the Vote of £100 which is down for that purpose this year, I would say that they are not taking the section seriously.  It was a good thing to have it in the Bill when the Bill was going through.  It shows a good intention on the part of the Government, but I would much prefer to see it carried out extensively.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by the Minister to the way in which the Department has been depleted.  That is another reason why work which I hold as urgent work cannot be done by the Land Commission.  I gathered from his statement that, in the emergency, members of the Land Commission have been taken from the work of the Land Commission and loaned to other Departments, as if the protection of land, the inspection of bridges and the inspection of flooding&mdash;and therefore the operation of Section 37&mdash;were not at all a portion of their work.  They could not do it, and who could blame them?  Every Department has come in and stolen, so to speak, the Minister's helpers.  There is reference to that in his statement.  For that reason, he says that the work of the Land Commission <Col N="1602" /> cannot be done as it would be done normally.  Most of us have to complain that it is over-normal, that it is outdoing itself in many respects, as a result of the depletion of its staff.  It was never so normal as it is now.</P>
    <P>These are the principal matters I wanted to raise.  The Board of Works and the Government as a whole are to blame because they do not give serious attention to the constant deterioration of the land, as a result of bridges and banks of arterial schemes being broken, and its being nobody's business to repair them.  Nothing can be done; the Land Commission cannot do it: it was not their responsibility; the Board of Works cannot do it, because they are thinking of a much bigger plan.  Meanwhile, between the two Departments the banks get worse and the cost of the repair work mounts year after year, notwithstanding pious statements that we hear from Government Departments that, after all, there is less flooding now as a result, apparently, of the breaking down of the banks and of the greater damage done.  The Land Commission do nothing.  In other countries in Europe, they are not hesitating to undertake the reclamation of land, and they think it is a good proposition; yet here is a country which, more than any other in Europe, is predominantly agricultural, determined not to do anything in that way.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, when dealing with Deputy Cogan's speech, we must undoubtedly face very new problems after the war, and we are deliberately allowing our principal machinery&mdash;the land&mdash;to fall into disrepair. It is, so to speak, our principal factory, and what improvement has been made?  The emergency which should urge us on to more determined efforts to deal with that situation is used as the excuse for doing nothing. I think that is regrettable, and that it shows a lack of proper responsibility on the part of those concerned. With work of that kind to be done, the Minister should have put it before the Government as work that, in the national interest, could not be neglected, and if inspection was necessary it should be done and men should <Col N="1603" /> not be taken from the Land Commission&mdash;as the Minister implies they were&mdash;to be put on to other work. Remember, as I said, the farms are our factories.  That is not a phrase of my own coining: it was used in other agricultural countries.  We are allowing those factories, so far as the Government is concerned, to go to rack and ruin, and we are making no effort to prevent the damage being done year after year or to see that that damage is not progressively increased, which is really what is happening. The Minister can say that that is the business of the Board of Works, but that is small comfort to those who are looking to the future.</P>
    <P>More than once I have made a suggestion that there should be better co-operation between the different Departments in Government.  Sometimes there is pursued in one Department a policy that runs counter to the policy produced by another Department. I remember that, some years ago, we were discussing the question of turf; and at the time one Department was putting money into turf and starting an intense propaganda for its use, another Department was overseeing the building of cottages by local authorities; and whilst the turf Department said there was a range that could burn turf, the other allowed ranges to be put in which were quite incapable of doing that.  That habit prevails in every Department.  Each Department stands autonomous, though I admit there is a kind of loose connection between them.  They are like a Confederation of States, and have to discuss, almost diplomatically, their relations with one another.  Then, over and above all, there is the Department of Finance, and you can blame them for everything that is happening.  I suggest it is time that the Department attended to these important matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's reply regarding land division and the size of holdings.  I have in mind three estates which were divided, where 17 or 18 men have got holdings of about 40 acres of very good land.  The rents were very high, but they made a success of them.  They <Col N="1604" /> maintained the farmer and his family in reasonable comfort.  I have in mind other estates which were divided and where men were given as low as 25 and 30 acres, and I have seen these men making a wonderful effort to survive and work successfully on their holdings, but, because of the small size of the holdings, they were unable to make a success of them.  Very often I have seen those holdings let in grazing to large farmers.  I often felt sorry for those hard-working men who have taken over those small holdings and have been pressed down because of economic conditions and unable to survive the difficulties which confronted them, particularly the question of meeting the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cogan said, we know that the men need horses to plough the farm, and other things as well, and the difficulty was their borrowing money and being unable to pay it back.  I have seen those holdings carried on and worked mainly by the bigger farmers in the locality.  In Wales the British Government has adopted settlements, and the Minister might tell us his view on the question of dividing estates of the kind Deputy Kennedy was referring to, where a number of men had the grazing of a cow and calf and were able to carry on.  I have in mind one estate of 666 acres.  Instead of giving these 20 people farms of 30 acres, the estate was divided between 15 persons, each of whom got about 40 acres.  In my opinion, it is impossible for 20 or 25 people to rear families on holdings of 30 acres.  What should be done is to put 15 or 20 houses on an estate and have some system of co-operative farming so that these families could maintain themselves.  I have in mind such a place in Wales upon which the British Government experimented in that way some years ago.  I do not agree with the idea of the communistic system.  Each family on these Welsh estates was established on a holding and worked it in a co-operative way.  A manager was employed and some 33 families had a recognised income, but a separate identity.  How many persons who got holdings of 25 or 30 acres have been failures?  I heard of people who should never have got land and who were not worthy to <Col N="1605" /> get it.  I am inclined to agree that the holdings given were too small to enable the tenants to stand up to economic conditions.  On the other hand, I know of men who got good land in County Cork and were successful.  They survived because they got 40 acres.  Men who were equally industrious but who only got 30 acres were not successful because the holdings were not economic. I should like to have from the Minister a survey of the results of the division of land.  The rent fixed on many of these holdings was too high for industrious people to survive.  I do not know if, when purchasing land, the Land Commission bears in mind that a family has to be reared out of the 35 acres, although the charges amount to 35/- or 40/- an acre.  I think it is impossible to do that.  I heard Deputy Kennedy stating that people were about to be dispossessed in his constituency and that land was about to be taken over by individuals who had no particular interest in the district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I must agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that the Land Commission was the wrong place from which to take staffs for other Departments. I am opposed to having too many officials but, when men are taken out of a particular Department for a number of years, that does not improve the position.  I know that the Land Commission did their job very well in my constituency last year. They tilled practically 75 per cent. of the land in their possession and took crops off it.  The same land is being tilled this year and, probably, it will be the same next year, but they are taking crops off that land without putting any manure on it.  I am wondering what kind of land that will be when the time comes to divide it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean land in the hands of the Land Commission that was taken over for division before the war began. They had not officials there with the necessary vision.  I could understand crops being taken off the first year, but <Col N="1606" /> I certainly object to crops being taken off for three or four years and then having the land handed over to some person to make a living out of it.  That could not be done.  There is an old problem in my constituency&mdash;the scandal was perpetuated by the Land Commission last year&mdash;in reference to an estate that was up for division for almost 14 years.  That was the Flower Estate, containing about 400 acres. Whatever kind of influence was put up, small farmers, living on the hillsides, whose predecessors had been evicted, received no notification that the land was to be dealt with and only 40 acres were divided amongst them.  Nine days after that, an advertisement appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> offering 380 acres for grazing on the 11 months system. I do not know what influence was used. I cannot believe all the yarns that I hear about the influence, and I cannot believe that the same influence that held sway still exists.  I sent the cutting from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> to the Minister.  It indicated that the 380 acres were to be let for grazing.  That is not fair.</P>
      <P>In 21 parishes in that area, there are about ten land-holders, all of whom, it may be said, were planted there. There are sums of £400, £500 and £600 due for rates to Cork County Council out of some of these estates.  Still no steps are being taken by the Land Commission to acquire and divide them.  Eventually, if the Land Commission takes them over, the county council will only get two years' arrears of rates.  In the case of the Rostellan estate about £780 was due to the county council.  That estate is now being worked on the same system of conacre year after year, everything being taken out of the land, and it will be useless.  Nobody can tell me that, on a farm on which crops are raised year after year, wheat and oats will be of any use afterwards, seeing that no manure is put into it.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported.</P>
