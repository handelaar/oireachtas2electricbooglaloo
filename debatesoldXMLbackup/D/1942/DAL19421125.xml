      <P>As I have indicated on a previous occasion, I cannot undertake to answer questions relating to the administration of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann which is an independent company operating under the Companies Acts, the board of the company being responsible for all decisions in regard to the management of the undertaking.  I have, however, made inquiries regarding the matter raised in the Deputy's question, and I understand that the Thurles Sugar Factory is not at present in production, because the company have found it necessary to postpone for a short period the commencement of the campaign owing to the present low level of water in the River Suir which does not permit operations being carried out at the factory on an economic basis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the great dissatisfaction which exists in rural areas owing to the various rates of wages paid under Government relief schemes; and if he will take steps to see that rates of wages are standardised, <Col N="2326" /> and that the rate of wages paid will not be less than those operating under the county council road work schemes in each county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not aware that dissatisfaction exists in rural areas in the circumstances referred to by the Deputy.  Generally, the rate of wages paid on any employment scheme financed from the Employment Schemes Vote is the same as the rate paid for analogous work in the same district.  It is considered that this is the fairest basis on which to fix wage rates for employment schemes, and it is not proposed to change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that considerable hardship which may have serious results is being inflicted on people in the Garristown dispensary area due to the revocation of the motor permit granted to Mrs. Fanning.  But even if the facts were as suggested by the Deputy, I could not accept the suggestion that for this reason the permit should be restored, because a similar argument could be advanced in the case of very many other permit-holders, and acceptance of such argument would make it impossible to enforce the regulations about the use of motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> Mrs. Fanning's motor permit was revoked because the vehicle was used by a member of her family to carry workmen and parts of farm machinery on the 3rd September last.  I have specially considered this case, but cannot see my way to restore the permit and petrol allowance.</P>

      <P>It has been represented to me that the people of Rathcoole are finding difficulty in obtaining supplies of fuel.  I find that no merchant in Rathcoole holds a fuel merchant's licence, and that the parish council which arranged for the distribution of timber fuel last year has ceased to function.  I am prepared to grant a fuel merchant's licence for this district which would enable the holder to sell turf at a price not exceeding that fixed for turf outside the scheduled turf area.  No licence is required for the sale of timber fuel.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the British Railways Wages Board made on March 9th, 1942, an award granting an increment applicable to certain grades of the clerical and wages staffs of the Great Western Railway Company and of the L.M. &amp; S. Railway Company resident in Ireland; whether he received from the parties concerned an application for permission for the railway companies concerned to pay this increment to the railway workers in Ireland affected by the award; and, if so, the date on which he received such application; whether he will say if it is his intention to permit the payment to those workers of the increased remuneration awarded them; and, if so, what is the cause of the delay in granting the permission sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Railway Staff National Tribunal (Railways of Great Britain) made a decision on the 9th March, 1942, granting increments applicable to certain grades on the clerical and wages staffs of Great Western Railway Company and of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company.  On the 17th October, 1942, I received from the parties concerned a joint application for permission for the railway companies concerned to pay this increment to railway workers in Ireland.  Under the provisions of the Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order, as amended by the Third Amendment Order of the 26th August, 1942, the payment of the increases mentioned is not permissible <Col N="2330" /> in this country.  It is open to the parties to seek, by way of wages and bonus order applications under Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order, increases in the remuneration of the workers concerned.  I have asked the parties to submit applications for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that this is in operation in the Six Counties, where the cost of living is lower than here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the circumstances may be in Great Britain, or even in the Six Counties, they cannot affect our policy here, which must be based on our particular circumstances. That is the principle upon which the Government has been proceeding.  In so far as this application for increase in remuneration comes under Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order, I presume that the parties were aware that no invitation was necessary, and that they could have submitted their applications on their own behalf, without an invitation.  I have explained the position to them, and suggested that that particular method should be availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Wages Standstill Orders, No. 83 and No. 166, as amended, relate or are intended <Col N="2331" /> to relate only to bonus applications arising out of the cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the increment is not prohibited by Order No. 166, I have nothing to do with it.  I presume that the fact that the parties communicated with me on the matter is an indication that they believe that this is a type of increment that is prohibited by that Order, and that such increments can only be secured in accordance with the Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in the last resort the legal decision as to what is the exact significance of any piece of legislation is given by the courts, and not by the Minister or the Minister's legal advisers.  So far as my legal advisers are concerned, what they give me is an opinion, and it seems to me that in this particular case there is very little doubt as to the correctness of their opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he does not think that in a case of this particular type it means inducing outside employers to differentiate adversely against their employees in this country as compared with their <Col N="2332" /> employees in Northern Ireland or Great Britain?  Has he considered that aspect of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but the Deputy must not lose sight of the fact that the control now being exercised over remuneration is in relation to the emergency, and that it will operate only for the duration of the emergency. Quite obviously, the circumstances operating here during the emergency are entirely different from those prevailing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland where, in fact, the railway companies increased the remuneration of many classes of their employees for the express purpose of preventing these employees leaving their employment to work in munition factories, and elsewhere, where high rates of wages were temporarily prevailing.  In these areas there were special circumstances which resulted in the decisions that were made by the railway companies, but the circumstances here are entirely different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the quantitative aspect of this problem is a small one here, but that it may be very inadvisable that a policy should be induced in the case of outside employers by which they might differentiate adversely as regards the payments they make to their employees in this country as compared with the payments they make to their employees outside the country?</P>

The first scheme was approved on the 3rd September, 1938, and the second scheme on the 30th June, 1941.  Up to the 30th June last applications had been received from 176 tenants for the purchase of their cottages.</P>
      <P>Before vesting cottages in tenants the local authorities are required to place these cottages in good repair and sanitary condition.  This work has been in progress in Mayo for some time and it is understood the repairs will soon be completed.</P>
      <P>On the 28th ultimo the county council reported that, owing to the absence of records relating to cottage plots purchased prior to 1918, there had been delay in vesting the cottages owing to difficulties in connection with the registration of the title of the local authority to cottage plots.  It is understood that there are only a few such cases now outstanding.  I may say that the difficulties as to title encountered in this instance are commonly met with owing to the destruction of general and local records.</P>

    <P>Ten officers, 28 non-commissioned <Col N="2339" /> officers and 97 men discharged on medical grounds since the 1st September, 1939, received pensions or gratuities. The records dealing with the payment of pensions or gratuities do not indicate to what category of the Defence Forces the men concerned belonged, and the desired segregation could not be furnished without some delay.</P>
    <P>In regard to the number discharged who received no payment by way of pension, gratuity or bonus, I desire again to mention what I have already stated in the House, namely, that it is proposed to introduce legislation to amend the Army Pensions Acts.  This amendment will extend the provisions of the Acts to men discharged medically unfit where disability, although not due to a wound or injury (as at present required by the Acts) was attributable to Army service.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the 6,452 men who have been discharged from the Defence Forces without gratuity or bonus of any kind constitute 98 per cent. of the total who have been discharged as a result of ill-health and, as it is probably correct that a large percentage of that number cannot prove that their ill-health is attributable to Army service, will the Minister say whether he will set up some kind of machinery of liaison that would connect these men with the ordinary medical services of the country of a relief kind or with other relief services, so that they will not be discharged from the Army, incapacitated by ill-health, and left to make their own contacts in whatever way they can with the relief services, medical or otherwise, in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course very large numbers of the men who are discharged as being medically unfit are suffering merely from very minor ailments such as sore feet or tender feet, or something of that kind, and, in the natural way, they would not be retained in the Army and they would have no call upon a pension or gratuity of the kind I am dealing with under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate <Col N="2340" /> that, but when a man is discharged from the Army on the grounds of ill-health, even though he may be incapacitated only in a slight way, he finds it almost impossible to get back into his ordinary employment although he may be physically fit for it.  Therefore, as well as putting them into touch with relief services, where necessary, some kind of Army liaison is necessary in order to shepherd them back to their normal employment where an assurance is required from the Army authorities that their incapacity is not such as to involve danger if they return to their ordinary employment.</P>

I understood also that the Minister agreed that that application would be made on a form which would embody the application on the one hand and the report on the other so as to systematise both the application for and the passing on of the information.

    <P>The object of the amendment is to meet a situation where differences of opinion might arise between teachers, as to the exchange of information, involving correspondence and argument. I am suggesting it should be made a kind of statutory matter that when, on the prescribed form application is made to the former teacher for information, such information should be furnished inside a week.  I would like to know from the Minister, following the suggestion that was made here the last day, whether the form conveying the information will be franked so as to obviate the necessity for paying postage on it when it is being transmitted through the Post Office in an outward or inward direction.</P>

      <P>This amendment, with amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15, meets an amendment that was put down by Deputy Mulcahy on Committee Stage.  The exceptions to it are set out in amendment No. 13.  These are: The exercise of manual labour by a child lawfully detained in a certified industrial or reformatory school; the receipt by a child of instruction in manual labour in any school; the employment of a child by a relative, if such employment does not prevent or interfere with the attendance of the child at school or the obtaining by the child of proper benefit from such attendance.  The word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; is defined.  In addition to the degree of blood relationship, it specifies that the child must, of course, live in the relative's dwelling-house, if it is to be excepted from this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained to the House on the Second Reading that it is extremely difficult to deal with the matter of the employment of children by parents. Perhaps I did not emphasise sufficiently, when dealing with this question, that we may be faced with the position of having on adjoining farms children in the one case working for their parents, who will not be covered if my amendment is accepted, and, on the next farm, children working for gain.  There was such a strong feeling, however, that we ought to prevent the actual employment of children for gain that I feel it is a matter which will have to be decided sometime, but, as I said on the last amendment, there is always the question whether it is <Col N="2345" /> good to put things down in black and white in the law of the land if there are going to be wide opportunities for evasion, and if, in fact, it is not going to be possible to ensure absolute compliance with such conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage I urged that it was placing an unnecessary burden <Col N="2347" /> on a teacher, on the one hand, and placing unnecessary documents before the school attendance committee on the other, to oblige a teacher to submit particulars of every child who was absent from school on any day no matter what the reason was.  My amendment is intended to provide that, where a child is absent through illness, or for any other reason which the principal teacher is satisfied is a good and legitimate explanation of his absence, the teacher will not have to be troubled by reporting that case to the school attendance committee, and the school attendance committee will not have the information in which it is really interested&mdash;that is information about children who are absent from school without adequate explanation&mdash; smothered under and smathered over by information that they do not want at all, that is information about children who are absent through illness or who have a good and adequate reason, in the principal teacher's judgment, for their absence.</P>

      <P>As I explained on the last stage, I think it would be invidious to put this duty upon the teacher.  The teacher has certain functions to fulfil <i>vis-a-vis</i> the children, and, if he is called upon to take the place of the court and determine whether or not a child is absent through a reasonable cause, I am afraid we are going to have serious difficulties.  Perhaps the whole scheme of the administration of the School Attendance Act may be affected.  I see what the Deputy has in mind; I indicated already that I have sympathy with his view, but nevertheless I do not find myself in a position to accept the amendment.  I think the House will recognise that parents would find that the teachers, for reasons which they considered satisfactory, were compelled to discriminate between one child and another, saying that one child was absent for a good and satisfactory reason and another child was not, and I think perhaps the teachers would not welcome that.  In any case, I would ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, before Section 18, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever it appears to a body (being a school attendance committee or a rotatory sub-committee) from the report of a school attendance officer that a parent has failed or neglected to cause his child (being a child to which the Principal Act applies) to attend school in accordance with the Principal Act or this Act, that body may serve on the parent a notice requiring him to attend before such body at a specified time (not being earlier than seven days after the date of such service) and place and then and there to show cause why proceedings should not be instituted against him in respect of such failure or neglect.</P>
      <P>(2)  If any person upon whom a notice has been served under sub-section (1) of this section fails to attend in compliance with the notice, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really to fulfil an undertaking which I gave to accept in principle Deputy Mulcahy's amendment on the Committee Stage.  The first portion of the amendment provides that a school attendance committee or a sub-committee of that body may, on a report from the school attendance officer, order a parent to appear before them to show cause why proceedings should not be instituted against him in respect of his failure or neglect to send his child to school.  The warning notice in the Principal Act goes out.  I explained to the House that it takes up a considerable amount of time, and that one of the objects of the measure is to speed up proceedings against <Col N="2349" /> parents who are clearly neglecting their duty to their children.</P>
    <P>This first paragraph, therefore, is, as it were, a substitute for the warning notice.  It puts it beyond question that the committee has legal power to enforce attendance before them of parents who are not carrying out their duties.  With regard to the second portion of the amendment, I am advised that it is necessary that some penalty should accompany this first paragraph.  Therefore, I am proposing that parents who fail to attend when served with notice by the school attendance committee shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 10/-.  That would mean that if the school attendance committee decides to prosecute a parent, it may charge him, first, with the absence of his child or children from school, and, secondly, with having aggravated the offence by failing to appear before the committee when summoned to do so.  It would then be a matter for the court whether a fine should or should not be imposed. I am advised that a legal sanction of this kind is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has been able to accept the suggestion that forms the body of this amendment.  I indicated, when he was speaking about it on the Committee Stage, that I did not like the second part of my amendment, which dealt with the penalty for an offence; but I think it is quite sound to arrive at the conclusion that you cannot get away from a penalty of some kind.  It will be interesting to see to what extent the school attendance committees bring themselves to avail of this new power. I think if they do, it might solve a lot of their difficulties and bring about a better spirit on the part of parents who are difficult at the present time.  I think a difficult parent has a better chance of being brought to reason by a discussion with a school attendance committee than by being brought into the atmosphere of a court.  I would like to be sure, however, that the putting in of this amendment in this way does not impose a duty on the school attendance committee in every <Col N="2350" /> case to get a parent to appear before them, before they take proceedings, because I think it might be a matter of difficulty to put the school attendance committee into that position.  I take it that they will have the same power of proceeding, after due notice, to take a parent to the court, without bringing that parent before them.</P>

      <P>I hope it will not be taken that there is any compulsion whatever on the school attendance committee to bring parents before them.  The warning notice clause in the original Act goes by the board.  If the committee wish, they can prosecute the parents straight away, or the Gárda Síochána, as the case may be, may act similarly.  But it gives the committee the opportunity of bringing parents before them, as a way out, as an alternative to the taking of proceedings immediately they receive the report from the school attendance officers.  We are not compelling the committee to bring parents before them.  If they are dealing with recalcitrant parents, who have already been in trouble over the absence of their children from school, and who are clearly neglectful, I hope the committee and the Gárda Síochána will realise that every possible step ought to be taken to bring them before the courts as speedily as possible.  The object of the legislation is to ensure speed.  I hope all concerned will take notice and that greater efforts will be made to bring defaulters before the courts, and I hope the courts will deal with them as they deserve.</P>

    <P>(b)  at any time on any Sunday or on Christmas Day, Good Friday, or Saint Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, we came to a compromise with regard to weekdays. I was anxious to leave things as they were, but, in view of the pressure from all sides of the House, I agreed to compromise.  I thought that that was accepted, but I find that there is an amendment down to have a 10 o'clock closing hour in the county boroughs. According to the agreement, I put down 10.30 o'clock.  I understood that there was no objection to 10.30 in the morning.  I thought that was agreed to, but apparently it is not.  As regards Sunday, I have arranged in the case of the county boroughs other than Dublin for an opening from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock and 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock. I made the inquiries that I said I <Col N="2354" /> would make about the opening hours on Sunday in Dublin.  So far as I could gather, anything earlier than 2 o'clock would not meet the objections raised. A one-hour break on Sunday was scarcely sufficient.  It is suitable, I understand, on weekdays, because there is not very much business done up to the closing time on those days, but it is anticipated that for the hour on Sunday there would be rather a rush, and it would probably be a quarter of an hour after the closing hour before assistants could get out and the proprietor have the place ready to start again.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that one and a half hours are necessary, and that means knocking off half an hour from the time originally proposed, giving a three and a half hours' opening instead of four hours.  The times now suggested are from 2 to 3, and from 4.30 to 7 o'clock.  I, personally, would have preferred to have the time uniform in all the county boroughs, but as there was a special problem to be dealt with in Dublin, I have made a distinction in the case of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be general acceptance of the Minister's amendment, and so far as I am personally concerned I do not see the slightest objection to letting the half-hour go in the morning.  The Minister says he wants to have a uniform time, and that is quite reasonable.  I do not think that in the rural areas, with the provision which exists in respect of exemption orders for fairs and markets, anybody bothers about whether the opening is 10 o'clock or 10.30 in the morning.  So far as the county boroughs outside Dublin are concerned, the Minister has accepted the suggestion made on the first Committee Stage and has adopted the hours we suggested in respect of which we intended to put amendments down. There was a misunderstanding on that point, but the Minister has met us very fairly on it.</P>

    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to one matter in order to show how things may be misinterpreted.  When the Minister circulated this amendment, the first thing which struck <Col N="2355" /> many Deputies was paragraph (b) which refers to &ldquo;any time on Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday or St. Patrick's Day&rdquo;.  There was a wave of indignation through the country for the past few days because people felt that the Minister was closing public houses completely on Sundays.  The paragraph gave that impression, and for the last two days most Deputies in the country have been bombarded by people who seemed to think that this amendment meant that there would not be even a <i>bona fide</i> traffic on Sundays.  Of course it does not mean that, and I make the point merely to show that Sunday in the country is not affected by the amendment at all, as the Minister may not be aware that that construction was put on his amendment.</P>
    <P>On the first Committee Stage, a case apparently was made in regard to a particular situation in Waterford and Limerick in relation to the split hours, and I understand that an amendment dealing with that situation was to be moved.  I do not know whether the Minister proposes to do anything about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting any amendments to do away with the split hours, but I am allowing a continuation of the <i>status quo</i> in which <i>bona fide</i> traffic can be carried on during the hour.  The deputation which met me asked me to see that that was done, and I have arranged for it, but I do not propose to agree to abolish the split hours provision because I think it very necessary.</P>

      <P>We are perfectly willing to accept the Minister's amendment so far as the position in this city is concerned and I think it meets very fairly all the points we made on the first Committee Stage.  I am quite satisfied, even though the Minister felt that he was on a slippery slope, that he has succeeded in making a very forcible approach to what I think is a very much better licensing Bill than the original, for the reason that nothing will ever convince me that more and more restrictions will improve the situation, but when you <Col N="2356" /> have a reasonable job done, you can enforce what you have.  The Minister, I am sure, will have the support of everybody, now that certain concessions have been granted, in seeing that the licensing laws are carried out.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister does not propose to interfere with <i>bona fide</i> trade in the country on Sundays under this amendment.  Many people in the country were under the impression that the amendment affected that trade.  I am sorry, however, that the Minister could not see his way to allow some few hours of opening on Sundays in country districts. It would be much better and the law would be observed more fully if hours of trading on Sundays were granted to the people in the country as well as in the cities.</P>

I thought the Minister's forward movement a very good thing and I am very much surprised, in view of the general agreement in the House on the last occasion&mdash;and I think the Minister must have been completely surprised&mdash; that anybody should now ask the Minister to go back to the position from which he so wisely went away. I have at the back of my mind the idea that the reason behind this amendment has something to do with a situation with which this House should not concern itself at all.  So far as I can gather, the reason for the amendment has to do with the question of assistants and licensed traders, and I submit with all respect that if the Ministerial hours will give rise to an awkward situation as between the licensed traders and their assistants, that is a domestic matter for the licensed trade to get over, and not one for this House.  So far as I am concerned and, I am sure, so far as the other members of this Party are concerned, we will oppose any attempt to force back the hours which the Minister has given.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment, as I have already explained to the Minister, is to exempt <Col N="2358" /> the southern cities from this closing hour in the middle of the day.  It may serve some useful purpose in the City of Dublin&mdash;I am not going to argue whether it does or not&mdash;but it is senseless in a place like Limerick.  Limerick is really an over-grown provincial town, which is dependent on the hinterland from which the people come with horses and traps to do their marketing.  They park their horses and traps in the livery yard behind the public house, and particularly a public house which belongs to a friend or relation, and do their shopping, sending their goods back to the public house.  When they come back to the public house, they find a queue of messenger boys waiting for the end of the split-hour period.  There is no useful purpose that we can see served by it. It is an unnecessary and vexatious intrusion. I think I mentioned on the last occasion that a particular anomaly arises in this connection and the Minister agreed to look into it.  I pointed out that if a man went into the public house during that particular period on a <i>bona fide</i> basis, he could buy drink and nothing else as a <i>bona fide</i> traveller, and that it would be an offence for him to buy a sack of flour or any other goods.  I hope the Minister has looked into the point.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that there would not be a prosecution for buying foodstuffs.  I ask the Minister favourably to consider the proposal regarding the hours in places outside Dublin.  The 1927 Act was specifically related to Dublin.  The present position has created what amounts to a growing nuisance, and I ask the Minister to take advantage of the alteration to bring this Bill more into conformity with common sense, and to make it easier for the Civic Guards to discharge their duties.  We do not respect the present position in Limerick.  It is not thought to be any breach of the law to disrespect it.  No evil is likely to arise from the change, while business will be facilitated.  There cannot be <Col N="2359" /> any consequences in the way of intemperance.</P>

Is the Labour Party serious about it for the County Borough of Cork and the County Borough of Dublin, in going back on the half-hour that the Minister gave?  That appears to be the real point.  The Minister gave until 10.30 at night, and now do Deputies want to go back to 10 o'clock?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The hours of closing on ordinary week nights are 10 p.m., and on Saturdays, 9.30 p.m.  The point I want to make is that the only demand for the later hour, which the Minister has seen fit to incorporate, was made by the licensed trade.  That demand is based on the fact that they have to compete with theatres and clubs, which are able to keep open longer, under existing circumstances, than they can, and at the best hours.  That change has been made at the expense of the workers in licensed premises.  I suggest to the Minister that the proper way to deal with the difficulty is by having uniform hours for clubs, theatres and licensed premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill as amended it would extend the closing period to 10.30 p.m., but the Minister is meeting that by a later opening hour in the morning.  The assistants have a point of view there which is of some importance.  The half hour they work extra at night is not going to be compensated for by giving them half an hour in the morning.  From their point of view they would much prefer if the existing opening hour would continue, even though the licensed premises might remain open until 10.30. at night, because the additional half hour they work if aggregated over a week, could be utilised to confer on the assistants a period of relief from duty to compensate them in some measure for the fact that they worked from 10 a.m. to 10.30 p.m.  There is no particular advantage in keeping the houses closed until 10.30 in the morning if the assistants have to work until 10.30 at night.  They would prefer to be allowed to aggregate the additional half hour over the week, and then be <Col N="2361" /> allowed to get some substantial advantage for working the extra half hour than by going on duty half an hour later in the morning.  Did the Minister consider that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  My attitude when I brought in the Bill was rather to have restrictions instead of giving concessions.  I was frank about that. The Dáil forced me to extend the hour. I am not going to be forced, if I can help it, by anyone to give extra time for drinking.  As far as I can avoid that I will.  I cut off half an hour.  I know plenty of people, even healthy people, who, if they spend a few hours out at night, do not mind lying on in the morning.  I have enough trouble. People come to me&mdash;not in this House &mdash;about that.  I was surprised at one case.  Deputy F. Lynch told me of people whose duty it was to look after our souls.  Even in the House some opinions have been expressed in that respect.  If I can help it I am not going to be responsible for increasing the hours permitted for drinking from 10.30 in the morning to 10.30 at night &mdash;12 hours.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keyes was not in the House when I was dealing with the position in Limerick.  I considered the position there, and I am surprised that Deputy Keyes has such a pessimistic view about Limerick.  I think Limerick is going to be a very big city in the near future.  It may not be a university city but, as far as I can see into the future, Limerick is not going to remain like a large provincial town. At any rate, these were the four <Col N="2362" /> county boroughs and the split hour was introduced to do away principally with the long sitter.  I am pretty certain there are plenty of them in Limerick, and in Cork too, as well as in Dublin. I did meet the point made by the deputation of traders from Limerick that people from the hinterland who were in the habit of coming in the middle of the day would be placed under a disadvantage by the proposal to close for an hour in the middle of the day. Under my proposal, anybody who comes from districts three miles beyond the city can still be treated as <i>bona fide</i> travellers and they can get goods, and drink if necessary, during that hour.  I have met them to that extent and I think that is quite satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3, which is an amendment to amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph (A) (b) (i) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) In the case of the County Borough of Dublin or in the Dublin Metropolitan area before the hour of two o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of six o'clock in the evening, and,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has its roots in the Committee Stage discussion, in the course of which we endeavoured to have the hours on Sundays in the county borough from 2 o'clock until 6 o'clock.  The Minister's proposal at that time was that the hours should be 1 to 2 and 4 to 7.  I made the case then that there were many objections to opening for one hour during the day on the ground that it was extremely difficult to induce people to leave licensed premises within an hour <Col N="2363" /> of the opening of the premises.  Many large licensed traders in Dublin have frankly confessed that where a public house opens at 1 o'clock and people come in, say, at 1.10 or 1.15, in groups of four or five, in order to close the premises at 2 o'clock it would be necessary to get these people moving at 1.40.  It has been represented to me that it would be a physical impossibility to get such licensed premises cleared at 2 o'clock.  I think if the Minister consults any of the large licensed traders in the city he will get confirmation of that view.  If the Gárda are to do their duty with the alacrity recommended by Deputy Dillon, I should imagine that it will not be long before a considerable number of licensed traders in the city are before the District Justice explaining why it was not possible for them to close their premises at 2 o'clock.  I think many of them would be able to put up the argument that it would be a physical impossibility to open their premises at 1 o'clock and have them cleared again by 2 o'clock.  I think the Minister is opening up the possibility that there will be widespread disregard of the licensing laws in the city in this respect.</P>
    <P>I suggested on the Committee Stage that it would be much better for the object which the Minister has in view if the hours were made from 2 to 6. That period is not too extensive.  It meets the demands of anybody who wants refreshments on Sundays and, at the same time, it would make bearable the conditions of assistants who have arduous hours of work and who are compelled to work when most other folk can enjoy themselves.  I thought the Minister would have seen fit to accept these hours, but instead he has put in an amendment which really worsens the position of the assistants. The Minister now proposes that the hours should be 2 to 3 and 4.30 to 7. There would be still, under this proposal, the objectionable split hour from the point of view of the assistants.  The proposal still perpetuates the difficulties which, I think, will arise as a result of the short opening period from 2 to 3.  It gives a total opening on <Col N="2364" /> Sunday of 3½ hours.  Again, from the point of view of the assistants it would have been much better if the Minister had a four-hour opening on Sunday.</P>

      <P>I am not personally concerned if every club in the country is closed down.  I am putting this matter from the point of view of the assistants.  Frankly, the purpose of my amendment is to get a period of opening which will suit the assistants.  I am not concerned with the interests of the traders; I am not putting a tooth in that at all. Deputy Cooney can look after the interests of other people if he likes. I am not concerned with the interests of the licensed trader, but with the interests of the assistants.  The Minister's proposal as it stood originally was really better than the amendment he has now put in because if the hours <Col N="2365" /> of opening on Sunday were four, the assistant, under the Conditions of Employment Act, would be entitled to compensation if he works for four hours on Sundays.  Now by making the period 3½ hours, the assistant will not get the compensatory time he would receive if the licensed premises were open for four hours.  Frankly, I would prefer the original proposition in the Bill&mdash;2 to 3 and 4 to 7&mdash;than 2 to 3 and 4.30 to 7, because the Minister's new proposal reduces the opening period from four hours to 3½ hours. That small reduction of half an hour deprives the assistant of some compensation which he would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister said that he wanted a longer meal interval for the assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and for the traders too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The assistants would much prefer to put up with the inconvenience of an interval of one hour for meals and have a four-hour opening than to get 1½ hours for meals and have only a 3½ hour opening.  All they would be doing would be sacrificing half an hour of the meal interval, and the advantages which they would get for a four-hour opening would more than compensate them for the sacrifices they made in that connection.  If the Minister's purpose in moving that the second period of opening should commence at 4.30 instead of 4, is to facilitate the assistants, I should be glad if he would look into the matter again and see if it is not possible to accept the hours 2 to 6.  At least he should not introduce a 3½-hour opening which is calculated to deny the assistants the bargaining power which they will get if there is a four-hour opening on Sunday. In any case, it seems to me that you have all the disadvantages of the short opening period of one hour, the broken day, and the long spread-over for the assistants.  Most reasonable people will agree that a 2-6 opening has many advantages over a 2-3 and 4-7 or a 2-3 and 4.30-7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2366" /> I understand that a meeting of the licensed trade in Dublin was held on Sunday last and that, out of approximately 155 people present, 83 voted for the new hours proposed in the Bill and 72 against them.  I understand there are approximately 500 licensed traders in Dublin, of whom 300 are members of the Licensed Traders' Association.  There is no terrific demand there for these proposed new opening hours.  If the Minister consults the trade, on the assistants' side and the employers' side, he will find probably that he is putting into this Bill provisions for which there is no great demand by the citizens, by the assistants or by the employers.  I would appeal to him to accept the amendment providing for a 2-6 opening in the City of Dublin.  If he cannot accept it, he should not deprive assistants of the bargaining position they would get by a four-hour opening on Sunday instead of a 3½-hour opening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I deeply deplore the fact that the Minister is interfering with the Sunday hours for the City of Dublin at all.  I say that 2-5 was quite sufficient for any man who wanted a drink.  Opposed to that, however, there were elements in the city who said that, on the occasion of big Gaelic and Soccer matches, when there was a crowd rushing to the stations, by the time they would leave the football field the licensed houses would be closed. If the Minister would agree with me to leave the hours 2-5 as they are, it would give the workers of the city an opportunity to leave the licensed house at 5 o'clock and go home to celebrate the Sunday cup of tea with the family. That is something we all would like to see.  Under the new proposal, while the Minister breaks the hour, to let them go home to lunch&mdash;better known as &ldquo;dinner&rdquo; amongst people in the city&mdash;he is encouraging them to go back and remain out of their homes for the tea hour.  I strongly object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The split hour also means an extra cleaning up.  People talk about the assistants and say they finish at certain hours, but the cleaning-up process takes at least a quarter of an hour or <Col N="2367" /> half an hour each time.  If they close at one on a Sunday, it will take a quarter of an hour to clean-up.  At least, in the old days, when I was in in the business, that was so, and I do not think there has been any change. I would not take second place to any man in the House regarding my knowledge as to how hard the assistants have to work.  The official hours are not the hours he has to work&mdash; generally he has to work an hour more. The hours 2-5 are sufficient for the City of Dublin.  I appeal to the Minister to accept that.  If that effort fails, perhaps he would agree to do the next best thing and make the hours 2-6. That would empty the house at 6 o'clock and let the men go home to tea. The Gaelic and Soccer football crowds would have an hour, from 5-6, to get refreshments before getting their trains home.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have some regard for the assistants and for the conditions under which they work, and for the licensed traders and their families, too.  I have been told by very many licensed traders that they do not want any alteration in the Sunday hours in Dublin.  They are glad to have their early evening off, just as much as the assistants.  The 7 o'clock hour would spoil the assistant's tea. He may want to go to the pictures or to a concert, or may wish to enjoy the open air.  This would spoil his whole evening.  Is it proper or right that we should talk always about this giving of extended hours for drinking, for a few who, as the Minister says, go out to the outskirts of the city on buses?  We should not be legislating for them at all, but should tell them to act as reasonable citizens, like the other 99 per cent., and stay at home, having had reasonably sufficient.  It should not be a holiday at all, to send them out on buses five or ten miles to enjoy the evening according to their lights.  It is not enjoyment.  In the City of Dublin and in the licensed houses on the outskirts, those people are considered a nuisance by the licensed traders.  The man who takes too much is a danger to the trade&mdash; both to the trader's profit and his business. <Col N="2368" /> We have been talking here a lot about the man who drinks to excess. The traders do not want that type and there should not be further encouragement to him.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to consider the assistants and to have regard to the fact they are human beings, who, like every other type of worker, want their Sunday evening off. If he cannot see his way to accept my view that the hours 2-5 are long enough, he should consider 2-6, so as to give the assistants an opportunity to bargain for additional time off on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I would strongly advise the Minister not to be taken away too much by Deputy Cooney's confidence.  In the first instance, the Minister's proposal was calculated to meet the objections of some licensed traders in the city who found themselves at a great disadvantage.  When the Minister realised the difficulties in that position he changed the hours, or indicated that he was prepared to accept a change in the hours, that would meet the objection of the G.A.A. We now find, in this amendment, a further change which, I think, the Minister was prompted to introduce in order to meet the difficulties of the <Col N="2369" /> assistants with regard to the very short interval for luncheon.  Deputy Norton has explained that, instead of conferring any benefit on the assistants by the changes the Minister proposes to make now&mdash;namely, to reduce the hours from four to three and a half&mdash; he is putting them at a disadvantage as, by taking away the half hour, he is also taking a half day a week off them.  I am sure that is very far from the Minister's intention.</P>
      <P>He would be well advised to drop the idea of splitting the hours on Sundays and revert to the position of granting the hours 2-6, which would meet the views of those in the trade and be best calculated to meet the requirements of the general public. Over and over again it has been emphasised that there is no demand on the part of the general public for a change in hours.  The Minister's efforts are calculated to please this person or that person, this body or that body, and he will find himself soon in a very difficult position.  To get out of the difficulty, he should adopt the hours 2-6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, it does not, but I want to ask Deputy Byrne: Is he in favour of closing down the houses of the licensed traders outside the city?  The Minister made one specific statement when he introduced this Bill&mdash;his original proposals <Col N="2370" /> were revolutionary, the complete abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, a complete close-down from 10 p.m. Thanks to the good sense of Deputies from all benches, the Minister changed his mind and allowed the <i>bona fide</i> traffic to be maintained up to midnight. That is why we have the proposal to close at 10.30 on week nights, and that is why we have the split-hour proposal in respect of Sundays.  That is very fair.  I have been in this House for a number of years.  I have been here when the Ministry of Justice was occupied by different persons, and no Minister in that Ministry ever faced up to a critical position, such as this Licensing Bill created, more honestly or more courageously than the present Minister did.  It is untrue to say that there is no demand for amending legislation in respect of hours.  It is in the interest of the community, as a whole, that there should be a one o'clock opening in the capital of this State.</P>

      <P>What is the position we are to have now?  The other three boroughs are to have precedence over the capital, with 500,000 of a population. The capital is to remain a sleepy valley until 2 o'clock on Sunday.  The other three boroughs are to open at 1 o'clock.  Although this is the Report Stage of the Bill, I hope that the Minister will again change his attitude and that we shall get a 1 o'clock opening. The Minister has said, time and again, that it is immaterial whether you have three or four hours, provided you establish the principle of split hours.  On that he is determined to stand, and on that I am with him 100 per cent.  I regret and deplore that the licensed traders and their employees did not come together and formulate proposals to enable the Minister to have this 1 o'clock opening and 7 o'clock closing, the split hours being arranged to suit their mutual interests.  It could and should have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting to hear Deputy Norton tell us that his sole interest is that of the assistants.  I am glad to <Col N="2371" /> hear that from Deputy Norton, particularly in view of the fact that it is only a few months since a very intimate colleague of his took advantage of an occasion in Bundoran to slander and ridicule the assistants' organisation. I have not heard that any member of Deputy Norton's Party stood up at that Trades Congress to repudiate the abusive methods used by that gentleman in respect of that particular organisation.

I have sufficient confidence in the intelligence of the rank and file of the assistants to know that they will realise that the attitude I have taken on this Bill is in their interest and that it will lead to increased employment and increased wages.  Did the Labour Party take up an attitude in opposition to that on Committee Stage?  Not at all.  I asked Deputy Norton or any member of his Party to say if it was contrary to trade union principles to advocate extension of hours in any trade or industry where the workers had a guaranteed working week. The workers in this trade have a guaranteed week.  It is guaranteed by law&mdash;I emphasise that&mdash;and that is due to this Government.  They have a 48-hour working week and, if the original proposals of the Minister had been accepted by both Parties, what would have been the position? Increased wages and increased employment would have been inevitable.</P>

I urge on the Minister to stand fast for the principle of the split hours.  I hope that, before this Bill becomes an Act, we shall get the 1 o'clock opening and 7 o'clock closing. It can be arranged whether the hours will be 1 to 2 and 5 to 7 or 1 to 3 and 5 to 7.  I think that there is an open door there, if the Minister gets agreement.  The people of this city and the people who come here are entitled to that.  They should not be told that the houses in the other boroughs can open at 1 o'clock, but that the houses in the capital of the State must remain closed until 2 o'clock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the purposes of the Sunday closing was to stop the rush, not of a few people, but of a multitude from the city to the surrounding districts.  To do that, I brought in the 7 o'clock closing.  I would much prefer to have left it at 5 o'clock.  The licensed trade may have appealed to me, but I did not listen to them.  I was concerned only with the report I had got both from the Guards and from decent people&mdash; mostly in County Dublin&mdash;who had to travel on Sunday evenings or who live <Col N="2373" /> in the districts concerned.  These disgraceful scenes were increasing in those districts.  The only way I could see of dealing with the matter, unless we were to cut the <i>bona fide</i> hours, was that which I proposed.  If we made the hour 7 o'clock for the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, instead of 8, then I would be inclined to have a 6 o'clock closing in the city.  But two hours would leave it as bad as ever.  If you had 2 o'clock and 6 o'clock, you would have it as bad as ever.</P>
      <P>We discussed the break on Sunday on the Committee Stage.  I think it was Deputy Linehan quoted the report of the commission which sat in England.  They referred to the good effect that the closing for the dinner hour had from the point of view of stopping the long-sitter.  I said on the Committee Stage, and I think I was right in saying, that four hours on a Sunday, when there is nothing else to be done, would be a temptation to people to stay drinking for the whole four hours; whereas, if you have the break, they will go home and there is a chance that they may not come back; but if they do, at least they will have the break.  The reason I put in 1 o'clock in the beginning was because I was given to understand and I was satisfied that it was the most suitable time.  Clubs open at 1 o'clock and hotel restaurants open at 1 o'clock. Therefore, I thought that was a reasonable time to open.  I admit that an hour is a short time.  But when people know there is only an hour, they can be got out in time if the owners wish to get them out.  I had provided for a two hours' interval, namely, from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock and from 4 o'clock to 7 o'clock.  I thought that was all right, because the Sunday would be different from a week day.  When it comes to closing for the dinner hour on a week day, there are very few people in the public houses and it is easy to get them out.  There is no trouble and the assistants and the owners can get a break of a full hour for their meals.  I do not think it would be the same on Sunday.  Deputy Byrne told us that from his experience it would take at least a quarter of an hour to clear the house.</P>

I would prefer, as Deputy Cooney has said, that all the county boroughs would have the same hours, but apparently it does not suit Dublin.  It was in order to deal with the Dublin problem that I brought in 2 o'clock.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one.  I tried to adopt a reasonable attitude in connection with this Bill.  There were, however, certain things to which I would not agree, for instance, the general opening on Sunday.  On the whole, I think it will be admitted that I have been reasonable in this matter.  I will not agree to a longer gap than one hour on Sunday. That is my main trouble.  If the closing hour were 6 o'clock in the cities and 8 o'clock in the outside places, I think the unholy rush would still continue.  I want to avoid that. Then, if there were a four hours' continuous opening on Sunday when people have not got work to do, I am afraid it would lead to a continuous sitting. That is why I would not agree to make it from 2 o'clock to 6 o'clock.</P>

As Deputy Linehan said, it is a domestic question.  I am concerned with the general problem. Clubs have been mentioned.  If I had the same continuous complaints from the police about abuses in clubs that I <Col N="2375" /> have had about the public houses, I would have dealt with the clubs, too. But I have not had these complaints. That is why I have not dealt with them.  There may be some foundation for them, but I do not think there is. I think there is a certain amount of propaganda in this.  We all know that there is a certain amount of lobbying going on and a case being made.  They have not got any evidence that the abuses in clubs are anything like what has been said here.  I am sure the police would have been in possession of the facts if there had been.  I am sticking to the amendment.  If Deputies would agree to knock an hour off the <i>bona fide</i> hours, it would be a different matter.  But I object to four hours' continuous opening on Sunday.  I admit I have changed my mind, because I was open to reason and I wanted to get the views of Deputies.</P>

      <P>Of course it is not so. Surely the assistants are entitled to agitate reasonably for avoiding a long spread-over?  That is a legitimate demand.  Is it just the same for a person to have to work 48 hours at night as 48 hours during the day?  Of course it is not.  Many conventions have been ratified in Geneva and here prohibiting the employment of certain people at night and prohibiting the employment of people at certain work at night, all indicating that the hours of work are an important consideration, and often a more important consideration than the actual number of hours worked.  For instance, it is much better for a person to work 48 hours during the week, say, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day than to work 44 hours per week from 9 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock in the morning.  The hours at which people work are important.  The assistants have a long spell, inasmuch as their hours are to be 10.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m.  Of course it is not just 10.30 p.m., because when a person closes at 10.30 there is washing up to be done and the stuff has to be made ready for the next day.  An assistant in Dublin will probably find himself in the future getting home about 12 o'clock at night after a 10.30 o'clock opening.  Anybody who cares to inquire into the matter will find that to be a fact.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a break of one and a half hours.  He forgets the fact that during the week he only gives one hour, namely, from 2.30 to 3.30 and in that period they have to have their meals.  The Minister says, of course, that they have not so much to do when they come back.  Take, for instance, a licensed premises in Dublin on a Saturday.  I venture to say that when an assistant opens it again at 3.30 o'clock he will probably have a large number of customers to deal with, because a large number of people are in town on a Saturday afternoon. A large number of workers are off on a Saturday; crowds are coming from and going to football matches on a Saturday and, if an assistant manages to get a meal on Saturday from 2.30 to 3.30, why will not the Minister permit him to manage it between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock on a Sunday?  If it can be done on a Saturday, why cannot it be done on a Sunday? It would at least give the assistants four hours' attendance and, under the Conditions of Employment Act, they would be entitled to one day's compensatory leave.  But they will not get a full day's leave for three and a half hours.  They will get a half day's leave for three hours.  If they have four hours on Sunday, they are entitled to one day's compensatory leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, so far as the assistant is concerned, is putting him in a certain <Col N="2378" /> disadvantageous position with regard to the present hours of duty.  Why should the Minister deprive them of using whatever bargaining position they can get by a four-hour opening on Sunday instead of going back to a three and a half-hour opening?  The Minister ought not to deprive them of that.  Deputy Cooney indulges in some &ldquo;ráiméis&rdquo; about what happened in Bundoran during the year.  I was not there, and I do not know what was said.  I am sure Deputy Cooney was not there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As far as I am concerned, I would welcome the 2 to 6 hours, even if that meant restricting the <i>bona fide</i> traffic around Dublin to 7 o'clock in the evening, and if you do restrict it around Dublin to 7 o'clock in the evening.  I do not think you will do very much harm.  As far as I am personally concerned, <Col N="2379" /> whatever might be said about a black area for the purpose of this <i>bona fide</i> traffic, so called, on a Sunday evening, I think that any restriction is justified, but if the Minister, for various reasons, does not want to restrict it to 7 o'clock on a Sunday evening and prefers to go on to 8 o'clock, I venture to say that if the Gárdaí exercise vigilance in these places around Dublin which are the sources of trouble, so far as the Gárdaí and the Minister are concerned, I think that the Minister need not fear a continuance of that type of conduct; but even the fact that it should continue to a minor extent is not a reason for dividing up the day in the way the Minister proposes in his amendment.  I still press him to agree to the 2 to 6 opening on Sunday.</P>

      <P>I would urge the Minister to make it 1 to 2 and 4 to 7, or even 5 to 7.  I think that the 2 o'clock opening is absolutely unjust and unfair to the community.  As the Minister said &mdash;on an earlier stage of this Bill&mdash; Dublin, the Capital of Ireland, is the heart of the tourist traffic of this country.  Into this city, in normal times, on Sundays, come thousands of people, and I would again remind the Minister of the terrible situation that existed in pre-war times when, on one occasion, something like 50,000 people came here to see an All-Ireland Final.</P>
      <P>It was one of the wettest days that ever dawned, and these people were lined up at the railway stations and along O'Connell Street and the Quays, unable to get even sandwiches, not to mind liquid refreshments.  Now, the majority of these people came in before 1 o'clock, and if&mdash;again adverting to the question of the national games&mdash; the games start, as they always do, at 3 o'clock, and if you do not open until 2 o'clock, the gates at these national games will suffer, because the people coming from the country want their stout and sandwiches before going to Croke Park.  I think that no case can be made against a 1 o'clock opening, not alone on that ground but also from the point of view of the public houses and the people who have not money enough to become members of clubs.  I think the ordinary consuming community should be given the same rights as those who can afford to become members of clubs, which open from 1 to 3 and from 6 to 9.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2 to add at the end of Section 4 the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing contained in Section 2 of the Act of 1927 shall operate to prohibit the holder of an on-licence (not being a six-day licence) in respect of premises situate in an urban county district or town the population of which district or town according to the last census exceeds ten thousand from selling or from keeping open for the sale of intoxicating liquor on any Sunday between the hours of one o'clock and three o'clock and between the hours of five o'clock and seven o'clock in the afternoon and the said sub-section shall have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of the amendment is to extend to towns of the size indicated the privilege enjoyed by the boroughs, other than Dublin.  The legislation we are dealing with, I understand, has in the main been dictated by the conditions <Col N="2382" /> obtaining in and around Dublin, and advantage is being taken by the Minister to adjust the existing code because of requests from the Dublin area.  It is the view of some people in the House that when the Bill is being put through, the people of the country generally should be given an opportunity to have a drink on Sundays in their own localities.  That, seemingly, has not been possible, but this amendment aims at extending to sections of the community who live their lives under exactly the same conditions as the citizens of Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Even though they happen to be something smaller in population, it cannot be said that there is any difference between the conditions obtaining in Galway, Dundalk, Drogheda, and towns of that size and type, and the conditions obtaining in cities like Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  The inhabitants of these towns cannot be said to be rural in their habits.  They are really citizens in their methods of life, and they are denied the right that citizens of these big towns have of getting a drink on Sunday.  There is no question of there being any fear of the extravagances that have been the subject of so much comment in the House taking place in those districts.  Instead of driving them to become <i>bona fide</i> travellers, the Minister should give the people in these districts an opportunity to get a drink on Sunday.</P>
    <P>They ought to be entitled to have the same hours of opening, before and after dinner, as are enjoyed by the southern cities.  That would put them on a plane of equality with the population of these towns, and I think nobody can suggest any argument, from the temperance point of view, that there would be likely to be any abuses in these districts.  It would facilitate them also, of course, on the occasion of big events taking place in their towns, but I am rather speaking for the life of the people from one end of the year to another, rather than for catering for an influx of visitors to these towns, when I suggest that they are as much entitled to have an opening between 1 and 3 and 5 and 7 as are the citizens of my own City of Limerick or of Waterford or Cork.  I am perfectly <Col N="2383" /> satisfied that the House would agree and that nobody would put forward any argument that there would be abuse of that privilege if it was extended by the Minister in this Bill to the towns I am speaking of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am personally concerned, I would support this amendment. The fact that such an amendment has to be brought in at all shows where the real problem lies.  Even though I support the amendment I am beginning to be very much afraid of what the people in the rural districts are going to do now.  First of all, they were in a subordinate position only to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the four county boroughs.  If this amendment is accepted they will be in a subordinate position to every small country town. There is no doubt there is a strong case for the amendment.  There is an equally strong case for the rural areas, but, for the life of me, I cannot see why the Deputies suggest this amendment. I suppose they are suggesting it now because they know they will not get the other thing and they are hoping to get this.  I think there is a very strong argument for it, and I am quite satisfied that in the towns such as Deputy Keyes mentioned&mdash;Drogheda and Dundalk&mdash;which are industrial towns, there is a very strong case for a Sunday opening.  I shudder to think what Deputy Corry's reaction will be if this amendment goes through.  He felt small enough in his position as country representative when the Bill was being brought in originally, but when he is put in a still more inferior position to the towns, I do not know what he will feel.  I think the Minister ought to accept this amendment and I think the Minister, even at this late stage, could consider going the whole hog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put one very strong point to the Minister.  I am glad that I have been reminded of it by Deputy Keyes' reference to temperance.  There was a snowball resolution sent to every Deputy in this House from a certain society of which branches were revived all over the country for the purpose of sending that resolution, condemning <Col N="2384" /> the action of the House and of the Minister and condemning everybody having anything to do with the proposed relaxation of the licensing laws in the new licensing Bill.  I do not know how many Deputies thought it worth their while to reply to that circular, but I thought it worth my while to reply to it.  I wrote to the secretary of one of the branches that sent me that circular.  I said: &ldquo;I have got your letter.  I do not see anything wrong with the licensing Bill, as amended.  The Minister has given us concessions that I am satisfied with. If you see anything wrong with the licensing Bill, will you tell me what you see wrong with it and what your arguments for your opposition to it are?&rdquo; I did not get any reply to that letter. I am very much afraid that, behind the general opposition to the Sunday opening in the country, there is a feeling that there would be intense opposition to it from certain quarters.  There was a certain amount of that opposition in the House.  There was quite sincere opposition, I believe, from Deputy Allen in his speech on the Committee Stage.  I appreciate his viewpoint, although I totally disagree with it.  The fact that it is necessary to ask that this amendment be accepted in the case of towns of over 10,000 population indicates the necessity for doing something like that for the whole country.  As far as the amendment is concerned, it is something to be desired.  The towns mentioned are surely entitled to have an opening.  It will do this much, but it will not improve the situation because it will make a bad anomaly worse.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is accepted, it will mean there will be less <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  You will not have men coming from Dublin to outlying districts, especially to my constituency. I am supporting this amendment on account of representations made by the Bray Urban Council on behalf of the <Col N="2385" /> licensed trade in Bray.  In the summer time there is a floating population of 20,000 in Bray.  The Bray traders are prepared to meet the Minister's wishes if he wants to restrict <i>bona fide</i> traffic and to have similar hours of opening to those in Dublin and not to have any <i>bona fide</i> traffic in Bray.  They are large ratepayers. They are large employers. They have represented that people can come by bus or rail from Bray to Dublin and get in Dublin the drink that is denied them in the Bray area.  I am not one who would advocate intemperance.  I pointed out to a temperance organisation many years ago that, with transport facilities, a three miles' or five miles' limit will not prevent a man from travelling in order to get a drink.  I am satisfied that if you had the facilities in the district that I am speaking for that exist in Dublin there would be less drink consumed. I am sorry the Minister brought up the question of clubs.  I could give him instances of clubs and I could give him the reasons why he does not receive reports in connection with them.  It is because high officers are appointed committee members of the clubs before they are a week in the area.  What I object to is the fact that the publican who is paying for his licence and paying his employees, is restricted by Guards, watched and persecuted in many ways, while people can leave the public house and go to a club on St. Patrick's Day, St. Stephen's Day or Sunday and get drink there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to restrict drinking, he would first of all have to tackle, not the decent public houses which are under everybody's observation, but the clubs in isolated places where there is intemperance.  Even in my own constituency we are often surprised at the reports we receive from the clergy and others about the drink that is consumed in certain clubs.  You have the licensed trader backing up the club because he happens to be the agent for supplying the beer to the clubs in the area.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment on behalf of Bray&mdash;it is not for all the rural areas.  It is such a short distance <Col N="2386" /> from Bray to the city, a matter of a quarter of an hour in the bus, that the workers of Bray can come to Dublin for <i>bona fide</i> trade.  The Bray traders are prepared to comply with the regulations.  They recognise that under the present law they would be entitled, in the tourist season, to supply when the public houses are closed in Dublin.  If there were a rush in the summer season in Bray, there might be a difficulty in meeting it.  We will be satisfied if the Minister grants this concession.  The effect of it will be to bring about the situation that he desires.  We believe that its acceptance would help to abolish a lot of the abuses that occur in connection with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not give way by accepting this amendment. This is the thin end of the wedge for a general opening on Sundays.  There can be no doubt about that.  Deputy Linehan was quite right when he said that the rest of the rural population would have a grievance if the Minister were to give way on this and allow Sunday opening in about a dozen towns in the country which have a population of over 10,000. There is one such town in the constituency that I represent.  It has a population of about 12,500.  I think I can speak, to a certain extent, on behalf of that town.  Neither the members of the licensed trade there, nor any section of the people, want Sunday opening.  It is very significant that a Deputy who resides in that town is not sitting beside Deputy Everett to support him.</P>

If, as I said on the Committee Stage, the Minister were to give way to the clamour of a few topers by allowing public houses to open on Sundays the effect would be to sap the morale of the people.  If Sunday were allowed to be turned into a day for the carrying on of general trade, and for boozing, that would have the effect of sapping the whole moral foundation of the people in this State.  We would soon have what they have on the Continent&mdash;no Sunday.  The observance of the Sabbath has, unfortunately, been done away with in some countries.  If we had a general opening of public houses in the rural areas on Sundays, then we would be on the high road to the position that, unfortunately, has been reached in many countries throughout the world.  As I have said, I hope that the Minister will not give way to this clamour from a few topers for Sunday opening.</P>

I want to say that no representations whatever have been made to me by the licensed trade in that town or by anybody else in regard to the granting of facilities for the opening of public houses on Sundays.  Deputy Linehan rightly pointed out that the rural community would have a grievance if towns with a population of the one that I represent were to be allowed to have a Sunday opening for public houses.  There are a few public houses situate outside the borough of Drogheda. Is it suggested that the owners of them must, of necessity, keep closed on a Sunday while the publicans in Drogheda, only a few hundred yards away, are to be allowed to open?  I hope that, for the reasons I have stated, the Minister will refuse to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join in the appeal to the Minister not to accept this amendment.  On previous stages of the Bill we pointed out, when a general Sunday opening was advocated, <Col N="2388" /> that at present only a small number of &ldquo;pubs&rdquo; in the country engage in the <i>bona fide</i> trade on Sundays with the result that the owners of them and their assistants can go away and have a day's recreation.  If the Minister were to agree to have a general opening on Sundays, the result would be to pin everybody down to a seven-day week.  It would open the door for the carrying on of a general trade on Sundays.  Deputy Davin, on the Second Reading and Committee Stages of the Bill, advocated that the carrying on of a general trade should be allowed on Sundays.  This, he urged, would save the busy farmer and his wife from having to do their business on Saturday.  If that state of things were permitted, it would mean a return to slave conditions both for the owners of public houses and their assistants.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Linehan that, in this amendment, we have the thin end of the wedge for a general opening on Sundays.  If the Minister were to give way on the question of population, then at some future stage he, or some other Minister, would have to give way in the case of towns with a population of 5,000.  Later on the figure would be brought down to 1,000, and, eventually, we would reach the position of having not only a Sunday opening for public houses but of other premises in which a general trade is carried on.  I think it is a good thing for this nation and for its people to have a day of rest on Sunday.</P>

I have not taken very much interest in this Bill, but, viewing this from a logical point of view, I cannot see why towns like Dundalk, Drogheda and Wexford and other towns with a population of over 10,000, should not enjoy the same facilities on Sundays as Waterford, Cork and Limerick.

I cannot speak from experience of public houses on Sundays, but I suggest to the Minister that, in the case of people who want to have a drink on a Sunday, it would be much better to have an opening of public houses during certain hours so that they could walk boldly in and take their drink, instead of, as at present, ducking around and entering public houses through back yards.</P>
      <P>I want to dissociate myself from some remarks that were made in the course of the debates on this Bill in regard to the manner in which the Civic Guards enforce the licensing laws.  The statement was made that the public houses might as well be open on Sundays, the suggestion being that the Civic Guards were not enforcing the law.  I want to repudiate those statements and suggestions.  In my opinion, the Guards are doing their duty as best they can to see that the law is obeyed in regard to Sunday closing.  If abuses do happen to occur in connection with the licensing laws, it is not fair to put the blame on the Guards.  As I have said, I cannot for the life of me see why people in towns like Dundalk and Drogheda should not enjoy the same facilities in regard to being able to get a drink on a Sunday as the people in Cork, Limerick and Waterford enjoy.  Take the case of the City of Dublin.  Nowhere in the country is there a better observance of the Sabbath than in this city, where the public houses are allowed to open for a few hours in the afternoon.  The people in Dublin, it can be said, are most exemplary in the observance of their religious duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore the argument put forward <Col N="2390" /> by Deputy Allen does not, in my opinion, hold water.  If he were prepared to go the whole hog and vote against Sunday opening generally, whether in the city or anywhere else, one might appreciate his point of view, but, with all respect, he cannot differentiate as between various sections of the community.  A large number of people come into the town of Dundalk on Sundays, and I think it would be much better if they could get into a public house for a drink than that they should carry on as they have been doing for the past two or three years.  I think the Minister would not be making a mistake in granting those facilities.  Possibly, he may not think that the hours suggested are suitable; he may want to make certain changes in the hours.  If he does, I am sure Deputy Keyes and the proposer of the amendment will only be too happy to fall in with any adjustments he may wish to make.  I cannot see why those towns should not have the same facilities with regard to Sunday opening as are enjoyed by people in the other places to which the Act applies All those terrible things which we are told would happen if those facilities were granted simply would not take place.  There is no use in throwing up our hands in despair.  We have very little confidence in the people of this country if we think they cannot be trusted to pass by a public house on a Sunday even if it is open.  The public houses are open every other day, and thousands of people do pass them by; they can do the same on a Sunday.  I would ask the Minister to grant those facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we had settled this question with regard to the general opening hours.  As Deputy Kennedy said, if those facilities are granted to towns with a population of 10,000, we would then be asked to go down to 5,000 and 4,000, and where are we to draw the line?  Deputy O'Higgins said that I should justify the differentiation: he tried to put the onus on me.  I found it there; there was some reason for it, and I do not propose to interfere with a differentiation that has been there for quite a long time.  This is more than the thin end of the wedge; it is something I <Col N="2391" /> would not be prepared to do at all.  I am not prepared to do what Deputy O'Higgins said I was bound to do, that is, to justify the differentiation. I found it there, and conditions have not changed so very much.  One of the reasons, I think&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash; why facilities were given in the cities and not in the country is that it was easier to control the sale of drink in the cities.  That may have been at the bottom of it.</P>

As I say, if those facilities were granted to towns with a population of 10,000, then a case could be put forward for towns with a population of 5,000, until eventually a case could be made for the countryside.  I do not propose to agree to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand to an extent the Minister's reluctance to depart too extensively from the provisions of the 1927 Act, but on the other hand I do not think that the acceptance of the proposed amendment <Col N="2392" /> would involve any very revolutionary departure.  There is no question of stepping down to 9,000 or 6,000 or 5,000, at another time, by some other Minister.  Personally, I am inclined to hope that, with the passing of the years, we will reach a stage of confidence in our people which will justify that further extension.  At the moment, it ought to be possible for the Minister and the House to agree to what is suggested in the amendment&mdash; that we see no huge gulf between the conduct of people in the towns with a population of 10,000 and those with a population of 20,000 or 30,000.</P>
      <P>If I anticipated for a moment the terrible calamities portrayed by Deputy Allen as the consequence of accepting this amendment, I would shudder to think of having my name associated with it, but I have not the least fear in the world that in his own town of Wexford&mdash;I am sorry Deputy Corish is not here&mdash;where we are told that one cannot buy a box of matches on a Sunday, the conduct of the people would be so shockingly revolutionised by having the public houses open on a Sunday.  I do not think any abuses would take place if the people in those industrial towns with a population of 10,000 had the privilege of having the public houses open on Sundays for a certain limited number of hours, so that they can get a drink if they want it.  We do not see any of those abuses taking place in towns where the public houses are open.  If such abuses were taking place, neither the House nor the Minister would agree to a continuation of those opening hours.  We would have a clamour from the temperance people, demanding the prevention of those abuses.  There has been no such clamour.  Where have we an example of the horrors that we are given to understand will take place in Ireland if Galway, Wexford, Dundalk, and those other places are granted those facilities?  They are purely a figment of the imagination; there is no evidence to support it.  It is a reflection on the conduct of the people to suggest that they would not behave themselves if this privilege were ex tended to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister would not be <Col N="2393" /> doing anything revolutionary in extending the privileges of the 1927 Act from the four county boroughs to the industrial towns of our country.  As has been pointed out, modern transport has revolutionised the condition of affairs in recent years, and you cannot prevent people from getting a drink if they want to get it.  I heard Deputy Norton making the point on an earlier stage of this Bill that if the Minister had a commission for bicycle tyres there might be something to be said for this restriction, because it drives people further afield to get their drink.  If they could get a drink close at hand, they would take it and go home to their dinner, but when they have to go out a few miles they will not stop at one drink.  I would again ask the Minister to grant those facilities to towns with a population of 10,000, and not to be intimidated by the bogeys which have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

As I stated before, I would not advocate any excessive facilities for drink, but I would ask the Minister to consider the position in regard to places in close proximity to Dublin. The position will be that when the public houses close in Dublin the people will travel by bus to the public houses in Bray.  It is only a matter of a quarter of an hour.  We do not want <i>bona fide</i> traffic on Sundays; we are prepared to have in Bray the same opening hours as in Dublin, with no <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the debate on this amendment and to the debate on the last <Col N="2394" /> amendment and I am beginning to wonder if this country is not made up of only two classes, the owners of licensed premises and their assistants, because I hear now, as a conclusive argument put forward by Deputy Allen and Deputy Corish, that this thing must, of course, be bad, as the publicans have not asked for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I misunderstood the Deputy, I am very sorry, but that was the impression left on my mind.  Let us ask ourselves, who else could have asked for it?  So far as the temperance associations are concerned, I know they passed resolutions. Even the licensed trade may pass resolutions, but I do not yet know of any association of moderate drinkers, let us say, who would come together and pass resolutions and send them on to their Deputies.  I have not come across that type of body, but possibly it is in existence in Wexford.</P>
      <P>Let us get down to this amendment. Whether the licensed trade or the assistants are or are not asking for it, let us consider it on its merits.  I am not at all impressed by the Minister's argument that a certain thing is there and it must remain.  That is not at all, to my mind, a conclusive argument.  If amendments are brought before the House, you must deal with them according as you think they are sound or unsound, and not because a differentiation was made 60 or 70 years ago and it must remain for all time.  It does seem to me that there is a particular reason why large towns should be differentiated from strictly rural areas, and it is a pretty obvious one.  If you have 10,000 people collected in one area and none of them can get alcohol on Sunday inside that area, they have to wander out in order to get the alcohol. Possibly friends may come in to meet them, and may want to have a friendly talk over their alcohol.  The inhabitants of the town must be teetotal, while the visitors whom they are entertaining can take the stronger stuff, one set being <i>bona fide</i> and the others not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2395" /> If this amendment is carried it will mean that in the larger towns that problem will not arise to the extent to which it does now.  In a small village or town where there are only 500 people they may have to move out if they want a drink on Sunday.  It is quite a different problem, and I take it that is the reason why the differentiation between Dublin, the other county boroughs and the rest of the country took place.  The legislature did not want a colossal exodus from a city with 500,000 of a population to the country public houses around in order hat persons might become <i>bona fide.</i> I would be absolutely absurd and impossible to prevent Sunday opening in Dublin unless you stopped the <i>bona fide</i> traffic altogether.  So far as the argument is concerned that you may have to enlarge if you start with 10,000, that need not be taken seriously. How this legislation will work out will only be shown by experience. I do not think there are any statistics to show that there is more drinking in Waterford than in Galway or Clonmel on Sundays.  I do not think there are any statistics that could be produced by the Minister to show that there is more drunkenness on Sundays.  If the public houses are opened in accordance with this amendment, they will be opened for a shorter time so far as the <i>bona fide</i> traffic is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

He talked about the principle involved in this amendment that Deputy Everett and Deputy Keyes have moved, and for that reason he declined to accept it.  I do not think that is the real position. The Minister has agreed to the continuance, and even the extension, of the Sunday opening hours in the boroughs and by so doing he has given away what he calls the principle of Sunday opening.  It is now only a <Col N="2396" /> question of whether he will extend what he has agreed to in the case of Dublin and the other county boroughs to places like Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>

Is that not so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Deputy the reason I have given already&mdash;it was decided in 1927 and has since worked satisfactorily, and I do not propose to recast the 1927 Act.  That Act was passed in 1927 after a very long debate. The point originated in 1878, but it was fully considered here in 1927, and I am satisfied that it has worked satisfactorily. There has been no general demand for a change.  I do admit that it would be a very bad principle to say that what was good enough for our grandfathers is good enough for us.  I do not stand on that principle at all. I agree we ought to move with the times, but you must draw the line somewhere and not take on too big a job.  If something has worked fairly well, it is as well to leave it alone, until there is a very big demand for a change; but where something has not worked and has become simply a farce, <Col N="2399" /> as in the case of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, it is time to interfere.  That is why the Bill was brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the danger which the Minister sees, but he is looking a little further ahead than I.  As has been said already, it will probably be 20 years before we have another licensing Bill.  I hope that will be so, but the Minister is resting his whole case on four boroughs.  The amendment in the name of Deputy Keyes suggests that towns or cities with a population of 10,000 or over should have the same concessions as those enjoyed by the people in the four boroughs.  I do not know what the population of Waterford is, but let us take Galway which has a population of over 20,000.  I think that a city with a population of 20,000 or over should have the same concessions as the boroughs, and I do not want to preach intemperance by any means.</P>
      <P>This amendment will not affect many towns in the Province of Connaught, but I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment, with the proviso that the figure of 10,000 population might be raised somewhat.  I should be quite agreeable.  I cannot see why the same concessions should not be given to a city with a population of 20,000 or 22,000 as are given to the boroughs.  I do not think it will lead to a spread of intemperance, and in fact I think it will bring about a lessening of intemperance, because if people want a few drinks, they will have to run into backyards, persecuting the Guards who are trying to keep law and order, in order to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>If the Minister were disposed to accept the amendment I should be rather inclined to urge him to reduce the figure rather than to raise it as Deputy Brodrick suggested, so that towns in tourist areas, such as Killarney, might be brought in.  If he were to consider it at all, he should consider it on the basis of towns which have town commissioners, urban councils or bodies of the kind; but in fact I object to any of this differentiation, as I pointed out at the Committee Stage.  I see absolutely no reason for any differentiation between the residents <Col N="2400" /> of our towns and our rural population. I agree that it is an inheritance of the Minister's and I do not throw the blame for it on him.  It has existed for 70 or 80 years.  It was brought forward into the 1927 Act, but that does not make it right, and the Minister cannot adopt the attitude that everything we did was right, and therefore sacrosanct.</P>

We were all very young men and young men are inclined to be enthusiastic in adopting particular attitudes.  There was undoubtedly a great wave of temperance enthusiasm behind the 1927 Act, even though there was a fair amount of strong opposition to some of its provisions.  I do not want to go into it all, but I do want to stress that the principle of differentiation between the residents of the boroughs and the residents of the rural areas is wrong, and that the Minister should have taken his courage in his hands and made the same law for every citizen.</P>
      <P>It would be a very nice question as to whether there is not a constitutional issue involved in this differentiation between different sections of our people.  It has never been raised, but it is a point which may be raised, as to whether it is constitutional at all.  If the Minister gives any consideration to the proposition in the amendment, I ask him to consider it on the basis of making it much more wide than the amendment proposes, while I still maintain that it is entirely wrong to make any such differentiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask if the Minister would inform us in regard to the question of the amendment proposed by Deputy Everett.  While I hope that he will not give way and extend these hours widely on an indiscriminate basis all over the country, and while I cordially approve of the principle of discriminating in respect of closing hours in the cities and in rural Ireland, for reasons into which I do not think it is necessary for me to go &mdash;Deputy Lynch and I had our say on <Col N="2401" /> the merits of that question on Committee Stage&mdash;I do think that this question arises: If we are going to emphasise the development of the tourist traffic industry post-war, does not the Minister think that in areas recognised as tourist areas, the amenities provided should not be identical with those in rural Ireland?  I cannot find myself in agreement with Deputy Brodrick's views.  There is something to be said for a middle course.  Does the Minister not think that he should reserve to some one discretion to give limited hours in tourist areas by bringing them into line with city hours rather than with those in rural areas?  If we are to be in competition with the Isle of Man and Blackpool and to build up a considerable business on that assumption, it seems absurd to say to persons whose co-operation we are seeking that there will be certain hours in those areas for that type of tourist.  We will have to compete with Blackpool and the Isle of Man, but we are asking people in the licensed trade to conform to hours that are intended for a rural population or for remote parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy is not aware that in the Isle of Man there is complete closing on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to be an expert on the tourist question.  I think the Minister for Justice will agree that if the Isle of Man has total Sunday closing that arrangement must be founded on some peculiar puritanical ordinance.  I wonder if there is some difficulty in repealing it?  However, I do not care what they do in the Isle of Man.  What I am concerned about is to do what is reasonable here. If they want to do something daft in the Isle of Man let them, but if we go to people in this country and ask them to improve their premises, and to spend money on them, because they happen to be located in an area where there is a certain development of tourist traffic, we should tell them that we give money to the Tourist Development Board in order to second their efforts to improve their premises.  Does the Minister not think that consequential on the private efforts of the individual, <Col N="2402" /> and the exertions of the Tourist Development Board, which are financed out of public money, the rational thing would be to reserve a discretion, if adequate representations were made to him to define an area, and to say that in that area the Sunday opening hours normally available in Dublin would be available for tourist traffic, and to justify that departure from the general rural rule by scheduling it as a tourist area?  It seems to me that unless we do that, sooner or later we will be confronted with a new Licensing Bill, in which special facilities will be set out to create amenities of that kind.</P>
      <P>Under the present law, people who go to hotels to get a meal on Sundays can have a drink with it.  But remember that while a considerable body of tourists are in a position to go to hotels for meals, or for whatever refreshments they want, a different class of people who go there bring sandwiches in paper bags.  While the children are picnicking on the strand the men in the party may adjourn to a public house to have a bottle of beer or a bottle of stout with which to moisten their lips.  If we intend to do all we can to develop the tourist trade I urge that view on the House.  Everybody seems to think that we are manoeuvring for positions in this debate, and that by our stand here we are going to be known hereafter as advocates of tee-totallers or of &ldquo;drunks&rdquo;.  I do not mind what is said.  The important thing is that we should do the right thing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that at this stage or at any stage we could finally define every tourist area.  What is a tourist area to-day may not be a tourist area to-morrow.  There should be discretion in the Minister or in somebody to declare tourist areas scheduled areas. I can see that the Minister might be in misery if he were called upon to administer a discretion of that kind. I know that every Minister is reluctant to undertake that task.  I cannot see why any serious doubt should arise as to whether an area is a tourist area or not.  I imagine there will be some rule of thumb which the Minister will apply as to what he considers a tourist <Col N="2403" /> area.  Will the Minister consider that suggestion?</P>

      <P>The tourist organisation urged to have this done and one of the arguments put up was that if extra facilities for drinking were given, we would be able to compete more successfully with places such as the Isle of Man and Llandudno.  The fact is that these places attract crowds of tourists, and the public houses are not open on Sundays.  It is not people who want drink we want to attract here.  There are many people who would be glad to come and enjoy the amenities that we can offer without considering the drinking facilities.</P>

After Dublin, Bray is the largest tourist centre, and you have the position that residents in Bray who want these facilities can take a train and come up to Dublin.  I might not have been correct in suggesting that the journey could be covered in a quarter of an hour, but I suggest that if the shops are closed in Bray, it would not take more than 30 minutes in normal times to get to Dublin.</P>

      <P>I do not like the Minister's last equalisation, that if you open in these tourist areas you are offering facilities to &ldquo;drunks&rdquo;.  That, I think, represents a division of mind on the part of the Minister.  There is the mind that seems people who come into an area to get refreshment to which human beings are reasonably entitled, and the mind that can only see &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; coming in.  I would agree that so far as there are more facilities given, you are likely to have a greater proportion of people who are under the influence of drink, but I think there are other people who should also be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Davin's answer to the Minister with regard to those areas where there are no drinking facilities in England, is pertinent.  I understand that the number of clubs in England went up by at least 50 per cent.  in a very small period of years as a result of these restrictions in England.  I think, however, the distinction made between a tourist area and the rest of the country is a bad one.  It is very hard to see why there should be any logical discrimination between the countryside generally and these areas.  It seems to be odd that the stranger who comes in here to look at our natural scenery is apparently going to be enervated to such an extent that he cannot recover unless he gets drink while the native who is looking at that scenery all the year round has to go without drink. <Col N="2405" /> I take it that this concession is sought merely for the purpose of catering for people generally.  That is the net point, that public houses should be allowed to cater for the reasonable demands of the community.  In this country, unfortunately, we have had a reputation in the past for intoxication. We have lived that down by slow degrees&mdash;partly as a result of the increased price of drink, and partly as the result of temperance crusades.  I think it is largely because of that history of ours that Ministers are not inclined to interfere with laws made so far back as 1878, but I should like the Minister to make up his mind that while old liquor may be good, old liquor legislation is not necessarily good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole objection, I understand, to extending the hours in the whole of rural Ireland is that by doing so we would probably turn Sunday into a market day.  Public houses in rural Ireland are usually engaged in mixed business.  If I am a draper and a person next door has a public house and also carries on a drapery business, if he is allowed to open his premises for the purpose of supplying drink on Sunday, he will also carry on his drapery business at the same time and I must, in order to compete with him, open my drapery establishment.  The moment the premises are open, they will be open not alone for the sale of drink but for the sale of any commodity which the shop stocks.  If my next door neighbour opens, then I must open in competition with him.  If the whole town is going to open after last Mass, the idea will be that Sunday is the best market day.  That surely would be an undesirable development in the rural life of this country.  I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that tourists who go to a centre for relaxation will ordinarily and legitimately consume rather more liquor refreshment than a native who has to work six or seven days of the week.  If Deputy McGilligan and I are in Waterville or Portnoo on holidays, shall we not consume more frequent glasses of sherry than in our respective homes?  That is the ordinary practice.  Why not face <Col N="2406" /> the fact that any one of us on holidays will consume more alcoholic liquor than when we are engaged on our daily jobs at home?  If we are catering for the accommodation of persons so minded, who want to go and relax and to pursue a less ordered or less careful regime than ordinary men going about their daily work, why not make provisions for that purpose?</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, we do not want tourists, if we do not want people to relax and have a good time, then we should not have a Tourist Development Board.  There are many rationally-minded people who think that we should be much better off if we did not encourage such people to come amongst us but if we reject that view and invite and urge tourists to visit this country, surely it is nonsense to suggest that if that class of person wants refreshments on Sundays we should not give them to him?  There is nothing sinful in taking refreshments on Sunday.  If the tourist wants it and thinks it will add to his comfort by all means let him get it, but that is no reason why we should revolutionise the whole social life of rural Ireland, by throwing open all the public houses in the country.  In tourist parts, however, inasmuch as there is nothing intrinsically bad in consuming liquor on Sunday, facilities can be provided whereby liquor will be available for people visiting these places.</P>

    <P>This amendment is intended to meet the suggestion of Deputy McGilligan on the Committee Stage.  Section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, entitled a person who is the holder of a seven-day licence and a six-day or an early-closing licence in respect of premises situated in the same licensing area, to obtain, at the annual licensing District Court, a transfer of the seven-day licence to the premises to which the six-day or early-closing licence is attached. Section 7 of the Bill provides that such transfer may be obtained at an ordinary sitting of the District Court as well as at the annual sitting.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable a seven-day licence to be transferred to premises to which a six-day or early-closing licence is attached, where the seven-day licensed premises or the six-day licensed premises are situate in the same or adjoining districts of the District Court.

The population has shifted to a particular area, and there may be one or two licences in the former areas which have become redundant, the licence-duty being paid in the hope that something will turn up.

It is proposed to amend the 1927 Act by inserting before the words &ldquo;on any week day&rdquo; the words &ldquo;after the hour of six o'clock in the morning&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This and the following amendment were put down by Deputy. Dockrell and Deputy Kennedy.  They were not my amendments.  I said I had no objection to them.  I thought that Deputy Dockrell was speaking for his <Col N="2414" /> own Party, but apparently he was not. I think, however, that it is hard to call a man a traveller if he only travels five miles.  I admit that with modern transport the difference between five miles and ten miles is not a lot.  I said I would put it down for the purpose of debate to see what support it would have in the House.  I am not committed to it, but I should like to see it done myself.  Deputy Lynch reminded us that in the country they still travel by ass and cart.  He did not care, he said, what we did about the county boroughs, but in the country areas we should stick to the three miles.  I do not know if there is anything more I can say with regard to it.  But, if you are to call a man a traveller at all, I think a distance of five miles is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to adopt the attitude he took up on another section and leave well enough alone.  Whether Deputy Dockrell was speaking for himself or anybody else, so far as I am concerned, and I think other Deputies, there would be the most violent opposition to this, whether it came from Deputy Dockrell or from the Minister or anybody else.  I think we would be inflicting another shocking injustice on the rural community if we compel them to travel any longer distance than they have to travel at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is with regard to the three miles.  But what about the urban community?  Suppose we leave the rural people as they are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody in a county borough at the moment has to travel five miles and in the rural districts three miles.  The suggestion here is to double it in both cases.  There may be something in the point about the county boroughs that the facilities for transport are different from those in the country districts.  But in a country district there might be only two public houses within a radius of 12 miles, and there may not be any buses travelling on these roads.  So far as the country is concerned, I am sure Deputy Lynch and every other rural Deputy will advise the Minister to leave well enough alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2415" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the rural areas are concerned, I would be strongly opposed to any suggestion to extend the present distance from three to six miles.  It is all very well to talk about the improvement in travelling facilities; but actually in a great many parts of the country the travelling facilities now are the same as they were 50 years or 100 years ago.  The ordinary vehicles by which small farmers in my constituency go to Mass are the same as they were when I was a child.  They go on a horse and cart. Very few indeed have even risen to a pony and trap.  Even bicycles are not anything like as common as you would find them in the neighbourhood of the cities and towns.  Therefore, so far as rural areas are concerned, I would be very strongly opposed to the suggestion to increase the mileage from three to six miles.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly interested in the boroughs, as it is undoubtedly a fact that the transport facilities in the neighbourhood of the boroughs are much greater than in the rural areas. You have a great service of buses plying from the boroughs, and perhaps a case could be made for extending the limit from five to ten miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think the Minister would be well advised to leave well enough alone.  After all, there are persons who presumably have invested sums of money in hotels within five, six, seven or eight miles of the boroughs on the basis that the existing mileage would stand.  I am not speaking for any of these, but I can assume that there are such people.  As a matter of fact, I can recall a case in the neighbourhood of Dublin where there was a hotel licence granted in recent years which I think would be cut out if the distance were extended to ten miles.  I am not speaking for the hotel concerned because, as a matter of fact, when the application was before the courts I was briefed against it, but the hotel got its licence.  I am referring to the new hotel at Portmarnock.  It is a question of whether that would not be brought within this definition of ten miles.  I think it would be hard lines on the proprietress if she found the money she had sunk in that concern <Col N="2416" /> very nearly gone owing to the loss of the <i>bona fide</i> trade from the city. However, I am not particularly concerned with the question of the distance from the boroughs.  But I am very much concerned with the question of the distance in the rural areas.  I am strongly opposed to the proposition that there should be an increase of the existing three miles.  With regard to the boroughs, I think the Minister would be well-advised to leave the matter as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would be well-advised to leave the existing mileage as it is, both in the county boroughs and the rural areas. Does the Minister realise what the position will be in the County Dublin and within ten miles of the other county boroughs?  It means that the public houses cannot open as they do in the city to supply the local people and that they will not be allowed to carry on the <i>bona fide</i> business.  The Minister might as well insert an amendment to close 200 public houses in the County of Dublin and as many more within ten miles of the other county boroughs.  That is what it would amount to.  I think the Minister's intention was to grapple with the <i>bona fide</i> business.  In the summer time he has only left a difference of one hour between the city and the county, and in the winter time he has not left any difference at all.  Therefore he has dealt with the abuses which were said to exist.  I understood that was what was in the Minister's mind when introducing the Bill.  If the distance is increased from five miles to ten miles, it will mean that all those traders who sunk money in the business cannot sell to local people and will be too near the city to do a <i>bona fide</i> trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public houses in Clondalkin, for instance, are only seven miles from the city.  They cannot let in the local people from Clondalkin and they cannot let in people from Dublin City. Therefore, they might as well shut down.  The same applies to places like Portmarnock.  This would apply to places nearly as far as Bray, as well as places like Tallaght, Saggart, etc. <Col N="2417" /> Then if the distance of three miles outside the boroughs is doubled, farmers and farm workers who go to Skerries or Malahide on a Sunday in the summer time in order to enjoy the only day they have off, will also be affected. At present if they live more than three miles from these places they can go and have a drink while their families are playing on the strand.  Therefore, I think the Minister would be well-advised to leave the mileage as it is. Otherwise he would be doing a great injustice to traders in the neighbourhood of the four county boroughs. Therefore, I would appeal to him to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this, both with regard to the county boroughs and the rural areas.  The case of the rural areas is obvious; nobody could defend this in my opinion.  With regard to the urban areas, I do not think the authors of this realised the serious injury which it would inflict on people who have bought premises on the basis that the existing mileage would stand and paid a considerable amount of money for them, or, if the premises were not very good, spent an enormous amount of money on them for the purpose of that trade.  You are striking at the rights of property and at the whole stability of property if you do a thing like that.  I am putting it on that ground alone.  It is not so much a question of whether the distance is five miles or ten miles; my serious objection is that people invested their hard-earned money, their savings or the savings of somebody else, and that by just changing a word in a sentence you are hitting at the stability of their property.  It appears to me to be absolutely indefensible. You turn five into ten, and thereby you wipe out property worth tens of thousands of pounds.  It is just the same as if you were to take a tin of petrol, put a match to it, and blow it up.  It is from that aspect that I look upon the matter&mdash;that is, with regard to property around the county boroughs, the City of Dublin, and places like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the rural areas, I think that the people of rural Ireland <Col N="2418" /> are suffering enough at the moment without subjecting them to any more disabilities.  These are the fellows who have to put hobnails on the soles of their shoes, and now you are adding another three miles on these people. Now, I hold that if a person goes that distance for a drink, he will make up his mind to make a perfect job of it and, having gone that distance, such people will simply sit there in the public house until they are sodden with drink, and if they have come on bicycles or have driven a horse and trap, they will not be fit to ride the bicycles or drive the horse when they leave.  I do not hold with driving men to a point where they cannot readily get refreshments, and I say that, having had to travel such a distance for a drink, they will say to themselves: &ldquo;Very well, we will get full now, and make a proper job of it.&rdquo;  If they have to go six miles in a pony-cart or some such conveyance&mdash;there are no motor-cars now, of course&mdash;they will go into a hotel or public house, put up the pony and trap in the yard and say: &ldquo;We will make an evening of it now and do this job right.&rdquo; We all know the dangers in the case of an intoxicated man driving a motorcar, but it is just as bad in the case of such a man driving a horse or a pony. If these people could get a drink conveniently, they would not get full of drink, and they would go back home. I think that if the distances were allowed to stand as at present, there would be no abuse.</P>
    <P>So far as the county boroughs were concerned, I was trying to link up the closing time of the city public houses with the closing time in the county where these scenes were taking place, with a view to seeing that it would not be worth while for these people to go out there.  My object was to cut that out by linking up the closing hours of the city public houses with the legal closing time for the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, so that it would not be worth their while to go out.  This, however, is on quite a different plane, and while it is connected with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, at the same time I think that this House would be doing a very serious injustice, and would be doing it unwillingly <Col N="2419" /> and unconsciously, if it were to agree to this.  I think the Minister should not attempt to do it.  I am really thinking of the value of property. I have no particular case in mind at all, but there must be plenty of such cases, and I hold that this would be committing a terrible injustice and would lead to the ruin of many people.</P>

    <P>(2)  Where in a case to which the foregoing sub-section applies the certificate referred to in that sub-section is given to the applicant, nothing contained in the Act of 1902 shall operate to prevent the grant to the applicant of the licence which the said certificate declares him to be entitled to receive.</P>

In this case, these people were never holders of a full licence, and I am sure there would be strenuous objections from those in the district who had full licences.  It would be giving a full licence to people who do not have an ordinary licence.  I <Col N="2424" /> know that it is not easy to get light wines now, but that is only a temporary matter, whereas this measure is designed to be permanent.  That would be giving a full licence to people who would have only an ordinary licence and there would be a great deal of objection on the part of people who already have a full licence.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think that that is a section that ought to be encouraged?  The supply of alcoholic refreshment with a full meal in a restaurant ought to be encouraged, and certainly the larger restaurants ought to have a full licence.  I do not know how the Minister feels about it, but there is a certain number of people who go to restaurants and find they cannot get the refreshment that they could get in a fully licensed house.  It is a very serious handicap to restaurants placed in that position.  If the Minister sees another way of doing it, but would adopt that principle, I would be perfectly satisfied.  It is not a question of wishing to do it in that way if any other way can be found, but I certainly think the Minister ought to encourage the restaurant business as far as possible.</P>

I do not quite agree with Deputy Dockrell that because you have a big restaurant it should have a complete licence, but I think the public houses that already have the licences should be put into the position&mdash;as they are in other countries&mdash;that they would cater more for the ordinary needs of the people, that is, when a man would go in for a bottle of stout he could get sandwiches or something else to eat with it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell is a very conservative man, who is interested in property and in the rights of property, but there is this objection about the amendment, that it would enhance the value of the property of the owner of the restaurant, and to the extent that he sells drink you are depreciating the value of the property that is owned by the publican in the surrounding neighbourhood.  That is the point.  The publican may have invested a very considerable sum&mdash; £12,000 or £14,000&mdash;in a public house in the neighbourhood.  To the extent that the full licence will increase the value of the restaurant, it will depreciate the value of the premises that were already bought on the assumption that in that particular area or district there would be nobody else allowed to sell drink.  I think that consideration should appeal to Deputy Dockrell as a very conservative man, a man interested in the rights of property.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before Section 17, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, the holder of a six-day licence may apply at any annual licensing District Court, that in lieu of a certificate for the renewal of the six-day licence there be granted to him in respect of the said premises a certificate for a seven-day licence and the justice of the District Court, if he is satisfied that a certificate for the renewal of the six-day licence might have been granted, may, if he so thinks fit, grant to such applicant the certificate so applied for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is of importance to traders in towns situated in my constituency, <Col N="2426" /> and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the possibility of accepting the amendment.  In several towns in my constituency&mdash;Cahirciveen, Killorglin, Kenmare and other centres in South Kerry, fairs are held and considerable trade is carried on on Sunday evening.  People come in but they are debarred from access to licensed premises where a six-day licence obtains.  The holder of the licence is debarred from allowing even his relatives or friends from entering the premises on that particular day. People come ten, 15 and 20 miles on the preceding evening to do business in the fair and they return on the following day.  I think something should be done by way of adjustment so as to allow these people to obtain, on application to the District Court, a seven-day licence where it can be shown that the premises and business carried on justify such a licence being granted. There is another matter.  The holder of a six-day licence cannot allow a lodger or person residing in the premises to bring in people to the premises on a Sunday.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of people in the district generally, it is a matter that calls for adjustment.  It is an injustice to these people.  I cannot see why the Minister should not consider it.  We have been informed that the attitude of his Department is that it is really a big matter that entails the revaluation of the premises and property, and all that, and that it is too big a question. It is a matter that, as one Deputy described it this evening, has been there from the dim past.  It has existed as a result of the Act of 1902. I do not understand why there was ever such a differentiation between six-day licence holders and seven-day licence holders, or what the origin of it was.  Whatever it was, I think we have reached the stage in this country when these people should at least get a chance to carry on their business on equal terms with people who were more fortunate in a bygone period in obtaining facilities.  I put down this amendment not knowing very much about the law in the matter, but simply at the request of the people in my district. I know Deputy Fionan Lynch was <Col N="2427" /> interested in this matter.  Deputy Kennedy has a similar amendment, and I think the Minister, if he can at all see his way, should meet us in the matter.  I earnestly request him to do so.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  About 11 years ago, in a midland town, a case came before the Circuit Court judge by way of application for a new licence. The gist of the application was to turn a six-day licence into a seven-day licence.  The circuit judge gave the case a very patient hearing.  He heard a considerable number of witnesses, and came to the conclusion, on the facts, that the holders of such licences in that town were entitled to a seven-day licence.  He made two Orders to that effect.  Subsequently, the two Orders made were brought, by way of certiorari, before the High Court and quashed, the High Court holding that they were made without jurisdiction. It seems to me that this is something which is out of date in our legal code. There is no reason why the holder of a six-day licence should not have it turned into a seven-day licence, if the appropriate court thinks it fit to so order.  I understand that is the object of the section, and I support it.</P>

      <P>In connection with amendment No. 20, there are 153 beer-house licences in the State.  The object of my amendment is to put them on the same basis as the 10,000 publicans who have full licences.  A number of holders of beer-house licences, before the establishment of this State and since, have gone into one court after another and have been precluded, by the law as it stands, from getting the spirit licence which would give them a full publican's licence.  The proposal is to extend the spirit licence to 153 citizens who have a good business and are prevented by law from selling spirits.  If a number of individuals in this State decide to start a club, let it be a sports club or any other kind of club, and there is in regard to it no licence in existence, they can go into court and, on satisfying the judge, get a licence for the sale of beer, wine and spirits.  But here are 153 individuals, born into the trade and living by it, who are carrying on their trade under this severe handicap.  The Minister has already given concessions in regard to some bigger things.  We want him to grant this concession to the 153 owners of beer houses who, in some places, are doing the principal trade there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 deals with off-licences. I want to be quite frank and to say that I had only one case in mind when I introduced the amendment.  A town in the Midlands with a population of 5,000 is divided by a river. Approximately half the population lives on one side of the river, the other half living on the opposite side.  It has about 50 public houses on one side of the river.  On the opposite side, there is a house with an off-licence.  Some of those 50 public houses on one side of the river are doing practically no trade.  I think that the man on the opposite side with the off-licence, in a part of the town where the population has grown up around him, should be entitled to get an on-licence.  That is the meaning of amendment No. 21. As regards the owners of the 153 beer <Col N="2429" /> houses, I ask the Department to examine their trade in detail and to take an unbiased view of their position. The case of a man in Howth who had a beer-house licence&mdash;he is doing the best business in Howth&mdash;was fought in the courts.  He failed to get a full licence.  In the end, he had to build a hotel beside his licensed premises and get a hotel licence in order to get over his particular difficulty.  Tributes have been paid to the Minister and bouquets have been thrown at him.  I want him to do the fair thing in regard to the 153 individuals I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put before the Minister, and those who are putting forward the amendments before the House, a suggestion which was made to me by a publican.  It was this: that anybody with suitable premises who wanted a seven-day licence should be entitled to get it provided he was prepared to pay an extra licence duty.  This man held that the present holders of seven-day licences might have a grievance if newcomers were given a seven-day licence freely, since that would mean increased competition for them.  He said they would have no grievance if the newcomers were obliged to pay an extra licence duty.  That might get over the present difficulty.  The granting of the new seven-day licences might be left to the discretion of the district justices.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy McGovern's point is already met, because I think the historical reason for the six-day and seven-day licence is not all those shocking anomalies at all; it is because certain people, when originally applying for a licence, took the cheapest licence.</P>

      <P>Under any circumstances, I do not think the Minister could agree to amendment No. 21. There may be a very hard case in a particular town, but has not the Minister already provided that, if a person across the river has a licence and is not doing any trade, and the bulk of the population has slipped over to the other side of the river, he can now go <Col N="2430" /> in there.  In present circumstances, I do not think there is any case for giving on-licences to people who have off-licences.  I do not know anything about beer houses.  That is not a problem in the south, certainly not as far as Cork is concerned.  There are one or two six-day licences there, and if those people were given seven-day licences I do not think it would hurt anybody; the Minister would not be giving away very much by giving the extra day.  As I have said, I have no interest in, and no information on, the question of beer houses, but I think that, as far as the few six-day licence holders are concerned, it would not hurt anybody if they were given seven-day licences.</P>

      <P>There are 1,758 six-day licence holders in the country, and I think I have heard the view expressed during the progress of this Bill that there were too many on-licences in the country.  As Deputy Linehan has mentioned, we have already made it easier for people to transfer; we have en larged the district in which they car get the existing licence.  I think that is good enough.  I would not be prepared to go any further.  Deputy Flynn did not know how those licences originated. It was quite voluntary, as Deputy Linehan said.  Either at the time they got the licence or subsequently, they decided to go for the six-day licence and pay the smaller fee.  Once they had done that, they could not get back to the seven-day licence.  Everyone knows that there are too many licence already, and, as I say, the facilities are already there to change a six-day licence into a seven-day licence by transferring a seven-day licence to the premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that what the Minister has suggested as an alter native would not meet the case raised by Deputy Flynn, that is, the power to extinguish the existing licences and get a new seven-day licence.  Like Deputy Flynn, I have got a communi cation in connection with certain of those houses, and I immediately raised the point which I think was made by Deputy McGovern.  I pointed out to my correspondent that there was an <Col N="2431" /> other side to the question; that the existing seven-day licence holders in the town of Cahirciveen might have something to say to it; that many of those people may have purchased their premises within the last 40 years, since the 1902 Act was passed, and undoubtedly they bought them having regard to the existing conditions of competition for the Sunday trade.  At the same time, the proposal in Deputy Flynn's amendment does not give the six-day licence holder a seven-day licence on payment of the seven-day licence fee.  It merely empowers him to apply to the district justice.  Now, I do not think there can be any great case made against that.  If the existing seven-day licence holders object, they can come before the district justice when the application is being heard and oppose the granting of any further seven-day licences in the area. Personally, I think this is a small matter; it affects very few, and they are mostly small people who would not be in a position to do what the Minister has suggested about extinguishing the licence and applying for another. They are not that type of person; financially, they are not in a position to do anything of that kind.  I think the Minister might consider&mdash;if not now, between this and the time the Bill reaches the Seanad&mdash;the question as to whether or not they should not be given the right to make their case before the district justice, who would then refuse or grant the licence as he saw fit.</P>

There were many cases where&mdash;perhaps because of a pussyfoot element on the bench of magistrates&mdash;the seven-day licence was refused, and the applicants had no alternative but to accept a six-day licence.  As Deputy Linehan has said, a great many of them may have applied for a six-day licence originally in order to pay a smaller licence fee, but there is no doubt that a great many of the existing six-day licence holders are persons who applied for seven-day licences and did not get them.</P>

A very reasonable suggestion has been put forward by Deputy Lynch &mdash;that those people should be allowed to make their case before the district justice, who would also hear any objections put forward by competitors in the trade.  The Minister informs us that this opens up a very important matter, but I do not see why the Minister should not accede to our request, seeing that he has given way in regard to concessions as far as Dublin and other big centres are concerned. I think all sides of the House are agreed that a case has been made for those people.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello, I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, before Section 20, but in Part III of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by reason of the discontinuance of the business carried on in any premises an off-licence attached to such premises is extinguished or surrendered, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the goodwill of the business formerly carried on in the said premises <Col N="2435" /> has for valuable consideration been acquired by or on behalf of any person who was in the employment of the owner of the said business prior to its discontinuance, and</P>
    <P>(c)  such person is carrying on a business similar or analogous to the same business in premises (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the adjoining premises&rdquo;) adjoining or in the immediate vicinity of the premises to which the licence so extinguished or surrendered was attached,</P>
    <P>the justice at any sitting of the District Court shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Act of 1902 have power to grant an off-licence for the adjoining premises unless the justice refuses to issue such licence on one or more of the following grounds, namely, the character, misconduct or unfitness of the applicant or the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall continue in force until the 31st day of December, 1944, and no longer unless the Oireachtas otherwise determines.</P>
    <P>This amendment is meant to deal with an individual case, the case in Dame Street.  Has the Minister any objection to it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an objection.  In the other case, the Clery case, there was a licence in existence and it was allowed to lapse.  In this case, the premises were disposed of, the people actually in the business went out and people who were engaged there took over the premises next door, which never had a licence.  If they sold the other premises as a going concern there would have been no objection and the incoming people could have got a renewal of the licence.  This is an entirely new premises, and I see all sorts of objections to the granting of a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really no merit that I can see in this proposal.  I <Col N="2436" /> admit I have dealt with an individual case in this Bill, but there was much more merit in that case.  In this case, the whole premises have gone and they are to be devoted to a different purpose altogether, a drapery establishment as distinct from a grocery establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the situation is that there was an old-established firm there who had an off-licence. They carried on other business as well.  These people suddenly decided, without giving anybody a chance to arrange to take the whole premises, to sell out, and before these other people could get a group to buy over the whole premises, the sale was accomplished.  Then some of the people employed in the previous business in Dame Street took over the place next door.  They are not financially strong enough to go into the old line of business, but they propose to carry on as much of it as their resources will enable them to do.  They ask for a transfer of the off-licence.  If they were seeking an on-licence I can imagine it would be a much more serious proposition.</P>
      <P>I might point out that these people are going to give employment to quite a big proportion of the folk who were previously employed in the main establishment and they want a transfer of the off-licence.  The Minister will observe that the circumstances are very severely limited by the terms of Deputy Costello's amendment and the same situation will hardly ever arise again in the period specified in the amendment.  It will also be noted that the goodwill of the business has to be taken over by some person in the employment of the previous business prior to its discontinuance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment such a person is carrying on a business similar or analogous to the original business.  It would not affect a man opening the adjoining premises and carrying on a drapery business; he has to be in a business similar or analogous to the old business.  The whole thing is very limited.  If the licence transfer is not granted, there will be relatively great hardship arising.  These people felt <Col N="2437" /> that they would get the transfer and now they are going to be faced with the usual difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this would mean granting a new off-licence.  I see a difficulty there and I am sorry I cannot consent to what is proposed.  I do not see how I could.  In the other case a restaurant business was being carried on and the licence lapsed for a number of years.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Act of 1902 is hereby amended by the insertion after the words &ldquo;for consumption on&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;or off&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Act of 1902 says: &ldquo;Where, by reason of the expiration of a lease, a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquors for consumption on the premises comprised in the lease is extinguished or surrendered, the licensing authority may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, grant a licence for a suitable premises in the immediate vicinity of the premises to which the licence so extinguished or surrendered was attached.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to take up much time in advancing arguments in favour of the amendment.  It speaks for itself. I am satisfied that had there been an <Col N="2438" /> organised body or association of off-licence holders in existence in 1902, no amendment would now be necessary. I should like to ask the Minister whether he intends at an early date to introduce legislation releasing certain family grocers from what many of them regard as penal clauses, and whether he will give the same concessions to off-licence holders as he has given to on-licence holders.  An off-licence holder at present may find himself deprived of his licence and of his livelihood without any right of appeal and nothing has been brought into this Bill to safeguard him.  It is not necessary to stress the matter.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment, but if he can suggest an alternative which would be acceptable to him, I am in his hands, provided it achieves my object, that is, full protection for the family grocer, and that if there are two convictions, they might be removed and the family grocer given a fresh start.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, before Section 26, but in Part V of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in the Licensing (Ireland) Acts, 1833 to 1927, or in this Act, shall be deemed to prohibit any licensed person or his private friends from gaming by way of playing cards for stakes on licensed premises provided that such gaming is carried on in any part of such licensed premises other than the part in which the sale of intoxicating liquor generally takes <Col N="2440" /> place and the private friends of the licensed person are being <i>bona fide</i> entertained by him at his own expense.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a matter to which I want to call attention.  One of the Acts scheduled to the 1927 Act was the Licensing Act, 1872, Section 17, and the result of that section being scheduled is that if a person commits an offence against one of these enactments, there has to be an endorsement.  Section 17 of the Licensing Act of 1872 simply says: &ldquo;Permitting gaming on licensed premises&rdquo; Gaming has been the subject of definition in quite a number of Acts, but it is not quite clear which of the definitions is strictly brought into the 1872 Act.  There is a particular definition which means playing at any game where money passes, and the situation is that if a publican has friends on his premises and they are engaged in such an ordinary innocent matter as a game of bridge, so long as there are stakes on the game, the publican, if he is caught, may be prosecuted for permitting gaming on the premises.  It is clearly not intended to cover any such thing as that.  The amendment proposes to meet the position by tying it down very strictly and narrowly by saying that nothing in the earlier Acts shall be deemed to prevent a licensed person or his private friends from gaming by way of playing cards for stakes on licensed premises, provided that such gaming is carried on in what might be described as the private part of the establishment and that the private friends are being <i>bona fide</i> entertained by him at his own expense. I do not think there is anything wrong with the amendment, and I do not know whether the Minister feels that it is putting up a barrier against something which is not going to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it might be used as a sort of cloak.  There has been no complaint of any hardship, so far as I know.  The provision has not been carried out very strictly, and I have never got any complaints about it.  There is the danger, however, that if we take the provision out of the licensing code, it may help people to evade the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the situation that has to be met to get an exclusion. The publican must have people who are his private friends; they must be in the private part of the establishment; and if they are not playing an inhospitable game, the phrase is that they are being entertained <i>bona fide</i> at the publican's expense. All these provisos will cover the ordinary game of cards which a publican ought to be allowed to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the difficulty is that I know cases of suspicious circumstances, so to speak, of people not adverting to the gaming aspect at all whose premises were entered and to whom the police have expressed themselves to the effect that &ldquo;In the end, you were gaming on licensed premises&rdquo;.  That was the threat held out.  I can realise very well what the old Acts meant.  These old Acts were drafted in a frame of mind which I think is not at all the modern frame of mind, that is, that a publican was a sort of outcast who was not to be allowed to do things which the ordinary person could do, with the result that they prevented a variety of things happening on licensed premises, one of them being gaming, because it was suggested that, if it were allowed, those taking part would make merry and there would be general debauchery.  Look at the amendment: A publican entertaining his friends and having a game of cards in the private part of the establishment.  I do not think that will ever make much of a gap in the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a bridge drive in the Gresham Hotel. Strictly speaking, that is not legal either because it is a licensed premises, and the bridge drive is gaming. I suppose that should be regularised just as much as this.  My only objection is the one I have mentioned. I do not think people ought to be penalised in that fashion, but I should not like the amendment to be used as a cloak for evasion or that people should be able to put a deck <Col N="2442" /> of cards on the table and say they were friends of the publican.  Suppose there was a raid on a premises, and the people there went up and got out a deck of cards, and evaded the law in that way?</P>

      <P>In page 11, before Section 26, but in Part V of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall operate to prohibit or render unlawful the serving of intoxicating liquor at any time in premises which are for the time being an hotel, to persons accompanying a person then lodging in such premises providing that such intoxicating liquor is ordered and paid for by the person so lodging in the hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment having regard to the general attitude towards this question.  At present if a person calls to see a friend at an hotel there is difficulty about asking him to have a drink.  Of course the host may have a bottle in his room, or he may order a bottle to be brought there, but I am desperately opposed to bottles being brought into these rooms.  I much prefer that they should openly have a drink where they are having dinner or lunch, whether the drink be a glass of wine or a glass of whiskey.  I abhor the idea of driving people to bedrooms where they can drink out of bottles, whether it occurs in hotels or motor cars.  That is a vicious practice.  I do not see any reason why two respectable citizens, one of whom is staying in an hotel, cannot meet and, if necessary, <Col N="2443" /> transact some business and then have a drink.  I do not think any abuse can arise from that.  It may be said that it could by people with vicious minds who suspect everything.  I am speaking of a well-conducted hotel, and I suggest that it would be better to authorise what I propose rather than have back-stairs methods and have bottles brought to bedrooms.  I tried to put my proposal in such a way that nobody would be afraid of doing anything that was not within the licensing laws.  As Deputy McGilligan pointed out, conditions have changed enormously in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of other attractions besides drinking, such as picture houses, etc.  Hotels are now subsidised by the State and they will have a direct interest in seeing that their character and reputation are raised.  I put down the amendment to prevent abuse and the Minister would be wise to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is merely asking us to recognise what was generally thought to be the law for a number of years.  As far as I am aware, everyone was under the impression up to the decision in the High Court by Mr. Justice Hanna, in the case of the Attorney-General v. Carroll, that a permanent resident in an hotel was entitled to invite in a friend.  That was the generally accepted view up to that period.  The decision in the case of the Attorney-General v. Carroll then upset the applecart and gave rise to a number of vexatious and silly prosecutions. The amendment asks us to assume what everyone recognised was the law of the land, not only in connection with hotels but ordinary public houses, into which a cattle dealer who stayed there the night before a fair could invite a friend.  The amendment is a reasonable one and the Minister might accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of the amendment would do a great deal to clarify the present position.  There are people who believe that as the law stands they have the right to do this. <Col N="2444" /> It seems sensible to believe that if a man is resident in a hotel that is his dwelling for the time being.  There is no reason why during his period of residence there he should not have the same rights as if he were in his own home.  If a friend called he should be entitled to ask him to have a drink. That was accepted as the law until recent years.  The Minister should clarify the position by accepting the amendment or, if the drafting is not satisfactory, bringing in one of a similar nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the licensing laws could not be enforced at all if the amendment were accepted in regard to hotels.  There is no question about that.  People could go into them and the bars would be open. Everybody in the town could be there. We know that there are parts of the country where that was done and where there was no such thing as a closing hour.  I think Deputy Lynch is aware of that in one part of the country.  The police would not be able to enforce the licensing laws in hotels if the amendment were agreed to.  I could not accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister but I want to call his attention to another matter which was mentioned to me recently.  Take the position of a licensed hotel in which there is a surplus of visitors who are sent to other premises where no food is cooked. These people sleep on one premises, say, on Saturday night, but they have to return to the hotel on Sunday for meals.  It appears that they are not entitled to be on the hotel premises. That is a position that the Minister might look into.  Some officers of the Gárda mentioned it to me.  At seaside places there will be great difficulty in administering the law on Sundays if conditions of that kind are not provided for.</P>

I admit that if this could be confined to friends genuinely living in a hotel it would be reasonable.  I am well <Col N="2445" /> aware that it would not be confined to them.</P>

Until then a number of Circuit judges on appeal held that if a person was resident on licensed premises, and wanted a drink, he could have it on paying for it.</P>

It came to the notice of certain people that while the restaurant car attached to a train is licensed, it might be an offence for the waiter to bring a drink to a person sitting in a carriage attached to the restaurant car.  Apparently the licence will not cover the whole train, and if a person sent up to the restaurant car for a drink, the waiter would be committing an offence if he brought it to him.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, the reason I move the amendment at all is to meet a very obvious case.  In 90 per cent.  of cases a person who wants a drink will go down to the restaurant car, because it is much more comfortable, but occasionally you find people travelling who are not in good health or who are very old.  I think it is unreasonable that they should be obliged to go to the restaurant car.</P>

The railway company would have to face this difficulty, and they could not allow drink to be consumed generally in the carriages, because there would be objections to it.  There is, however, the odd case of people whom the railway company would like to serve and they do not think that it will be very difficult to meet any objections that <Col N="2447" /> might be made.  They feel that the legal impediment is there, that the restaurant car only is licensed.  The Minister himself knows that scenes that occur on a train are not caused by people who get drink on the train, but by people who bring drink with them into the train.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in order to promote the development of agriculture and industry, and to provide employment for our workers and remunerative prices <Col N="2448" /> for farm produce, without adding to the burden on the taxpayer or the consumer, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should promote legislation taking power to issue for the benefit of the people money and credit on the security of the State.</P>

      <P>I think only half an hour is left to finish this debate and, as probably the mover of the motion would like some time to reply, and others might want to join in the debate, I do not propose to take up much more of the time of the House.  There are, however, a few figures for which Deputy Belton and some other Deputies asked, and which I tried to get since the matter was last under discussion.  I should like to take this opportunity of giving them to the House, as they might be useful in other debates on this subject.  I am not quite sure whether, when speaking on the last occasion, I gave figures of the total money in circulation, including coins and notes of all kinds, in the month of June in each of the years from 1938 to 1942.  The figure for June, 1938, was £16,745,000.</P>

      <P>That did not take very long.  As regards farm improvement schemes, on which considerable sums have been spent, it may interest Deputy Cogan to hear that the amount spent in each of the financial years since the scheme was started are as follows:&mdash;in 1940-41, £54,448; in 1941-42, £154,272, and for the year 1942-43 it is estimated that the amount will be £230,000.  The number of grantees in <Col N="2449" /> 1940-41 was 11,969; in 1941-42, 18,244, and for the year 1942-43, the estimated number is 30,000.  I think everybody agrees that that is a good and useful scheme and that, perhaps, it could be still further extended with advantage to the farming community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton was very interested in making a comparison between the moneys in circulation in Britain and here for certain purposes.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt that something must be done to provide credit if we are to have business expanded. Some explanation is required as to how the Minister for Finance expects the business of this country to be done to-day with £22,000,000 of a note issue while Britain has £900,000,000 of a note issue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not waste the time of the House in reading that extract.  He asks why we have not expanded our note circulation at least in proportion to what the British have done.  He said also that if there were more money in circulation there would be more employment. Deputy Belton went back into the last war and quoted the figures for note circulation in existence in the United Kingdom then.  He made an estimate of the amount that was in circulation here.  I tried to get the figures in the meantime for his benefit and here they are.  In the four years 1914 to 1918, the note circulation of the then United Kingdom reached its peak in December, 1918.  The total in that month, including Bank of England notes, currency notes and notes of Irish and Scottish banks, amounted to £420,515,000.  Deputy Belton quoted another figure&mdash;£559,000,000&mdash;but did not tell us where he got it.  The total amount of notes of Irish banks in circulation in the four weeks ended 28th December, 1918, was £31,922,000.  In addition to this of course, there was in circulation here a certain number of Bank of England notes, but we have no means of knowing the number or value of them.  The total actual note circulation is not known, as the only figure available is in respect of the whole United Kingdom; and, of course, there is no way of sub-dividing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2450" /> Deputy Belton quoted a figure of £40,000,000 as being in circulation here &mdash;I think he said in the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;but he did not tell us how he got it.  I have tried to get a calculation made as to the amount.  We have looked up the Banking Commission Report.  They made an estimate that, at the time of that report, the total amount of British currency notes in circulation and held as till money in all Ireland was approximately £3,000,000.  That is the surest figure we can get.  Though it is probably a bit exaggerated, if we take it that in December, 1918, there was £6,000,000 in circulation in all Ireland, then the total amount of notes in circulation in all Ireland in that month was £37,922,000 or, say, £37,950,000.  It could be assumed that 70 per cent.  of these notes were in circulation and held as till money in the Twenty-Six Counties in that year.  That gives us a figure of £26,565,000, which is 70 per cent.  of the total £37,950,000.  That compares with the figure of £40,000,000 that Deputy Belton quoted the other day.  Wherever Deputy Belton got that figure, it would look as if it is an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>The note circulation for Éire in August, 1939, was £15,035,000, which includes legal tender notes and consolidated bank notes.  The corresponding figure in August, 1942, was £25,050,000, which is an increase of two-thirds or 66.6 per cent.  Deputy Belton quoted the figures for circulation as £22,000,000.  Evidently he was not looking at the latest figure, and probably omitted the consolidated bank notes.  In August, 1939, in the United Kingdom, the total amount of notes outstanding was £580,000,000. In August, 1942, the total was £940,000,000, which shows an increase of 62 per cent.  We show an increase of 66.6 per cent.  Therefore it would look as if we were keeping step fairly well, despite what Deputy Belton said as to the shortage of currency in circulation here.</P>
    <P>The Deputy then went on to say that we should have more money in circulation, as it would give more employment. I cannot accept his theory. There will be as much currency in circulation <Col N="2451" /> as the business of the community demands.  Probably in 1918, when there was a big rise at the end of the last war in the amount of money in circulation here and in Britain, the fact that it rose to such an extent was due to the fact that the value of all goods and services in the community had risen very steeply during the war. Deputies will remember what the prices for cattle were then: they are not anything comparable to those now.</P>
    <P>If the prices for all our produce and services were at the same money value, now as then, probably there would be a still further big increase in the currency in circulation.  Another thing that may account for the fact that there is not as much proportionately in circulation now&mdash;though there is not much difference&mdash;as at the end of 1918, is that cheques are more commonly used now.  There has been a great increase in the use of the cheque compared with the use of currency notes.  I think there has been a considerable increase in note circulation since the banks put on the extra charge a year or so ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of putting more money in circulation in order to provide more employment, the mere fact of putting currency in circulation &mdash;if it could be done, if the banks could pump out more money&mdash;does not mean that there would be more employment, as you have to get people to use the money.  At present the banks have very considerably increased sums at their disposal in the way of deposits that they would be glad to hand out and glad to find people to use.</P>

      <P>That is not Deputy Belton's statement.  If Deputy Hickey has another statement to make, I will <Col N="2452" /> answer it at another time, I hope.  The banks have very considerably increased deposits at their disposal and they cannot get people to use them.  It would mean extra profit for them if they could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, they are no use under present conditions.  It is not the banks' fault, and not businessmen's fault either, as it largely arises through the absence of raw materials for industry.  That is the reason why so much additional money is lying idle in the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister having spoken the last night, also spoke to-night.  My name was mentioned a couple of times by the Minister, and other Deputies mentioned that there were bids in respect of these matters. It is unfortunate that, on a motion of this sort, we should have only three hours and that most of the time should be taken up with figures which were given twice.  Deputy Corry said that some bidding was going on and that this was a bigger bid than that which had been made by the Fine Gael Party. The programme in connection with the development of agriculture, as outlined <Col N="2453" /> by me, was one which sought to improve the gainful production of the agricultural industry, generally.  Comparisons have been made between this country and Great Britain.  In Great Britain, the advances to agriculture amount to about 6.5 per cent.  Up to 1936, the advances in this country amounted to about 25 per cent.  It is obvious that agriculture here is in a very different position from agriculture in Great Britain.  The objection I have to this motion is that it is a proposal, so far as one can judge from its face, to issue money without backing.  It has been stated in the course of this debate that we have an arrangement or bargain with the Bank of England.  If such a bargain ever took place, it escaped my attention.  I knew nothing of such a bargain in 1927 and I have not heard of it since.  If you lodge your money, it is not necessary to bargain with the bank as to taking it out when you wish.  We were as independent of the Bank of England in 1927 as we are to-day.  There has been no improvement in our relations with the Bank of England since 1927.  There is a disimprovement so far as our currency is concerned, inasmuch as we have it backed exclusively by sterling. That is beside the first part of this motion, which is concerned with employment and production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the proposals we have put forward for increasing the production of agriculture are concerned, we believe that agriculture is not likely to be in a position to pay the ordinary interest rates charged here.  Those interest rates compare favourably with interest rates in other parts of the world, even taking much richer countries than ours into consideration. They compare favourably with British and general American rates, though perhaps not with New York rates, as was stated in the Banking Commission report.  The figures given by the Minister deal with negligible numbers. Assuming that there was no repetition of advances to any farmer in any of those years, it means that 20 per cent. of the farmers have got improvement loans.  That is not the way to develop agriculture.  It must be developed on a scientific and sound basis.  So far as that is concerned, money should be advanced <Col N="2454" /> to agriculturists at the earliest possible moment at negligible rates of interest&mdash;if it is not possible to advance it free of interest.  The war has given us an increase in prices, but nobody has ever suggested that the agricultural industry, as such, is in a prosperous condition&mdash;prosperous in the sense of increasing its production. That is the main consideration.  Pigs are practically out of production. Butter production has diminished. Poultry production is diminishing and there are rumours that even the number of sheep is going down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that the rumour is circulating that the numbers are going down?  The Minister took long enough holding up this debate without interrupting other members. I said that it was rumoured&mdash;and rumoured by people who know&mdash;that the number of sheep is going down. While there is an increase in the index price in respect of agriculture, that does not establish that the industry is in a healthy, productive state.  We want to ensure that it will be in that condition after the war.  While disagreeing with the pumping of money from the printing press, I think that the State should provide money free of interest to ensure the necessary production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has, I think, more or less, established a case for this <Col N="2455" /> motion by admitting that agriculture cannot at the present time pay interest on the credit which is available. Agriculture is the foundation of this country.  It is the one and only real industry.  It is the industry upon which the entire nation must depend.  If that industry cannot pay the rates of interest demanded, there must be something wrong.  There would, certainly, be a case for the proposal of Deputy Cosgrave to provide money out of the taxpayer's pocket to relieve agriculture if there were no alternative. But I might point out that to provide money out of the taxpayer's pocket for this purpose would be very poor relief inasmuch as the farmer is, in the main, the taxpayer.  To whom are those rates of interest paid but a small monopoly who control the issue of money to which they have no right. Credit is the property of the State inasmuch as it is based upon the productive capacity of the people.  There is no gold at the back of the currency in circulation.  There is nothing behind it but the productive capacity of the people.  We may be told that there is behind every note issued here the credit of the Bank of England inasmuch as every note is backed by a Bank of England note.  But what is behind the Bank of England note? Nothing but the credit of the British community.  There we have a position which is somewhat similar to a belief held in the early ages, that the earth rested upon an elephant's back, but that the elephant stood upon nothing. We have the security of the British note behind our currency, but there is nothing behind British currency but the belief of the British people in their own Government and in their own empire.  I submit that the Irish nation is as good a security in this insecure world as any other nation, large or small, and that for that reason our currency and credit should be based upon the productive capacity of the Irish people.  If it were, it would be possible for the Government, or for the central bank, to provide the money which is required for the development of agriculture and the relief of unemployment without imposing the burden of interest-rates upon the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2456" /> The Minister, when speaking on this motion, appeared to adopt an irresponsible attitude.  He seemed to try to befog the issues completely by producing a huge volume of figures which have no bearing on the motion. Deputy Corry, as the first official spokesman in this House for the Bank of England and the upholding of orthodox finance, made a much better case.  He trotted out the old argument which is the last resource of all those who try to prevent economic reform in this country.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a proposal to issue money with a wave of the hand; to turn the printing press and print an unlimited volume of money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion of that kind in the motion.  Those who have studied this question are convinced that the issue of money should be in scientific relation to the economic needs of the community, that that issue should not be in the hands of a Party Minister for Finance, but in the hands of a body which would have a definite statutory duty to perform, namely, to finance production and to ensure that every available man in this country is in permanent employment.</P>
    <P>As the time is limited, I should like the opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Deputy McGilligan for the stand which he took on this motion. He made a very useful and very important contribution to this debate and one which I think will bear fruit in this country.  When we find a man of his outstanding ability prepared to come forward and advocate a reform such as is outlined here, it ought to impress people like Deputy Corry who are inclined just to take a Party view of the matter.  Deputy McGilligan did not view the matter from a Party angle; he viewed it from the point of view of the welfare of the nation.</P>
    <P>Three questions were asked by Deputy Kennedy which, in my opinion, demand a straightforward answer, as they were proper and straightforward questions.  He asked: have we the means to expand agricultural production in this country?  I am sure Deputy Kennedy cannot but be aware of the fact that essential supplies of agricultural products such as butter, bacon <Col N="2457" /> and oatmeal&mdash;and I believe in a very short time a number of others&mdash;as well as feeding stuffs for livestock are in short supply.  Surely there is room for increasing the output in these particular branches of agriculture.  There is also need for the employment of men in the improvement of the land by drainage and reclamation.  Is not that a useful purpose to which money, provided as outlined in this motion, could be used?  The Deputy also asked: how are the loans to be repaid?  There is no mention of loans in this motion. This motion seeks to utilise the credit of the State for the purpose of expanding the volume of money so as to provide for the relief of unemployment and for improved prices for agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>We know that the volume of money has increased from year to year.  We know that the volume of money in this country at present is far in excess of what it was 30 years ago; that it has probably doubled or more than doubled.  How was that increase brought about?  Simply by the printing and issuing of money.  The difference was that the issue of money on the security of the State was in the hands of a small private monopoly who utilised that increased issue of money for profit-making.  This motion proposes that that increase in the volume of money should be revenue to the State, should be non-repayable and free of interest.  Since there is an increase in the volume of money provided, surely it should be regarded as revenue.</P>
    <P>Then the Deputy asked a third question: how are remunerative prices to be fixed?  Surely anyone who has any knowledge of economics will know that a remunerative price is a price which will cover the cost of production and at least leave a margin of profit.  That, I think, would answer that question.  It may be asked: how are we under this motion to provide for economic prices?  The proposition is that we must guarantee to the Irish producer remunerative prices and, if the consumer is unable to pay to the farmer a price which will cover the cost of production, it is the duty of the <Col N="2458" /> State, as outlined in this motion, to close the gap between the remunerative price and the price which the consumer can pay.  There is not time to deal with all the matters raised, but I think this motion has served a useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I move the following motion standing in the names of Deputy Norton, Deputy Murphy and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>So as to give effect without further delay to the undertakings in Article 45 of the Constitution that the State shall direct its policy towards securing that the citizens may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, Dáil Eireann requests the Government immediately to formulate proposals for absorbing into useful employment at adequate remuneration all adult citizens able and willing to follow useful occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this motion is a suitable follow-on to the one which has preceded it.  It is an important motion. I suppose that everybody who moves a motion is inclined to say that it is the most important one which has yet been moved.  But I make bold to say that this is the most important motion which could be suggested for discussion in this House, much more important than its treatment by the Government would seem to warrant.  It is similar to a motion put down by the Labour Party which is on the Order Paper since March, 1942.  It has been allowed to hang there since, and it is similar in terms, practically, to another motion which was tabled by the Labour Party in 1940 and which, at that time, was allowed to hang on the Order Paper for almost 12 months until it was skilfully and scientifically sidetracked by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy MacEntee, who introduced an amendment to it, the effect of which was to take from the Labour Party's motion the kernel of speed which we had put <Col N="2459" /> in.  We had asked for a commission to be set up to ascertain the cause and incidence of unemployment in industry and agriculture with a view to seeking a remedy for it, and we also asked that a time limit should be put on the findings of that commission.  By taking out that portion of the motion which referred to a time limit, the Minister left the motion innocuous, and that was carried through this House by the votes of the Fianna Fáil members only.  Nobody else voted in the Lobby for the Minister's amendment.  It was carried by 54 votes to 32, I think, and since then nothing has happened.  I think it will be of interest if I read the Minister's amendment which was carried on that occasion by the sole and complete vote of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;nobody else in the House voting for it.  It was as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A commission should be appointed to inquire into and report upon the extent, cause, incidence, general character, and other aspects of unemployment, and to make proposals in relation thereto.  Dáil Eireann requests the Government to appoint such a commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's amendment to the Labour Party's motion which, as I have said, wanted to have a definite time limit on the findings of the proposed commission.  There were 32 votes against the Minister's amendment, and 54 votes&mdash;all Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;in support of his amendment.  Evidently, the 54 Fianna Fáil Deputies thought it sufficient to await the Minister's decision on the matter.  I say that the Minister had no serious intention in his mind to give effect to that, and that he was just using it as a means of sidetracking any definite proposal or effort by the Labour Party to grapple with what we considered to be really the only serious problem in this country to-day and for years past, the solution of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Two years later, the subject again comes up before the Minister and the House, and it comes up because the Minister and the Government have failed to make any reasonable attempt to deal with the problem of unemployment, or at least any such attempt as members of this House ought to expect, <Col N="2460" /> because it would not be true to say that the Government did nothing to solve the unemployment problem in this country, since they certainly facilitated the exodus of our people to Great Britain to get employment there, although they did not make any effort to provide employment for them here. That is the line of least resistance&mdash; the attempt to solve the problem by the deportation of our people, and I am using the word &ldquo;deportation&rdquo; advisedly. In the past 12 months, 1,000 of our men and women have left this country per week, which means that, within 12 months, approximately 52,000 of our people have left this country.  I think it will be agreed that thereby we are making a free gift to another country of about £1,000 per head, taking into account what it costs to bring these people up, and so on, and a rough calculation will show that we are therefore making a free gift to England of £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 per week from the point of view of the potential value of these people of ours.</P>
    <P>England is able to find plenty of work for them.  They are potential munition workers and, in many instances, they are potential soldiers, because many of them are joining the British Army, but they are definitely exported from this country and, as I say, deported, because of the absolute failure of our Government to grapple with the problem of unemployment here or to give these people an opportunity to build up the fortunes of this country rather than carry on the services of another country.</P>
    <P>A good deal of capital is being made in certain places out of the action of the German conqueror in resorting to the practice of driving out the unemployed men in the occupied countries to work in Germany, making munitions, producing food, and so on. That is bad enough, but that is being done by the conqueror of these peoples.  Our people have not that satisfaction, if one might call it so. Our people are compelled by a native Government to go and work in another country&mdash;a native Government which refuses to take sufficient interest in them to provide them with work here at home or to make it worth their while to stay at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2461" /> We had recently in this city the annual meeting of that voluntary and benevolent society, the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  That society certainly could not be alleged to have any political bias, one way or another, and their comments on the present situation are of very great interest to anybody concerned with the affairs of the State.  In their recent appeal for funds, in October, 1942, that excellent organisation, which has more intimate contact with the victims of poverty than anybody else in this country, said that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  Poverty and destitution are rife in Dublin;</P>
    <P>(b)  many of our men and women are so weak from under-nourishment that, even if employment were offered them, they could not undertake any kind of heavy work;</P>
    <P>(c)  thousands of people are without sufficient personal and bed-clothing;</P>
    <P>(d)  the never-ending struggle to provide food and clothing often results in non-payment of rent and constant fear of eviction;</P>
    <P>(e)  the poor have no reserve of food or fuel for the winter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the description of poverty and of the victims of poverty published widespread by the non-political, humanitarian St. Vincent de Paul Society in October, 1942, and can anybody challenge the correctness of it? Anybody who knows the close and intimate contact that that society has with the poor in the City of Dublin and in other cities must know that it is only too painfully true.</P>
    <P>We have allowed all these thousands of people to leave this country to seek employment in Britain, and still we have 60,000 registered as unemployed at the labour exchanges, and I do not think I would be exaggerating if I were to say that there are another 40,000 unemployed who are not on the register, who do not bother to go into the labour exchanges because they feel that it is not worth while.  On the official register, however, there are 60,000 signing at the labour exchanges, plus the numbers that have gone to Britain, and they are admitted to be <Col N="2462" /> at the rate of 1,000 a week for the last couple of years.  I have not the exact figures as to the numbers who went to Britain since 1939, but I have a shrewd idea of what they would be.  At any rate, they have been absorbed by England, and have been given good wages to perform her functions, whereas we could not afford to keep them here at all.  Now, unemployment is not by any means inevitable.  It will scarcely be denied that we could provide work of national importance here in this country for these people.  In the last few hurried words of Deputy Cogan he referred to the work that is here.  It has not been challenged that there is good, useful work of national reconstruction to be done.  Deputy Cogan spoke of reafforestation.  I also speak of it.  We have land reclamation, river drainage, coast erosion schemes, road widening, and reclamation of land that has gone into waste and could be restored into good arable land.  Will anybody suggest that that is not good, useful, national work on which our people could be employed?  The Minister for Finance, a few minutes ago, referred to the lack of raw material, but the question of raw material does not arise there.  There is plenty of useful work here to be performed by Irishmen, if the Government will set their hands to the doing of it.  The Minister for Finance, about a quarter of an hour ago, also said that it was not a question of money, as he said that the money is and will be available, whenever necessary, for the fulfilling of the nation's demands.  He said that the bankers have plenty of money, and are prepared to make it available if the people are prepared to take it, but that these people are not prepared to take it, mainly because of the lack of raw material.  That is not, by any stretch of imagination, an answer to the point contained in this motion.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the biggest problem of this or any other Government will be the building up of our population and maintaining them at home.  We are declining in population.  In fact, before the war, we were the only white race in Europe that was declining.  We are declining because there are late marriages and long-delayed marriages because of the fact that people have <Col N="2463" /> not the courage to get married; they have no prospects; there is no work for them.  We are told about the flight from the countryside.  Quite recently, an attempt has been made to stop that.  We are now offering to our rural workers, rather belatedly, a retainer of 5/- a week to keep them in the country.  It is a very belated effort. It is like closing the door when the horse has gone.  That effort may have the effect of retaining the bare minimum for the saving of our crops, but it is no answer for the Government's assistance, I might say, in the departure of thousands of men and women who should be engaged at home on works of national reconstruction. The responsibility for this calamitous condition of affairs cannot be laid upon the shoulders of any individual. It was taken on to the shoulders of the Government themselves when they framed the Constitution.  Article 45 was written into the Constitution for some specific purpose.  It gives guidance and direction to the Government and Parliament in regard to policy which can be expressed only in legislation and in the administrative acts which flow from legislation.  The Article declares:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing that the citizens ... may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not visualise the citizens of this State living on doles or on private and public charity.  That Constitution visualised the virile, healthy, active members of the Irish race being put to work in their own country to earn their livelihood by their own occupation and to create their own incomes by the wealth they would produce. We have here private and public charities overloaded.  We are sinking into a race of charity mongers.  We have perfect respect for the charity, but we think it is unfair that the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other organisations of that character should be loaded with the responsibility which the Government accepted in <Col N="2464" /> that Article of the Constitution and which is their responsibility if they never put that pious Article into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>No reason has been adduced for the lethargy of the Government.  It points from time to time to the amount of money spent on social services. £5,000,000, £6,000,000 and up to £7,000,000 is spent annually on social services.  We have great respect for them, but I suggest that the magnitude of the figure is merely evidence of the failure of the Government to grapple with the problem in its true perspective. If our people were put to useful employment the money required for the social services would dwindle considerably because, as I have said, the people would be earning and creating wealth in the country rather than being a drag on the wheels of prosperity in the country.  We see a declining population and we see the existing population pegged down to low-wage levels. We see the arrears that were left to us by an alien Government still existing after 20 years of two native Governments. The present Government seem to have no more intention of grappling with the problem in 1942 than they had when they were a perfectly new Government, buoyed up with good ideas and hopes in 1932.</P>
    <P>Will it be argued, for instance, that it is beyond the competence of the Government or of any Government to provide such schemes of work as will absorb our people and put them into employment and keep them at home? The Labour Party are not talking like the hurler on the ditch.  We are not talking the day after the fair.  We were before the Government in 1939 and submitted proposals similar to those I am mentioning here to-night.  The following year the Labour Party published a little pamphlet entitled <i>Planning for the Crisis,</i> which sets down exactly what we have in our minds in this motion.  The only reply to that from the Government was the sneer of Deputy Lemass that it was visionary and unworthy of serious consideration. That, evidently, is the policy of the Government to-day.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has not departed <Col N="2465" /> one inch from the ideas that prompted us to draft that programme in that little pamphlet.  We believed the urgency existed then, and we believe it has increased with every day that has since passed.  We charge the Government that they are deliberately and wilfully responsible for the lowering of the virility of our people, for lowering the standards of our people at home. As the St. Vincent de Paul Society tells us, the people are scarcely able to work when work is offered to them because of the poor state of health they are in as a result of continuous periods of unemployment.  The Unemployment Assistance Act was passed through this House as a pledge on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government that an Irishman was entitled to work or maintenance in his own country and that between periods of employment on schemes of work which might be necessary, there would be small gaps of unemployment during which he was entitled to maintenance allowance.  I am prepared to say that that maintenance allowance was not intended to be a living wage.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Government as expressed at the time was that such periods of unemployment would be infrequent and of short duration and, therefore, it would be necessary to give only a maintenance allowance until the men would go to another scheme of work.  The schemes of work have not materialised since then. Periods of unemployment have become more long drawn out.  Many of our workers throughout the country have the experience of being employed perhaps three, four or six weeks in the year.  Six weeks is sometimes considered a big amount of work in the 12 months.  I am speaking from actual experience.  Men in my constituency tell me: &ldquo;I have done six weeks' work in the entire year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only effort made to implement that first promise was to draw the machinery more tightly in administering the Unemployment Assistance Acts and their provisions, to get more inspectors and more inside information, more anonymous letters, to see if they could trap a man and rob him of the few shillings given him at the <Col N="2466" /> labour exchange.  For instance, the fact that a man might be seen digging a drill of potatoes at the back of his own house might be quite sufficient for someone to send an anonymous letter to the labour exchange and, automatically, that man would be struck off. That guarantee to the Irish worker that he was entitled to maintenance as long as work could not be provided for him is and should be as sacred as any other piece of legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>As a result of unemployment the physique of our people has deteriorated and the health of the children has deteriorated.  We are now reaping the whirlwind.  Reports received every other day tend to show us that T.B., that we thought we had under control a couple of years ago, is again on the increase. I think it can hardly be challenged, taking the reports of the medical officers of health throughout the country, that that increase is largely attributable to hunger or, as we now call it, malnutrition.  I have heard statistics given from the Government Benches, I think on the occasion of the last Estimates, that malnutrition was on the decrease.  Anything can be proved with figures, but I would ask the Government to take serious cognisance of this point: wherever they get their statistics, they do not square with the actual facts.  Malnutrition is rampant in the country.  It is showing itself, unfortunately, in the increase of T.B. and we have not sufficient sanatoria in the country to grapple with the disease.  I think it is all directly&mdash;not even indirectly&mdash;attributable to the failure of the Government to give effect to what is asked to be given effect to in this motion and what was asked to be given effect to in the motion of the Labour Party practically two years ago.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government what have they done since then to implement the promise they made to this nation when 54 members of the Fianna Fáil Party walked into that Lobby in support of the amendment of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy MacEntee, which in point of fact was similar to ours except for the one thing, that there was no period to it. <Col N="2467" /> Ours was too precise.  Ours reckoned that the problem was too serious.  The Minister evidently did not think it was serious, but he succeeded in capturing the vote of his majority and pawning it off on the people and did nothing. That has been the effect of the amendment of Deputy MacEntee that was passed here almost two years ago.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party feels that even now it is not too late&mdash;it is certainly not too early&mdash;to make the attempt.  I think it is belated, but certainly there is no necessity to wait until the end of hostilities, until the period of emergency has passed.  We think that now is the time to grapple with this unemployment problem.  We do not think it should be beyond the competence of any Government to deal seriously with it.  If the Government say that they are unable to put all our unemployed people to work, what will their answer be when our exiles in England return home after the war?  If they are not able to deal with the lesser evil that faces us to-day, how do they expect to grapple with the greater evil to be faced when the emergency has passed? The Government may plead a lack of raw materials.  I would not regard that as a serious answer, since the question of raw materials does not enter very largely into the schemes that I have outlined.  These schemes are mainly of an agricultural character.  For example, afforestation, the reclamation of land and river drainage works, if undertaken at once, would absorb a considerable number of our unemployed.  Housing schemes might, to some extent, be impeded by a lack of raw materials, but even these could, I suggest, be undertaken under present conditions.  We have cement and stones.  We may have a shortage of timber.  We have plenty of lime and sand and of native timber.  I understand that where native timber has been employed the results have been satisfactory.  If it is seasoned over a period of three or four months it can, I understand, be utilised in building schemes.  Slates ought not to be unprocurable here, so that really with the materials available in the country there is nothing to prevent us from <Col N="2468" /> going ahead with housing schemes. Why not put our idle men into employment on vast housing schemes and on the other schemes that I have outlined?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that these works should be undertaken on money borrowed at exorbitant rates of interest from the banks.  May I say that, I think, is the kernel of the Government's trouble; that they feel they ought not to upset the present practice of going to the banks for loans.  What we think the Government should do is to take their courage in their hands, especially when we propose to undertake works of a national character, the effect of which will be to put our people into useful employment. The execution of such works ought to be possible without going to a private institution for money on which high interest charges have to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Government ought to be capable of taking such control of the credit of the country as will result in putting our idle people to work on those waiting schemes that I have mentioned. The failure to connect our idle people with such waiting schemes is, in my view, a blot on the escutcheon of the Government, or on any Government that would permit such a situation to exist.  If the Government were to take control of credit, houses could be provided at rents the people could afford to pay.  Those of us who are connected with public bodies are aware of the difficulties that prevent them from providing the people with houses at rents they can afford to pay.  These public bodies are working in co-operation with the Department of Local Government. I want to give that Department every credit for all that it has done under the Housing Acts passed since 1932.  But the position is that the local authorities are hamstrung in their efforts owing to the high interest charges they have to meet on the loans made available.  The result is that the houses cannot be let at rents which are within the means of the occupiers to pay.  Slum areas are being cleared and the people are being put into decent houses.  The houses are not too good for our people, because our workers are deserving of the best that can be <Col N="2469" /> provided.  But they are in this position that, under present conditions, they cannot afford the rents that are being charged.  In connection with housing schemes carried out by local authorities, the position has been reached that the interest charges on the loans almost equal the cost of the labour and materials employed in the houses.  That is an impossible condition of affairs.  We suggest there should be no necessity to have recourse to the banks for the money needed. The Government, in our submission, should have sufficient control in their own house to be able to create credit, and thereby put men into employment on the creation of what would eventually become valuable national assets. The Government should be able to do that without asking leave from the commercial banks or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the time for an inquiry as to the causes and incidence of unemployment has been wasted and frittered away.  We know too much about the causes and the incidence of unemployment. The time has now arrived when action should be taken without delay.  I suggest that this motion is entitled to the immediate and serious consideration of the Government, that there should be no further sidetracking of it and no further dodging of the issues involved, as happened under the amendment that was set down two years ago.  It is practically two years since this question was first dealt with, but nothing has been done to check the evil, which has grown worse in the meantime.  In my view it is the most serious evil that is facing the country to-day.  I cannot understand the Government's serenity so far as this question is concerned.  They seem to have become more and more unaware of the seriousness of the problem.  The solution of dealing with our unemployed by sending them out of the country is not one that ought to be offered to this House by any Government.  The policy should be one of providing work for Irishmen in their own country, and not one that would oblige them to go to England to seek work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  Reading the terms of the <Col N="2470" /> motion and listening to the speech in support of it made by my colleague, Deputy Keyes, my mind goes back to a period 20 years ago, when I first became a member of this House.  This subject is a very old one.  It was one of the first subjects that the Parliament elected in 1923 concerned itself with. The urge for consideration of it at that time came from the benches that are now sponsoring this motion.  We can all remember the disappointment of those early years, that no big steps were taken to deal with the unemployment problem.  Looking back, one can remember that there were other problems as well as this one that had to be dealt with at that time.  It was because of their existence that this one had to take a more or less secondary place.  There was no reason, however, why it should have taken a secondary place in later years.  Certain statements made by the Taoiseach before 1927 gave room for the hope that when he came in here in that year a new era had begun for this country.  Certain other statements which he made in the House gave stronger grounds for that hope.  He told us that there was no country in the world that was so suitable for solving the unemployment problem as this country.  He made other statements of the same kind. We had a repetition of statements of that kind, and hopes of that kind raised, during the period from 1927 to 1932.  In 1932 the Taoiseach and his colleagues got an opportunity of showing how real were their promises and their schemes for dealing with unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the ten years from 1932 to 1942, and see how all those hopes have been completely shattered throughout the country.  Deputy Keyes said that in the last two years or in the last 12 months we did nothing&mdash; that nothing happened.  I think he was wrong; we did something; we issued 50,000 permits to people to leave this country.  That was certainly something very big, and it should not be overlooked. The returns for the 12 months from October, 1941, to October, 1942, show that 50,000 people were deported out of this country.  Yet, the Taoiseach goes around to the various functions <Col N="2471" /> all over the country and says that there are not enough men in the Defence Forces.  How could there be, when he is sending them out of the country?  How can there be members of the Defence Forces here when poverty and their own Government's neglect of them is driving them out of the country?  This is a subject on which it is difficult to speak with restraint.  It is a subject that goes to the very root of our life here, and it is one that has been disgracefully neglected by the present Government. If there was one cardinal point in their programme that one can remember, it was the promise to make this question of the relief of unemployment the foremost item in their policy.  By their fruits you shall know them, and judging the present Government by their callous neglect of the unemployment position in this country up to 1939&mdash;because whatever excuse they might claim in the last year or two there was none up to that time&mdash;they stand condemned before the public of this country, and I venture to say that public opinion will not be slow to bring in a verdict for the years of betrayal and neglect in regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>An American journal lately stated&mdash; I have not seen any contradiction of the statement &mdash; that 200,000 Irish people are employed in British war industries at the present time.  It is a strange contradiction of our claim to be neutral that 200,000 of our people, if that statement is right, are employed in manufacturing the equipment necessary in war, but nobody can have any word of blame for the people concerned. The majority of them had no desire to leave this country.</P>
    <P>There is no use in dodging the issue by saying that a great many young people have left the country because of their desire for change&mdash;because the attractions of life in another country lured them away from their own land. Anybody who wants to face the facts, and who knows what has been the condition of affairs in the big cities in England in the last two years, must readily admit that there was some strong compelling reason why all those <Col N="2472" /> people left this country, and inevitably one is forced to the conclusion that in the majority of their cases the reason for it was poverty.  I wish all the Ministers could have seen, as some of us did, this trek from the different parts of Cork County to the railway station in Cork, and those mournful scenes that have been a regular feature of travelling here in the last two or three years.  The people who have gone away have not all been young people; men pretty well advanced in years figured in considerable numbers.  One can imagine the number of homes disturbed, the number of people sundered from their relations.  The most outstanding condemnation of our claim to the right to govern ourselves is the fact that 20 years after an Irish Parliament was established we have no remedy for our unemployment problem but to send our young people away, and no remedy for the problems of those who remain at home except to give them vouchers and assistance of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>As I am on that subject, I want to associate myself very strongly with the comments of a colleague of mine in this House recently on the question of vouchers.  I deprecate and deplore this whole paraphernalia as being reminiscent of the period after the famine when the remedy for unemployment in this country was the making of the roads which are still pointed out as &ldquo;the famine roads&rdquo;.  I hope it will not be said in the years to come that 1941 and 1942 represented the period when we sent the bulk of our people away and provided vouchers for those who remained at home, branding them as a class apart, as they are being branded in this country at the present time.</P>
    <P>The home assistance regulations brand them in the same way.  An auditor of the Local Government Department went down to West Cork some time ago and passed very serious strictures on public representatives because they did not give in kind half the amount allocated in public assistance to certain classes of people.  A person in receipt of 5/-, 6/-, 7/- or 10/- a week home assistance got that sum in money previously.  Then an order from Merrion Street, or from the <Col N="2473" /> Custom House, I do not know which, provided that half that sum should be paid by way of a voucher to a local shop and the remaining half in cash. I object to a system of that kind which tends to degrade our people.  I think it is one of the most sordid symptoms of the kind of decay and servility that has overtaken our country.</P>

      <P>I am in possession, Sir, and I am entitled to make my case. I say that that person goes in stamped and branded as a pauper when he goes in with a voucher to get food or some other commodity.  That system is based on the assumption that he is not fit to handle money; that he must be protected against himself and must be compelled to take something else that is measured out to him rather than have the management of the 5/- or 6/- or 10/- himself.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach has no more rights than any other member of this House in regard to interrupting, or in endeavouring to side-track things that may be very unpleasant for him but are equally, if not more, unpleasant for the people in the country who have to put up with them.  I consider that it is a disgraceful thing that we should have in this country a system of marking out our poor people, who are unemployed people, and deliberately degrading them in this way.  This particular system compels a person to go to a shop and accept goods in a particular way.  Very often the shop is designated and I doubt if there is always the free choice in the obtaining of these goods that there ought to be. All this goes to show that there is abroad in the country a mentality that the poor people cannot look after themselves or cannot be trusted to expend their few shillings properly or advantageously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, speaking in this city a couple of nights ago, challenged all and sundry to repeat the statement that his Government were incompetent, and he threatened us that if that statement was made in the future we might have to submit to a general election.  This is the new philosophy of the present Government as expounded by the Minister for Local Government, who has been the champion figure in that Government in making extraordinary statements.  That certainly was a most extraordinary statement.  The Minister must now know, if he did not already recognise it, that the viewpoint that his Government are incompetent is fast becoming the viewpoint of the majority of our people.  I say that the people have been very patient in giving his colleagues and himself a chance of dealing with the problems <Col N="2475" /> that have arisen in this country, more particularly the unemployment problem. The Minister for Local Government must recognise, and he can convince himself of the fact very easily, that despair and misery are mainly the result of the policy pursued by his Government.</P>
    <P>I remember the introduction here of a provision which would in some degree go towards meeting the principle of maintenance in the absence of work. I want to repeat what has been said often from this quarter of the House, that neither we nor the unemployed have ever regarded unemployment assistance as a solution of the difficulty. I want to see the time in this country, and I hope we will all live to see it, when unemployment assistance and everything else like it will be abolished, and when we will have instead the natural and proper substitute, work for the people.</P>
    <P>Let us take the manner in which unemployed people have been treated. For the past two or three years there has been in force a system that has been given the rather high-sounding official title of an Employment Period Order.  That Employment Period Order has operated in the rural districts generally from March to October. It has meant that single men, widowers without dependents, and small farmers, received nothing in the way of maintenance during the period from March to October.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was not satisfied with the money saved in that direction and it has been extended to cover all classes of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  From March to October there is no unemployment assistance for them and they have to seek relief by going to the home assistance officer or elsewhere.  The average saving that has been made in that connection amounts to £250,000&mdash;I think that was the figure last year.</P>
    <P>This Government that set out to treat the unemployed fairly, that described themselves as the poor man's Government, took £250,000 from the poor people and returned it to the Exchequer. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, returning <Col N="2476" /> a large sum of money allocated for certain schemes a couple of years ago, said it was going back to the Exchequer because there were no suitable schemes upon which it could be expended.  If anything could add insult to injury, it was a statement like that.  First of all, the Government saved £250,000 at the expense of the poor and the unemployed and then we had an added insult through the statement that there were no suitable schemes to be undertaken and therefore certain moneys could not be expended.  On top of all that we had the Minister for Finance saying recently that it was not money we were short of in this country but schemes on which to expend money.</P>
    <P>The Government's contribution to the solution of the unemployment problem took the form of offering a few crumbs here and there, £40 or £50 for a bog road, or the opening of small drainage schemes and the payment of 4/11 a day to men in the depth of winter.  That was their contribution, and that is how we are to interpret the Constitution that was made an issue at a general election and in regard to which the most hectic enthusiasm was worked up in order to convince the people that it was a great measure of liberation.  We have had some experience of the amount of liberation it has brought us.  Many men are not able to get work for the full week; their employment has been restricted to a few days a week, and all they have received was 4/11 a day.  So far as assistance to the unemployed is concerned, we have the case where the sum of 4/- was given recently to a man with a family of five to maintain.  That is the manner in which the unemployment problem is being tackled; that is how the poor are treated, yet our Constitution invokes the Divine aid on our work in this country.  One does not want to say too much in describing that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes touched on a very vital point in regard to the terrible post-war problem that faces this country.  Whatever the end of the war is going to be, whether Great Britain is victorious or otherwise, one thing is certain and that is that war employmen will terminate once hostilities are <Col N="2477" /> over, or a short time afterwards, and every other form of employment will be very seriously contracted, and it is a reasonable presumption that the bulk of the people who have gone to Great Britain within the last couple of years will return here and will have to be accommodated in some way.  They will come here to find that while they have been away we have not been able to provide for those left behind, not to mention the formulation of plans to absorb them when they return here. The prospect is a terrible one.  I wonder have the Government given it any consideration.  Have they even considered setting up a commission of one kind or another that would deliberate in silence and secrecy? <Col N="2478" /> Probably that will be their only remedy.  I say that there is going to be a very unhappy state of affairs in this country after the war.  I wonder if, at the eleventh hour, the Government will show any signs of repentance? Perhaps that is too much to hope for.  At any rate, the Government should be made realise that the crumbs they have offered to the unemployed are nothing but an insult and a mockery.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
