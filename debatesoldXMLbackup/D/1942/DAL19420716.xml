      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will say whether he will cause inquiry to be made, through Departmental channels, as to the likely effect changing the financial year to coincide with the calendar year would have on the work of (a) the commercial community, and (b) State and Local Government Departments, with a view to presenting the information so collected to a Parliamentary Committee, to be set up in the autumn for the purpose of considering and reporting on the advisability of such a change.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware from repeated representations made to him, that there are many small dealers in West Cork who have more tea customers registered with them than their ordinary monthly supplies will cover; if he is aware that the wholesale suppliers of such small dealers are prepared to supply these dealers with the little extra amount necessary to cover their requirements; and if he will state if he is prepared to sanction the granting of such extra supplies where <Col N="771" /> the amount involved does not exceed 10 lbs. in any one month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received applications for permission to obtain increased tea supplies from a number of licensed tea retailers in West Cork.  Each of these applications has been, or is being, considered, and where it is established that the existing supply is inadequate to meet the legitimate requirements of the trader concerned arrangements are made to enable increased quantities of tea to be delivered.  Every effort is being made to expedite clearance in cases still outstanding.  I am not prepared to agree to the suggestion that increased supplies should be automatically authorised where the amount involved does not exceed 10 lbs. in any one month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>To save the trouble of considering each case on the merits would the Minister consider the advisability of reallocating the whole available supply of tea and having it distributed on the basis of the number of customers registered, rather than on the amount of tea bought by a retailer during a particular year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that there are a number of hotels and guest-houses on the southern seaboard which operate only in the summer holiday season; and if he will make an allocation of tea and kerosene to the owners of such premises; and on what basis will such an allocation be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  With regard to the second and third parts of the Deputy's question allocations of tea to such hotels and guest-houses are made on a <Col N="772" /> monthly basis and are restricted to 20 per cent. of their purchases during the year ended 30th June, 1939.</P>
      <P>With regard to kerosene, allowances for lighting purposes are made on a limited scale during the summer tourist season, to hotels and guest-houses, whether seasonal or otherwise, which are not connected with a supply of gas or electricity.  In the case of users who produce their own lighting by kerosene-driven engines, allowances are based on the horse-power of the engines.  Allocations of kerosene for use in oil lamps are made in relation to the extent of the accommodation available for the reception of guests.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that many smiths cannot procure iron for horse shoes and are compelled to weld two old shoes to make one new one, thus causing much extra fuel to be used, and if the Minister will now endeavour to provide extra and suitable coal for the welding.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a general scarcity of standard quality shoeing iron and that blacksmiths have to rely principally on scrap iron.  I have no representations, however, that the amounts of coal which they are at present authorised by my Department to purchase have proved insufficient for their purposes.  As far as the suitability of the available coal is concerned, there is no action which I can take which might result in an improvement in quality.</P>

      <P>The position is as stated in the first part of the question.  I understand an official notification was issued by the Local Appointments Commissioners to those candidates who were successful at the examination in sanitation and hygiene held in Dublin and Cork in 1941.  A register of the names and addresses of candidates qualified and eligible for appointment as sanitary inspectors is kept in my Department.  It is not proposed to issue any certificates to persons on the register.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the form of notification sent out by the Appointments Commissioners is equivalent to a certificate.  The notice reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have pleasure in informing you that you were successful in the examination in sanitation and hygiene held in September (October), 1941, for persons seeking eligibility for appointment as sanitary inspector.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary not been drawn to the fact that persons who have passed the examination, when looking for positions for which their qualifications would suit them, have not found that notification from the Local Appointments Commissioners satisfactory?  Has it not been indicated to him that it would be of considerable importance to them to have from the Department of Local Government a letter saying they were entered on the register of the Department as qualified persons?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the form of notification received from the Local Appointments Commissioners is not satisfactory evidence of the extent or value of the qualifications of the <Col N="777" /> persons concerned.  The Deputy is, I am sure, aware that the qualification is not recognised outside the State. These people secure employment under local authorities here and, consequently, the sanctioning of their appointments rests with the Department of Local Government.

      <P>I am not aware that the fortnightly payment of marriage allowance to soldiers' wives has resulted in hardships which would be obviated by payment of the allowance weekly and, as I informed the Deputy when he raised the question on a former occasion, I cannot see my way to cause the allowance to be issued weekly in view of the very large additional cost which the Deputy's proposal would involve.  The rates of marriage allowance were increased last August and it is not proposed to grant any further increase.</P>

      <P>Could we have some explanation from the Minister in regard to this amendment, particularly as regards that part of the section which requires that stocks shall be quoted officially on the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges before they can be bought?  My reason for proposing amendment No. 13 originally was in order to get rid of the reference to the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges. Then I realised that the word &ldquo;buy&rdquo; in paragraph (g) of Section 7 did not include &ldquo;subscribed for&rdquo;.  If the State is issuing a loan having &ldquo;buy&rdquo; here&mdash;even if there is no reference to a necessity for quoting on the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges&mdash;would not it allow the bank to subscribe for any of the issues put up by the Government? I wonder if the Minister would refresh our minds on his intention in making a reference to the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchange quotations in his amendment No. 12.</P>

I also went a long way to make changes, in regard to the criticisms offered by Deputy Mulcahy and others on various stages of the Bill. <Col N="783" /> The limitation of having these issues quoted on the stock exchanges at Dublin and Cork is a wise one, and a safeguard both in the general interest and in the interest of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 7 (h), to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subscribe for, hold or sell securities of or guaranteed by the State which have been offered for public subscription or tender.</P>
      <P>On various stages of the Bill and in various discussions that have taken place here, we have emphasised the impossibility of carrying on the general work of this country if, in the present and in the future, we have to pay as much for money as we have been paying in the past.  As the Bill would stand, without the introduction of a clause like this into it, the Government, in issuing a loan to carry on necessary work, might find it impossible to get money at a reasonable rate.  We have indicated that we are paying a substantially higher rate here than is paid in Great Britain.  The work we contemplate doing with borrowed money at the present time ought to be as credit-worthy and as credit-sustaining as the work being done with very large sums of money borrowed in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted fairly generally now that an attempt must be made to provide full employment for all our people.  While we accept the responsibility of maintenance for our people, we cannot indefinitely maintain them unless there is production by all our people.  The only effective or proper way of getting the necessary distribution of money that will provide our people with the necessaries of life is by full employment, and we cannot hope to get full employment without the proper use of a monetary policy and without proper spending or investment of moneys by the State.  This is, <Col N="784" /> particularly, a time when, more than any other, State investment is required in order to maintain both our production and the capacity of our people to pass through present circumstances and to face a future in which the necessary investment will be done by the ordinary people.  It is, therefore, a time when the Government, inevitably, will find that they will have to borrow, perhaps, substantial amounts of money.  I see no means by which, systematically and without irritation and friction of one kind or another, the Government can control interest rates, at which they borrow money, and keep them at a suitable level unless they have the power to resist the withholding of money, by the people who have it, because they are not getting a high enough rate of interest.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had to ask to-morrow for a loan of £8,000,000 and found that only something like £4,000,000 was subscribed, I think he should have it in his power to get the remaining money that he required from the central bank at a rate that he and the Government, with their grip on the situation and their view of the situation, would consider reasonable.  During the previous discussions we pointed out what a very important lifting effect on interest rates here the deposit rate of 1 per cent., over such a very substantial amount of money as is held in the Irish banks on deposit, has had, and the Minister will find himself up against a very great difficulty, in bringing money rates down to a reasonable level, unless he has some such power as is indicated in the amendment which I bring forward here.  Therefore, I think the House should face that matter fairly and squarely.</P>
    <P>As paragraph (g) of the section stands, the bank can only buy Government securities that are actually in the hands of some other person.  As I read it, if the Minister issues, say, £8,000,000, and if only £4,000,000 is taken up, he having fixed the rate of interest beforehand, the bank is not then in a position to subscribe the remaining £4,000,000 without going through some machinery other than subscribing <Col N="785" /> directly for the loan as issued.  For that reason, I think it is essential that such a clause as I suggest here should be inserted.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but I understand that a loan cannot be quoted on the Dublin or Cork Stock Exchanges until the Minister for Finance has indicated that the loan has been subscribed in full, and therefore I think that what I say with regard to paragraph (g) is perfectly correct: that is, that if a loan of £8,000,000 is offered, and only £4,000,000 is taken up, it would not be possible to get a quotation from the stock exchange at that point, and therefore it would be impossible for the bank to take up from the Minister for Finance the remainder of the loan outstanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the present regulation made by the Stock Exchanges of Dublin and Cork is that they would quote a loan that had been subscribed as to two-thirds. Of course, they can change their rules at any time, but their present rule, which has been in existence for some time, is that once two-thirds have been subscribed, they are prepared to issue a quotation.  In introducing his amendment and recommending it to us for adoption, Deputy Mulcahy urges that the Minister should be anxious to get money for public purposes at a cheaper rate.  That has been the custom up to the present.  It is very difficult for a Minister for Finance to resist such an amendment.  I, as Minister for Finance, would be very happy to get money for public purposes at a cheap rate, the lowest rate possible.  If we could get it at 2 per cent., as Deputy Mulcahy properly says, it would save us a lot of money and probably enable us to do, in normal circumstances, a lot of very useful public work which is, to a certain extent, ordinarily restricted when the cost of money is much higher than 2 per cent.  I do not think that it would be wise for me, as Minister for Finance, to accept this amendment because, while it might help to secure money at a cheaper rate than at present, it also opens a door&mdash;a door that, probably, would not be used by this Government or by the next Government, <Col N="786" /> but that might be used by some Government for purposes that, in the end, would not be advantageous to the State.</P>
      <P>We heard some Deputies in the House here, when this same principle was under discussion on the Committee Stage of the Bill, describing in lurid language the printing machine that might be used to print red-hot currency by some Government at a future date.  As the law stands, or as it is proposed in the Bill, and as it is proposed even with the amendments that have now been accepted by the House, the danger which those Deputies saw, that it might be used to the disadvantage of the State at some time or another, may exist to some extent, but an effort, certainly, has been made to control it, so that no loan would be issued by the Government of the day except in a <i>bona fide</i> way, and offered to, and accepted by, the public; and a guarantee that it was accepted by the public would be that these loans would be quoted on the stock exchanges. That is a guarantee to the public that loans have been issued in a <i>bona fide</i> way, and not because of the Government rushing to the central bank, in times of panic, emergency, or difficulty, and urging it to give moneys to the Government to carry on the normal affairs of the Government, which the central bank, in normal times, and except under pressure, might not wish to do.  I think that, all things considered, in the powers we are proposing we have gone a long way on the road towards meeting those who are anxious to leave the approach to the central bank wider open and to make the effort to get cheaper money more easy.  But to go to the extent that Deputy Mulcahy suggests would not, I think, be wise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the condition that we had laid down, of having the issue quoted on the stock exchange, is a guarantee to the public, to the people who subscribe to these loans and to the taxpayers in general that the loan has been <i>bona fide</i> offered to, and subscribed by, the public: that the savings of the people have been used to float the loan successfully.  That is a guarantee that, so far as I can see in <Col N="787" /> present circumstances or in the immediate future, we ought not to forgo.  It is a wise provision.  It is one that Governments, even those that might be tempted in times of financial difficulties to go to the central bank and ask it to provide them with finances, would be glad to have as a safeguard for themselves not to expend money extravagantly.  On the whole, I think that if the Deputy himself thinks over the matter he will see that even though this Government, or the next Government, or may be a Government or two after that again, might not use the power, still it is better not to tempt them and to have the safeguard there.  Again, I say that I think the provision is a wise one and that it ought to remain.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to support any recommendation that will secure money at lower rates of interest than those quoted during the period of the emergency.  I would urge on the Minister to set aside whatever stupid fears he may have with regard to what future Governments may do, and keep before his mind the fact that local authorities as well as the State have had to pay excessive rates of interest&mdash; in fact they might be described as usurious rates of interest&mdash;to enable them to carry out important housing schemes for the working classes.  The Minister cannot but be aware that within the past year an important <Col N="788" /> housing scheme, promoted by the Dublin Corporation, was held up because sanction was refused by the Department of Local Government on the grounds that the type of house proposed by the corporation&mdash;three or four-roomed flats&mdash;would cost more than £1,000.  The cost in that particular case was due in no small measure to the excessively high rates of interest charged to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would, I think, if passed make a most important and far-reaching contribution to the success of this Bill.  It would enable the State to provide itself with money at lower rates of interest than the powers that control finance at the moment are prepared to accord, and in so doing would put at the disposal of the community money which could be extensively used for the development of the agricultural industry.  I think the Minister has already admitted that he would like to be able to obtain money at a lower rate of interest than that which prevails at the moment.  He also admitted that this money, if available, might be used to serve useful purposes for the community. He has suggested, however, that if such a power were in the hands of the Government it would offer to them a temptation which they might be unable to resist.  Therefore, it has been decided to place, to a large extent, this power in the hands of people who are outside the control of the Government.  One may ask, if we cannot rely on the honesty of the elected Government of the country, how can we rely on the people in whom the Minister reposes control in this Bill?  There is no doubt whatever that if the financial interests here consider that a loan is being sought by the Government at too low a rate of interest for the development of agriculture, for industry, for housing or for turf production, they can prevent the Government from securing that loan by refusing to have it subscribed to the extent of two-thirds.  By wielding that power they can hold the Government and the community of this State to ransom, and hold up all efforts <Col N="789" /> for the country's development on sound economic lines.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, before Section 8, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> It shall be lawful for the bank to do all or any of the following things on such occasions and to such extent as the board shall think proper, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  make provision for the collection and study of data relating to monetary and credit problems and publish informative material in regard thereto;</P>
    <P>(b)  establish and maintain, either directly or indirectly, contact with the monetary authorities established in other countries;</P>
    <P>(c)  do all such things as may be ancillary or incidental to or consequential on the exercise of any of the powers or the performance of any of the duties conferred or imposed on the bank by this or any other section of this Act or from time to time conferred or imposed on the bank by law.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment does what Deputy Cosgrave asked should be done.  It does not do it in as wide a sense as Deputy Cosgrave wished to have it done, but I think it does the essential things that everybody, perhaps Deputy Cosgrave included, would like to have done.  I do not know whether Deputy Cosgrave was anxious to have full research into all economic matters, but I think that so long as the central bank deals with all monetary and credit problems and collects statistics and data relating to these matters, not generally covering the very wide field of the whole economics of the country, the bank will be fulfilling its functions.  If it were given power to set up any machinery it thought fit and proper to collect all that data and publish informative material, as stated in the amendment, relating to the monetary and credit problems, it would be doing all that we could really ask it to do.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second item, I have, I think, accepted fully Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion about establishing and maintaining direct contact with monetary authorities established in other countries and, fearing anything should be overlooked, that it <Col N="792" /> might not have power to do some things which might be useful and helpful in the monetary and credit spheres, I put in a general sub-section, sub-section (c).  My anxiety, as I think it is the anxiety of Deputies opposite, is that the most useful kind of statistical matter should be collected and published by the board of the bank at convenient times.  Whether it will be convenient to publish these statistics weekly or fortnightly or monthly will rest with themselves.  But I certainly am anxious with regard to our financial affairs, the financial condition of the country, and monetary and credit problems that arise here, that all relevant figures and statistics and information that can be gathered by the bank should be published by them and given to the people to use in whatever way they think proper.</P>

    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister grants under this section an application by a bank to be admitted to be an associated bank, such bank shall as on and from the date on which such application is granted, become and be an associated bank for the purposes of this Act and of the Currency Act as applied, modified, or amended by this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may require a bank applying under this section to be admitted to be an associated bank to furnish to him such information in relation to its business and to permit the Governor or a permanent officer of the bank specially authorised in that behalf in writing by the Minister to make such inspection of its books as appears to the Minister to be necessary for the due consideration by him of such application.</P>
    <P>23.  In page 7, before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may, at any time on or after the appointed day, in his absolute discretion remove any associated bank from being an associated bank either (after consultation with the board) on any of the grounds expressly authorised by the Currency Act as adapted by this Act or (with the consent of the board) on any other ground which appears to the Minister to be sufficient.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any associated bank may at any time on or after the appointed day, apply to the Minister to be removed from being an associated bank, and, whenever such application is so made by an associated bank, the Minister shall forthwith remove such bank from being an associated bank.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister removes under this section an associated bank from being an associated bank, <Col N="794" /> such bank shall forthwith cease to be an associated bank, but such removal shall not prevent the subsequent admission under this Act of such bank to be an associated bank nor relieve such bank from liability to pay on due presentation the amount of every consolidated bank note outstanding with it at the time of such removal or from liability for payments on consolidated bank notes outstanding with it whether before or after such removal.</P>
    <P>(4)  Except when an associated bank is removed on its own application, the Minister shall not remove under this section an associated bank from being an associated bank without giving such bank a reasonable opportunity of being heard.</P>

      <P>During the Committee Stage Deputy McGilligan stated that he recollected a judgment having been given at some time that a bankrupt means a bankrupt within the State only, and this is to provide that it should be taken as &ldquo;whether in the State or in any other country&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, Section 15 (4) (d), after the word &ldquo;creditors&rdquo; in line 24 to insert the words &ldquo;whether in the State or in any other country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was put down following on the principle embodied in the section generally that if a director or governor of the bank is adjudged bankrupt in another country he automatically has to retire from the board of the bank. This provides that a person who has to make a composition with his creditors in another country should also retire from the board of the bank. It is not a particularly high standard to set that, if the central bank has on its directorate a person who has interests in another country or business relations or dealings with another country, we should specify that we would regard his making a composition with his creditors there as a reason why he should retire from the directorate of the bank.  The only objection there might lie to it would be that, on rare occasions, attempts have been made to ruin a man's credit and in a case of that sort subsequent consideration might tend to rehabilitate the man here, but, at the moment, if he fails to meet his creditors in full in another country, it appears to me that it would be scarcely right that he should occupy a seat on the board of the central bank of this country.  I do not know what the practice is with regard to the directorate of banks, but I should say that if a director of a bank finds himself in that position, it is almost inevitable that he would have to retire, even if the failure were in respect of another country.</P>

      <P>In principle I am with the Deputy.  If there is bankruptcy, there is no question that he ought to be disqualified.  But it might happen that the governor would be a shareholder in a bank or some institution of the kind that defaulted or went bankrupt or that had arranged with its creditors, and he might be disqualified because he was a shareholder in that institution&mdash;because the bank he had shares in defaulted or made a composition <Col N="796" /> with its creditors.  Under the amendment, it has been suggested to me, the governor would probably be disqualified and that would be going even further than what the Deputy has in mind.  If there is any question of bankruptcy, there is no dispute; but if there is a question of the governor being a shareholder in some foreign company that defaulted or made a composition, he would be disqualified. It is probable he would be disqualified under the amendment that the Deputy has put down, and that would be going further, perhaps, than what the Deputy might like to suggest.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Minister's line of reasoning.  If a bank director was a shareholder in a company in another country and that company went bankrupt or made an arrangement, he would not have carried the arrangement with his creditors; I take it that it would be in a corporate capacity.  If it be a limited liability company, I take it that he would be a director of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the line of argument is even thinner.  How could the shareholders of a company, except it was an unlimited liability company, which is almost unheard of these days, be so adjudged?  If that company went bankrupt, surely all the shareholders would not be adjudged to have made an arrangement with their creditors?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the situation is even more serious.  Here we are talking about a person who is the governor of our central bank, who will have a very important and influential say in the investment of a lot of money in the hands of the bank.  We are supposing the possibility that he is the kind of person who would have his own money in shares in a foreign bank that might go &ldquo;bust.&rdquo;  I could understand his having his shares in some industrial concern, but if the thought could come into our minds that it was <Col N="797" /> possible to have a person like that who would have shares in a foreign bank that might go &ldquo;bust,&rdquo; surely the last place we would have a person of that type would be as governor.</P>
      <P>As regards the point Deputy Dockrell raised, I cannot see how, except it was in some queer country with queer laws, the shareholder of a bank or even a company could be adjudged bankrupt or could be regarded as having compounded with his creditors simply because the company got into difficulties and had to compound in any kind of way.  When we consider the type of position and the type of man we expect in that position, I think it is a dangerous splitting of hairs to distinguish between a person being adjudged a bankrupt and compounding with his creditors.  In a case of this kind we should hold that there was no difference between either one or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the governor, I think there should be no qualms of conscience with reference to conditions. They could not be made too difficult for him.  I would not allow him to buy or sell shares.  If he is going to do that, he should be confined to gilt-edged securities, so as to keep him after the manner and style of Caesar's wife.  He should not be allowed to purchase shares in a bank anywhere at any time once he accepts the office of governor, and therefore no question arises as to any call that will be made upon him, and any composition or any complications with his creditors would not arise either.  From what then might a difficulty arise?  The only way is if an action were taken against him, if he were defendant in proceedings or if he were a plaintiff and lost and some unusual influences were at work to <Col N="798" /> place him in that position.  But, apart from those considerations, the question we have to decide is whether this man should not be compelled by the law as we lay it down to refrain from the exercise of any activities which would put him into a position in which he would have to make an arrangement with his creditors.  It would be undesirable that publicity in the banking or the commercial world would be given to the fact that the governor of the central bank in Eire was making a composition with his creditors in Timbuctoo.</P>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister at a moment's notice to decide on this amendment, but I think it would be highly undesirable that there should be any latitude given to a person occupying the position of governor of the bank, and he should lose his office, he should resign, if he had to make an arrangement with his creditors in any part of the world.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy talked about the idea of a man holding shares in an institution&mdash;he cannot hold shares in a bank&mdash;but in some <Col N="799" /> other institution that might go bankrupt. I know and I know Deputy Cosgrave knows, and I think Deputy Mulcahy knows, people who were looked up to and regarded by us who knew them as men of substance, men of the highest integrity and standing in finance in the United States of America and in the collapse they were caught out.  Some of them went bankrupt; some of them went to jail, not through their own fault, in the awful collapse that took place after 1929 in the United States of America.  There were some people whom we did not know personally but who were of world-wide repute in financial circles in America who were caught out in the same way&mdash;people who could sign their names for millions of dollars.  When the collapse came, they were caught out.  I do not think anything of the kind is likely to happen here.  I would entirely accept Deputy Cosgrave's statement that the governor of the central bank should be <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>, financially, at any rate, but we might be tying him up too tightly.  After all, if a man is of a saving nature he must put his money somewhere, and if he happened to get caught out in a financial tornado such as occurred in the United States of America, where something like 4,000 banks went out of business in a period of two or three years, it would not be the governor's fault.  It may be that there is foundation for what is suggested to me here, that we are pulling the ropes too tightly and that the amendment of Deputy Cosgrave would exclude the governor from putting his money even in what we would all regard as safe, gilt-edged investments, over which he would have no control.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33, standing in the name of Deputy McGilligan:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12 to delete lines 36 to 58 and in page 13 to delete lines 1 to 10 (Section 22) and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The first banking directors shall be appointed from among the persons elected or nominated to a panel to be formed according to the further provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  Not more than 30 nor less than ten days before the appointed day the Minister shall appoint a time and place (in this section referred to as the appointed time and place) for the meeting of representatives of the associated banks for the election of three persons to the panel.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister shall cause every associated bank to be informed in writing of the appointed time and place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Every associated bank may cause one and only one representative nominated by it in that behalf <Col N="803" /> to attend at the appointed time and place and shall then or within three days thereafter elect in accordance with the Rules contained in the Second Schedule to this Act three persons eligible and willing to act as banking directors, each experienced in practical banking and possessing sufficient knowledge of currency and credit to enable him to give the board expert advice in matters relating thereto, and shall forthwith communicate to the Minister in accordance with the said Rules the names of the three persons so elected.</P>
    <P>(5)  Not more than 30 days nor less than ten days before the appointed day the Minister shall appoint a date (in this section referred to as the appointed date) on or before which the executive committee of the Irish Bank Officials' Association may nominate and communicate to the Minister the names of three persons being officials of associated banks who are eligible and willing to act as banking directors each experienced in practical banking and possessing sufficient knowledge of currency and credit to enable him to give the board expert advice in matters relating thereto.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Minister shall cause the executive committee to be informed in writing of the appointed date.</P>
    <P>(7)  If the said representatives of the associated banks who attend at the appointed time and place fail to elect in accordance with this section three persons for the panel or if no representatives of the associated banks attend at the appointed time and place it shall be lawful for the Minister to appoint such three eligible persons as he shall think proper to the panel but subject to the restriction that if and so far as eligible and suitable persons willing to act can be found amongst the directors of the several associated banks no person who is not a director of an associated bank shall be appointed to the panel by the Minister under this sub-section and in any event no person who is in the <Col N="804" /> permanent service of the State shall be appointed.</P>
    <P>(8)  If on or before the appointed date the executive committee of the Irish Bank Officials' Association fail to nominate and communicate to the Minister the names of three persons in accordance with this section it shall be lawful for the Minister to appoint to the panel such three eligible persons as he shall think proper but subject to the restriction that if and so far as eligible and suitable persons willing to act can be found amongst the officials of the several associated banks no person who is not an official of an associated bank shall be appointed to the panel by the Minister and in any event no person who is in the permanent service of the State shall be so appointed.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this amendment is to delete Section 22 and to insert the new section that is on the paper in its place.  Section 22 proposes that the representatives of the associated banks on the board, that is, the three members referred to in Section 5 (3) (b) would be appointed from a panel of six submitted to the Minister by the representatives of the associated banks, that is, that the associated banks, through the banking directors of these banks, would submit a panel of six and that the Minister would select three of them.  I submit that you want as banking directors persons who have first-class and long experience of banking and that you do not want the type of person who becomes a banking director through the amount of money that he holds, or as it were, through inheritance.</P>
    <P>We depend for the development of our life and security and the improvement of our national situation on technicians of various kinds&mdash;on our engineers, on our doctors and even on our statesmen.  From where do we get our first class engineers?  From long training in the schools and long experience outside, where the person of the engineer is developed, by long practice at every aspect of the work and long contact with other men in handling that work.  We get our <Col N="805" /> doctors from long training in the schools and direct personal plodding through all the various aspects of the doctors' work, and the same applies to the architect, and even to the statesman. Unless he is in close contact with people and their problems, and has had that close contact for a considerable time, and unless there is embodied in his person a complete grasp of the human factors he is dealing with, you will not have any successful work.  Here we are appointing a body which will have a very great deal of control over the most important matters&mdash;matters which, if simply dealt with in a theoretical kind of way, without an understanding of the complex machinery involved and without an understanding of the humanity and sense of organism of the machine being dealt with, may lead us very far astray with very great reactions of an unfortunate kind on the people.</P>
    <P>In his amendment, Deputy McGilligan suggests that the panel of six which will go to the Minister will consist of three names selected by the directors of the associated banks and three selected by the executive committee of the Irish Bank Officials' Association&mdash;an association which includes officials of all ranks in the banks throughout the country, from the very highest down.  The Minister would then have placed before him, as a panel from which to select three, the selections of people who are directors and the selections of people who are steeped in the details of the practical carrying out of the banks' work.  I move the amendment because I feel that the Minister should have the opportunity of having drawn to his attention by the people who are engaged in the practical work the type of people who are available, as they consider, for work of this kind.  Without machinery or a process of this kind, the Minister has no chance of having brought to his notice perhaps the most important class of people whom you want to have represented on the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have all kinds of claims as to the type and number of people to be appointed as the other directors.  Two of these will no doubt <Col N="806" /> be service directors, and he will then have three others, and there is no doubt that these three will be selected with a view to either academic qualifications or industrial qualifications. Both classes of persons will no doubt be necessary on the board, but, as the proposal stands at present, there is no provision at all for the appointment of men with practical banking experience, of men who have grown up in the banking world in the same way as the engineer grows up from his schooling and experience of the actual work, or as the doctor, the architect, or any of these other highly technical people grow up.  The Minister not only has no opportunity of getting that type of person on the board, but he has no opportunity of seeing where that type of person is, or of having the persons of that type who are available drawn to his attention by the people most qualified to draw them to his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correctly informed if he says that the Minister will have no opportunity of getting for the board of the central bank, through the machinery proposed in the Bill, the help of people of wide and lengthy experience in banking, or that I, as Minister, will give no opportunity to the bankers to elect such people on to the board, through the panel of six, unless I adopt the series of amendments set down by Deputy McGilligan and moved by Deputy Mulcahy.  I auggest to the Deputy that that is not correct.  We have had on the Currency Commission at least two directors of banks who, so to speak, rose from the ranks, who had a life-long experience of banking and who, towards the close of their long years of experience, were elected bank directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met fairly frequently deputations from the Banks' Standing Committee. We had discussions on certain aspects of this Bill, and, before the Bill was under discussion, I met deputations from the Banks' Standing Committee. I do not think I ever met a deputation on which there were not directors of banks who had risen from the ranks, who were formerly officials. We have had the most distinguished <Col N="807" /> bankers and the most experienced bankers in the country on these deputations&mdash;some of them always&mdash;men who had formerly been officials and who had occupied the highest official posts in a number of these banks. Speaking from recollection, from my knowledge of the bankers, in Dublin, at any rate, there are on the boards of six of the eight associated banks directors who are technicians, who have spent their lives in banking and who have all the knowledge and experience, all the technical qualifications which Deputy Mulcahy regards, and which I regard, as desirable to have at the disposal of the central bank.  It is not necessary, therefore, that the amendments should be adopted to secure the technical fitness which the Deputy thinks so desirable.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons.  It is the directors of the banks, and not the officials, who are the custodians, the representatives of the shareholders and the depositors.  Those who confide their money to the banks for safe keeping have confidence in the directors.  I do not say that they have not confidence in the officials&mdash;I am sure they have&mdash;but it is not on the officials, but on the directors that the responsibility rests for the safeguarding of the money of the depositors, the shareholders and the customers of the banks, and it is important that that confidence should be recognised by the State in the way in which we propose to recognise it.</P>
    <P>It is also advisable that the harmonious relations that have existed so long between the Currency Commission and the shareholding banks, as they were called&mdash;the associated banks as they will be called when the central bank is set up&mdash;should continue.  I should not like to say that there would be a break in these harmonious relations if we were to adopt the amendments, but I should not like to take the risk.  I think we have full opportunities of getting all the technical ability, the knowledge and skill that one associates with people who have given a lifetime to the service of any profession&mdash;engineering, medical or banking. The knowledge that comes from a lifetime of service will be at our disposal <Col N="808" /> from amongst the directors of the associated banks at present in existence, all of whom may be eligible for election on the panel.  We are not excluding any of these officials.  A number of them are men whose names are well known in the financial and banking world and they would certainly bring a great and valuable store of knowledge and experience to the board of the central bank if they were put on it, as some of them have already done in the case of the Currency Commission. However, I do not think it necessary to accept the amendments suggested by Deputy Mulcahy for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 49, Section 22 (3), to delete the word &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;each experienced in practical banking and possessing sufficient knowledge of currency and credit to enable him to give the board expert advice in matters relating thereto.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 22 provides that the associated banks shall select a panel of six persons eligible and willing to act as banking directors and submit it to the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;a panel of six persons eligible and willing to act.&rdquo;  There is no provision in the Bill in which eligibility is defined in any way.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide a definition of &ldquo;eligible.&rdquo; Lines 49 and 50, if amended in accordance with the amendment, would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a panel of six persons each experienced in practical banking and possessing sufficient knowledge of currency and credit to enable him to give the board expert advice in matters relating thereto, and willing to act as banking directors&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is necessary that eligibility as regards the banking directors should be indicated in some way and it should be made clear that they are experienced in practical banking and that they possess a knowledge of currency and credit.  I should also like <Col N="809" /> to ask the Minister, arising out of his remarks on the last amendment, whether in order to be nominated on a panel put up by the associated banks under Section 22, as it stands now, it is necessary for a person to be a director of a bank.  Would an official of a bank or a person who was not either an official or a director be eligible for submission on the panel set up by the banking directors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <P>(6) Whenever the Minister, for the purpose of reducing the number of directors to whom this section applies, determines not to fill a vacancy which has occurred amongst those directors, he shall cause the board to be informed of such determination.</P>
      <P>This is similar to an amendment moved already.  Whenever a vacancy occurs amongst the directors to whom Section 24 applies, the Minister may decide not to fill such vacancy.  The amendment is designed to meet such a situation.  It is a consequential amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 42 arose out of some discussions on the Committee Stage in relation to adding two new sub-sections to Section 24.

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 12 to 47, to delete Section 28.</P>
      <P>This amendment should have been put in on the Committee Stage.  Its object is to delete the provision of compensation or superannuation or other pension for members of the Currency Commission, and to ensure that the new board which is now being set up will not be composed of any pensionable members so far as that board is concerned. It is an innovation to provide for those compensations and pensions. In any event, to my mind, it is not necessary, and, as far as we know, is unasked for.  It was not recommended, as far as my recollection goes, by the Banking Commission.  Even if it were, I should not be disposed to consider or accept such a recommendation.  The work of this body, as I have said before, is not to my mind either as onerous or as important as that which is undertaken by the board of a fairly extensive associated bank, or a shareholding bank as it is now called.  It is possible that the work may, on occasion, be more important work, but it is routine.  It has none of the characteristics and gives rise to none of the immense troubles and worries occasioned by the other work, nor does it call for the exercise of a business mind such as is asked for or expected on the boards of one of the other banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, no case was made in respect of this provision either in the Second Reading speech of the Minister or on the Committee Stage. It adds to the expenses, and to my mind it detracts somewhat from the dignity of the persons appointed.  I know of no bank in this country&mdash;some of them have been here for 150 years and others of them for 100 years&mdash;<Col N="813" /> which provides a pension for a chairman or member of the board of directors, no matter how long they have been appointed.  I heard quite recently of a member of a board retiring after 40 or 50 years' service&mdash; almost an octogenarian or a septuagenarian at any rate-and no pension was paid in his case.  This is a time when costs are rising and there should be very keen consideration of any addition to our national expenses.  Those things must be paid by somebody. Consequently, I think we should take this opportunity to strike out that provision, and stop those unnecessary expenses.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Cosgrave is correct in saying that this is a unique proposition, and that there is no precedent for it.  There is a precedent under Deputy Cosgrave's own Government, and there is a precedent in the previous history of this country.  Under the Railways Act, 1924, the directors were provided with compensation for loss of office, and under the Insurance Act of this Government certain directors were provided with compensation for loss of office.  There are certainly two precedents; there may be others.  I think it is correct to say that directors who are not whole-time officers of a banking board would not be pensioned.  The Deputy was probably correct in saying that men who had been on the boards of banks for 30 or 40 or more years would not be pensioned, but certainly if they were whole-time officers&mdash;as some of them were&mdash;they would be pensioned and have been pensioned.  I think all whole-time officials of banks, whether directors or not, have been pensioned.</P>

      <P>If he is a whole-time official I think it is just that he should be pensioned for his years of service or compensated for loss of office.  I did not think that was a proposition to which anyone in the House would object.  A whole-time official, no matter what his salary is, when he loses office by reason of abolition or anything else, should be compensated or pensioned.  I think that is a proposition which we have always stood over in this House.  Certainly there is a precedent for it in the case of the two Acts to which I have referred, the Railways Act, 1924, and the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938.  The directors in those cases were compensated for loss of office, and I think it is not an unreasonable proposition that the directors in this case should be compensated for loss of office also.  More recently still-I think the Final Stage was only reached to-day-under the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Bill, the House has accepted the principle of compensation to directors for loss of office.  The principle was discussed at length in this House and in the other House, and we agreed to give compensation for loss of office to directors, whole-time and part-time, of the Electricity Supply Board.  That is another case where the principle was accepted in the House here, and I thought it unlikely that there would be any opposition to <Col N="815" /> accepting the principle in the case of the directors of the Currency Commission.</P>

      <P>There is no relationship whatever between the railways and the position here.  In the case of the railways the board of directors was abolished.  Here we are simply changing the name of an institution.  There are five directors at present and we are going to call this institution instead of the Currency Commission a bank.  You must distinguish between directors and officials.  If these are officials are they to be paid as such?  They are not. Everybody knows that.  If it is intended that the Chairman of the Currency Commission is to be an official that is another matter.  I never heard of it before.  So far as insurance companies and railways are concerned they were simply wiped out and replaced by one body.  It is not the same here.  There is no bank director or ex-director on the pension roll of any bank.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 43, Section 32 (1) (a) (ii), after the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not more than.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage I sought to reduce from 2½ per cent. to not more than 1½ per cent. per annum the charge for consolidated bank notes.  Deputy McGilligan explained in my absence that I sought to reduce the amount of commission originally put on the notes.  Later on that amount was increased from 30/- per £100 to £3 and then reduced to 2½ per cent. the figure at which the fee now stands.  In view of the fact that the banks were able to carry on, and that the scheme was able to pay for itself at 1½ per cent. the additional 1 per cent. added is nothing but taxation.  If we let the section go as it is now it will read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii) for the portion of such half-year which is subsequent to the date of the passing of this Act, a sum calculated at the rate of 2½ per cent. per annum on the amount of consolidated bank notes outstanding ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>shall be paid.  We are practically adding 1 per cent. per annum to the taxation involved.  I do not agree with that.  I want to leave it open to the Minister, when the scheme has settled down, to charge less, if, on reconsideration, he changes his mind as, I think, he should.  The State is going to receive money in a number of ways from the central bank.  The situation should be tidied up and in relation to consolidated bank notes there ought <Col N="817" /> not to be any charge more than the cost.  The State is going to receive a considerable portion of the 2½ per cent. The capital I think is 40,000 and the State is going to receive the surplus. We ought to know what the State does get.  The overheads of the banks should be reduced.  I submit that the present overhead charges on the banks involved by the increase should not continue indefinitely.  If the section passes in its present form there will be statutory requirement to charge the banks 2½ per cent. for consolidated bank notes.  The second reason for the amendment is that there ought to be a tidying up of accounts in the relationship between the banks and the Government, and we should know in a unified way how much money the Government was getting.</P>

      <P>I think it has been a very profitable business for the banks, that they are getting this service for 2½ per cent.  It is a small enough charge for the privilege they get.

The old rate of 7/- is still in operation there and the bank charges have never been less than they have here.

      <P>In this case the Minister ought to consider that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  Last night the Taoiseach when resisting an application from the Labour Party to increase the wages of turf workers, pointed out that the wages of these workers could not be increased without ultimately increasing the price of turf in Dublin.  I suggest to the Minister that there is no difference between that inexorable logic and the position of the banks, except that they do not sell turf.  They are selling money.  If you increase the costs to the banker, he must get it off somebody somewhere. He must either pay smaller dividends to his shareholders or charge his customers who get accommodation, including the Government themselves, more.  I suggest to the Minister that that logic is inexorable.</P>

      <P>I could repeat on this amendment my remark about sauce for the goose being sauce for the gander.  The Minister was to consider whether or not he could offer relief in this case.  In my opinion, for what it is worth, it is manifestly fair that if any claimants turn up for money which has been written off, the Government should stand their share in the proportion that they have shared in the &ldquo;swag&rdquo;.  That is my proposition in plain language and I suggest to the Minister that it is only justice.</P>

It is contemplated that the writing-off will be effected in more than one operation, one writing-off taking place in 1943, and the second one five years subsequently.  The section provides for a further writing-off if any dead notes be presented later.  The interest of the banks will be well safeguarded and the initiative will lie with them.  They will be dealt with fairly and justly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Minister was to consider two points in connection with this matter.  One was the precipitancy of the Currency Commission in coming to a decision on a particular date which would bind all subsequent dates, no matter what movements took place in the dead notes in the meantime from one part of the country to another.  I understood that the Minister appreciated that weakness in the Bill.  What is decided on the 1st June, 1928, will not apply without alteration in July, 1929, or in July, of 1930, 1940 or 1942.  Over that period, there must have been some alteration in the proportion of these notes in either part of the country.  It was a great mistake on the part of Currency Commission to take a decision which would bind all subsequent dates in relation to these notes.  Sooner or later, there will have to be an agreement between two Governments or, possibly, three Governments on this matter.  The two Governments are not going to be concerned regarding a decision the Bank of England may take.  We would not be bound by that decision, if we did not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Currency Commission takes a decision, it is obvious that the other Governments are not going to accept it unless they are in agreement with it. The second point is: having agreed as to the proportion of these notes outstanding, and as to the percentage the Minister should get, some of those notes are subsequently presented.  The case we put up on the last occasion was that the charge in respect of those notes, which were regarded as dead, and in respect of which the Minister was paid, should not be the liability of the banks.  They have paid.  Why should they be asked to pay a second time?  We argued on the last occasion <Col N="821" /> that the banks had paid a considerable amount of interest on this money.  For five years they paid 1½ per cent., for the next five years 3 per cent., and for the past five years 2½ per cent.  That is 35 per cent. in all.</P>
    <P>There are two Governments involved. One Government lays down in this section what it will get, what it expects to get and what it is determined to get.  Is the other Government, looking on, likely to seek a better bargain?  It appears to me to be likely that they will.  I can imagine the position of a bank, looking at these two collections of gentlemen, bent upon getting the last ounce of money's worth out of the institution.  It is our loss, as those banks have their major holdings, interest and liabilities in this country.  It is all loss, and to that extent I thought the Minister would reconsider the whole section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered this matter again very fully, with all the expert advice I could get.  Having done so, I found no necessity to change it, as we have covered all the situations likely to arise.  In this case, the initiative rests with the banks. As Deputy Cosgrave properly says, there must be agreement between all the people concerned before this matter is settled finally.  Efforts have been made before to obtain agreement, and they have failed.  Certain understandings, which might form the basis of agreement at a later date, were arrived at between the Governments concerned; but I do not know how they will work out eventually.  If the proportions we would like to see adopted are accepted, the State will get something out of it and the banks' interests will be safeguarded also. The Government maintain that we have a certain interest in the matter-that all the interest in the dead notes does not lie with the banks.  The British Government, the Northern Ireland Government as a subsidiary, and this Government, maintain that they have a certain equity in the matter, and that a certain proportion of the assets of these dead notes, when they are finally written off, must accrue to the Government.  Under the tentative <Col N="822" /> agreements that were discussed-but not adopted-the interests of all parties, including the banks, would be safeguarded.  The banks would not get all they asked for, but neither would the Government.</P>
      <P>Before any conclusion is come to or any final agreement arrived at, there will have to be&mdash;as there has been already-further prolonged debates and discussions.  It is not the intention of the Government to deprive the banks of their just due, but there will be differences of opinion as to what &ldquo;just due&rdquo; may mean.  The banks are entitled to a certain proportion, in the belief of the Government.  I do not know how long it will be before final agreement is reached-it may be 20 years, when most of us are under the sod-but the Government spokesman of that time will, I hope, see to it that the Government gets a fair share of the assets of these dead notes, while at the same time not being unjust to the banks.  If I were in a position to arrive at a decision in this matter, I would not be unjust to the banks; and I am sure that, if Deputies on the opposite benches have to deal with this, they will try to be just and fair also.</P>
      <P>After all, the State has provided all the opportunities for the profits derived out of this note issue, and the State should get a certain proportion of the assets of the dead notes.  This matter has given a great deal of trouble in the past, and will give a certain amount more in the future, but I think that, on the whole, the sections proposed in this Central Bank Bill are not unjust to anyone.  They will provide a basis, on the initiative of the banks, for coming to an agreed settlement as to how the assets of this fund should be disposed of finally.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, before Section 36 but in Part IV, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal tender notes to the proportion of not less than 1 in 3 on the backing of liquid sound advances <Col N="823" /> shall be issued to each associated bank.  The bank shall accept the certificate of the responsible officer of each associated bank countersigned by the auditor and the chairman of the board of directors.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage I had down a different amendment from this, effecting much the same purpose.  As the law will stand as soon as this Bill is passed, without this amendment, any currency to be issued in the future will be currency deriving its sole backing from external assets-from credits that we have elsewhere.  The integrity of our currency depends upon this country possessing external assets at least to the extent of whatever currency is issued.  Under the Currency (Amendment) Act-even as amended by this Bill&mdash;the central bank may decide, with or without the concurrence of the Minister, as the case may be, to utilise other backing for the issue of its notes. Very little reflection is needed to realise that any or all of our securities here-say national loan, land bonds issued on our own responsibility exclusively, any stock issued by a local authority here entitled so to issue, and so on-have no real market on our stock exchanges.  It would be impossible to sell £1,000,000 worth of those securities inside many months.  It is quite true that, on occasion, a national loan is taken up to the extent of £6,000,000 or £7,000,000; but our securities, as such, have no market.  People who buy them do so to keep them, and the sales are insignificant-as was shown by the Banking Commission. Therefore, any change that would take place on the part of the central bank &mdash;in respect of the utilising of these securities&mdash;would mean simply buying securities that would be unmarketable, except over a long period of time.  We are faced with the problem of finding something which is marketable, which is security, and which is easily realisable.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made here is not a new one.  It was recommended in the case of the first Banking Commission. In regard to the original consolidated note issue, arrangements were made to <Col N="824" /> have it backed by liquid sound advances.  I have explained already that the Currency Commission was not satisfied with the arrangements which the banks were prepared to make, nor were the banks perfectly satisfied with the arrangements which the Currency Commission wishes to make in that connection.  The banks, after all, have a certain confidence reposed in them. In this country, they have maintained that confidence over a very long period, and have not sacrificed it even in this particular case, and they solved the question of the backing of the consolidated note issue by pledging these notes with the Currency Commission. That was not the intention, either when the Act was passing through this House, or when the matter was under consideration, I think, by the original Banking Commission.</P>
    <P>Now, the principal contention that I make in recommending this amendment is that, although we boast of our independence and claim to be a sovereign State, we do not back that claim with our own money.  It is a derogation, to my mind, of status, and there is no earthly reason for it.  The banks, in this country of ours, have survived over 100 years.  Not a single depositor in 100 years has been disappointed in getting his money whenever he wanted it, and it is an extraordinary thing that we should set up a commission&mdash;a commission of yesterday&mdash;which will not accept that standing and that status.  Why, every single penny that there is in the Currency Commission at the present moment, every penny that there will be in the central bank that they will have control over, came from those banks here in this country, and the Irish banks, in their turn, got it from our own people. There is every national reason why we should have an issue of currency backed by our own assets.  The assets of our own people are as good as there are in any part of the world.  What is the meaning of liquid sound advances? It means advances to customers in which there is collateral, and collateral which is as negotiable and as good as any of the sterling assets on the other side.  It is all nonsense for us to be talking about our sovereignty, our <Col N="825" /> independence, and all the rest of it, if we are not prepared to accept the value of our own 6d. or our own £ as being as good for the backing of the note issue of this country as the sterling assets.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for anything unreasonable in respect of this, because I realise at once the ease with which one can cash in on the London Stock Exchange any sterling securities that one might have, or how easy it is to get a cheque on the Bank of England cashed, and so on.  I realise that this is a conservative country, with a conservative banking system, and I am not asking for the whole of the backing of our currency here; I am only asking that it should be in the proportion of one in three, and it is not an unreasonable thing to ask for.  It is one in regard to which the circumstances of the case warrant us in having confidence in our own people.  For that reason, this proposed central bank has none of the characteristics of a central bank.  Have we not the courage to back at least a portion of the issue of our notes with our own assets?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully, in principle, that it would be wise for us to have portion of our currency backed by domestic assets.  I accept fully what Deputy Cosgrave says about the soundness of our own assets and our own banking system and bankers.  I realise that we have a reliable banking system here and reliable bankers, who have not failed the people of this country in safeguarding the deposits committed to their charge.  That is true.  There is no country in the world where there is sounder security than here.  The question between us, then, is, how is that to be arranged?  How is it to be arranged that we should have domestic backing for a portion of our currency? I am quite willing, if it were practicable, to adopt Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion&mdash;quite willing&mdash;but since we discussed this matter before, I went into the whole subject again with my advisers, and I also sought other advice.  I sought the best banking advice that is available to the Government-experienced men-and I put <Col N="826" /> Deputy Cosgrave's amendment to them and asked their opinion on it, and their answer was that it is impracticable and that it cannot be adopted.  I asked, why, and a variety of reasons were given.  The advice of these bankers, men with as long experience of banking as any bankers in the country, was that the liquid sound advances, as a basis of backing for even portion of our currency, could not be adopted by the banking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I am quite willing to accept, in principle&mdash;taking into account our financial history, taking into account national sentiment, if you like, but, more important still, our financial soundness&mdash;that we should have no hesitation in taking the risk of having a proportion of our currency backed by domestic assets.  That is not an unreasonable proposition, and, if it could be done in the way Deputy Cosgrave suggests, I would not hesitate to adopt it, but having gone to those who know more about it than I do, and who would have the job of putting the system into operation-that would be their responsibility-I am told that it cannot be done.  I am told, not alone by the Currency Commission&mdash; they told us that before, as I already informed the House-but by the Banking Commission, that it is not practicable.  I also went to bankers of long standing, and with experience and knowledge of the subject, and their advice to me was that it is not practicable. The only way out, that I see, is along the line of the amendments I have down later in regard to the Currency Commission (Amendment) Act of 1930.  I think there is a way there of securing, to some extent at any rate, what Deputy Cosgrave desires, what I would desire, what I think the Government would desire, and that, probably, the whole House would desire.  But having examined the matter, having gone everywhere that I could to get technical and reliable advice on it&mdash; not alone, as I say, to the members of the Currency Commission, to whom the matter did not come as a new subject, or the Currency Commission officials, but to those who are independent of the Currency Commission and are experienced bankers-and being <Col N="827" /> advised by them all that Deputy Cosgrave's amendment is not practicable, I have to bow to superior knowledge and experience and I cannot, therefore, accept Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.  I think, however, that a way of meeting, to an extent at any rate, the principle that he advocates and the principle that I myself should like to see adopted, is offered in later amendments that are down here for consideration.  I refer to the amendments to the Currency Commission Act of 1930.</P>

      <P>In page 25, before Section 46 but in Part VI to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) If at any time it should appear to the board, with the concurrence of the Minister, that it is expedient so to do, it shall be lawful for the board to make, with the consent of the Minister, regulations requiring every licensed banker to settle all or a particular class or particular classes (defined in the regulations) of his clearances by cheques drawn either (as shall be specified in the regulations) on the bank or on an agent appointed for the purpose by the bank and requiring every licensed banker, for the purposes of so settling such clearances, to make and maintain with the bank such deposits as shall be prescribed by the board by or under the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) If at any time it should appear to the board, with the concurrence of the Minister, that it is expedient so to do, it shall be lawful for the board to make, with the consent of the Minister, regulations requiring every licensed banker to lodge with <Col N="829" /> the bank for clearance all such cheques, bills, notes, or other negotiable instruments (payable outside the State and lodged for clearance at an office in the State of such banker) as shall be prescribed in that behalf by the board by or under the regulations.</P>
    <P>(3) If and whenever regulations made by the board under either of the foregoing sub-sections of this section are in force, it shall be the duty of every licensed banker to comply with those regulations and, if any licensed banker fails (whether by act or omission) so to do, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100 for every day during which such failure is continued.</P>
    <P>Central banks generally perform the function of clearing payments between the commercial banks in their respective countries.  As the commercial banks generally keep balances with central banks, the settlement of payments can be conveniently effected by means of debits and credits between the accounts in the books of the central banks.  Paragraph (j) of the original Section 7 of the Bill empowered the central bank &ldquo;to keep the accounts of any bankers clearing.&rdquo;  Many central banks carry out clearing arrangements and settlement of balances as a natural development of central banking functions.  I think there are few, if any, central banks that do not, in fact, carry out the function of clearances.  That is so in the case of the Bank of England and of the Federal Reserve Banks of the United States of America.  They certainly do, and some others.  In some of these cases it is provided by law that the central bank should carry out clearing arrangements for their respective commercial banks. The Irish banks, of course, have already their own clearing arrangements, and it is not proposed to disturb these arrangements, but it is considered desirable to empower the central bank to perform this function if the need should ever arise in the future, and if circumstances would <Col N="830" /> make it desirable that the commercial banks should be required to effect their clearances through the central bank.</P>
    <P>Clearances through the central bank, apart from being a matter of great convenience to the commercial banks, are of some significance in economising the use of cash in banking operations, and thus tend to strengthen the banking system at times when big demands are made by the public for more cash. It has been pointed out that the settlement of internal clearances through the central bank makes for economy in the amount of cash required to be held by the various commercial banks, and that a similar economy can be effected in the amount of foreign exchange required for the purpose of effecting external clearances if these are all centralised and effected through the central bank.  This is an important consideration where payments have to be made to countries from which we import more than we export, and in which we have no substantial assets and investments such as we have, for instance, in Great Britain.  I think the suggested arrangement, if put into operation, will be found advantageous from the point of view of the State as well as of the commercial banks, and may probably be a source of economy to the banks as well as to their customers. However, the section does not at present seek to impose a system of clearances, but empowers the board of the central bank, with the concurrence of the Minister, if it thinks it expedient to do so, to make regulations requiring the licensed bankers to adopt the central bank as the medium for clearances for internal and external operations.</P>

      <P>When I first saw this amendment, and the provision in Section 7, it struck me that this was going to be another imposition on the banking system without any corresponding advantage.  The present clearing system has been in operation for a very considerable time.  I must say that I have never heard any criticism or complaint about it.  It had this advantage, that it was kept within what one might describe as the banking system as such, and within whatever confidences there are in that connection. There was this confidence in it, that when a person drew a cheque he knew that the confidence of the bank could be relied upon not to have any talk about it.  The first thing that strikes me about this amendment is that all cheques drawn, on whatever bank, must be lodged in this new institution. You will have, possibly, the six persons on this central bank and its officials in contact with that extra information.  The point is a small one, but it is one which, I expect, banking interests would be concerned about. The principal thing I am concerned about is this: Is this going to mean a delay in the clearing of cheques?  I have not given much attention to the matter for some time, but, speaking from recollection, cheques are, or used to be, cleared in two days.  Assume that the period was two days, is this going to mean an extra day?  This is new work for a new body that has not had previous experience of it.  If there is going to be no extra delay then the objection on that score falls.  Another objection is that a deposit must be kept, presumably free of interest, by the commercial banks with the central bank for the purpose.  They have their credit at present in the Bank of England. Does it mean having an extra bank added to their list of expenses? If it does, it means that they have to keep a credit in London and a credit here.  That appears to me to mean further expense without any corresponding advantage.  I should like to see where the advantage lies, if there be one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> I hope the new central bank will not be a sort of Nosey-Parker.  But there is a general apprehension on the part of persons outside whenever they see Governmental interference in these matters, that there is something of that sort afoot.  I should say off-hand that that is not so.  But to explain that to people outside is quite a different matter.  The real issues here are: does this mean a further lodgment of money on the part of each bank on which it will get no interest because, on its face, it appears that that would be so?  Secondly, does it mean that there will be extra delay in the clearance of cheques?  That would be a matter of some importance.  There is a further objection.  Regulations are to be made by a board which, in effect, is not responsible to anybody.  It is not responsible to this House.  This board gets statutory authority to make regulations.  I object to that.  It is bad enough to have Ministerial power to make regulations.  Is is true that they usually arrange that they can be annulled?  It is not a form of legislation that is particularly attractive to anybody except Ministers, and I suppose the Civil Service generally.  It is not a good system.  But to have regulations made by a body not responsible to this House, a nominated body, is something which is unusual.  They can exercise very considerable powers under these regulations.  In these circumstances, the proposal seems to me to be capable of adding to the expense of business; to be capable of adding to the delays that are occasioned in business, and to be capable of spreading information which is of a highly confidential character.  It adds nothing whatever in efficiency; it adds nothing to the status of the institution, nor does it add in any other respect to commercial progress or activity in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
      <P>In page 25, before Section 46, but in part VI, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) If and whenever the board shall recommend to the Minister that it is <Col N="833" /> expedient to require every licensed banker to make and maintain with the bank, such deposits as shall be prescribed, and to settle all or a particular class or particular classes of clearances by cheques, drawn either on the bank, or on any agent appointed for the purpose by the bank, the Minister may make an Order declaring in accordance with such request the particular deposits to be made and maintained with the bank, and the particular class or classes of clearances to be cleared by cheques drawn on the bank or on an agent, appointed for the purpose by the bank.</P>
    <P>(2) If and whenever the board shall recommend to the Minister, that it is expedient to require every licensed banker to deposit with the bank all cheques, bills, notes or other negotiable instruments payable outside the State and lodged for clearance at an office in the State, the Minister may, in accordance with such request, make an Order accordingly.</P>
    <P>(3) The Minister may, at any time, upon the request of the board, by order, rescind, vary or amend in accordance with such request an Order made by him under this section.</P>
    <P>(4) No Order made under this section, upon a request of the board, which is not unanimous shall be of any force or effect unless or until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and has been approved by resolution of each such House.</P>
    <P>(5) Every Order made under this section on a unanimous request of the board shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling such Order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which such House has sat after such Order is laid before it, such Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such Order.</P>
    <P>(6) It shall be the duty of every <Col N="834" /> licensed banker to comply with any Order made under this section and if any licensed banker fails (whether by act or omission) so to do, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100 for every day during which such failure is continued.</P>
    <P>(7) If and whenever the deposits made by a licensed banker with the bank under this section, exceed the amount it is necessary for the bank to maintain in order to settle the clearances of such licensed banker, the bank shall pay to the licensed banker on such proportion of such deposits as are equivalent to this excess interest at a rate or rates equal to the rate or rates the bank receives for its corresponding investments.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is somewhat exploratory, but if it were adopted, the deposits would cover any deposits required for international clearances or domestic clearances, or safeguard certain assets that are held in respect of banks' liabilities within the State.  Under the Minister's amendment No. 56, any deposits that would be required would be for the purpose of settling clearances.  Under sub-section (1) of my amendment, these deposits would not be restricted by the necessity for using them for mere clearances. But, in considering this amendment and some other matters in connection with it, certain phenomena came to my notice that I think require a certain amount of attention and a certain amount of safeguarding.  If we look at the statistical returns issued by the Currency Commission for April last, we find the domestic liabilities of the banks on the 31st March, 1942, were £165,790,000.  These were the liabilities within the State.  As against that, they held assets within the State that only amounted to £77,854,000.  So that there was a difference of £87,936,000 between the assets and the liabilities of the banks within the State.  But assets were held outside the State. That was the position at the end of March, 1942.</P>
    <P>If we look at the position from that <Col N="835" /> point of view at the end of March, 1939, we find that as against £34,726,000 of liabilities within the State, the banks held £71,234,000 of assets within the State, and held outside the State, in respect of liabilities within the State, a sum of £63,492,000.  We have the position, therefore, that between March, 1939, and March, 1942, while the liabilities of Irish banks within the State rose by £31,064,000, the assets they held within the State as against these liabilities rose only by £6,619,000. So that there is a sum of £24,445,000, or about £24,500,000, in liabilities within the State covered only by assets held outside the State.  That is a very considerable increase in the holding of assets outside the State against domestic liabilities, and I suggest that there is a possible serious danger in that.  Of that £87,936,000 held outside the State against liabilities inside the State, a fairly large amount is no doubt held by four banks that are not institutions belonging to this State; that is, they are institutions that are regarded from the point of view of taxation and everything else in Great Britain as being British institutions. In the situation that has developed and is continuing to develop there, we do not know what type of special taxation or capital levy might be introduced in Great Britain that might operate in some way or another against those assets as long as they are held in Great Britain by non-Eire institutions.</P>
    <P>In the first part of my amendment I say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If and whenever the board shall recommend to the Minister that it is expedient to require every licensed banker to make and maintain with the bank, such deposits as shall be prescribed...</P>
    <P>When, in the development of the amendment, I free that from any condition that these deposits will be made in respect of clearances, I mean it to cover a situation in which the board might consider that, in order to preserve to a greater extent assets that our banks had lying outside the country in respect of liabilities within the country, the banks might be required <Col N="836" /> to transfer these assets to the central bank and, even though they were held in Great Britain, that they would be held for the banks by the central bank as an Irish institution and therefore would be free from running any of the risks that they might run in the present extraordinary circumstances by being held by institutions not belonging to this country.</P>
    <P>A very large amount of money is held abroad by Irish banks in cash or at short call.  I should like to know why it is necessary to hold so much cash abroad.  I take it that cash is held abroad for the purpose of keeping one-tenth against liabilities that are liabilities to the banks abroad and may be held also in connection with our trade balance and whatever clearances may be required in connection with them.  It appears to me that there is some connection between the amount of money that is held in cash or on short call outside the country and our trade balances.  If we look at the balances of trade from 1933 to 1937, we find that there was what we call an adverse trade balance in 1933 of £16,768,000, in 1934 £21,927,000 and, over the years 1933 to 1937 inclusive, there was an average adverse trade balance of £18,539,000.  If we take the cash held abroad during that time, there was an average total of £19,433,000 held by the Irish banks in cash and at short call.  Some of that money was required, to the extent of one-tenth, to cover liabilities abroad.</P>
    <P>Let us take 1933 as an example.  The adverse trade balance in that year was £16,768,000.  The total amount of cash held abroad was £20,641,000.  The external liabilities were £49,200,000. Taking it that £4,920,000 of that cash was held against external liabilities, we had, in some kind of relation to our trade balances, cash held abroad to the extent of £15,520,000.  In the same way, on an average against an adverse trade balance of £19,503,000 for the six years, there was cash held abroad, when allowance was made for the one-tenth, to the extent of £14,686,000. Where your adverse trade balance was £18,500,000 you had £14,500,000 held by the banks in cash.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> During the last two years a very considerable change has taken place.  In 1940, when the adverse trade balance was £13,816,000, the excess in cash and money at short call over what was required to cover external liabilities was £22,230,000.  During 1941, when we ceased to have an adverse trade balance, and when we exported £2,298,000 worth more than we imported, the cash held abroad, again making allowance to cover external liabilities by one-tenth, was £28,425,000.  While the trade balance has changed from an adverse of £16,522,000 in 1939 to a favourable trade balance of £2,500,000 in 1941, the amount of money held abroad over what was required to cover liabilities rose from £16,000,000 to £28,000,000, or by £12,000,000.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that an examination of that position would show that there was a very considerable amount of money lying abroad earning nothing. It could be utilised, on the credit of the central bank, by deposits being made with the central bank, to earn money.  When we see a situation like that developing, it does seem to require some review here in order to ascertain why such a large amount of money would be lying abroad, perhaps lying dangerously abroad, and earning no money, while we were here paying very high rates for any money we required.</P>
    <P>Under the first part of the amendment, it does seem an examination is required as to why deposits of that kind should not be made, in the first place, to safeguard those assets that are being held abroad against liabilities that are entirely domestic, and, in the second place, we should like to know why our financial resources are wasted by the holding of such huge amounts in the shape of cash and money at short call abroad, earning nothing, particularly when our trading position, which might be expected to require money abroad for clearance purposes, has been so radically changed, when we compare it with what it was before the emergency started.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether any estimate has been made of the amount <Col N="838" /> of money that would be saved by bringing domestic clearances from London here; and, again, what might be saved by bringing the international clearances from London here.  Deputy Cosgrave has asked whether this is going to cost the banks anything more. I should like to know that, too, and how the central bank is going to pay itself for the amount of work it will do in that connection.  The amendment provides that where decisions along these important lines are taken, by a unanimous decision of the board, they may be put into operation by an Order of the Minister, but they may be challenged by a vote here.  Where the Minister considers it advisable to take decisions on these lines, and where he has not the unanimous recommendation of the board, they would have to come before the Dáil for positive approval.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment, if it is put into operation, where deposits are made with the bank over and above what is required for clearance purposes, the banks making the deposits would get, on the amount of money they have deposited, interest at the same rates or some equivalent rates as the bank was earning on these deposits &mdash;they would earn money on the proportion of the amount of their deposits that was not required for clearance purposes.  Again, I say the idea is in the first place to safeguard money that is held abroad as against liabilities that are internal ones; in the second place, to get some kind of machinery going that would show how much money was being unnecessarily held abroad as cash and would see that it was put to use by the banks or would require deposits to be made so that it could be made productive through the operations of the central bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add to the protests about statutory powers being extended to this body. It is quite bad enough to have a number of Government Departments practically making statutory orders but now we are going to have an outside body making statutory orders with the concurrence of the Minister.  The Minister will probably say that this clause is <Col N="839" /> only permissive but, of course, having parted with it as a permissive clause, it may become operative the day after. We must look at it in that light and consider the advantages and the disadvantages. As far as I know, it is proposed to use only the central bank for collecting English and foreign cheques.  In other words, they are to be centralised here and sent across.  It was suggested that that would mean perhaps one day's delay.  I would suggest that it means more like three or four days' delay because, remember, the ordinary banks, when dealing with the central bank, will have to carry out the same procedure that they carry out at present, namely, they will have to collect, record and take particulars of all the cheques that they send on to the central bank, the central bank will again have to do that and, therefore, I would suggest that there will be three or four days' delay.  If the Irish banks are going to get that service performed for nothing, I would like to suggest that it is something new, because it will entail substantial staff who will have a substantial amount of business to perform.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I would like to suggest to the Minister.  While the banks at present adopt the procedure of collecting these cheques and sending them away through certain well-defined channels, in certain cases there are cheques which, by reason of some doubt or something else, may be called upon for special clearances and those are taken in a class by themselves and can be dealt with quite separately from the ordinary machinery.  Is the Minister going to provide for that or is he going to say that a system which has grown up and which has been founded on years of practice, must, in the interests of centralisation or something else, be done away with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the account, apparently, the banks are going to have to keep their present channels for Irish cheques coming back here.  I do not see how the Minister could suggest that there is any saving there or that there will not be very substantial <Col N="840" /> expense, first of all in cheques being delayed three or four days going back to the other side and the banks not being credited with those balances. The next thing is that, apparently, there is going to be one channel for cheques going one way and another channel for cheques going the other way.  That is a type of&mdash;I suppose you might call it&mdash;Heath Robinson machinery which I am afraid we are becoming only too familiar with in this country.  Somebody will have to pay the cost of that.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that, when he is replying, he should deal very fully with those points because, while he might say that this expenditure is not very great, it is all heaping costs on to the back of industry which industry must bear in the last resort.  The Irish banks and the central bank will all have to be paid a profit over and above the services they perform and that is all going to come back to the ordinary trader in increased cost of running his business.</P>

      <P>The main argument against the amendment I propose, as I understand it, is that there would be delay.  I do not know that it is a fact that there need be any greater delay than there is at present.  I do not see why the central bank should not be as expeditious in dealing with the matter of clearances as the office which at present performs that function for the Irish banks in Dublin, or any places in Great Britain where clearances are carried out for Irish banks.</P>
      <P>At present the office is connected with the Bank of Ireland.  As a matter of convenience, the practice of clearances being carried out by that office has grown up.  That office clears cheques for the Irish banks and if the office had to move across the street in Dame Street or College Green, I do not think there need be one hour's extra delay by reason of the fact that a new office, situated somewhere in the centre of the city, might be doing this work in future rather than the office which at present performs the function.  It might happen that there would be delay in connection with what might technically be called foreign cheques, but I do not think it necessarily follows that there should be delay of one day more much less the three days Deputy Dockrell suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave earlier to-day complained that this new bank would not have any of the attributes of the ordinary central banks as we know their constitution and their practice in any other part of the world.  Here is one function which the great majority <Col N="842" /> of them perform for the banks in their respective countries.  These central banks in most cases&mdash;I cannot say what the percentage is, but it is very high-perform clearing operations for their respective banks and we propose to give that function to the new central bank which is to be set up here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave ought not to complain if we give it that function because it is one of the attributes of the majority of central banks the world over.  It is true that, to some extent, there may be a loss of interest, but it will only be very small because the amount of interest paid on the deposits held by the clearance banks, if we may so refer to them, for the commercial banks here at present is, admittedly, in most cases, very small.  Something may be earned on these deposits, but, if anything is earned, it is a very small amount.  The cost to the banks should not be any more than what the cost of clearance to them is to-day.  I do not see how it need be any greater.</P>

      <P>The banks make their own records and the clearance office which operates at present, perhaps, makes records.  If it does not, the new central bank will have to make records and keep account of all the cheques sent to it for clearance, but I imagine that the office which does clearances at present keeps its records, and, if so, the necessity for doing that will, I take it, disappear and the work will in future be carried <Col N="843" /> on by the central bank, so I do not see the point in regard to duplication.</P>
      <P>Regulations may be made by the bank.  It is true that this is a permissive section, but it is not true, I suggest to Deputy Dockrell, that the Order will be made the day after power is given, because I realise, and I am sure the board of the central bank will be bound to realise, that this matter of clearances is not something which can be arranged in a day.  It is a highly technical business which will have to be studied and a knowledge of all its various operations will have to be acquired by the officials of the central bank; but I am satisfied that the central bank will not jump into this work the first day, the first week or the first month it is set up.  It will take its time, and examine the whole situation, and see whether the setting up of a clearance system to be controlled by the central bank will be advantageous to the commercial community, to the banks and to the State as a whole.  I believe it will be advantageous and helpful, and that eventually it will be an economy.</P>
      <P>I did not see exactly the appositeness of a good deal Deputy Mulcahy said in proposing his amendment about the large amounts of cash held outside the country and the necessity for reducing those large cash assets abroad and repatriating them, in connection with this section.</P>

      <P>I take it that what the Deputy said in relation to Section 57 related to deposits.  Deposits will be made with the central bank here for the purpose of clearance.  If it is for the purpose of clearance, the amount of deposit required would be very small and would not affect the assets held abroad to any appreciable extent.  The amount kept at present in the banks which do the clearances for the Irish banks is, comparatively speaking, very small&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I see that.  I pointed out that the Minister's amendment only required deposits for the purpose of making clearances.  I framed my amendment so that the deposits could be made without any suggestion that they were to be made only for the purpose of clearances.  I indicated some of the reasons why these powers should be operated in order to require licensed bankers to bring assets abroad under a national institution for taxation here and to earn money here instead of having them lying idle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>It is one that could have been very usefully discussed on various Stages of the Bill, but I suggest that it should not be brought in as a kind of side-wind because it is a very important power to give to the central bank.

    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> This amendment is moved for the purpose of carrying out the general intention which was indicated during the debate in Committee, and also, perhaps, on Second Reading, namely, that there should be two lines of approach in order to add new securities, etc., in accordance with Section 3 of the Currency Act, as a backing for currency. It was suggested that the matter could be dealt with in either of two ways.  If the bank board were unanimous about it, and the Minister agreed, it could be put through.  There was no question in that case of coming before the Dáil at all.  It was felt that, if there was unanimity in a body, composed as the board would be, there must be a strong argument for taking such action, that it was a matter which should be done quickly, and that it would be sufficient for the Minister for Finance, acting in the interests of the community as a whole, to give his concurrence.  If, on the other hand, there was a division of opinion amongst the members of the board, if the board wanted other securities as backing beside sterling, and if the Minister agreed with the view of the board as expressed by a majority, it was felt that before the view of the board and the Minister could become effective it would have to come before the two Houses of Parliament for express ratification by means of a resolution. I think that that is a fair attempt to meet all points of view.  It was felt that if we had unanimity on the board their decision should be made absolute, but you might never get unanimity and it might be very desirable in the national interest that other securities should be added, but the matter might never get beyond the board or might never come to the Minister. If, however, there was a majority decision with which the Minister agreed, it was felt that the public interest aspect of the matter could be determined by Parliament by means of a resolution.  We have discussed the question before and I do not think it is necessary to go into it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I would sooner sing a requiem over turf production than have another long debate on it. I think there is occasion for placing a wreath over turf production, seeing the way it has been handled.  I want to impress on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that the whole question of turf production is not being handled properly.  I say that with all sincerity, and as one anxious to try, as far as possible, to convert our people to a turf-burning mentality. <Col N="852" /> The Taoiseach worked himself into a white heat complaining of the cost of the transport of turf from Mayo and Galway to Dublin.  I think it is perfectly fantastic to transport turf from Galway and Mayo and Donegal to Dublin under present circumstances. The nearest piece of imbecility to that is to try to cart sea-foam over that long journey.  The commodity itself does not justify that long transportation; the cost of it is abnormally high, and in the long run the people who produce the turf get a low wage while the people who consume it pay a high price.  Much as the Taoiseach may disagree, I think there is exploitation of the producer and exploitation of the consumer because of inability to relate the cost of production to the selling price to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I suggested to this House two years ago that the sensible policy is to regard counties like Kildare, Offaly, Meath and Westmeath as turf reservoirs for the City of Dublin; that the sensible thing for the State to do is to concentrate its activities on producing turf in those areas on the maximum scale, and transporting it at the lowest possible charge to the City of Dublin.  I think the Government mishandled the entire problem of producing turf in Kildare.  There is most excellent turf in Kildare, stone turf, brown turf, yellow turf and white turf.  You can blend stone turf with kindling turf, which gives the best possible results.  Stone turf by itself will not make a fire in a grate.  In a range or boiler it will burn, but anybody who tries to burn stone turf in an ordinary grate will find that it will not flame; it is just a dark red patch of combustibility.  The County Kildare has enormous turf deposits.  Meath, Westmeath, and Offaly could also make a very substantial contribution to providing Dublin with turf.  But instead of trying to organise workers to pro duce turf in those nearby counties, and paying a reasonable rate of wages for the production of that turf, the Government embarked upon a policy of paying a wage of 32/- a week in the turf camps in County Kildare, less 5/- for food and 1/5 for unemployment insurance and national health insurance contributions.</P>

      <P>What would the Deputy suggest as a decent rate of wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary early this year that a decent rate of wages was probably something on which he and I would differ, but I also suggested that he should call a conference between representatives of the turf workers and himself and try to iron out there a rate of wages which would attract workers to those camps.  In that way he would have got enthusiasm for the production of turf, co-operation in the cutting of turf, and, in the long run&mdash; this is important&mdash;he would have got turf on a bogside 30 miles from the City of Dublin.  Instead of that, what did we do?  We engaged in the foolish task of carrying turf from Donegal to Dublin.  A good deal of the turf was <Col N="854" /> lying in railway wagons for a couple of days before it was transported. When it came to Dublin it was sodden with moisture.  If the Government had gone ahead with the camps in Kildare, paid a reasonable rate of wages to the workers there, and generally indicated that they wanted those areas to produce the maximum quantity of turf for the City of Dublin, I believe that they could have got very much better results from the County Kildare and other neighbouring counties than by paying the low rate of wages which has been paid in those camps this year. More than ever this year we need people to win turf for fuel.</P>
      <P>This year we have less people engaged in the production of turf than last year.  We are getting no coal now, whereas last year we got coal and there were reserves of coal here.  The harm is done this year, and people in the cities will have to pay for the short-sightendness of Government policy with regard to turf production.  Some effort ought to be made at the end of this year, and before next year's campaign is on the way, to exploit the peat deposits near Dublin, and to pay a reasonable rate of wages to workers engaged in turf production.  The matter of determining what is a reasonable rate of wages can be discussed between representatives of the turf workers and the Government.  I believe that if the Government take that line they will get a greater quantity of turf produced next year, and that turf production will run smoothly and efficiently, which has not been the case this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make an appeal to the Minister for Finance in respect of another matter.  The Minister knows that in 1932 and 1933, a very large number of civil servants, many of them very lowly-paid people, retired on pension when the cost-of-living index figure was 50 or 55.  Their pensions are governed by what is an overriding maximum, and that overriding maximum provides that a person retiring will retire on the index figure appropriate to the quarter immediately preceding that on which he retired, and provides that while the pension may go down if the cost-of-living index <Col N="855" /> figure falls, it can never go above the point applicable to the pension when he retired.  To give an example, a man may have retired when the cost-of-living index figure was 50, and if it fell to 25 he would suffer a reduction in the ratio of 50 to 25.  On the other hand, if the cost-of-living figure rises to 150, he could never go above 50. That is manifestly an unfair position. In normal peace times it did not work out in the same way as it works out to-day.  Here is the position that exists.  For instance, an officer in the post office might have retired on a pension of 25/- or 30/- weekly, measured by the index figure of 50. The index figure would now certainly average 140.  Quite obviously a man who retired when the index figure was 50 is suffering very grave hardship if the index figure rises to 140.  If the pension was inadequate, as most pensions of lowly-paid people are inadequate, when the index figure was 50, how much more inadequate is it when the figure is raised to 140?  Apart from his official position, I am sure the Minister realises the hardship that must be imposed in cases of that kind. While I do not expect the Minister to give a definite answer now, I ask him to examine the matter sympathetically, with a view to making some adjustment in the pension regulations, which will enable persons in that position to have the index figure varied in any upward direction, thus increasing the amount of bonus on pensions.  The cost would not be considerable.  I feel sure that if the Minister examined the equity of the case he would realise that there is considerable merit in it, and that ordinary justice demands that some effort should be made to remedy the hardship which many lowly-paid pensioners are enduring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I raised a matter with the Minister concerning ten or 12 officials of the ordnance service.  At the time there was but one case, but I rather think it governed the others.  In this particular case a man entered the service and was promoted surveyor unestablished on May 6th, 1903.  He was one <Col N="856" /> of a number of civil servants who were given the option in 1915 or 1916 of joining the Army or taking his discharge from the service.  He took his discharge.  He was reinstated in February, 1924, and it appears that he would require to have served 15 years from 1903 before he would be an established official, and then 7½ years of that time would qualify for pension. Perhaps it might be as well if I read counsel's opinion in this case.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have carefully considered querist's position in the light of his career as set out in his letter of April, 1940, and, in my opinion, he has real grounds for complaint.  In my opinion, when querist was reinstated in February, 1924, and obtained a certificate from the Minister for Finance under Section 2 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, he was entitled then to claim that he had unestablished service from the date of his appointment as surveyor unestablished on the 6th May, 1903, up to the date of the reinstatement.  The certificate of the Minister of February, 1924, was correct and in accordance with the statute in dealing only, as I understand it did, with the period between the dismissal on the 31st March, 1916, and the date of reinstatement. The section does not authorise or require a certificate in respect of the period of previous service.  The section provides that the period between dismissal and reinstatement is to be added to the periods of service which he is otherwise qualified to reckon under the Superannuation Acts.  If it be necessary further to define what period is intended, Section 7 (f) of the Superannuation Act, 1936, makes it clear that the period is to include the period of the person's service within the meaning of the Superannuation Acts in any British Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of querist, therefore, in February, 1924, was, in my opinion, that he had nearly 21 years' unestablished service and he was entitled to any rights which that service gave him.  Unfortunately, they gave in themselves no right to superannuation claims and all that can be claimed is whatever querist <Col N="857" /> was entitled to under the Minute of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries of the 5th December, 1906, relating to the &lsquo;superannuation of certain temporary civil assistants employed on the Ordnance Survey&rsquo;. This minute provided that every civil assistant should enter the service in an unestablished capacity and should not be eligible for the establishment until he has served for 15 years.  The minute provides that &lsquo;at the end of that period if the board desire to retain his services he may be placed on the establishment subject to his obtaining a certificate of qualification from the Civil Service Commissioners&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that after 15 years' service unestablished querist was eligible for the establishment subject to obtaining a certificate, and if established would be entitled to reckon one-half his previous service for superannuation. There was, however, no right to be placed on the establishment and all that can be said is that on reinstatement in February, 1924, querist was eligible to be placed forthwith upon the establishment and to reckon one-half of his service of 21 years for superannuation.  In my opinion, querist was in justice entitled to this treatment.</P>
    <P>Apparently the course taken was to assert that querist's unestablished service began only on the date of his dismissal and he was required to complete 15 years from that date before being established.  I can see no justification whatever for fixing the date of his dismissal as the commencing point.  The section referred to is quite clear that on reinstatement the officer is deemed to have continuous service from the date of his actual appointment and the effect of the certificate and the reinstatement is simply to blot out the interruption of the service.... I cannot see, however, that any legal claim could be formulated in the courts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During my term of office in the Government, civil servants who were affected were provided with compensation in respect of the period of disturbance <Col N="858" /> around 1915 and 1916.  This is a case in which, apparently, a man does not get that treatment.  He was dismissed from the service in 1916.  He had then some 13 years' unestablished service.  He was taken back in 1924. The claim I make is that he was entitled to add those eight years he was out of the service, for political reasons, to his 13 years of service, which would make 21 years.  He claims to be entitled to add ten and a half years in the computation of his pension. That is not an unreasonable claim.  There are not many of these cases.  I should be sorry to think that any section of those in the service of the State should feel that they did not get the treatment meted out to others. In this case, the man got the option of joining the Army.  He had been a civil servant from 1903 to 1916.  We have always taken the view that no man should be prejudiced by reason of his taking a position of that sort. This man's remuneration was about £400 and he goes out on a pension of about £68.  I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask for the additional years.  I can forward to the Minister, if he wishes, any of the papers in the case which would enable him to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>These are the only cases which could be alleged against either Government, so far as I know, of treatment which is harsh.  If I understand correctly, the most he could be asked to do would be to give one or two additional years after re-entering the service to qualify for his 15 years.  Having regard to the hardship he suffered, these eight years might be regarded as years of service for the purpose of the Superannuation Acts.  From 1924 to 1940 would be only 16 years.  Add ten and a half years to that and we get 26½ years.  The man is now 65 years of age, and he has given 37 years' service.  If, in this connection, the section provides that two years' service will only count for one for superannuation purposes, it is obvious that there is additional hardship. The man has no legal redress, but he has a strong case, morally and nationally.  He should not be prejudiced by reason of his dismissal in 1916 for exercising what would be re garded as his right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene on account of the remarks made by Deputy Norton regarding turf production.  I find it difficult to understand him when he suggests that Government policy was to get turf from distant parts of the country and not from places close at hand.  Some time last year, it was announced in the House that the greatest possible effort was to be made to get turf in areas not far removed from Dublin.  A certain quantity of turf was cut last year, and is available in counties like Donegal, Mayo and Kerry, but the policy was to try to get turf cut at the nearest available places to the principal centre at which it was required&mdash;Dublin&mdash;so as to save transport. We set out to build camps for that purpose.  There was considerable difficulty as regards supply of raw materials, and there was not, I think, the progress that the Parliamentary Secretary had hoped for in that regard. The difficulty regarding this question seems to be whatever difference there is between Deputy Norton's view and my view.  The Government's view, my view and the view of the Parliamentary Secretary, I think, correspond with Deputy Norton's views&mdash;that if it were possible to get turf produced in Kildare, it would be an ideal way of meeting the difficulty.  We are agreed that the turf is there, but the manpower was not there.  It was difficult to get accommodation for the workers, and there was a certain amount of expense in that regard.  From that point of view, Deputy Norton and we are at one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point that appears to arise is that concerning reasonable wages.  I do not think that anybody would be more pleased than the Parliamentary Secretary to get an understanding as to what the wage should be to get turf produced there, provided the understanding was reasonable.  If we had some kind of common understanding as to what &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; means&mdash;if &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; were interpreted in a reasonable way&mdash;I think that the Parliamentary Secretary would welcome a proposition of that kind.  We must remember that the price paid for the production of turf in Kildare would have an influence on the cost of turf everywhere.  I am not sure that it need <Col N="860" /> necessarily be so, but the tendency would be for a person doing the same type of work in Mayo to ask why he should not get the same wage as was being paid in Kildare.  The wages paid in Kildare would not alone affect the price of turf here in Dublin but might affect the price right through the country.  I do not know whether the Deputy, from the labour point of view, is in favour of trying to get it by piecework. Some people, not accustomed to cutting turf and not knowing how to do it, would not be nearly as effective as those who know how to do it.  There should be a reasonable wage&mdash;if you could get agreement as to what a reasonable wage is.  Above that certain minimum given to everybody in the production of turf, there should be the possibility of paying by results. The people the Parliamentary Secretary would like to see at that work are those who would produce as much as can be produced by a man working at a reasonable rate.  We all know that, in the turf counties, men did earn very much more than the wage that would be paid to those who are not good turf cutters.  If there really was that spirit of reasonableness that the Deputy suggests, I am surprised that there has not been more progress.  I am perfectly certain that the Parliamentary Secretary would welcome any suggestions with regard to wages.  I think the Deputy has over-estimated the number of people we could get into Kildare to produce turf.  The estimates we got were not anything like sufficient to produce the amount needed for Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure: the estimate was made long before that.  People producing near their own homes and paid by piece-rate could earn very much more than the ordinary labourer coming into Kildare from one of the turf counties.  If we had enough local labour in Kildare, it would be a different matter.  When we were examining the possibilities, we did not feel we would get enough men there to produce the quantity required and, <Col N="861" /> very unwillingly, we had to go outside Kildare.  I have not read all the Parliamentary Secretary's statements here, but I know his general attitude to this problem.  He approached it in a very reasonable way, trying to make the production as economic as possible, so that we might have turf for the people who wanted to purchase fuel. When he could not get sufficient labour in Kildare, he went in a ring outside that county, but even then there was not sufficient labour available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of wages is a difficult one, as you have one set of wages reacting on another. Both food and fuel are important, and it would be disturbing to transfer workers from the land and from turf production to something else.  We must make the rates for these things as attractive as for other types of work.  Wages paid in various occupations throughout the country must be taken as a whole, as there is a reaction of one on the other.  For instance, if there were a big difference between the wages for road work and for agricultural work, there would be many people leaving agriculture to work on the roads.  If it is suggested, then, to bring up the wages of the agricultural worker, that brings in the question of the price at which the farmer can produce, with its effect on food prices.</P>
      <P>There is no disposition to be in any way unreasonable, and I think it would be contested that the rates suggested were unreasonable.  I am not in an absolute position to form any definite opinion, but I know that the approach on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary was one of reasonableness.  The idea was to have turf produced as near as possible to the city.  I say that so that, if there is a difference between us, we may know where it lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that there is not sufficient labour in Kildare to produce the quantity of turf required for Dublin City.  That is incontestably true.  How did the Turf Controller imagine that he would get workers to <Col N="862" /> go into Kildare to live under a Government camp scheme at 32/- per week, when the county council was paying 36/- for wheelers and 48/- for sleánsmen?  Why should a man living in Kildare throw away a job at 48/- to go into a camp at 32/-?  This whole thing seems to be based on theory and not on practice.  A good sleánsman in Kildare can earn 10/- and 12/- a day at turf cutting.  Unless the man is a certified lunatic, he will not go into a camp and work at 32/-.  If an ordinary private person, cutting turf for sale in competition with the merchants, finds it profitable to employ sleánsmen at 10/- and 12/- a day, how does the Government hope to get men into a camp at 32/-?</P>

      <P>That is the way it worked out.  The Government were paying 32/- a week, while men could earn 10/- and 12/- a day.  Not satisfied with that, the Government went further.  Hospitals Trust employed people last year in Kildare and paid them £2 10s. and £3 to cut turf, but they would not be allowed to do that this year and were told they must take workers from Dublin.  You might as well ask people to go down and kick the turf out of the bogs as expect it could be cut by those who have not been trained to do it.  The Guild of Goodwill were paying £3 10s. and £3 15s. but they were not allowed to pay those wages this year and employ local workers: instead they were told they must get people from Dublin.  All that has caused a very bad atmosphere. I suggest that, in this matter, we should get off the book and on to the bog, and let those who are engaged in the work put their views forward.  I want to help the Government, on the condition that decent wages are paid and that there is co-operation.</P>

I know that quite an amount of really bad turf has come into the city.  Even if it were good, people ask why the price is so high. It is 64/-, or something like that, at the moment, while it appears here from the Estimate that the Government is giving a subsidy at the rate of £1 per ton.  How can you ask people in Kildare to be reasonable and to take 32/-, to get the turf out, when they know that it is being sold here at 64/- and that there is a Government subsidy of 20/-?</P>

      <P>I wish I could get the figures, go into them, and find out. At any rate, I know one thing that it cannot be: it is not the price paid to the person who owns the bog.  That would be only an infinitesimal fraction of the whole cost.  I remember that, by way of a question here in the House, I mentioned cases of people who were getting only a few pence, and it was thought that I was wrong.  I was rung up by officials of the Department to know if I had made a mistake, but <Col N="864" /> what I had stated was correct, and the Parliamentary Secretary stood over it.  There was to have been arbitration in connection with it, I understood, but that was over 14 months ago and there has been no arbitration since.  Of course, I admit that the place I am talking about&mdash;it was in Galway, as a matter of fact&mdash;would not bear comparison with other places, on account of the differences, but in any case the price to the owners is only an infinitesimal part of the final cost. Take the case, however, of a worker who comes here to Dublin from, let us say, my own part of the country, up in the north-west, and who knows what he has to pay for turf here in the city, and then goes down to Kildare to work on the bogs there and only gets 32/- a week in wages: he wonders what is the reason for the extraordinary discrepancy between the wages he gets and the price at which the turf is sold. There is no use in expecting a reasonable attitude from that man until he gets a first-class analysis of the figures and is told why there should be this enormous difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, however, this whole question of turf looms before the minds of the people of this country as the greatest mess that was ever made. If we go back to what I said last night, the one thing that, we have been told, we have a superabundance of in this country is turf, and we were told by one Minister, when he was in charge of that Department, that, so far as the transport problem is concerned, it had been well thought out, but no thought seems to have been given to the fact that the Great Southern Railways Company could not haul the turf here to Dublin because they were allowed to enter the war period with only one week's supply of coal.  According to the report of the tribunal on transport that was then sitting, the railway company had only one week's supply of coal.  That report was in the hands of the Government in the summer of 1939 and was made public at about the end of August, 1939, and yet they left the situation there.  What did they do?  We are told that the idea of the turf-cutting programme in Kildare is to get the turf cut and won as near to Dublin as <Col N="865" /> you can get it.  I remember the farce that took place last year, when Donegal was thronged with people cutting turf, and they cut so much turf that it is lying there at the moment rotting.</P>

Since the famous boat that broke through the boom at the Siege of Derry, I do not think any boat was ever received with such enthusiasm, and the captain boasted that he had not lost one sod. One would think that he had come through mine-infested waters.  I think that that farce was gone through even a second time, and an attempt was made to have Donegal come to our rescue.  Even that little bit of our territory in the north-west was going to be of use to us, and we were told that the sea passage was grand and we would get plenty of turf.  But all that, evidently, has faded out; we did not hear any more about it and Donegal, as a turf area, is more or less abandoned, as far as the city is concerned.  Take any one part of the whole scheme in connection with turf, and you will find that there has been a mess all along the line, and, instead of being better off than we were last year, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, we will be worse off this year.</P>

      <P>And it does not appear that they have learned anything. I can understand the repercussion of an increase of wages to one body of workers over the whole field, but the Government have that under control.  I think their way was the wrong way to control it, but they have it under their control and they can prevent a spread of it, and if it was a question of the difference between relieving a certain amount of anxiety with regard to the coming winter's supply of fuel as against an increase of a few shillings a week in wages, that might have induced a larger gathering of workers to go down to Kildare, I think the balance would swing in favour of paying these increased wages as an emergency matter, as something that we must face up to, and possibly as something that might mean a little extra taxation in order to pay them.  Instead of doing that, we have let the best part of the season go.  We have let the workers go, and there is no way of inducing them to come back.  No matter what efforts are made, or what talk you have about the spirit of reason, I do not believe you will get these workers back until they get a satisfactory explanation of the vast gap that there is between the wages they are paid and the final price of the turf.</P>

      <P>Well, we want to get our curiosity satisfied, and the whole turf scheme, in the minds of the people, is just an unexplained mess.  There is not even a defence put up for what has happened.  Take the last thing which emerged in the course of the debate on the Central Bank Bill: the question of the way the local authorities were salted when they wanted to get an advance of finances for five months, in relation to a commodity which was bound to be sold and for which the price had been pretty nearly guaranteed to be such as would remunerate all expenses, and yet the county councils, in respect of the advance that they wanted, were salted to the tune of 4 per cent.  At no point does there seem to be anybody treating this thing in a large way. There are only niggling, half-hearted attempts, and when attempts at one plan fail, they advance a little to another plan, and it seems to me that, until these figures are explained and made clear to the public, you will not get rid of the sense of annoyance amongst the public at having to pay the price that they have to pay for turf, and the sense of grievance amongst the workers on account of the low wages they get compared with the price at which the turf is sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there were also the costs of going into the bog, bringing the turf out to the road, loading it there and bringing it to the rail, then bringing it by rail to Dublin &mdash;whatever the distance might be&mdash;and then there were the costs of taking it from the rail and loading it on the lorry and unloading it again, and if it went to a dump it added tremendously to the cost, because you had to add on further handlings and rehandlings. These would appear to me to be the items that, relatively, added most to the cost, but I must say that I myself was completely, I shall not say bewildered, but astounded, at the additions in the cost from the time the turf was cut on the bog until it was landed here in Dublin.  Then there was the further addition&mdash;this is one of the things that I wanted to get, but I have not seen it&mdash;of the costs afterwards as it went to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that at the present time there is no question of the State trying to make money out of this.  The position is quite the opposite. You cannot sell it at all, apparently, <Col N="869" /> at the price it costs.  The 64/- per ton is not paying.  The turf cutter, like every primary producer, just looks at the intermediate stages which appear to run away with a great deal of the money.  The farmer, when he looks at the price the food he produces realises here in the city, he sees a big gap.  It is very hard to feel that such a big gap is justified unless you get the details.  I agree that organisation ought to aim at trying to get at the root of that gap so that both the primary producer and the consumer will both benefit.  Organisation ought to aim at making that gap as small as possible.  In the case of turf, the cost of rehandling adds to the ultimate cost to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On one occasion we were simply deluged with figures.  The figure that bewildered me more than any other was that for shrinkage to which Deputy O'Sullivan has referred. When I saw it I felt that someone was pulling wool over somebody else's eye.  I think there was a sum of 12/6 <Col N="870" /> per ton allowed for shrinkage.  We might take that to represent one load in, say, every seven.  If there was actual shrinkage to that extent, then, in my opinion, the turf was not there to be handled in the end, and could not carry the handling costs to which the Taoiseach has referred.  If you are going to make a deduction for shrinkage, the estimate for that ought to have some relation to the original cost of the turf and not to what one may call the finishing or delivery cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that shrinkage takes place the whole way along the line.  I do not say that an attempt is made to weigh the turf all along the line.  I take it there is an estimate of the weight when it is being put into the dumps, and that it is only weighed again when it is being sent to the consumer.  I imagine that is the position.  An estimate of the weight has to be made when you are paying the producer.  I do not know at what point they do that.  It may be when the turf is being put on the railway trucks.  At that time the turf is comparatively fresh.  If it has been well dried out there will not be as much ultimate shrinkage as if it had not been.  It may happen that when it is being transported by rail some rain may fall on it.</P>

      <P>I am making the admission that if it is carried in certain weather that will have a certain effect on it, especially if it is being carried in open wagons.  The aim should be to transport it in summer weather, if at all possible.  At any rate, from the time at which it is put on rail until it is delivered to the consumer, the shrinkage that takes place represents a very substantial figure and that, of course, has to be taken into account, because you pay the man in the bog in terms of the amount that he has produced, and, ultimately, you will get from the consumer payment in terms of the weight that he gets.</P>

      <P>The ordinary private turf cutter in Kildare can sell a ton of turf on the roadside, adjoining the bog, at 30/- and, in some exceptional cases, at 35/-.  Let us take 30/- as the average price.  What must the ordinary consumer think when the turf sold to him costs 34/- per ton in Dublin, plus 30/-?  That is the commodity which was dug out of the bog in Kildare, reared, footed and ricked and transported to the roadside and sold there at 30/-.  By the time the consumer in Dublin gets it, it costs him 34/- on top of that 30/-. How can the 64/- per ton be justified? And remember that the turf cutter, who sold the turf on the roadside in Kildare at 30/-, has made a profit out of cutting it at that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Parliamentary Secretary nor the Government is out to make a profit out of it. Whatever the ultimate cost is to the consumer is due to the expenses that have been incurred from the time the turf left the bog until it reached the consumer.  Naturally, the consumer objects when he sees the gap that is there.  In ordinary times we would have less handling if we had petrol available to take the turf straight from the roadside to the city.  If it were possible to transport the turf direct from the roadside to the consumer you would not have additions of the sort <Col N="872" /> to which the Deputy has referred.  It is the re-handling and the difficulty in regard to transport that, apparently, add to the cost.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave the figures.  I remember reading them in the House here when I think the Deputy was present.  I got these figures.  I did not make them up. They were given to me as representing the costs, and I read them out and I asked where any of these figures could be reduced.  If you say to me that it is terrible that we should have to pay 64/- in Dublin for something for which the producer in Kildare, not a long distance away, only gets 30/-, I can only say: &ldquo;There are the costings; that is what it cost to bring it from Kildare to Dublin.&rdquo; It is unfortunate that Dublin is not beside it and that the transport is necessary, but it is necessary.</P>
      <P>Shrinkage is also one of the items. If turf is to be bought and sold by weight, then undoubtedly the shrinkage will add to the ultimate cost and will account for a difference.  If the shrinkage is one-fourth, you can easily see that that would be adding really one-third to the cost.  To get a ton in Dublin, you would have to get one and one-third tons in Kildare.  Therefore, if you take the price at the bog, you will have to add one-third to the 30/-, and that would make it 40/-, so that the production of the turf on the bog would be really 40/-; that is the actual turf which would be burned or bought by the consumer.  The production of that would really cost 40/-.  Shrinkage is a very important item in adding to the cost.</P>

      <P>There is one thing which is akin to fuel; I do not say that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister has anything to do with it, but I was asked to raise it here.  It is in connection with the way in which gas is restricted in this city.  The Electricity Supply Board have instituted a scheme of economies under <Col N="873" /> which they deprive people of the benefit of using electricity for certain needs.  They compel them to make certain economies and restrict them to a certain percentage in their two months' bill.  The Gas Company seek to do the same thing, but they add that they will not allow people to use gas except during certain hours.  Nobody knows why.  I imagine the Government must have received many representations in regard to this matter.  It is a matter they might have regulated by an emergency Order.  I do not see why a private company in an emergency like this should be allowed to act of their own free will, when what they did has repercussions on matters of heating and lighting, without giving some explanation.  They insist on people getting home at certain hours and getting out of bed at certain hours. People have to prepare meals in the early hours of the morning and food values are being wasted in an attempt to keep food hot until such time as the individuals who have to consume the food get home.  The hours fixed by the Gas Company are not popular or hours which suit the generality of people. Why they have to do that nobody knows.  I know a number of people have communicated with them, and the only answer they got was that this was the scheme, and it could not be changed.  I have asked about it.</P>

Thousands of them live in suburban areas, such as Crumlin, Kimmage, Dalkey, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire, and they cannot get home before 7 o'clock, the time when the gas goes off.  Protests were made to the Minister for Supplies some time ago and a statement was made that the Minister was in consultation with the Gas Company in connection with the matter.  I presume he asked them for a revision of the hours, particularly the hour in which the gas is available in the evening. I suggest that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Supplies should make representations so that the hour at which gas is available in the evening will suit the convenience of workers. In the majority of cases, between six and seven in the evening is not a good hour.  If they would make it between seven and eight, the thousands of workers who have to go to Crumlin and Kimmage and outlying areas like Dalkey and Blackrock would arrive home at an hour when gas would be available and they would be able to get their tea after being all day at work without any proper meal.</P>

      <P>I do not know. I am not aware of what they have done.  It is an overriding fact in all the Superannuation Acts.  I do not know whether it would be possible to do anything about it, but I will look into it.  It is a matter I have not personally investigated at any time, but I will look into it.  The Ordnance Survey case that Deputy Cosgrave raised is not new to me.  Deputy Cosgrave raised it last year and I promised to look into the matter.  I did look into the matter and I found that the injustice was one for which his Government was very largely responsible.  Protests were made to the Minister for Finance of the day. In 1924 efforts were made to get the matter rectified, but it was not done. There was a general refusal all along the line.  I promised Deputy Cosgrave last year to look into the matter.  I think there are 15 or 16 cases altogether.  It affects not alone people in the Ordnance Survey, but others as well.  I have had a Bill in preparation for a long time and I hope to have it introduced in the next Session.  I hope to deal with and rectify the injustices that were inflicted on these people by Deputy Cosgrave's own Government, as well as by former Governments.</P>

A woman is in receipt of a disablement grant of 7/6 under the National Health Insurance Act.  She is also in receipt of 6/- a week under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  She reaches the age of 70 years; she is made willy-nilly an old age pensioner, and she gets 10/- a week.  She loses 3/6.  Is that actually the law?</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, I can quite candidly say, speaking in connection with the administration of the Old Age Pension Acts and with an experience of nearly 20 years, that the work carried out in this connection by the officials of the Local Government Department has been carried out in a very efficient and very sympathetic way.  If I have any complaint to make, it is in regard to the way in which the Old Age Pension Acts are administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Some time ago the Minister gave us the number of persons in respect of the maximum pension and he also indicated the average pension received, taking into account all who are in receipt of pensions.  On that occasion I asked the Minister if he could give me certain information. Perhaps he can do so now.  If he cannot give the information at the moment, perhaps he would convey it to me later on.  I was anxious to know the number of cases where pensions were passed by local pension committees and subsequently rejected by the Revenue Commissioners as a result of confidential reports made by investigation officers concerning the means of the applicants.  In my constituency a considerable number of claims that were passed, granting pensions varying from the maximum down to the smallest amount possible, were rejected by the Revenue Commissioners following reports by the investigation officers regarding the means of the applicants. I happen to know the circumstances of some of those applicants, and I cannot understand how the investigation officers arrived at the figure they calculated for means.  I take it they calculate so much for hens on the basis of the number of eggs laid by the hens in the year and subsequently sold to the local shopkeeper.  I think the officials responsible for these confidential reports have deprived many deserving applicants of pensions, and they are not interpreting the Old Age Pension Acts in the way in which I believe the Minister would like to see them interpreted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I understand, a provision in the Act&mdash; and, of course, the Minister is bound by the Act&mdash;setting out that an applicant who is alleged or supposed, or who has been proved to the satisfaction of the Department, to have given over a farm for the purpose of getting a pension, is ruled out.  I believe that it is interpreted in that way.  I understand that unless the farm is given over to the son on the occasion of his marriage, it is assumed that it is being given over in order to get the pension.  Does the Minister consider it good policy that a man who has reached the age of 70 years or over must still cling to the farm and must not give it to his son; that a widow of 74 must keep the farm and not give it to her son; that even if a person at the age of 80 years hands over the farm to his or her son, that person will not get the pension; that even a widow of 78 will not get the pension if she hands over her land? I put it to the Minister that that is actually the interpretation put on the Act by the Departmental officials.  I ask him to see that there is an immediate revision, because it is very unsound public policy.  I think one of the worst features of country life is that the son of a farmer must remain a boy until he is 60.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy, but so far as I can remember any of these cases coming before me when I was in the Local Government Department&mdash;they do not come before me now&mdash;while I think there is a very strict and rigid interpretation of the Act, still there have been ways found of getting around that and to my knowledge they have utilised methods of getting around that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that, but that did not happen in numbers of cases to my knowledge.  I, together with Deputy Davin, have very often experienced sympathetic <Col N="879" /> treatment from the officials, but in the particular type of case to which I have drawn attention, I have always found that interpretation of the law.  I am speaking now of my own experience. Of course, it was alleged that that was not universal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter in connection with old age pensions that has caused a lot of difficulty.  I must say that the officials of the Department have been very sympathetic. I am aware that they deal very sympathetically indeed with all cases that are brought to their notice. Certain difficulties have arisen with regard to the assignment of a holding by the father or the mother.  When it is assigned in connection with a marriage settlement, the pension is obtained without any difficulty, but it often happens where the son gets married before the father reaches the pension age and the father still holds on to the place until he reaches the age of 73 or 74 years, and then assigns it, the old age pension authorities will not regard that as a marriage settlement. Of course, it is not a marriage settlement, because it is made perhaps years after the marriage.  In such cases the officials are not at all so sympathetic. The argument is put up by the officers of the Department that the old man assigns the place purely for the purpose of getting the pension.  That is a difficulty that has very often arisen in the Department.  I think this matter should be considered carefully, and I really believe it ought not to be adhered to so rigidly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the officials of the Department of Finance and of the Revenue Commissioners and those who deal with the appeals in the Local Government <Col N="880" /> Department&mdash;and they deal with only a small fraction of the cases, only 20 per cent. of the old age pensioners, while the Revenue Commissioners deal with 80 per cent.&mdash;is that they give careful and sympathetic consideration to the cases that are brought to their notice. When we talk of old age pensions and the administration, we must take into consideration the 80 per cent. that are dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners. If there is such dissatisfaction as Deputy Davin suggests with regard to the question of means, I must say, since I became Minister for Finance, I have not heard anything about it.  I have not got one letter per annum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got one letter per annum of complaint on that subject.  That is a fact.  If the Deputy or any Deputy in the House has cases where they believe there has been hardship I will be glad to have them investigated.  I do not know how many cases that were recommended by pensions committees were completely turned down by the revenue officers. I may be able to get these figures.  It would probably take a good deal of trouble and we would have to go around all the committees in the country.  There cannot be many people, of those who were granted pensions at all, who are suffering on the ground of the operation of the means test because, of the total number of old age pensioners&mdash;143,000, in round figures&mdash;121,089 are getting full pensions. That is a very big proportion, is it not?  They are getting 10/- a week&mdash;121,089 out of 143,000.  So the means test cannot be operating very rigidly or unjustly there.</P>

It is very easy to distort the scheme if, when any particular appointment comes along, you first of all get your mind set on the individual you want to put into the post and, still keeping the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission in the foreground&mdash;they are going to have their choice but only in respect of a limited number of people who are going to apply&mdash;you think of your selected candidate and add a stroke here to the picture, a qualification there, a reduction in the age limit or a raising of the age limit at another point and, eventually, you come to the point where only one or two candidates will go forward.  It is only in that limited sphere that the Local Appointments Commissioners or the Civil Service Commissioners will work.  In this matter of appointments the Government are marking their departure from responsibility and are revealing themselves as a Government that have forgotten their principles to remember their friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the best examples of that is displayed in an advertisement for an appointment to the medical staff of the Local Government Department.  Since that advertisement has appeared people have come to me with such wagers as this&mdash;that they would here and now write down on a sheet of paper a name, and put it into the hands of the Ceann Comhairle or the Leader of the Labour Party, and put any money that is required on it and, when the appointment is made and that envelope opened, the name of the person appointed will be there because it is quite clear who is aimed at.  It is absolutely clear as between two people. If the bet is to be taken another way and the two names to be written down, <Col N="885" /> then, not merely could wagers be laid, but odds-on wagers.  That is a scheme that we have seen developing over years but it has now reached its final perfection at this particular point.  I say the scheme is one which allows people to parade themselves as still being in favour of the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission type of appointment and excluding the question of patronage, while patronage can still be exercised in the most barefaced and blatant way.</P>
    <P>The qualifications for an appointment under consideration at the moment are outlined in the advertisement which appeared, and it is easy for people who know the persons who might be up for it and who know the persons in the background, to sit down and study the little masterly strokes of this qualification and that experience, and to know exactly who is going to get his foot into that department eventually.</P>
    <P>The significant thing is that, although there were many evasions when the question was put, the Minister eventually had to confess that he had not asked the senior medical officer to advise him, although there has been a tradition that that should be done and although it is obviously a wise thing that it should be done&mdash;that the person in charge of the office for years should be asked to say whether there should be any special qualifications demanded. He has seen the office grow up and how the work has developed.  It is something which is done in an institution with which I have some association, where, on the death of any person who holds a university post, the faculty are immediately asked to say whether they think the qualifications for the post should be changed.  People in close association with the post, particularly if there are people there who are lecturers or assistants under the professor who has departed, are constantly asked for their views as to whether there should be any change in the regulations.  On this occasion, in connection with this particular appointment, the one thing which emerges was the Minister's definite attempt to evade that significant point as to whether he had or had not asked for the advice of the chief medical inspector <Col N="886" /> when the conditions of the new appointment were being framed.  It is a post which is now in the offing.  It is going to be filled, and through the most obvious method of patronage.  I ask members of the Government to remember when they ask people on this side to co-operate that co-operation does not merely mean that people on this side should go on platforms and ask young men, no matter what their political loyalties may be, to join the defence forces of the country.  One would have thought that, in a time of emergency, when that appeal was being sent out, there might at least be a chance given to merit, irrespective of Party affiliations.  That is not being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Local Government Estimate, I raised the question of the method, or lack of method, of, as I thought, the Local Government Department&mdash;I have since been informed that it is the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;with regard to filling various vacancies through the country.  There was very severe criticism of the Department of Local Government and it was held up to odium because of delays of various kinds.  I am now informed that, at least with regard to the making of appointments, they have endeavoured, and successfully endeavoured, to wash their hands of it, and that it is the failure of the Local Appointments Commission to do its job which is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer, in particular, to the appointment of a doctor to Roscommon County Hospital.  That is a matter which nobody can understand.  The hospital, which is both a surgical and medical hospital, was opened, so far as the surgical side is concerned, before Christmas, because we had the surgeon there, and, some weeks afterwards, we asked for a scheme from the Local Government Department in respect of the appointment of a physician for the medical side.  We did not agree with the Department in respect of the scheme that should function and about three weeks or a month were lost.  Eventually we accepted the Department's scheme.  That was, I think, in March, but from that day to this <Col N="887" /> the Local Appointments Commission has held up the appointment and nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>In accepting the Department's scheme, we sent a request to the Local Appointments Commission for the appointment of a physician, but notwithstanding the fact that the hospital is ready, is furnished and is operating on the surgical side from February to the end of July, there has not been a budge by the Local Appointments Commission.  What is happening?  I do not know what the difficulties are in getting together a selection board. So far as I am concerned, ever since the Local Appointments Commission was set up in 1926, I have been a firm upholder of its findings.  I think it is the best system, but my confidence has been shaken lately.  The position with regard to delays is unpardonable.  I do not know whether the whisperings are right or not, but I am told that many of the delays are occasioned by certain persons looking about for the right doctors to put on the selection board, so that certain people will be selected. I do not want to believe these whisperings, but there is something very fishy about the delays.</P>
    <P>I think these people who are paid by the State to carry out these duties ought to carry them out.  It is very unfair to the ratepayers of Roscommon who have asked for this appointment, and who have fallen in with the views of the Local Government Department months ago, that nothing has been done.  The hospital is there, with beds in it, but with no patients, because we have no physician.  It is a scandal which ought to be remedied, and I am glad of the opportunity of raising it on this Vote.</P>

      <P>I was not here, and I do not know what the appointment is.  When I was Minister for Local Government, I often had a considerable amount of negotiation on questions of qualifications and age. The Local Appointments Commission and I often differed as to ages.  We did not differ very seriously, as a rule, with regard to qualifications, and for all professional appointments which are filled nowadays, qualifications are fairly well standardised, so far as I am aware.</P>
      <P>Differences in respect of ages may arise in relation to different kinds of posts.  I do not know what the difference may be in the case Deputy McGilligan has in mind, but no effort has been made, so far as this Government is concerned, to give a political twist or Party bias to appointments by the Local Appointments Commission, and no effort has been made to get the Commission to allot marks by means of the selection boards for any particular political Party qualification, as was done by the last Government, when they laid down that men who had served in the Free State Army must get certain marks, and, therefore, made it possible for nobody but men who had served in the Free State Army to get certain posts.  Nothing of that kind was done by this Government. I am sure that, so far as the present board is concerned, the Local Appointments Commission act fairly and squarely, and I do not think anybody can charge them with doing anything but what is just and proper as between candidates.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> There may be delays.  Certainly the Local Appointments Commission procedure is often a slower procedure for filling posts than was the arrangement in existence before the Commission came into operation: but I am sure that in respect of delay, such as that alleged by Deputy Brennan in relation to a particular appointment, it will be found, on inquiry&mdash;and I will have an inquiry made and will send Deputy Brennan the result&mdash;that they will be able to give an explanation of it.</P>

      <P>Away back in 1934, after the Government came into office, with a great flourish they advanced the amount of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant by £100,000, but there was a reduction of the grant immediately afterwards.  I remember on that occasion a case was made from this side of the House for derating. The Minister for Finance was then Minister for Local Government.  That case was met by the argument that if derating was granted in this country we would have to alter the scheme of local government, that you could not have, running side by side with derating, the type of local government we had in this country.  Now the local government system has been altered by the latest Local Government Act and <Col N="892" /> the Managerial Act, and that case will not hold.  As a matter of fact, in future the administration in every county is going to be carried on by an officer over whom the ratepayers will have no control.  To that extent the case against derating has disappeared.  I think an unanswerable case can be made at the present time for an increased Supplementary Agricultural Grant or for derating, whichever the Minister or the Government decide would be best for the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but derating would be a substitute for it.  That case has been made here on various occasions on the Estimate for the Supplementary Agricultural Grant, that if the Supplementary Agricultural Grant were increased to such an extent that we need not have derating, there would be no necessity for derating.  I maintain that it is quite in order to advocate derating on the Vote for the Supplementary Agricultural Grant. because it simply means an increased Supplementary Agricultural Grant. The case was made on various occasions in this House that if derating were granted, and if rates were taken off large farms, it would be no advantage to the small farmers.  I do not think that anybody ever tried to prove that case home because any concession that benefits land as a whole is bound to affect everybody working on the land.  If the overheads of the big farmers are reduced it would enable them to compete at higher prices when purchasing live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think at the present time when administration has been taken very largely out of the hands of local authorities, when the cost of roads, hospital charges, asylums, etc., is increasing daily, it is not fair that the farmer has to bear this increasing burden every year.  People who away back in 1927-28 were paying only £5 or £6 in rates have now to pay up to £25 or £26, and these are only small farmers.  The burden has been increasing year by year until it has really become unbearable.  At the present <Col N="893" /> time the only income to which farmers can look is the price they get for whatever live stock they have.  It may be urged that the fixed price given for cereal crops is a great advantage to the farmers.  It is not a great advantage to the farmer because, unfortunately, there is a very reduced yield.  That is due to the fact that we have had to till without manure.  I am not apportioning the blame for that; I could possibly say a good deal about it if I wanted to, but we are having decreased yields as far as grain crops generally are concerned. That is due to the fact that we have tilled a good deal more than in former years, and that we have less manure than ever we had.  Even though there are fixed prices, the agricultural community are very badly hit at the present time.  The amount of rates that they have to pay has increased enormously, and the assistance they are getting from the Government was reduced by £100,000.  I do not know exactly what was the underlying motive at the time, but before Fianna Fáil came into office there was a feeling all over the country that we were to have derating.  Although the Taoiseach would deny that he ever made that promise, I think it was pretty well understood that there would be derating. When the Government came into power they gave us a pretty good supplementary agricultural grant, but reduced it the following year, and the grant still remains at that reduced figure.</P>
    <P>On the question of applying the grant as it stands at the moment, the case is very often made or attempted to be made that the small farmer is already practically derated, and that, consequently, if derating came it would benefit only the larger farmers.  Well, the large farmers and the average sized farmers are the men we have to rely upon at the present time to give us the tillage that we require, and I think when all is said and done they are standing up well to it.  The evidence that has been given by the inspectors in my county is that, whatever remissness there is in County Roscommon is on the part of the small farmers.  I think the Government should seriously consider the complete derating of agricultural land in this country.  There ought not to be any more supplementary <Col N="894" /> agricultural grants given; instead, there ought to be complete derating, as there is in Northern Ireland and in England.  We are not asking anything unreasonable.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, the case the Minister made originally was that local government would have to go if we had derating.  But local government has in fact so altered that derating would not affect it.  At the present time, the farmers have to foot the bill for the roads, although they cannot use them very advantageously, and they have to foot the bill for hospitals and so on.  It is very questionable indeed if there is a good case in equity for that.  There are travelling on the roads large numbers of lorries of various descriptions which are not owned by the farmers, and the farmers have to foot the bill to a major extent. As things are at the moment&mdash;the pig industry has been killed and production is not what it should be owing to the fact that we have no manures&mdash;I do not think the Minister or the Government can say that the farmers are too well off.  In equity, I think we ought to have derating.  The example shown across the Border and in England is evidence of the fact that we could have it, and that there would be no disadvantages from it as far as local government is concerned.  I should like to impress on the Minister that, before they came into office, he and his colleagues were very keen on having this done, and they had facts and figures to show what it would cost. They have those figures still, and I think they ought to use them.  They should endeavour as far as possible to meet the case, and try to relieve the agricultural community of the very heavy burden of local rates that has been accumulating year in and year out.  The local rates are still going up.  In our county and in every other county there is an increasing demand every year.  That is discouraging to the farmers, and is keeping production down.  To my mind, this is one way in which the Government could and should assist the farmers in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the view expressed by Deputy <Col N="895" /> Brennan on this question of rates. The present time is most opportune for the Government to recognise the services which the farmers are rendering to the State.  As Deputy Brennan pointed out, we are not looking for any favours.  In justice and in equity, our farmers should have their agricultural land completely derated, as has been done in the case of those who are competing with our farmers on infinitely better terms; they are getting much better prices for their products, and they have very many advantages that we have not.  I do not want to refer to the promises given in the past to derate agricultural land.  The farmers are now producing at a loss.  They are producing at a loss most of the commodities which are required to feed our people. Besides, local government methods have entirely changed.  The roads have been taken from the farmers; they cannot use the roads now.  Most of them are in such a condition that they are unfit for horses to travel on, and as the farmers have no petrol they cannot use motors or lorries.  They have simply lost the right to use the roads which were built at their expense, and for which they are still paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister or anybody else telling us that there is so much money granted; they are entitled to complete relief from rates.  In equity, nothing else will satisfy their claims.  The argument against derating was that only the larger farmers would benefit, while the smaller farmers would gain practically nothing.  It should be easy for the Minister to devise a scheme to get over that difficulty; it would be a compromise, but it would be better than nothing.  Could not the land be derated up to a valuation, say, of £40?  That would give the small farmer the greater benefit, and the larger farmers could be asked to pay on anything in excess of that £40 or whatever other figure was fixed. Such a solution would be a compromise, but it would remove the objection which has been raised.  The big farmer would not then be getting all the benefit.  It must be remembered, too, that the bigger farmers have to pay income-tax as well as anybody else <Col N="896" /> if they have a real income from their land.  I would ask the Minister to do something to relieve the farmers generally, at a time when they are making such a great effort, notwithstanding all the difficulties on account of the lack of manure and so on, to produce food for the nation.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind Deputy Brennan that the Government he supported set up a commission to investigate this matter in 1929-31.  The commission was, I am sure, a handpicked body, consisting of reliable Party supporters who, possibly, knew their job as farmers and they recommended that derating was not a wise policy.  I have not heard that any of the members of that commission have changed their views since. I remember that in a debate on derating that took place some five or six years ago which was initiated by Deputy O'Higgins, so that farmers should have derating for one year, as it had been a bad year for them, one member of that commission, Deputy Broderick, stated that he was as hostile to derating as when he signed the report, recommending that it should not be adopted, on the grounds that it would not be a wise policy for farmers, but that he would be prepared to accept it for one year, because it happened to be a bad one.  However, it is not going to be introduced under present conditions.  The Agricultural <Col N="897" /> Grant is, perhaps, not as generous as it might be, but it is as generous as we can afford in present circumstances, and I do not propose to ask the Government to increase it.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £170,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1943, for Compensation and other Payments in connection with Injuries to Property caused by the dropping of bombs from foreign aircraft and kindred incidents while the State is not engaged in war (No. 24 of 1941).</P>
      <P>This Vote is required to meet expenditure during the present year under the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, which was passed by the Oireachtas last September.  As the matter is so recent, Deputies may be interested to know the extent of the claims received under the Act, and the progress that has been made in dealing with them.</P>
      <P>Claims arise in the main from one or other of the bombing incidents (a) at Campile, in August, 1940; (b) at Sandycove, in December, 1940; (c) at Terenure and the South Circular Road, Dublin, in January, 1941, and (d) at the North Strand in May, 1941.  There were other incidents causing less extensive injuries arising from the dropping of bombs&mdash;e.g., in Counties Carlow, Louth, Wicklow, or the explosion of land or sea mines by the Army authorities, or from sea mines exploding from time to time around the coast &mdash;notably in County Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure under the Act in 1941-42 amounted to £111.880 (out of a Vote provision of £115,000).  The bulk of it was paid to local authorities in recoupment of moneys spent by them &mdash;under the authority of the Government&mdash;on repairs to injured dwelling-houses, and on cash advances for the <Col N="898" /> purchases of immediate necessities in the shape of furniture and/or clothing. This expenditure went to reduce <i>pro tanto</i> the number of claims&mdash;and the amounts claimed&mdash;by individuals for losses to which the Act applies.</P>
    <P>The Act allows a period of 12 months for the lodgment of claims.  2,034 applications, amounting to £317,000, have so far (30th June, 1942) been lodged&mdash; including 18 from Campile, 20 from Sandycove, 397 from Terenure and South Circular Road, and 1,488 from the North Strand.  Claims are still coming in at the rate of 25 to 30 each week.</P>
    <P>The investigations which are necessary to enable my Department to deal with the applications are proceeding as rapidly as possible and offers of compensation have been made in 970 cases, in very few of which have the amounts offered been questioned by the applicants; in all of these cases agreement was eventually reached, with one exception, which is under further examination.  If an applicant is not satisfied with the amount offered, he can refuse the offer and apply to the Circuit Court for compensation.  The Minister for Finance is entitled to refuse to make an offer of compensation and to leave the applicant&mdash;if he so desires&mdash;to seek his remedy in the court; this course has, however, been adopted only in about 24 cases, in which the entire claims were clearly outside the scope of the Act.  In no case, so far, has an application been made to the Circuit Court for compensation.</P>
    <P>The present Vote, like last year's, contains provision for recouping local authorities' expenditure, incurred by them on structural repairs, etc.  The amount included for this purpose is £72,000, part of which represents the balance which, after examination and audit, may be found due to the local authorities in respect of expenditure incurred last year; provision is also included for recoupment to Government Departments of expenditure incurred by them on reinstatement or repair of injured buildings (e.g., the homestead of the Shannon family in County Carlow).  In both cases the expenditure represents emergency assistance given in necessitous cases more <Col N="899" /> rapidly than could be the case under the normal procedure requiring the lodgment of formal claims under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also includes provision for the payment that will fall to be made to the Dublin Corporation in respect of the buildings in the North Strand area which they are in process of acquiring for the purposes of a town planning scheme under the Act.  The corporation will be entitled to a payment equivalent to the diminution in the market value of the acquired property occasioned by the bombing, whilst they, in their turn, will be responsible for the payment of compensation to the owners, or other persons having an estate right or interest in the acquired property, on the basis of the condition of the property before the injury took place.</P>

      <P>Should what has happened in the past happen again, I hope that the Minister and those dealing with such matters will have learned to take a more humane view, and not so entirely a Departmental view, of the sufferings of people caused through these bomb explosions.  No part of my constituency was affected by any of the raids, but many people in the North Strand eventually secured housing in Cabra and, in that way, came into North-West Dublin.  I met a number of them.  There was, in fact, a time when the number of those drifting down to various places where I was working became embarrassing.  It may be true to say that none of these claims proceeded as far as the Circuit Court but, if that phrase is intended to create the impression that these people were satisfied, it is very far from being the truth.  I have always expressed the view that those of us who did not suffer in these explosions are so thankful to have escaped that we would willingly pay a fair amount of money to reinstate the poor people in the position they were prior to the explosions.  On behalf of this Party, I guaranteed that if it had meant any increased taxation, or something specially allocated, to make good the loss that these people suffered, this Party would not have raised the <Col N="900" /> slightest argument against that particular item of taxation.  I ask if a lesson should not have been learned from what happened.  Some preparation should be made against the recurrence of such a ghastly business, after hearing these people talking of the experiences they had when they were practically left bereft of any clothing, some having had to get immediate protection and to huddle around while they were being taken to some sort of shelter, and then to find the hardship inflicted on them afterwards in connection with miserable grants of the most meagre and niggardly type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing was in the nature of an emergency and, naturally, there was an excuse for the rush.  One thing that always struck me as being very harsh in connection with the payments made to these people is the manner in which the Department assesses the amounts.  If a person loses a piece of property through an explosion, what he gets is not something to put him on the road again.  Those who were bombed in the North Strand were mainly people who had no money or resources.  Yet, we had meticulous calculation in respect of depreciation in respect of cases under this Act.  A man and his wife came and told me that on the night of the bombing in the North Strand an old lady member of the family who had retired to bed had, according to the best practice, a glass of water beside her in which she kept her false teeth.  The bomb came, and the false teeth went.  That lady applied for compensation.  The claim was ruled along the lines that she had had the teeth so many years, and that, therefore, a depreciated value should be put upon them.  When she interviewed me, she was without teeth because she had no resources wherewith to get a new set.  Unless she made herself a pauper and went to the South Dublin Union, she could not get a fit-ment. I do not say that that case was typical, but it was an example. Certain other types of property were also depreciated.  These people went to some kind of valuer, and they put in a claim based on his valuation.  The claim was ruled down, so that there was depreciation in respect of every <Col N="901" /> item.  That is ludicrous.  Anybody with a sense of the ridiculous would have avoided such a cutting down of claims as that.  These people had hardships imposed upon them, and the rest of the community had such sympathy with them that they would rather err on the side of putting them in a better position than they were before than try to make cheese-paring economies at their expense.  If any such thing should happen again, I hope a newer, better and more humane attitude will be taken up.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if any provision is being made in the case of destruction by our national forces, such as was the result of the regrettable happening we had at Laytown a few days ago.  The people there lost considerable property and my information is to the effect that they cannot recover anything from the State.  If our Government can make good damage done by foreign planes, I do not see any reason why nationals who suffer damage in such accidents as I have referred to should not also be compensated.  I should be glad if the Minister would make the position clear in that regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise the human point made by Deputy McGilligan.  On the property side, there does seem to be a systematic and fairly accurate estimate of the damage done.  I can agree with the Minister that in most of the cases of damage to building&mdash;property and substantial furniture&mdash;there has been general satisfaction with the amount of the awards.  That is so far as I have been in touch with these cases.  There has been a certain amount of delay in connection with the making of awards. I should like the Minister to tell us whether, in cases where compensation will be paid through the local authority, there has been a better linking up of the machinery between the local authority and the Department as to the type of work it will do and the way in which compensation will be paid.  There was a considerable amount of confusion in that respect. After the experience at Terenure, there was a chance of visualising the situation <Col N="902" /> and arranging for clearing up things in a more satisfactory way than was adopted in the case of the North Strand.  Now that additional experience has been gained and that there has been a certain amount of experience in dealing with cases through the local authority, I should like to be assured that the machinery has been speeded up in case, as Deputy McGilligan mentioned, something similar should occur again, which God forbid.  A good deal of trouble and loss is caused by delay.  Unless people who are in business can get back quickly into that business, they suffer in a way which cannot be met by compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept Deputy McGilligan's description of the hardships inflicted on the people on whom these bombs fell in the North Strand and elsewhere.  Everybody in the country has deep sympathy with the victims in these cases.  That has been my attitude and, so far as I am aware, the attitude of the officials dealing with these matters.  I have found the officials with whom I come in contact as humane as Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Mulcahy.  They are anxious to meet these people sympathetically and to help them.  Many of the claims were modest claims.  Very few of the claims that I heard of, especially those from the poorer people, had been grossly inflated.  There were a few cases of that kind but not a big percentage. The whole attitude of the officials was to meet the claimants sympathetically, but the officials have to bear in mind that they are subject to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who examines each one of these payments in a very scrupulous way.  So does the Committee on Public Accounts.  They have, therefore, to be cautious.  I noted what Deputy McGilligan said when this matter was previously debated about his own desire and the desire of his Party being to treat these people generously.  I was glad to hear that.  It accorded with what I would expect and with my own wishes and views.  When I got the report for this Estimate, I was very pleased indeed to see that so many cases had been settled&mdash;and in most <Col N="903" /> cases settled satisfactorily.  The total number of claims was 2,034 from all parts of Ireland, including 1,488 from the North Strand, North Circular Road, Summerhill and Phænix Park. Those represented nearly three-fourths of the total claims.  Of these, offers of compensation have been made in 970 cases and in very few cases have the amounts offered been questioned by the applicants.</P>
      <P>I think that is a good and creditable record for the Department.  The officials are to be congratulated on the rapidity with which they dealt with these cases and on the fact that they were able to settle 970 cases satisfactorily in such a comparatively short period.</P>
      <P>The point that Deputy Mulcahy raised, about co-operation between the Government and local authorities in settling these cases of property, has been satisfactorily arranged and is working smoothly.  There was a time when it was not working so smoothly and when people were sent from one place to another and did not know where the responsibility lay.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £16,667 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1943, for Compensation and other Payments in respect of Personal Injuries sustained by persons, not being members of State Services, as a result of the dropping of bombs by foreign aircraft and kindred incidents while the State is not engaged in war.</P>
      <P>This Vote is required to meet expenditure during the current financial year under the Emergency Powers (No. 98) Order, 1941, made by the Government on the 15th July last.  Article 4 of that Order empowered the Minister for Finance to make a scheme providing for the payment of periodical or lump sums to persons, or the dependents of persons, who suffer personal injuries resulting, broadly speaking, from breaches of our neutrality.</P>
      <P>A revised scheme under that Order was made on the 16th June, 1942, in the light of representations as to the inadequacy, in present circumstances, of the scale of compensation provided for in the earlier scheme made on the 17th September last.  The new scheme revokes the earlier scheme and provides compensation on a basis permitting of allowances to the dependents of persons suffering injury and of allowances also instead of lump sums to the dependents of deceased persons.  Briefly stated, while I have felt constrained to retain the maximum disablement allowance of 30/- a week for earners provided for in the original scheme, I have made provision for additional allowances as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In respect of dependent wife or husband or in respect of any female person residing with a widow or widower for the purpose of having the care of her or his children&mdash;7/6 a week.  In respect of each dependent other than husband or wife&mdash;4/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> Disablement allowances will be reducible by reference to the percentage degree of disability.</P>
    <P>In the case of fatal injuries I propose allowances as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For a widow over 45 years of age or, if under that age, in receipt of an allowance in respect of a dependent child, or incapable of earning&mdash;18/- a week.</P>
    <P>For a widow under 45 years of age not in receipt of an allowance in respect of a dependent child and capable of earning&mdash;12/6 a week. For a widower dependent on deceased wife and incapable of earning &mdash;18/- a week.</P>
    <P>In respect of dependents while living with a widow or widower 5/- a week and after the death of the widow or widower&mdash;7/6 a week.  For dependents of an unmarried man or widower or of an unmarried woman or widow&mdash;7/6 a week.</P>
    <P>Widows' allowances will cease on remarriage and an allowance in respect of any other female dependent will cease on marriage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make awards of compensation in respect of the dependents of deceased non-earners unless necessitous circumstances are established. For earners under 18 years of age, the maximum disablement allowance will be 15/- a week.  For non-earners over 18 years of age the maximum rate will be 18/- a week, and for non-earners under 18 years of age 9/- a week.</P>
    <P>As regards partial dependency, I cannot undertake to make continuing payments, and I have decided that partial dependency&mdash;but only in fatal cases&mdash;will be dealt with on a lump sum basis measured by Workmen's Compensation Act standards, where the merits of a case are established.  As regards classes of dependents, there has been included, in addition to those provided for in the original scheme, a child in respect of whom the injured or deceased person had placed himself or herself <i>in loco parentis.</i>  I have decided also that allowances in respect of children shall be payable up to the age of 18 years, unless they are prevented by physical or mental infirmity from <Col N="906" /> supporting themselves, when the allowances will continue to be payable up to the age of 70 years.  Moreover, any injured child up to the age of 18 who is not an earner will be treated as a non-earner for the purposes of the scheme and injury allowances will, accordingly, be payable in respect of young children.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may consider that the revised scale of compensation which I have outlined is still inadequate, but in this connection I can only repeat what I have already stated in this House, that I am bound in a matter of this kind to take into account the consideration that, in providing for compensation of this nature, we are undertaking an unlimited liability, and the contingency of further incidents giving rise to claims for damage to life and property on a widespread scale cannot be ignored.  Recovery from outside sources of the cost of compensation may not always be feasible, and it is essential to have regard to the possibility that compensation payment may, in large measure, fall finally on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The actual payments of compensation have been provided for under sub-head A of the Estimate.  Under sub-head B, provision is made for payment for medical and surgical treatment and the supply, where necessary, of medical and surgical appliances.  It is the intention to afford such treatment at the expense of the Exchequer, on the advice of the Army Pensions Board, where it is considered that suffering may be alleviated and a reduced degree of disability secured.  In addition, the sub-head provides for the refunds of medical and hospital expenses incurred by applicants contemplated by the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of the greatest importance, in considering this matter, that we should be clear as to the Government's intention in regard to the proposals.  For that reason, I confine myself to taking the case of a married man with a family who, as a result of bombing such as we had on the North Strand, finds himself adjudged completely disabled and, therefore, unable in any way to provide <Col N="907" /> any part of the income for the family.  Is it the Government's intention that compensation would be paid to enable such a man to maintain his wife and children, continue the children's education and launch them in life?  We have to take it that, by hook or by crook, such a man and his wife must live and rear their family without any serious hardship or misery.  We want to know whether the Government's intention is that the compensation in that case will be sufficient.  If it is not, then we are condemning people, on whom this misfortune has fallen, to seek additional assistance through the poor law system.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that we are unable to do it through the compensation machinery, because of the cost that would fall on the taxpayers, but the fact is that these people must be provided for by some means or other. If whatever compensation the Government gives is inadequate, the ratepayer must find the additional amount through the poor law system.  It should not be the policy of the Government that a certain amount will be paid by way of compensation and that the parents, already stricken by the fact that the head of the house has been completely disabled, should be forced to come under the patronage of the relieving officer and get assistance through the poor relief scheme to maintain the family.</P>
      <P>The original approach to this matter was very unsatisfactory, and I am sure the Government could not explain in any reasonable way what they intended when they fixed the compensation at a flat rate of 30/- a week, as was done in the scheme issued last September, without any reference to what kind of family responsibilities the man might have, but the fact that they approached it in that particular way makes me all the more insistent now to ask the Government to state what is their intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with that, I would point out that, from time to time, during the last 12 months, we have discussed the question of what would be a maintenance allowance for an ordinary family, and reference was made to an <Col N="908" /> examination carried out by Mr. Rowntree, in York, as a result of which, from figures that he made out in 1936, he showed that it would take 43/6 to maintain a family of five&mdash; that is, a man and his wife and three children&mdash;for a week, at the prices existing in 1936.  Now, the cost-of-living index figure has risen from 160, for the year 1936&mdash;that is, over all items in Ireland&mdash;to 226&mdash;all items, over an average&mdash;for the year 1941.  That is an increase of 66 points, which would mean that, in order to do what Mr. Rowntree intended should be done for a family of five, the amount should be raised from 43/6 to 61/-.  Now, I do not think that the cost of living for a family in York would differ very much from the cost of living for a family in Dublin.  If it differed at all, it would be higher in Dublin.  The Minister, however, is now providing, for a disabled man, with a wife and three children, 49/6 a week&mdash;30/- for the man, 7/6 for the wife, and 4/- each for the children.</P>
    <P>Now, when we compare what is being done in similar cases in Great Britain, we find that where we are providing 30/- for the man, in Great Britain the man gets 37/6; where the wife here gets 7/6, she gets 9/2 in Great Britain; where the first child here gets 4/-, 7/1 is provided in Great Britain; and where the second and third child here get 4/- each, 5/5 each is provided in Great Britain.  In other words, where we provide, under the present scheme, 49/6 a week, the British provide 64/7.  When we compare 64/7 with the scaled-up figure of 61/- on Mr. Rowntree's estimate, we see that there is at any rate a relationship between what is provided in Great Britain and what has been systematically estimated as giving a fair subsistence to a family.  Accordingly, I ask the Minister whether 49/6 for a completely disabled man and his wife and three children is intended to keep that family in, say, reasonably undistressed existence, or does he not realise that they will have to go to the relief authorities for further assistance? Why should the parents, already so distressed, be driven to do so, and if the cost has to be borne in some way or another, why cannot it be <Col N="909" /> systematised and paid in such a way as will avoid adding a certain amount of serious inconvenience, in the first place, supervision by the poor law authorities, in the second place, and a certain amount of degradation that, because of the unfortunate thing that happened in the North Strand, these people are driven into the arms of the poor law authorities until such time as the family is raised?  We talk a lot about the family and what it means as a unit, what it means to our social and political outlook that we should put the family in its proper and Christian perspective here.  I think that when we take into consideration how much we emphasise that in our Constitution and in our talk here, we ought not to allow a situation to be accepted here where the compensation that is given in this particular way is of a kind that forces a family to go to the poor law authorities in order to maintain themselves. That is the principal point that I want to make in connection with this.</P>
    <P>The next point that I want to call to the Minister's attention is this. Nothing, I think, has yet been done to provide a scale of compensation for persons in the L.D.F., L.S.F. and the other voluntary services, on the same lines as is done here for civilians that are injured.  I should like to hear the Minister say when it is his intention to have these schemes, whether they are going to be related in any way to the scheme outlined here and, if so, whether he will review the problem in the spirit in which I ask him to approach it, and do it at once before he finally fixes a scale of compensation for injury in the voluntary Defence Forces.  I would again point out that, apparently, the scheme in Great Britain is that compensation paid for civilian injuries and to people in the voluntary services is based upon the compensation paid to the lowest serving rank of soldier in the Army.  An examination of the situation, even with this inadequate scale of compensation for civilians, when compared with the compensation paid to soldiers injured on military service, under the 1927 Act, shows that this is a magnificent and munificent provision.  That Act reduced substantially the compensation <Col N="910" /> that was paid to injured members of the Army under the 1923 Act.  The reduction under the 1927 Act was contested pretty seriously here and, to my mind, there was no justification for it. The Act was passed in special circumstances, when it was thought that no soldier would ever again be injured here, but now we are brought up against eventualities that were not then foreseen, and when families are treated in this particular way, we have to ask ourselves will there be less provision for the families of soldiers who may be injured at the present time than for civilians.</P>
    <P>There is one particular matter that is urgent, and that is a scheme of compensation for men in the rescue services. At the present moment, in the City of Dublin, there is no rescue service, such as was called into operation and into action in a very important way when the bombs fell in the North Strand in May of last year.  The type of work that requires to be carried out by the rescue squads is of such a nature that there is serious danger of injury while in training, and because of the fact that there is no provision of any kind at the present time for compensation for men injured while in training on rescue work, all such work in the city has ceased for months past. As a result of the cessation of training it has not been possible to hold that rescue squad together.  After all our excitement about our danger and our machinery for defence and evacuation, it is shocking to think that that is the position in Dublin to-day, and if a bomb did fall to-night in Dublin, the rescue services that would turn to render first assistance to people trapped in burning or destroyed houses would be composed of workers not standing together in an organised way, because their organisation has broken down, and because a scheme of compensation for them does not exist.</P>
    <P>I say that these are matters that require urgent and serious attention, and that it would be a serious thing for this Dáil to adjourn for the Recess except we have an assurance from the Minister for Finance that some definite pronouncement will be made at once in regard to compensation schemes for the rescue services in Dublin, Cork, <Col N="911" /> Limerick and other places.  I know this all means money, but we here at least are being saved from the shocking cost that would fall on us if we were actually engaged in war or suffering the severe damages caused by it. We have had experience of one or two horrible incidents, but they are nothing at all to speak of in the matter of cost compared with what, in other circumstances, we might be suffering. We are stimulating our people to face the future vigorously, resolutely and with courage in an organised way. But what are we proposing to defend for the kind of future that we look forward to in this country when the unfortunate victims of to-day, few as they are, are going to be left by us in the position that, in order to maintain whatever families they have, they must go to the relief authorities?  We have civilian defence forces, and surely we ought to see to it that their members, married men with families, will be maintained in a systematic reasonable way that will indicate to them that we are thinking thoughtfully and earnestly about the country and of the organisations that we need to keep it safe and sound.  They ought to be given the feeling that the country is worth defending, and that we are not neglecting them or the really fundamental things that matter.  They should be made feel that we are prepared to maintain the families that are injured in present circumstances, and that we are prepared to do that in one way or another for all our people.</P>

      <P>I want to express my keen disappointment at the amount of the allowances that are being made available for men who become completely disabled.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that these allowances fall far short of what would be required to maintain a man's family in reasonable comfort. They are such as will drive a man to seek help from the board of assistance. No provision is made in the Estimate for rents which, as we know, are pretty high in Dublin.  A man with a wife and three children will not have much left <Col N="912" /> out of the allowance after paying a rent of 10/- or 10/8 a week.  What will be left will put that man and his family on a starvation diet.  I think the Minister ought to review the provision that is being made in the light of the high cost of living in Dublin to-day.  Deputy Mulcahy said that the members of our rescue services at the moment are dissatisfied and discontented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>He added that, if anything should happen to-night, those services would not be available in an organised way.  But the Deputy and myself know that, if anything did happen, our Dublin men who have been in the rescue services and are discontented would, despite that, turn out to do their duty in the cause of humanity. Due to lack of training they might not be as efficient as they should be, but I believe they would do their duty and render all the assistance possible. About two months ago I received a deputation in Leinster House composed of representatives of the rescue services.  They showed me copies of the correspondence that had passed between their trade unions and the Departments concerned, but, as far as I could judge, they appeared to get no satisfaction.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures said, some days ago, that a measure would be introduced that would give those men some satisfaction.  I gathered from him that whatever was done would have a retrospective effect, certainly in the case of one man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking from memory, there is at least one man in the rescue services who got injured following the last bombing.  His position was such that his colleagues in the A.R.P. were obliged to run whist drives and things of that sort in order that he might have some little allowance to live on. Afterwards, I understand he got 30/- a week, but whether that payment is being continued or not, I do not know. What I know is that there is grave discontent in the rescue services in the City of Dublin to-day.  Those men have given practical evidence of their fire-fighting <Col N="913" /> abilities and should be treated in a more generous way.  The other services, the L.S.F. and the L.D.F., are not being treated fairly either.  I think the Minister should do something to make the men in all those services more content, to indicate to them that, if any misfortune should overtake them, this House will see that their dependents will be adequately compensated.  In making that appeal to the Minister we are not, I think, asking too much.  We know, as Deputy Mulcahy has stated, that the allowances proposed do not compare at all with those paid in Great Britain. Yet, it is an extraordinary thing that a few days ago a Minister, in dealing here with the case of a man whose son lost his life on the &ldquo;Clonlara&rdquo; rather boastfully said that we were paying the same allowances to the dependents of those lost at sea as are being paid in Great Britain.  The Minister, in defending the attitude of this State on that matter, forgot to mention that in Great Britain, in cases of that sort, there is no means test applied, such as occurred in the case that happened here.  The man here whose son was lost on the &ldquo;Clonlara&rdquo; was paid 5/- a week, but then his unemployment allowance was reduced by 4/6, so that he was left with 6d. a week for the loss of his boy.</P>
    <P>That would not happen in Great Britain.  If we are to follow Great Britain in any of these compensation schemes we should adopt the maximum, not the minimum.  Nothing less than the maximum that Great Britain gives is good enough for our people. I put it to the Minister that he ought to give our people the maximum.  The cost of living is very high and the standard of living of certain people has gone down because they have not the money to buy the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>I made reference to-day to the question of the wives of serving soldiers in our Army.  They have been writing to Deputies that the allowance they are getting is not sufficient to purchase the necessaries they were able to purchase six months ago.  Owing to the high cost of living they are not able to purchase the necessaries of life.  I appeal to the Minister when preparing <Col N="914" /> compensation schemes, especially for those who give voluntary service, that he should give the maximum amount and not the minimum.  It would create contentment and a greater desire to serve in the voluntary services.  Our people, young and old, answered to the call for these services.  The least they can expect is that if they meet with an injury the compensation given them should not compel them to apply for home assistance to augment the amount given them by the Government. I think it is grossly unfair and the Minister ought to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>I have a case in mind, and perhaps it is the one to which Deputy Byrne has made reference. If the treatment meted out in this particular case is typical of the treatment meted out to members of the A.R.P. services, the effect will be to deter rather than to encourage recruiting for these services.  This case is one in which a member of the auxiliary fire brigade in Dublin was injured in the course of fire-fighting exercise, and suffered a fracture of the tibia.  He is still incapacitated owing to that injury.  For several weeks he received no money from any source. Finally, his case was dealt with by the Commissioners administering public assistance in Dublin.  Only after strong representations had been made by the chief of the fire brigade was the miserable sum of 22/6 granted to him, plus a food voucher of the value of 7/6 provided he signed a form that he would reimburse the local authority when compensation was paid to him by the Minister for Finance.</P>

It is simply a question of bringing forward a number of different aspects of the compensation requirements in relation to the scheme that is under discussion.</P>

      <P>There was a scheme then, but it was not regarded as satisfactory, and a revised scheme has been under consideration since then.  This scheme that we are now discussing on this Vote, Deputy Mulcahy knows very well, was brought before the House in another form and discussed here before. Suggestions were made both in the Dáil and in the Seanad that the proposals of last September were not regarded as satisfactory or as being as generous as they should be.  I think that was the general line of criticism. I withdrew the scheme, and am now putting forward a revised one which I know will not be regarded generally as giving full satisfaction.  I do not think that any scheme I could introduce, knowing the limitations that are on me as Minister for Finance, would get general approval here.  I think, however, <Col N="918" /> that I have gone as far as we can go in circumstances where we do not know what our liability is likely to be. We have no way of measuring what our liability will be.  We cannot, in the circumstances, know that.  If we could have any idea of the total bill that the State will have to meet at the end of this emergency under this heading, then we might be able to approach the matter differently.  When the emergency is over, and we are able to reckon the cost of the compensation we have to pay, we may be able to treat people more generously than we propose to do here.</P>
