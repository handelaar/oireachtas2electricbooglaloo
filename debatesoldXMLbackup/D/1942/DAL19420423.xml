      <P>I received a confidential report from our representatives at the conference shortly after its conclusion, but the official report of the proceedings, including the texts of the resolutions proposed and adopted at the conference, has not yet reached this country.

In the case of Exchequer <Col N="1017" /> moneys placed on deposit, which are of large amount and subject to withdrawal without notice, the rate of interest paid by the bank during the years mentioned by the Deputy was the ordinary deposit rate as fixed by the Irish Banks Standing Committee from time to time and announced in the public Press.  Apart from the rates of 2 per cent. and 1½ per cent. operative during brief periods in August-October, 1939, the ordinary deposit rate during the years in question was 1 per cent. per annum.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take this opportunity of stating what, in the judgment of his Department, will be deemed to be a commercial vehicle?  Is it true that if the question as to whether a converted vehicle is a commercial vehicle is in doubt, the local Gárda sergeant can resolve the doubt? The Minister is aware that a number of persons are converting cars and the difficulty is to decide whether the conversion corresponds with the Minister's view of what a commercial vehicle should be.  I understand that he is prepared to accept the certificate of the Gárda sergeant.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not altogether correct.  The alterations which must be made in a vehicle to qualify as a commercial vehicle are strictly defined. The Gárda sergeant may come in for the purpose of certifying that alterations conforming with these regulations have been effected.</P>

      <P>The Minister sees the point of my question.  Unless there is some local arbiter to determine this question, there may be 2,000 vehicles outside Ballsbridge waiting to ascertain whether the Minister thinks they are commercial vehicles or not.  Would it not be advantageous to say now that that question can be resolved locally if the person concerned goes to the Gárda station&mdash;the question whether they have, in fact, effectively converted their vehicle, or not?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he has received an application from the School Meals Committee of the Carlow Urban District Council for permission to purchase supplies of cocoa for the provision of school meals under the auspices of the council, and whether having regard to the desirability of continuing the school meals scheme he will arrange to issue permission to the School Meals Committee to purchase the required quantity of cocoa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  The application was for permission to purchase cocoa required in connection with the school meals scheme at the Christian Brothers' School, Carlow, to which institution the council appears to have extended the scheme, involving a supply of cocoa in September, 1941, some months after it became necessary, because of scarcity, to restrict the distribution of available cocoa supplies.</P>
      <P>Deliveries of cocoa are restricted to institutions which were supplied with cocoa during the year 1940.  As the scheme was not in operation at the school in question during that year, I regret that I cannot see my way to alter the decision already conveyed refusing the application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters were raised on this Estimate and, as far as possible, I propose to deal with them.  Deputy Lynch spoke about the success which the mussel cleansing plant at Cromane, County Kerry, had been and he suggested that we might consider the set ting up of another plant at Mornington. Deputy Coburn also referred to the question of providing additional plant.  That point has been raised from time to time by other Deputies. Deputy Coburn said that it would not take long to erect the plant as there should be no great difficulty in procuring sand and cement.  The facts are that the Cromane plant has been operating successfully during the past two years.  It has been successful in turning out mussels in a healthy condition and it has also been financially successful.  The capital outlay was very considerable, when compared with the turnover, and we had to make <Col N="1026" /> substantial additions to it during the two years.  It is rather soon to come to a definite conclusion as regards the plant or to proceed to erect more plants of that kind.  We were fortunate, perhaps, in coming in at this particular time because prices for mussels, as for other fish, had considerably improved and that added to a great extent to the success of the plant at Cromane.  It is not true that we have all the materials available for a plant of this kind because certain equipment has to be purchased, apart from building materials&mdash;sand and cement&mdash;and the price of these things has gone up considerably.  If the capital cost were to be increased very much, it would take a long time to repay it.  On the whole, I think we should wait for, at least, another year before deciding to erect a second plant at Mornington or anywhere else.  I may tell Deputy Coburn that there would be a considerable amount of delay.  From the time we decided to erect the plant at Cromane until its completion, about two years elapsed. The making of plans and specifications and the obtaining of the necessary plant and equipment would be rather tedious.  It is not work that could be done in a few weeks or even in a few months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the way in which fishermen were handicapped by lack of nets and other gear.  The difficulty so far experienced in obtaining nets is the great variety of nets which are, of necessity, in use.  There are various types, differing as to materials, shape and general make-up. On that account, it was quite a while before the Department of Supplies could get any sort of comprehensive memorandum prepared.  They have now succeeded in getting this material together and they have put the position to the authorities in Great Britain, with a request for certain of these supplies and for the necessary export licences.  The whole matter appears to be, at least, in train now and, while we cannot assume that our wants will be fully met, I think there is ground for being hopeful of getting some of these supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> Deputy Corish mentioned the question of a special ration of tea for fishermen.  Where fishermen are out overnight, the Department of Supplies have granted them a tea ration but they have not granted a tea ration to fishermen who go out only a short distance and come back within a few hours.  I am afraid that that does not really cover what Deputy Corish has in mind but, on the other hand, I think it is a reasonable enough ruling by the Department of Supplies.  If Deputy Corish has any further representations to make to that Ministry, I shall be glad to support them if they are reasonable.  Deputy McMenamin contended that our fishing fleet was not all it might be, either as to number of vessels or its total catching capacity. The Deputy is probably right in that to a certain extent but, whatever our fishing fleet may be now, it is certainly many times better than it would have been had matters been left to individual initiative during the past few years.</P>
    <P>The Sea Fisheries' Association has put into commission more than 130 power boats and some hundreds of sail and oared craft and has maintained that fleet with the necessary gear.  We can assume from that that, if the Sea Fisheries' Association had not been operating, things would not be nearly as good as they are.  I do not say that some of these boats might not have been got through private initiative, or in some other way, but Deputies will agree that all of these boats would not have been got but for the efforts of the association.  Deputies know that the terms of repayment are very convenient. Repayment depends upon the actual earnings of the fishermen so that in the bad times they repay a comparatively small amount while in the good times they repay large amounts.  In the last year, 1941, 26 boat owners repaid completely loans outstanding to the association.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke of the need of providing sails for our fishing boats. The Deputy had in mind that, while many of our fishermen have at the moment fuel oil for propelling their <Col N="1028" /> boats, the time might come when fuel oil would not be available and he urged that we should keep in mind the alternative of sails.  That has not been overlooked by any means and, if the Sea Fisheries' Association have to find alternatives for fuel oil, they will be in a position to do something in the matter. I do not say that they will be able to provide an alternative as satisfactory as fuel oil but, at least, something will be done.  Deputy Bartley mentioned the desirability of having our sea fishing industry developed on commercial lines, as is the case in other countries.  I completely agree with Deputy Bartley in that desire. On many occasions, in the Dáil and elsewhere, I have appealed to commercial men with money to consider the possibility of investing some of their money in a trawler fleet.  If they had done so, I think they would now be getting good returns.  As a matter of fact, I have not got by me the figures of the Dublin Trawling Company for the last two years, but I am quite satisfied that the results for those two years have been satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Another matter which Deputy Bartley mentioned concerns the several fisheries.  Deputy Bartley thought that, as a result of recent legislation, we had put the owners of these several fisheries in a better and more stable position.  That is not true.  As far as that Bill went, it only tended to ensure that when the State takes over the interests of any of these private holders in the fisheries the title of the State could not thereafter be questioned by a member of the public and that the fishery would go on being worked by the State, for the State, without let or hindrance.  It does not in the meantime in any way alter the title of these people.  It is true, as Deputy Bartley pointed out, that we actually paid compensation to certain people whose ownership was held by the court to be defective but, even so, that does not alter the position that I have already outlined, that we have in no way strengthened the position of these several fishery owners.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also complained that some enterprising people in his constituency, who had by their own efforts <Col N="1029" /> set up what I freely acknowledge to have been a very satisfactory fishery hatchery, were not being accorded as much assistance as was due to them. That is a matter, perhaps, in which the House generally would not be very interested. A good deal of correspondence has taken place on that point between the Department and those concerned.  It really centres around a permit which was sought by these people for the capture of spawners in a certain river.  That permit was refused. I would like to assure Deputy Bartley that the decision to refuse the permit did not rest at all with the wishes or the advice of the local board of conservators.  They did, naturally, offer their observations, which were taken into account, but I would like to say that it was the Fisheries Department that refused that permit, on two grounds.  One was a biological ground. There were biological objections to netting in the river in question.  Secondly, there was the difficulty that those concerned in the application had not fulfilled the conditions attaching to a permit previously issued in their favour and it was feared, naturally, that if a permit was given the second time the conditions would not be observed.  I pointed out these matters before to some correspondents in Galway who wrote to me about this matter but I would like to assure Deputy Bartley that it is really a point that was decided by the Department on its merits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley went on to discuss certain undesirable qualities apparent with regard to some of the boards of conservators generally arising out of that point.  I have, I think, more than once stated in the Dáil that I have a very open mind on this whole question of the fishery conservators, the manner in which they are selected and the manner in which they discharge their duties.  I suppose one might say it is what you might expect to find in boards of that kind&mdash;some of them very good, some indifferent and some very bad.</P>

      <P>Were it not for the intervention of war conditions, I would expect to have had before the Dáil by now a Bill that was promised when I introduced the Inland Fisheries Bill here, a Bill to consolidate and to bring our fisheries statutes into reasonable shape.  As already announced, I had intended on that occasion to listen to Deputies and allow a free discussion of this question of the control of our inland fisheries; whether our conservators should carry on on the present form of selection and the present form of control, or whether we should try to get a more satisfactory system, if Deputies thought that possible. Some such measure, of course, must eventually come before the House and I shall welcome the fullest possible discussion as to how these boards should be constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only question remaining, I think, is the question raised by Deputies Broderick, McMenamin, Lynch and Corish, that is, the question of salmon prices.  I have already explained in the Dáil, in reply to questions put to me, that I did not fix the prices payable by the British Ministry of Food for our salmon on export.  I explained that the British Minister of Food announced that he intended to fix a price for salmon and that he would also fix the importers on the British side to whom the salmon could be consigned. At the same time, he made a request to us to limit the number of exporters.  There was a good deal of negotiation after this was announced, and while we did get some amelioration, <Col N="1031" /> if you like to call it that, in the conditions, we did not get, I need hardly say, as good conditions as we would like.  For instance, it was proposed to confine the number of exporters in this country to about 12. As a result of negotiations, that was brought to 35 or 36.  With regard to the price, though we could not get any move upward on the price, we did get some movement in the dates.  The 4/- a lb. rate was to come into operation on 1st March.  It was postponed to 9th March.  The 4/- per lb. rate was to cease on the last day of April and the 2/6 rate was to come in on the first day of May.  We got that date postponed to 18th May.  There were some other small items, such as packing, responsibility for the salmon on being landed on the other side, and so on, that we also fixed up on a more satisfactory basis.  Although, as I said, we would like to have got better terms, we did not succeed in getting them. I think the Dáil may take it for granted, however, that those engaged in the negotiations did their best. Although the 4/- a lb. rate is not fully satisfactory, still, it is not unreasonable in the light of the average price paid for the last three years.  When the 2/6 rate comes into operation it will not be nearly so favourable compared with the last three years.</P>
    <P>I think it was mentioned by Deputy Broderick that whereas 4/- was paid on the other side, the fishermen concerned only got 2/6 or 2/8.  That is exceptional, if it is the case, because, as far as our information goes in the Department, the wholesalers are paying from 3/4 to 3/6 per lb. to the person who catches the salmon and if wholesalers can afford to pay 3/4 or 3/6 anywhere they should be able to afford it everywhere because they are all working under the same conditions.  If anybody is paying as low a price as that which Deputy Broderick mentions, it is very unfair and we should get more information about it so that we can investigate it.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned also that while our fishermen were getting 4/- a lb. from the importer in England, English <Col N="1032" /> salmon was fetching very much more. That is true.  I do not know whether the Minister of Food had intended to fix the price of English salmon and Scotch salmon as well as of our salmon but, at any rate, he did not fix the price of Scotch or English salmon when he fixed a price for ours.  In exceptional cases, it is true that salmon fetched as much as 17/6 per lb., but there is no doubt that that price was exceptional, just as we read of oranges fetching 2/- a piece and whiskey £2 a bottle in certain places.  The usual price, so far as I can find out, would be about 7/-, which, of course, yields a much better return to the English salmon fisherman than we are getting for our salmon.  During past years our experience has been that from May onwards there has been a fairly steep drop in the wholesale price on the British market and, as I have already said, a drop to 2/6 per lb. on the 18th May is much more than we should like to see if we had any control over it.  However, we are making observations and keeping in touch with the situation, as far as salmon prices are concerned, and if we find that the prices paid to us for this year for our salmon compare unfavourably with the prices paid to English and Scottish salmon fishermen, we shall at least have that argument to use when we come to discuss the price for the coming year, a discussion which I anticipate will take place before the end of the present year.  I do not think there is any other point with which I need deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  I hear all sorts of strange rumours about strife and misunderstanding arising in Killarney and Killorglin, in regard to the board of conservators there.  It has even been alleged that certain members of the board or their officers have been convicted in court of fishery offences and that they still remain members or servants of the board.  I understand that many people have asked the Minister to send down a responsible officer to hold an inquiry so that he might have information on which effective action could be taken to restore <Col N="1033" /> confidence in the administration of the board.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that that is a reasonable suggestion from men who are anxious that the law should be observed.  I would strongly urge on the Minister to institute some form of inquiry into the matter, so that he might be furnished with particulars of a sufficiently certain character to enable him to take whatever action may be necessary to restore respect for the law and to bring about a realisation in everybody's mind that the fishery laws and regulations must be respected by all persons, regardless of whether they are conservators, bailiffs or ordinary citizens.  Unless something like that is done I fear that a very unsatisfactory situation is likely to develop.  Has the Minister heard anything about the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is wrong in stating that members of the board have been convicted of fishery offences because, that in itself, if true, would render them ineligible to carry on.  With regard to the suggestion of holding an inquiry, there has been nothing of a positive nature done that would warrant that.  There have been some unseemly scenes at their meetings, but there was nothing very definite on which we could base an inquiry.  I do not think we could do anything at the moment, so far as that suggestion is concerned.  They had a meeting recently at which new officers were elected, and I think we should wait and see how things go on.</P>

      <P>The Money Resolution of the Central Bank Bill seems to be a suitable occasion to raise one aspect of this legislation which is of primary interest to Deputy Hickey and, indeed, to myself.  I take it that the expenses of administering this measure may be fairly substantial.  It is hard to foresee what their dimensions may ultimately be.  The question arises how far the commercial banks should themselves contribute to that expense.  As far as I can see, a great many people approach the whole question of joint stock banking under the illusion that the banks deal exclusively with the capital of their shareholders and the deposits of their depositors, and that to both of those they have a clear liability to compensate them for the funds which the depositors and shareholders entrust to the banks.  But, as I understand the situation, in addition to the capital and the deposits over which the banks have control, the banks themselves have determined by long experience that they may also deal in a sum represented by a figure of ten times the amount of their deposits. That is to say that if they deem themselves to have, upon a given day, £1,000 of deposits, they feel themselves entitled to make advances amounting to £10,000 and, while they are paying 1 per cent. on the £1,000 deposit&mdash;that is, £10&mdash;to their depositors, they feel entitled to lend £10,000, charge 6 per cent. interest on it, and so collect £600, and so far as I am aware, that is where the bulk of their profits comes from.  Now, I understand, that commercial bankers the world over have found that to be a safe and prudent procedure, but it is a procedure in which we would all like to share.  If anybody could take in £1,000, for which he paid £10, and then lend out £10,000 and collect £600 for it, he would be, in vulgar parlance, sitting pretty.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should bear in mind the fact that the Money Resolution should not be taken advantage of to make a Second Reading speech, nor to anticipate discussion which may arise, for instance, on Part V of this Bill.  The Deputy in a harmless introduction purported to ask what part of the expenses of this Bill might be contributed by the joint stock banks.  He is now discussing the whole business of joint stock banks.  The Money Resolution deals with the money actually required, not with the policy and operations of joint stock banks.  Much of the issue which the Deputy is now attempting to raise might occupy a whole day and prevent either the Money Resolution or the Bill being discussed to-day.</P>

Deputy Hickey often asks me, and I often ask Deputy Hickey, where is the money going to come from for all the things we want to do.  Now, one of the things we have got to do is to finance this central bank legislation, and Deputy Hickey and I ask one another where is the money to come from.

      <P>Well, if the Deputy did not, he ought to have.  Might I suggest that that credit-creating capacity in the joint stock bank exists by virtue of the existence of this House and that, while I am prepared to admit as just and equitable that a fair share of the profits derived from credit created by joint stock banks in pursuit of their lawful occupations should go to those who create it with a stroke of the pen and by the use of their good name, the State is entitled to say: &ldquo;We, who have created the stability of the legal system and the free institutions within which such credit may safely be created, are entitled to some share in that credit volume, more especially when the banking system requires the intervention of the State to assist it by the establishment of a central bank which is designed to facilitate banking institutions in this country, to maintain their stability, and to secure it.&rdquo;  Would it, therefore, be unreasonable for the Minister for Finance to go to the joint stock banks and say to them: &ldquo;Already, you are under an obligation from time to time to determine the volume of your deposits in order to ascertain the safe limit of your advances.  I, therefore, want you, on the occasion of the determination of your deposits, to advise me of what you, joint stock bankers, deem to be the limit of credit which you may properly create&rdquo;?</P>

That means that you can take profit on four-fifths of the entire credit volume which it is safe to create, and make available to the Minister for Finance one-fifth of that credit volume for the purposes of paying the expenses of the Central Bank Bill, and this machinery secures that there is left in your hands a reasonable fund with which to make profit; there is made available to the State a fund with which to pay these expenses, primarily designed for your benefit; and the economic fabric of the State is uninjured by any fortuitous inflation of credit over and above what long experience and common practice have proven to be a safe margin in relation to the deposits, at any given time, resting with the joint stock banks.&rdquo;  I do not see Deputy Hickey giving this scheme the close attention which it deserves from a man with his outlook, because I think it is a gold mine, and if Deputy Hickey will lend his mind to this line of country I think he will discover something almost as good as the scheme for providing credit that the Deputy has in mind, and I have long been waiting for that baby to get born from Deputy Hickey's mind.</P>

This suggestion of mine is a very different thing from the printing suggestion.  This is a plan to withdraw from the general volume of commercial credit whatever sum it is deemed expedient to take over from the joint stock banking system to finance this Bill.  The proposal that I am putting forward, I know, will give many so-called orthodox financiers fits.  They will just lie down, gnash their teeth, and go into convulsions, but that does not make it any the worse.  The orthodox financier always goes into convulsions over anything which threatens to interfere with what he regards as his legitimate profits.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 of the Bill sets out that the Minister for Finance will supply £24,000 of the capital of the bank.  At least that is the money advance he is making.  The capital, as set out in the same section, is £40,000. This is a departure from the recommendation that was made by the majority of the members on the Banking Commission.  We have got no very good reason from the Minister as to why a departure should take place from the recommendation that was made or, in fact, why it is now proposed to alter the capital arrangement which was made when the Currency <Col N="1040" /> Commission was established.  The point as to who subscribes the capital in this case is not a very strong one. Speaking from recollection, the capital of the Currency Commission was approximately £40,000.  They were allowed to make a profit of 5 per cent. on that.  They have been in business for some 15 years and there is a very large sum in reserve.  Paying off the banks now&mdash;although I think no one would claim that the banks are entitled to any share of whatever reserves there are in the Currency Commission&mdash;and taking possession of the reserves and merely putting £24,000 or £40,000 into this, is a change from settled practice which has no recommendation of any sort or kind behind it.  A different system was recommended by two Banking Commissions.  It may be that the Minister thinks that 5 per cent. gives too much of a profit.  That is not a big point, assuming that it is so, but there is no limitation, as far as one can see in this Bill, as to what profit the Minister will get.  In any event, it is immaterial because he proposes to get whatever profits will be derived from this new system which will be a more expensive system than the former one, a system which seeks to get, for every £ that is issued in currency notes, sterling banking.  To get sterling backing means that the banks have got to put up either cash or securities of equal value, so that, so far as this system is concerned, it will be more expensive for the banking institutions of the country.</P>
      <P>Whatever strength there was in the Currency Commission, or whatever strength there is going to be in this new Central Bank, was or will be derived from the existing banks. Whatever integrity there is in the currency that is at present in issue in this State or in circulation depends exclusively upon the banks. These are questions of fact and do not admit of argument or contradiction. The safeguarding of the integrity of the currency of this country depends more upon the joint stock banks of this country than upon the central bank which one may compare to a policeman on point duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> It will simply regulate the channels, having nothing to do with the sources, or the origin of the sources.  I would like to hear from the Minister what reason there is for the change.  There must be a guiding motive of some sort or other to suggest a change of this kind.  It is not, as I have said, a matter of very great consequence except to this extent, that it would appear as if it were thought that the banks were not worthy now of participating in the shareholding of what will constitute the capital of the central bank.  Now every penny that can be got out of the services of the banks is being got by the State.  For years there has been a reduction not only in bank profits but in bank dividends, and, what is worse still, in the reserves put by by the banks from year to year. In other countries the main concern of the people has been to conserve the strength of their banking institutions. They are regarded as the anchor, one might almost say the foundation, of industry and commerce throughout those states.  Here it is quite a common and popular thing to point the finger of scorn at the banks as if they were the concern only of rich people. They are nothing of the sort.  That also is a question of fact and not one for argument.  The House is entitled to be told by the Minister why this change is being made.</P>

      <P>When the Money Resolution for the Currency Act of 1927 was being moved in this House, the then Minister for Finance explained the possible State liability under three heads.  He said there might be some liability in respect of the issue of gold coins&mdash;about refining and putting into coinage any bullion that was brought in.  The second thing was that under a particular section of the Currency Act there might be a State liability in regard to the redemption of token coins, and the third thing he said was that there would have to be some money provided against what he called the ultimate State guarantee for legal tender notes.  It is to be presumed that these three possible liabilities are still in some sort of existence.  I would like to hear the Minister segregate his <Col N="1042" /> £24,000 under specific headings, if there are any.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Dillon said, in so far as it was relevant at all, I listened to him speaking here on the 25th March last explaining his great interest in Deputy Hickey's remarks because, he said, it always annoyed him to find Deputy Hickey so much in revolt against the credit restrictions that at present harass and hamper the local authorities and other bodies with which he had been associated.  He said he hoped to be in the House when Deputy Hickey found out where the money was going to come from, and said there was only one way to do it&mdash; the printing of bank notes.  But Deputy Dillon, in his remarks to-day, comes very near to Deputy Hickey in his view because, he said, if you get a £ in cash you can print nine bank notes against it, so that the only difference between Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hickey is the original £.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked about the capital of the bank. The sum of £24,000 was the actual amount paid by the shareholding banks when the Currency Commission was founded.  Deputy Cosgrave asked the reason the Government had for changing the system in operation since the Currency Commission was founded. We unquestionably read and considered the report of the Banking Commission. We did not accept their recommendation on this matter.  We felt it would be more in keeping with the purpose and function of the central bank that its capital should be subscribed and held entirely by the State. I think that is a good and sufficient reason.  There is no reflection in any way on the joint stock banks.  The accumulated funds of the Currency Commission were, I think, at least 12 times the amount of the capital subscribed, so that the capital in the matter was hardly of anything but formal significance.  I do not think I can agree with Deputy Cosgrave when he says that the strength of the new central bank, if and when it is founded, will depend more on the strength of the joint stock banks than on the central bank, or anything that the central <Col N="1043" /> bank can do.  I think the strength and the influence of the central bank will depend on the State's financial and economic position as much as on anything else, if not more.</P>
      <P>I do not want to take one iota from the words used by Deputy Cosgrave in describing the strength, the integrity, the efficiency, the reliability, or any other word of that kind you wish  use, of the joint stock banks. They have a record that everybody in the country ought to be proud of.  They have maintained a position, certainly for a period of 50 years, second to no other banking institutions in the world. They have safeguarded the deposits and the finances of this community in a way that did great credit to themselves and brought them considerable profit, as well as profit and credit to their shareholders.  But the central bank, I hope, will be of assistance to them, to the State, and to the community as a whole in still further maintaining the security, not alone of the currency, but of the finances of the State and of individuals who are lucky enough to have money to place in the custody of the joint stock banks. Certainly, I think everyone is agreed that we ought to be in line with the rest of the world with regard to having an institution of this kind, especially in the times in which we are living, to assist in preserving and maintaining the credit we already have for sound financial institutions, and to help to guide us and protect us in our currency and monetary affairs through the dangerous and difficult times which probably are ahead of us.</P>

Twelve times the original capital is in reserve and the banks make no claim on it.  The State now, in a burst of piety, says: &ldquo;We will pay you back the money you put up in the first instance.  It will relieve the new central bank of paying you 5 per cent.&rdquo;  The State sets up this bank to make money.

      <P>On Section 4, I think it well to raise this point, because it may arise later on as affecting some of the arguments which we will hear on the other sections.  It is proposed to repeal Section 62 of the Currency Act.  Under the first Schedule, the whole of that section is to be repealed on the completion of the winding-up of the note reserve fund.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to Section 56 (4), where it is proposed to amend Section 4 of the Currency (Amendment) Act, 1930, by the substitution of the expression &ldquo;currency reserve&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;note reserve fund.&rdquo; As amended by sub-section (4) of Section 56.  Section 4 (1) of the Currency (Amendment) Act, 1930, would read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever during any half-year a profit arises on the realisation (whether by sale or maturity) of any capital asset of the legal tender note fund, the commission may, after making such allowance as it thinks proper for any depreciation which may have occurred since the beginning of such half-year in any capital asset of that fund, transfer from the legal tender note fund to the currency reserve capital assets in any one or more of the forms mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 62, of the Principal Act equal in value at the time of such transfer to the amount of such profit remaining after making such allowance (if any) for depreciation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed so to amend that.  It is proposed to rely on that for certain things, while the section which is referred to there in this Section 4, and which is to be relied on for certain things, is being repealed under the <Col N="1049" /> first Schedule.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section proposes that there shall be established a body to be called and known as An Bannc Ceannais or, in the English language, the Central Bank of Ireland.  I propose to delete the words &ldquo;An Bannc Ceannais&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Bannc Ceannais na hEireann&rdquo;.  At times, because it is the Irish language we are speaking, we are inclined to &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mick&rdquo; our national institutions &mdash;as it were, to call them by their Christian names.  We are talking in English of the &ldquo;Central Bank of Ireland&rdquo;. I do not think there is one in 100,000 persons in the country who, when the central bank is set up, will talk about it as anything else but &ldquo;The Central Bank&rdquo;, but from the statutory point of view it is to be called the &ldquo;Central Bank of Ireland&rdquo;.  If <Col N="1051" /> we are going to give the fully grownup description of this institution in the English language as &ldquo;The Central Bank of Ireland&rdquo; we ought not to colloquialise it in Irish.  We should give it its proper description of &ldquo;Bannc Ceannais na hEireann&rdquo;.  I think &ldquo;An Bannc Ceannais&rdquo; is not a proper description.  It is colloquialising our national institution, as it were, calling it by its Christian name.  I think, from the statutory and legislative point of view, it is not right.</P>

I think the title in Gaelic is not likely to be used anywhere else but in Ireland, and I think &ldquo;An Bannc Ceannais&rdquo; is just as dignified a title as &ldquo;The Bank of Ireland&rdquo; in English, or &ldquo;The Bank of Leinster,&rdquo; if there were such, or &ldquo;The Bank of Munster.&rdquo; However, I do not feel very strongly on the point.  I know that some of my colleagues feel like Deputy Mulcahy about it; they feel that it should be &ldquo;Bannc Ceannais na hEireann.&rdquo;  I thought the other was better; as Minister for Finance, I had the right to put in what I thought was better, and it is there.  If anybody feels very strongly about it&mdash;I do not feel strongly about it&mdash;believing that it is dignified and proper, and the title that will be used, I am quite prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

We might have the title &ldquo;The Central Bank&rdquo; in English provided that it was quite clear that it referred to one particular institution.  In another country speaking of their own central bank in their own language, they probably would not put the name of the country with it at all.  It is really only a question of opinion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>Under this section, the Bill provides that the bank shall be controlled by a governor, three directors, to be known and referred to as banking directors, and not more than five other directors, and that control of the bank shall be vested in such personnel.  It is mandatory on the Minister under the section to appoint three banking directors, and the object of this amendment is to eliminate that mandatory provision. The Minister has given us no evidence whatever that the appointment of directors of commercial banks is necessary for the continued existence of the central bank, and he has given us no evidence that they can render to the central bank any more assistance than could be rendered by non-commercial bank directors.  If this amendment is carried, the Minister, if he still has a passion for appointing banking directors, may do so.  The object of the amendment is to prevent the wrapping up in statute law of the responsibility for making it mandatory on the Minister, and inferentially on the Government, to appoint three banking directors to the control of the central bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister feels that he would like to see banking directors on the board of the new central bank, well and good.  As Minister for Finance, he can make these appointments, but I suggest to the Minister that the fact that he has a preference for a certain number of banking directors as distinct from non-banking directors is no reason why he should for all time tie the hands of succeeding Governments, these hands not being capable of being freed from the standpoint of the selection of banking directors, except by an amendment of the law.  It is quite possible that, tied up in the fashion the Minister is by the provisions of Section 5, he may be confronted with a position in which he may have to appoint, for instance, directors who are perhaps directors of banks in the Six Counties. or of banks in England, who may not look favourably on our efforts to <Col N="1055" /> establish a central bank here, particularly if the activities of that central bank are likely to or, in fact, do run counter to the desires of commercial banks here or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister wants to tie himself down to an obligation to appoint three banking directors. It seems to me that he would be in a very much stronger position if that obligation were not imposed on him by statute, and that he would have much greater freedom in the choice of personnel and, at the same time, be unrestricted in the matter of the appointment of banking directors, if he personally felt that the appointment of such directors was necessary or would contribute any substantial assistance towards the progress of a central bank here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is very good reason from the point of view of our history, and particularly our financial history, for seeking the assistance of three experienced bank directors, to help us to guide this new institution.  The Currency Commission when it was founded looked for&mdash; I think, wisely&mdash;and got the help of directors of the joint stock banks of the country.  The Dáil, in its wisdom, when it founded the Currency Commission, realised that there was little practical knowledge and experience of banking in the country to be got outside the banks and, in the way of direction, outside the directorates of the banks, and wisely, as I say, they sought that assistance and got it. These bank directors helped, during the years the Currency Commission has existed, to carry on that institution successfully; they guided it through many years of successful working. The savings of the country are deposited in the joint stock banks of the country and these savings are the foundation of our financial prosperity and of our success, whatever it is, in business enterprise of every kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bank directors have, for a period of more than 50 years, carried on their banking institutions with credit to themselves.  They conducted them <Col N="1056" /> through times of financial difficulty that had repercussions of a very disastrous, kind on banking institutions all over the world.  Our banking institutions, owing to the fact that they were managed by experienced men, prudent men, wise financiers, during the times when banks were tumbling over and falling down, not alone by the hundred, but by the thousand in other countries, carried on successfully.  Not one of them failed to meet its obligations and I think it would be a helpful thing and would enable this new institution to be well-founded in the confidence of the people, in the confidence of the depositors, who are, mainly, in this country, small depositors, if we have the assistance of bank directors. I am quite satisfied that it is a good and a wise thing to have their assistance and to provide for it in the Bill, as I propose to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter, not from the angle of the sub-section we are discussing; but the relationship of the board to the Government and to the duties which the Government want this bank to carry out.  I have before me what the Minister said on the Second Reading.  It was this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is intended that there should be the fullest co-operation between the Government and the central bank. The Government does not, however, propose to interfere with the administration of the bank which will be independent in the carrying out of its functions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the way the Minister placed it on the Second Reading.  The board will consist of nine persons.  The governor is to be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government. There will be three banking directors, two of whom will be chosen by the Government from a panel selected by the banks.  There will be two civil servants, if the Government take the full leave given here, and there will be then three others, making the full board of nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the method of removing people put on the board, the scheme seems to vary according to the <Col N="1057" /> various people.  The governor is only removable because of permanent ill-health. Excepting that, he is removable only on the unanimous vote of the rest of the board.  So far as the other directors are concerned, they may die or resign; but, leaving out these contingencies, they leave the board only if they become disqualified. The conditions that establish disqualification are set out in a later section and they include such thirigs as becoming bankrupt or ceasing to attend to their duties.  On that make-up the board can be left independent, although the Government have the choice in the first instance, a free and unrestricted choice, of six out of the nine members of the board.  Once they establish them, there is no way of getting rid of any of them.  The only way of removing them is if they fall inside the clauses about disqualification.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that that aspect has been discussed and considered, but there is another important matter which may arise.  When we come to discuss the clause in the Bill later on dealing with expansion or restriction of credit in the country, I hope we will not be told that the Government will have any interference in that, because, once your establish the board, the question of expansion or restriction of credit in the country depends on the bank in so far as it is monetary business. When we come to discuss the credit situation afterwards, we cannot be told, if the Government have certain ideas with regard to credit, that they can work their will on the board, because they cannot if this set-up is attended to.</P>
    <P>So far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned, it is possible for the Dáil to remove people inside their term of office for a cause stated.  There is no such leave here.  Once a director goes on the board, he serves his time, unless he suffers from incapacity due to permanent ill-health, or is disqualified for any of the reasons set out in the Bill.  The Dáil does not retain such touch with the central bank as it does retain with the Electricity Supply Board, because, under the Electricity Supply Board Act, the Government at <Col N="1058" /> any time, in respect of the people appointed, can say: &ldquo;For reasons stated we are removing this, that or the other man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister does intend to have the central bank board completely independent in its functions, then I think it is wise to have these three bank directors.  If the Government's idea with regard to certain big matters of policy, with regard, say, to such a vital matter as the expansion or restriction of credit in the country, is that they should have a say, then the complete tenure of office given to the members of the board would be possibly an undesirable thing.  But, on the set-up of the board as it is. and on the Minister's phrase, accepting that the board is to be independent, I suggest that the Minister should stay as he is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given any satisfactory reason why he should at this stage seek power to appoint three bank directors on the board.  This section proposes to hand over the control of our monetary policy to a body of nine persons who will not be responsible to this House.  I think it is an extraordinary proposal, particularly at a time like the present.  It is extraordinary that the control of our monetary policy should be handed over to a body of outsiders who will not be responsible either to the Minister for Finance or to the House. That is why we view with very grave suspicion the proposal to include three bank directors under Section 5.  If this was a genuine State bank providing for some kind of Ministerial interference with the policy of the bank, I would not have the same objection to the inclusion of three bank directors.</P>
      <P>Answering some questions here in the House recently, in connection with the financial policy of the New Zealand Government, the Minister made many statements, among which was this, on the 16th April&mdash;column 624 of the Official Debates&mdash;dealing with the speech made by the New Zealand Minister for Finance in introducing his last Budget:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" />&ldquo;We have emulated New Zealand, as we have got similar results to those they got there, but there is a difference in degree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose that is correct: there is a great difference between the New Zealand Government system of controlling the monetary policy of the country and the control, or alleged control, that is supposed to be contained in this Bill, and particularly in this section of this Bill.  I assume that the Government&mdash;if the Bill passes in its present form&mdash;will be able to find an Irishman who knows as much about this business as anybody else in any other country.  I am sure of that.  I dare say they will be able to find two service directors, if they decide to appoint two, who will have a general knowledge of banking operations and the conditions prevailing in this and other countries, and I doubt if these people would have anything to learn from the three banking directors who would become directors of the proposed central bank.</P>
    <P>The directors of our banks are not supposed to know such a lot about banking.  I venture to suggest that the principal officials of the banks know more about the operations than the directors.  The directors of most of our banks are very busy men, associated with many of the key industries, and they devote only part of their time to the banking business.  They meet once a week and devote, perhaps, an hour or two to the consideration of questions put up to them by the officials, who are really responsible for banking operations in the country.  I know a couple of directors who are on as many as seven other boards of key concerns, and who naturally cannot devote much of their time to this business.</P>
    <P>I dare say that, if the two service directors are ultimately appointed by the Government, they will be able to devote more of their time to the administration of this proposed bank than any of the three directors who may be appointed by the Minister. Does anyone think that any of those three banking directors will be a party to the doing of things that will be out <Col N="1060" /> of tune with the work of the joint stock banks?  I cannot imagine their doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister was questioned here some time ago as to the reason why loans or overdrafts given by our banks, to people lucky enough to get them, cost 1 per cent. more in interest than was charged in Great Britain.  The Minister replied by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a question of tradition, and it is very hard to break down tradition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This question of charging 1 per cent. more for loans given to the farmers and industrialists of this country has a very serious effect on the cost of production and on the amount of employment.</P>

      <P>How does the cost of loans come under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that, if you have the three banking directors on the board of this central bank, they will not agree to depart in any way from the present banking methods, and to that extent it would be a menace to the board of this bank, especially in view of the fact that Parliament and the Minister will have no control over the monetary policy followed by this board.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have emulated New Zealand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is the position in regard to the control of banking policy in New Zealand?  It is no harm to quote Section 10 of the State Reserve Bank of New Zealand.  I wish we could get this into Section 5&mdash;I think that is the proper section&mdash;and then I would not have the same hesitation about supporting the Minister's proposals.  Section 10 of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the general function of the Reserve Bank, within the limits of its powers, to give effect as far as may be to the monetary policy of the Government, as communicated to it from time to time by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no such provision in this section of the Bill, and no right whatsoever <Col N="1061" /> is given to the Minister for Finance to interfere in any way with the policy of the board proposed in this section.  The Minister is quite right when he says that the boards of the joint stock banks have carried on with credit to themselves.  There is no doubt about that&mdash;and with considerable advantage to the shareholders of the joint stock banks and at the expense of the community as a whole. From the latest returns issued, it is evident that the average rate of interest paid to the shareholders is 12 to 14 per cent.  That is certainly a credit&mdash;from the shareholders' point of view, at any rate&mdash;to the directors responsible for reaping such a rich harvest for their shareholders.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants these banking directors to &ldquo;guide these new institutions.&rdquo; That is what they will do, if they get their way.  This Bill, as it now stands, makes provision for the doing of certain things by the unanimous wish of the board.  Does anyone think that anything revolutionary will be done by the board while there are three banking directors to &ldquo;guide these new institutions&rdquo;&mdash;in the words of the Minister?  I am inclined to think they will boss this new institution and, if they do, there will be no change whatever in our monetary policy.  I am of the opinion that this bank and the governor and directors of this bank will stand between the people of this State and the preservation, maintenance and feeding of the people.  The monetary policy of every country in the world will change, no matter who wins this war, when the war is over; and we should be very careful to see that the control of our monetary policy is not handed over, at such a period in the history of the world, to people who will not be responsible to this House or to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about &ldquo;experienced banking directors.&rdquo;  He will have only limited power in the selection of the three banking directors proposed in this section of the Bill.  If the Bill is passed in its present form, the Minister will merely have the choice of taking three from a panel of six submitted to him by the joint <Col N="1062" /> stock bank directors of the country. I daresay that the directors of our banks&mdash;those who are Irish nationals or residents of this area, as well as directors who live in the Six Counties &mdash;will have some say in the selection of the three directors to be included on this board.  Is it right that that should be so?  Is it not right that the Minister, if he is to exercise any control, should have the full say in the selection of the three who will be put on this board?</P>
    <P>I and the members of this Party are entirely opposed to the proposal contained in this section, and we could only think of considering a proposal of this kind in circumstances where the Minister for Finance himself would have some say in the control of the monetary policy of the proposed board. I hope the Minister will reconsider seriously the terms of Deputy Norton's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> The proposal embodied in amendments Nos. 3 and 4 is for a smaller board.  As the section stands, it provides for a board of nine&mdash;a governor appointed by the Government, three from a panel of bank selections&mdash;presumably names, of which the Minister will select three&mdash; and five others of whom not more than two are to be service directors.  In my view, a board of five would be sufficiently big to do the business that is likely to fall for consideration by a central bank under any heading.  As it is unlikely that the business would take long to transact, it could very well be discharged by a board of five. The cost is considerable in the difference between nine and five.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the board consists of nine persons, it is likely that the cost of the remuneration and fees paid to the members would be in the neighbourhood of £6,000.  Assuming further, that one of the implied intentions of the Minister fructifies, the cost under that heading of the nine would be £7,000 because it is contemplated in one instance that the person nominated by the Minister will devote his whole time to the business of the board, and I presume in his case the remuneration paid would be £1,000 or £1,200.  In that case the cost would be £7,000 per annum.  Under the proposal in the two amendments the cost ought not to exceed £3,700.  That is a saving of over £3,000.  It is the Minister's responsibility to prove that we will get value for the expenditure of that £3,700.  I do not know that we would. We heard from Deputy Davin a good deal about how banking boards are run.  He knows all about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>His statements do not exactly fit in with what one banking director informed me on that subject. He has to spend several days on <Col N="1064" /> duty at that work on occasional weeks. The business of a bank director is very different from the business that will fall on a director of the central bank. It would be of some advantage to the House to know what length of time the business meetings of this board will occupy.  I have the greatest doubt if it will occupy more than four hours a week.  If it only occupies that length of time it is obvious that a board of five can do the work.  There is a later section on which we can deal with the division of responsibility with regard to the board.  So far as this work is concerned, it is more or less with investments, in having money at call on short notice, and is not comparable at all to the business that would devolve upon a bank director.  If there is anything comparable let us hear about it. Bank directors deal with applications from customers for advances.  There is no such business here.  The banks will need on occasions to have money on call at short notice and to buy or sell securities.  Although there is provision in the Bill for what is called &ldquo;open market operations,&rdquo; it is very unlikely that they will transpire with any great rapidity.  The business is altogether dissimilar.  In one case you have the whole building up of financial institutions, and in the other case merely regulating investments and issuing currency notes.  That does not devolve on this board, which is more concerned with administration than with control or anything of that sort.  What are the circumstances of the last few years?  This Government was not very long in office when the term of office of one of the members of the Currency Commission expired. Was anyone appointed in his place? No one.  Some months ago another member died.  Has anyone been appointed in his place?  Not that I am aware of.  So that the present strength of the board consists of five persons. That is the situation.  In the Report of the Banking Commission, which went very carefully into every question in connection with currency, banking, economic development background, and everything of that sort they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been informed that there is at present a vacancy on the <Col N="1065" /> Currency Commission, and that this vacancy cannot be filled, as the law stands, for the period within which nominations should have been made was allowed to lapse....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The date of the publication of the report was March 23rd, 1938&mdash;four years ago.  For four years the Currency Commission operated with a board of six persons, and it has been operating for some time with a board of five persons.  If there is a case then for the extra expenditure of £3,500 we are entitled to hear it.  With regard to what Deputy Davin and the mover of the motion said about knocking off the banking members I do not agree with that.  They made no case for that.  I think they would very much resent Civil Service experts being brought in to run one of the trade union organisations, and that they would not agree that a civil servant is so adaptable that he would soon become accustomed to the work of trade union organisations, that his knowledge of men and things would be found as great as that of Deputy Davin and that his wonderful adaptability would make up for his lack of experience.  It so happens that nobody is so experienced in the practical work of finance, money and banking as bank directors.</P>

      <P>It may be that the officials know more about the details than the directors, but it is the directors who have to give the decisions and it is on them the responsibility lies.  A board of five is, in my opinion, quite sufficient for the work to be done.  We have not so much money that we can afford to expend public moneys unnecessarily on a large board doing work which could be as well done by a smaller number of persons.</P>

      <P>Any Central Bank Bill could be approached from a variety of viewpoints.  We were, to a certain extent, influenced by the position as we found it.  There were three bank directors on the Currency Commission. The number three was chosen because it fitted in very well with the banking <Col N="1066" /> organisation here, and afforded representation to the variety of interests in the banks.  From what I have heard them say, Labour Deputies would make the central bank a Government, State-controlled affair; the Minister for Finance would, probably, be chairman, and the whole direction of the bank would be closely in accordance with Government policy.  The bank would simply serve the policy of the Government of the day.  That is not the basis on which this Bill has been framed. To a certain extent, we were influenced by what we found, and we had no desire to make any changes except where those changes were obviously and clearly for the general good.  The number three had been found to be suitable. If there were to be bank directors at all on the board, it was felt that it would be desirable that that number should be retained.</P>
      <P>A good case could be made for having no bank directors on the board. On the boards of quite a number of central banks, the commercial banks are not represented.  It is really for the general direction of the credit policy of a country that a central bank is set up.  Consequently, if you had the commercial banks represented on it, it might be suggested that these representatives would have regard to their own banks' profit-purposes rather than to the general interest.  This Bill has been framed on the basis of an attempt to get co-operation between the commercial banks, on the one hand, and the central bank, as functioning for the general welfare, on the other hand.  If it should prove, in practice, that that does not happen, and that co-operation does not exist, then the whole of the scheme may have to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the present the Bill is based on the faith and belief that we shall get in large measure, in the operations of the central bank for the general welfare, the co-operation of the commercial banks.  If there is to be a fight at any stage, then the Parliament and Government of the day will have to face that fight.  At present we do not feel that any such fight is threatened.  Our hope is that we shall get co-operation.  Reference was, I <Col N="1067" /> think, made to the fact that we have removed the banks from the position of being shareholding banks.  That was to make quite clear that this central bank was an independent national institution and that it was not, as the word &ldquo;shareholding&rdquo; might suggest, owned by the commercial banks.  We have here provision for six persons to be chosen by these banks&mdash;not exactly representatives.  I think that the banks can send up on the panel of six any names they choose.  It is not specifically laid down that the persons on the panels must be directors of the commercial banks.  The six names are to be sent up and the Minister is to choose three from the six.  From the point of view of the board of the central bank, there is a definite advantage in having on that board persons who have day-to-day knowledge of the working of the commercial banks&mdash;the problems they have to deal with, the position in regard to demands for credit, the type of credit demanded and so forth.  They will then have firsthand information in their own personnel on which they will be able to base opinions and they will not have to seek that information elsewhere.  On the basis of this Bill, I think that there can be no objection&mdash;there is possibly an advantage from the point of view from which we approached the matter &mdash;in having on the board persons who are likely to know the day-to-day activities of the commercial banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach paint the other picture and say what the other three directors are intended to be representative of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We deliberately left the matter open because, as the Deputy will realise, there is bound to be considerable difficulty in getting persons for this board, having regard to the responsibilities involved, which the Leader of the Opposition seems to be at pains to minimise.  In most countries the central bank is one of the most important institutions, and the responsibilities of the members of the board are very heavy.  Their actions could have very serious consequences regarding <Col N="1068" /> the welfare of the community as a whole.  The responsibilities of the members of this board will not be light.  If conditions are steady, so to speak, they may not have to spend a tremendous amount of time in transacting the routine work of the bank, but problems of various kinds will come before them, and to these they will have to give considerable attention.  The nature of their duties will be much more clear when we come to deal with the broader questions regarding the functions of the bank.  When considering these questions, I think there will be few who will refuse to admit that the responsibilities of this board will be fairly great.  If a body has to decide very big questions, one likes to see that body of fair size.  I have seen questions in which it was very, very difficult to know on which side the balance lay, which was the wiser of two courses that were being debated.  Where there are big issues at stake there is an advantage in having the number fairly large.  The Minister for Finance has here a list of central banks in other countries, and the numbers on the boards.  The reason for their being so large is obviously because the decisions that have to be taken are of such importance that they must have a fairly large number to ensure that a variety of points of view are put forward, that different aspects of the question are apprehended, discussed, and so on. In the Argentine there are 12 on the board of the central bank; in Australia, eight; Belgium, nine; Canada, 11; Chile, ten; Denmark&mdash; curiously enough&mdash;25; England, 24; France, 20; Netherlands, 15; Norway, 15; Portugal, ten and Switzerland, 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the people in the Netherlands and elsewhere are as anxious about the pounds, shillings and pence that are spent on any remuneration as our people are. But, considering the magnitude of the questions and decisions they may have to take&mdash;it practically concerns the whole economic welfare of the country &mdash;I think we would be very unwise to cut down the number to five or to a small number.  It may <Col N="1069" /> be even questioned whether the number, nine, is sufficiently large. If you want to maintain a balance and to make quite certain that it cannot be said that the central bank is being run by the commercial banks in the interests of the commercial banks, and you take three as the basic number, I do not think you can have the number less than nine. Whilst in our circumstances, it is right to have the commercial banks represented on it, I think it would be unwise to give them such a preponderance on the board that there would be any suspicion that the decisions of the central bank were taken solely in the interests of the commercial banks.  When you weigh the various balances, I think the House will be satisfied that the number, nine, as the maximum&mdash;the Minister is not bound to fill the whole number if he does not choose&mdash;is not too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true and, from that point of view, it is possible he will appoint the whole nine.  I do not know.  A decision on that matter has not been taken because, obviously, a great deal depends upon the material that would be available, the qualifications of the persons you wish to put upon the board, and so on.  So that, there is a certain amount of latitude left; but the number, nine, whether you take it as inevitable that the nine will be appointed or whether you take it as being the maximum, does not appear to me unreasonably large.  I think it is very easy to be penny wise and pound foolish in matters of this sort.</P>

      <P>Like the Taoiseach, I have an open mind.  Deputy Cosgrave has stressed the question of economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> I would like to approach it from a slightly different angle.  When one considers this question one wonders who is to manage the central bank.  The board will consist of five persons, plus the governor and three banking directors. The three banking directors, at least, will have a knowledge of banking. Most of us think that banking is a highly technical and complicated subject.  From some of the remarks of previous speakers one would imagine that to get a suitable person for managing the bank one had only to go outside on the street and stop the first person between the ages of 25 and 60.  If that is so, most of the people in banking have spent their lives in vain.  I think the Banking Commission in their report recommended a higher percentage for the banking directors than is suggested in this Bill.  I think in the control of the affairs of the Currency Commission the banking directors had a greater proportion.  The Taoiseach has stressed the point that this is not a Government bank.  I think he is very wise in that.  The people are not prepared for what has happened in other countries where the banks have taken control of the finances of the country, with disastrous results in certain instances.  We have heard complaint that we do not emulate New Zealand and other countries that have shown a very forward policy in connection with banking.  It would appear as if the banks here are under some nameless suspicion in that they do not display the progressive attitude that is shown in other countries.  Some other countries have undoubtedly shown a more progressive attitude but that has led to dangers of its own.  There has been the financial crash in America. There have been lesser crashes in other countries.  Certainly, it seems as if the only charge that can be levied at the banks in this country is that they have not had a financial crash.  That seems to be a nameless charge that is hoarded against them.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why he desires to hand-pick the directors. I think the manner of election which is suggested in a later section&mdash;and I am only referring to it in passing&mdash;is <Col N="1071" /> unnecessary and derogatory.  When one considers that there will be six directors nominated by the Government and three others hand-picked, it is quite conceivable that, out of nine directors considering a matter, six may be totally unprejudiced by any previous knowledge of the subject that is before them.  I think that is the plain way to put it.</P>
    <P>The reason that I have suggested a modest reduction of the directors from five to four is that I am envisaging a possible position where the three banking directors might find themselves in confict with the four directors nominated by the Government.  I shall not refer any further to the three directors having already gone through the Caudine Forks that the Government would no doubt exercise in their selection. Say that they sit down to consider a problem which is very important from the point of view of the central bank.  The four directors vote one way and the three banking directors vote another way.  If the chairman votes with the three banking directors, there would be a tie and the chairman would have a casting vote. I should like to suggest that, in that case, the matter would be decided in the best interests of the country by those who knew most about banking affairs and by a governor who, although he would be selected by the Government, might feel it his duty to side with the banking directors.  If the present numbers are adhered to, the proportion will be five Government directors to three banking directors, these latter being supposed to know most about the question under review and, as far as the general public are concerned, they will put the blame on the banking directors should anything untoward happen.  They will say that if the banking directors did not know, they ought to have known; but the position is going to be, if the numbers suggested in the section are adopted, that they never can get anything done which is opposed by the other directors.  That is a most unfortunate position and may possibly lead to the banking directors more or less handing in their guns and saying: <Col N="1072" />&ldquo;Well, there is no good in our making any protest.  These people sit together and vote together as a solid block.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that, first of all from the point of view of proper control, and secondly, from the point of view of confidence by the general public, it is very desirable that the position should be modified. I am not suggesting that the banking directors should be put in absolute control, but a position could arise where the situation might be extremely critical if one of the nominated directors or the governor sided with the banking directors.  In that case the governor would have a casting vote. I should like to press this amendment strongly for the consideration of the Minister and the House.</P>

      <P>Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance has given us any convincing reasons as to why they should insert in this Bill a mandatory provision under which they and their successors are obliged, unless they alter the provisions of the Bill, to appoint three banking directors to exercise their degree of control over the new central bank.  If the Government feel disposed to appoint banking directors, why can they not do it?  Let this Government do it, and let that be the measure of their appreciation of banking directors as such; but why not leave it open to some other Government, or open to experience, to decide the question as to whether the appointment of banking directors is desirable or not?  In this section, the Government are making the appointment of banking directors mandatory.  By the acceptance of our amendment the Government can still do that by the Minister simply naming three directors, but why do the Government tie their hands in this way to appoint three directors?  Our view of banking directors is that they are not the indispensable functionaries envisaged by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance will probably say that I am wrong in this matter and that he is right, but let me tell the Minister for Finance what the previous Minister for Finance thought of banking directors <Col N="1073" /> and Irish bankers in 1931 when he spoke of troy ounces and our loss in troy ounces owing to the way in which we were anchored to British sterling. Here is the report of a speech by the previous Minister for Finance as published in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 29th September, 1931:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even before that Party went into the Dáil its members had directed public attention to the dangers to which our people were exposed by reason, not only of our attachment to sterling but of the short-sighted policy of the Anglo-Irish banks in investing their depositors' funds in British securities....  The Free State Government, under Mr. Cosgrave, has been on the side of Britain.  The Anglo-Irish bankers have been on the side of Britain. The Currency Commission has been on the side of Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So the former Minister for Finance, who enjoyed the Government's confidence as Minister for Finance for eight or nine years, was of opinion that Anglo-Irish bankers were on the side of Britain and that the Currency Commission was on the side of Britain. With that kind of certificate before him and before the Government, with their ability to get the living testimony of the then Minister for Finance that this was so, the Government proceed to embark on a Bill which definitely ties them to appoint three banking directors who according to a Minister for Finance, who held that office for nine years, were on the side of Britain and against the best interests of the Irish people. The Currency Commission according to the former Minister for Finance was also on the side of Britain.  It is from that group that this Minister for Finance and this Government are proceeding to appoint three banking directors.  Why?  Was what the former Minister for Finance said in 1931 all nonsense?  Was it just said so that the boys at the cross-roads might cheer at the prospect of the destruction of the Anglo-Irish bankers and the emergence of financial freedom, or did he put it forward as the considered view of the Minister for Finance and his Government because, of course, in this speech the Minister for Finance spoke not <Col N="1074" /> merely for himself but for the whole Party?  He said they realised that not merely in 1931 but before they entered the Dáil.  What the Minister is now going to do is to anchor himself definitely to that collection of people&mdash;I use the words of the former Minister for Finance&mdash;who have been solely on the side of Britain and have done everything they possibly could to sabotage the efforts of the Irish nation to obtain financial independence.  Can the Minister for Finance tell us why it is necessary to anchor himself to a liability to appoint three banking directors by statute?  He can do it if he wants to, but before doing so he should ask his predecessor what he thinks about banking directors at the present time, and if he is still of the opinion expressed in his speech reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> in 1931.  If after doing that, he still proposes to appoint three banking directors one can only begin to wonder where the Government stand in relation to this whole question.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this Bill is simply to set up a central bank, and a central bank of a type that is not in existence in any other country in Europe, and that is not tied down to doing the things in any other country in Europe that this central bank is tied down to doing in this country. Our view of a central bank definitely is that we want the central bank to be a Government organisation, with the directors appointed by the Government and answerable to the Minister for Finance who, in turn, will be answerable to Parliament for the financial policy of that bank, which, in effect, is a reflection on the financial policy of the Government.  Here, however, we are setting up what is virtually a private bank masquerading as a central bank, with complete control of our monetary policy and of our entire credit policy.  It will not even be responsible to the Government, and the Government do not even purport to take power to be responsible to Parliament for the activities of that central bank.</P>
    <P>In Section 6, then, we come along and find that certain functions are given to the bank&mdash;simply standstill functions, functions to carry on as at <Col N="1075" /> present, and no more functions than that because, of course, the verbiage of Section 6 deceives nobody.  Is it any wonder that <i>The Economist</i>, commenting on the present Bill, said that the proposed central bank is likely to be little more than the existing Currency Commission under a new name, and that it can be more accurately described by the old title than by the new one.  <i>The Economist</i>, in the same issue, took pleasure in the fact that there was no significant change in the Bill: everybody could go asleep and be perfectly happy that the currency of Éire was still based on sterling. Then the <i>Times Pictorial</i>, which also comments on the subject, assured its readers that the sterling link remains unbroken by anything in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not believe that you are likely to effect any radical change in either the economic system or the monetary system of this country by merely rechristening the Currency Commission under the name of the central bank and merely transferring to it functions which, in the main, are functions similar to those possessed by our Currency Commission at present.  Our view is that if there is to be any radical change in our economic policy and economic development here, it is essential that present banking practices, which have given us poverty and misery and an appallingly low standard of production as well as an appallingly low standard of living, shall be altered unless we are going to tread the same kind of desolate road that we have been treading so long.  The Government have given no reason whatever why they should insist upon being tied to appointing three banking directors, and my fear is that the appointment of these three banking directors in a board of nine people is bound to have a very considerable influence on the policy of that bank in that sphere in which the bank may have some powers somewhat different to the powers which are conferred on the Currency Commission at present&mdash;and, if they have these powers, they are of a very microscopic variety.</P>
    <P>I think the Government ought not to <Col N="1076" /> bind themselves to be obliged to appoint three banking directors.  As I said, this amendment of ours is related also to an amendment which we are moving to Section 6, our viewpoint, frankly, being that we do not want the Government to be tied to the appointment of banking directors.  At present, there is no evidence that they are necessary for a bank of this kind, and there is always the grave danger that they will be concerned with existing banking practices, and that they will hinder and stultify the efforts of the central bank to break new ground. Having got rid of banking directors, as such, and of the practices which they symbolise, we want to see the Minister for Finance giving direction to the bank, under public control, and that he, in turn, will be responsible to Parliament for the activities of that bank and for the direction of the whole financial policy of the nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton referred to some previous statements by members of the present Government. I am as ready as anybody else to believe that it is very hard to get an idea into the heads of the members of the present Government, but I think that they ought to be given some chance of learning something from the experience of past years, and I do not think Deputy Norton's criticism was relevant to the present business.  What I want to speak about&mdash;and I have only a few words to say&mdash;is the question of the size of the board of control.  The Taoiseach, I think, suffered from a confusion of ideas, judging by his speech.  Having listened to Deputy Cosgrave, who stressed the amount of business that this new board of control had to do, he straightaway confused that with the responsibility and the importance of the work.  Now, that is all right if it were a question of a sum in addition, but surely there is an immense distinction.  Deputy Cosgrave did not deny the sense of responsibility that was required from this board.  What he said was that the amount of time required would not be great in comparison with that required from an ordinary banking official.  I was amazed to hear a person in the Taoiseach's position of responsibility <Col N="1077" /> taking up the line that you increase the sense of responsibility of any body by dissipating that responsibility over a larger number of people.  I think you do nothing of the kind.  You may make them a bigger debating society, and I think that that was all that was in the Taoiseach's mind, but certainly you diminish the sense of responsibility of the members of the board.  If you want an increased sense of responsibility, a smaller board is preferable to a larger board, and what the Government ought to aim at, if they do not accept Deputy Norton's view of their Bill and if they believe that this is an important measure, would be to limit themselves to a board of a small number of expert people, and to realise that the more you increase that board the less sense of responsibility there will be on the part of each individual.</P>

It is quite obvious, however, that what the Taoiseach has in his mind is a number of men who would not have the responsibility but who would simply discuss it and spend their time in discussing it&mdash;a debating society.  I do not think that is good business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know what the objection is to appointing three directors other than from the commercial banks.  Deputy Cosgrave said that the strength and integrity of the central bank will be based on the commercial banks.  He told us about the little amount of work that will have to be done by the central bank.  We believe that it should be the principal bank in the country.  Deputy Dockrell, in trying to make little of our views about banking and of the responsibility of governing the country, said that the view seemed to be held by some people that you could go out on the street, call in any young fellow and make him a bank director.  I think that was treating the matter too lightly.  The Taoiseach talked about co-operation between the commercial banks and the central bank, but does he or anybody believe that we are going to have genuine co-operation between them since the central bank will be supposed to look after the welfare of the people of this country?</P>
      <P>I do not believe we will have it. The Taoiseach also said that if there is going to be a row we will have to face it.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke as if we all looked upon bankers as some evil influence in the country.  We are not concerned about bankers but about the system they are operating.  There are some facts that we cannot blind ourselves to.  Take the record of the banks operating in this State and in Northern Ireland over the last 15 years, leaving out last year.  After making provision for all bad and doubtful debts, and we all know what they mean, the net profit made by the ten banks operating in the whole of Ireland over that period, leaving out, as I have said, last year, amounted to £22,406,000, while their paid up capital was only £9,000,000 odd.  In other words, they made over that period a net profit that was more than double their paid up capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave tells us that there is a danger of upsetting the functions of the banks in this country.  I would like to remind him that, some years ago, both he and I were members of a deputation that was asked to interview <Col N="1080" /> certain people with a view to getting money to build houses for the poor people in Cork.  We were prepared to offer 4 per cent. on the money needed for that purpose.  A short time before that the Cork Corporation floated a loan of £250,000 at 4 per cent.  The Deputy knows that from the banks in this State we did not get as much as a shilling to enable us to build these houses, even though we were prepared to give them 4 per cent. on any money they might advance for the purpose.  We had those poor people living in vermin-ridden houses, and that had been going on for years.  The reports of the medical officer of health testified to that.  Does the Taoiseach think for a moment that responsible men in the commercial life of this country could not be got to act as directors of the central bank instead of having three representatives from the commercial banks on it? Deputy Cosgrave in his amendment proposes that whatever decision is come to by the board it must be unanimous before any change can be made.  In other words, one may say that there will be no change, because I am quite satisfied that the directors appointed by the Government and the commercial banks are not going to do anything that will be likely to upset the operations of this institution. Even though changes may be necessary in the interests of the country, they will not be made since one bank representative will be enough to prevent them.  That is one of the reasons why we object to the commercial banks having three directors on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment raises two issues which cannot be properly discussed because the Government have not yet told us what their intention is with regard to the setting up of the board in its entirety.  There is the issue whether the board should be composed of nine or five members or some number in between.  The second point is that whatever the number turns out to be, the Legislature should insist that a certain number will be selected by the Government from a panel put up by the banks.  It is only fair to say that the people put up by the banks need not necessarily be <Col N="1081" /> bankers.  They may be anybody.  There is hardly any doubt, however, but that they will be representatives of the banks.  If I could get a clear idea of the functions of the board, and some better appreciation of the type of people who are to go on it I could speak on this with more decision.  I think it would be better to have a small board of full-time experts than a large number of people who will be looking forward to a continuance of membership. The better idea, I think, would be to have a smaller number on the board with a longer tenure of office. If that were done it might relieve Deputy Norton and his colleagues of some legitimate fears.</P>
      <P>With regard to those to be nominated in part by the banks, there is no doubt that if a person is a nominee of one of the banks&mdash;if he has to resign his directorship&mdash;and is given a three or four year period of office as a member of the board with the likelihood that he will be going off at a particular time, he will, during all the time that he is on the board, be thinking in terms of his own bank and of his services to that bank.  On the other hand, if you set up a board with a small number of first class experts, even though they may come from what my friends on the right here might call a bad area, it is quite possible that if they are given a long tenure of office, they will divorce themselves from their old-time associations and look upon the functions of the central bank in a different way from those elected by the other method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share the views of the Labour Deputies or their suspicions about the people whom the joint stock banks may put up.  I think these people know their business and have conducted it in a way that has earned the commendation of most people who have looked into the question of banks in this country.  Even though certain individuals may have been held up to public odium and scorn, it is not likely they would find themselves on the banks' panel.  From that panel it ought, I think, be possible to get three good representatives.  I do not think that their old-time associations will hamper them in any way.  They would hamper them less if they could be given <Col N="1082" /> the expectation of a longer period of office on the board of the central bank.</P>

Is there any suggestion here of public control?  I do not see it to any great extent.  More than any other opinion expressed, I share the opinion which Deputy Norton has expressed with regard to the Bill generally, and in fact what the Minister for Finance has expressed in comparison with the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach expressed the view that the Central Bank will be one of the important institutions of the State. The Minister in charge of the Bill rather threw cold water on that.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Finance knows the details of the Bill, and the Taoiseach knows the theory of central banks.  But the modern theory of central banks is not carried into this measure or anything like it.  It seems to me that we will have to make up our minds before this Bill goes through on a very big and important matter&mdash;people who may have had different views five or six years ago could be excused for having advanced views on it nowadays&mdash;and that is the question as to whether the provision of credit is a public function or not.  If you make up your minds that it has to be approached in that way, then this Bill is radically and hopelessly wrong.  If the provision of credit is to be a public function, there ought to be some more association of Government control through this House with the people on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> As the Bill stands, notwithstanding the high-falutin' language, when you cut that out and get down to the trammels put on the board of the central bank and the detailed provisions of the Bill, I think the Minister for Finance is right in saying that what happens in the country for the next generation will not depend on anything this bank does, but on things outside.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government, in introducing this Bill, had another idea.  I half expected them to say that they recognised the functions of the central bank as established in this country were to be limited mainly to the provision of short-term circulating of capital to trade and industry. If they have any idea that long-term investment is something that the Government ought to control as a matter of Government policy with regard to the reconstruction and guidance of industry, they have no control and very little association.  That is why at the beginning I called attention to the fact that they are establishing under this section an independent board.  You are throwing them out distinctly at arms length from the Government, not allowing even, as with the Electricity Supply Board, the Government to say: &ldquo; There is a policy being run.  It is being sincerely run; but it is not ours, and it is not what we think the country needs, and we must replace it.&rdquo;  There is no such provision here.  I am told that we can get that by amending the Bill.  That can always be done.  That is inherent in every legislation.  It does not bind another Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Government have not told us that they have any plan outside this Central Bank Bill for anything in connection with industry, or agriculture, or reconstruction, or the development of an undeveloped country, so far as it depends on the exploitation of monetary resources.  The Government are setting up this board of the bank in a narrowly restricted way and throwing them out, and from that moment this House and the Government have no touch with them.  In these circumstances I agree that it is of little matter what number <Col N="1084" /> is on the board or whether they are all bankers or a sort of industrial, trade, or agricultural people.  I think the Bill might be enlarged to give some better function with regard to credit and some better junction, although I recognise it to be dangerous, with the Government and with what the Government elected by the people will regard as the necessary functions of a central bank.  Then I would be interested in the question of how many men ought to be on the board.  If the bank is to be given proper functions, I should like to have some representatives of the banks on the board, because they will know banking work.  I should like to have a number of people not so closely tied up with the banks&mdash;I do not mean suspicious of the banks, but not interested in the mechanism of banking. If that situation is to be accepted, I should like to see a number of full-time experts as well, to whom you would more or less say: &ldquo;If you behave properly and carry out your functions well, then you are more or less there for life or until some age limit comes into operation.&rdquo;  If you are to have a central bank and to have appointed to the board a large number of people, this idea of circulating the representatives will get going amongst the commercial banks.  If you are to have a big number of them, some of them will certainly be thinking in terms of when they will get back to their own bank directorships and the background will loom up very impressively and inevitably in their discussions.</P>

      <P>No case was made by the Taoiseach when speaking against my proposal.  The mere fact that the Bank of Switzerland has 40 members on the board is not an argument that we ought to consider.  It is to be hoped that there is no bank director listening to this debate this evening because he would laugh at the House.  If the picture drawn from the opposite side of the House and from the Labour Benches is true, bank directors meetings are debates and discussions.  They are nothing of the sort.  They are mainly decisions, responsible decisions, and I have never denied it.  That does <Col N="1085" /> not add to the length of time it takes to do the work.  What is the explanation of not having appointed an extra person on the Currency Commission since the Banking Commission's Report brought the matter to the notice of the Government four years ago?  They have been operating with five members for the last 12 months.  The case made that the central bank will have control of credit to my mind has not been provided for in the measure, good, bad, or indifferent.  So far as the provision of credit is concerned, the Banking Commission's report says that there is plenty of credit.  They could not get from any responsible authorities representing business a complaint that there was not sufficient credit.</P>

      <P>They could get the £50,000.  They could have got it from either of two banks.  The two banks were in competition to give it to them. For some time past, I have been following the minutes of the proceedings of that board and I know that there were two banks in competition to give them the money.  Originally, one of them required security and subsequently they offered it without security. In any case, it is a question of fact, and we are not going to argue a question of fact here.  It is there in black and white on the minutes.</P>

What I am stating here are facts&mdash;they are not arguments.  I am not briefed by the banks; I am not speaking for the banks, and I am speaking according to the facts.  If money is dear, neither the Cork Corporation, the Dublin Corporation, nor the Government can get it cheaply.  If money is dear, it has a price in the world markets and it can get it and it must follow it, and, if it does not follow it, you have these catastrophic financial crises that occasionally disturb business.</P>

      <P>There is no use in asking a question of that sort unless you wait for the answer.  The First Loan of this State was started within 18 months of the Civil War&mdash;96 at 5 per cent.  At that time, what was the <Col N="1087" /> British Government borrowing at, and they had no civil war?  5 per cent. par.  What was the Belgian Government borrowing at, at the same time? 93 at 7 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a great deal more than a world war.  You have a great many financial crises and slumps of one sort or another.  Of course, Deputies there would trace them with unerring instinct in one direction.  I wonder would they be honest with themselves and say that in this or in any other country somebody other than the bankers is at fault?  I have asked where there was a public scheme in this country which suffered by reason of lack of money to carry it out.  On the Order Paper this week we have had questions put to the responsible Minister as to how much money had to be put up by the State in respect of loans that were guaranteed by it.  State Loans (Guarantee) Acts were passed by both Governments for the purpose of facilitating and helping those firms which required money on long-term loan.  It was not the banks' business to do it.  It is not banking, in practice.  They have money on short loan, and they lend on short loan.  If they lent money on long-term loans, you would have what occurred in America&mdash;a great many properties thrown on the market, a slump, and the depositors finding themselves without their money.  In this age, are we expecting the bankers not only to do the banking business of the country and safeguard the depositors, but also to tell us what public schemes should be formulated which will give employment, stop emigration, develop the resources of the country and so on? You may hope to get bankers of that kind, but I do not know where you will get them.  I think you should concern yourselves first with getting the sensible schemes, or getting the sound industrial concerns.  If you get <Col N="1088" /> them, the money will be found to finance them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy objects to the price of money, and he is quite right in doing so.  One of the disadvantages of this country is that it is small, that its business, compared with larger countries such as Great Britain, France and America, is on a relatively small scale.  It does not take a clerk in an office much longer to write 1,000 than to write 10.  It is only a question of a couple of extra noughts, but it matters when you come to add up the expenses of doing business.  It is possible to run a very big business, handling very large sums of money, with a small board.  On occasions, you may require as large a board to conduct a business of half the size.  If, by reason of our special circumstances here, and having no money market&mdash; that is what is given by the Banking Commission; I am not going further than that&mdash;extra costs are added to our system, that is one of the disadvantages of the State; but it is morally wrong for us to be trying to apportion the blame when the responsibility is on our own shoulders.  It is quite likely that one of the disadvantages of the Shannon scheme is that for the next 20 years we will have a collection of dud politicians looking for something to beat it at the cost of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave takes the view that there should be no Parliamentary interference whatever with the control of our monetary policy, and that is the very clear difference between his attitude and the attitude of the members of this Party.  We understand his position quite clearly. The provision of credit is a matter of major public policy, especially in present-day circumstances.  I wonder whether the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who can carry this Bill in its present form, realise that by voting for the Bill as it now stands they are handing over the control of our monetary policy to an outside authority? Personally, I do not care whether the membership of the board consists of nine or five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of minor importance compared with the power and <Col N="1089" /> authority given to the members of the board, and the outlook of the members of the board.  The saving of £3,000 a year, suggested by Deputy Cosgrave in his statement, is a simple thing compared with the passing over by this Parliament to an outside body, including three banking directors, of the control of our monetary policy in present-day circumstances.  Deputy Cosgrave is a very able debater, especially on financial matters.  The monetary policy of every country in the world will be changed before another Budget is introduced in this House, and that is why it is a very serious matter in present-day circumstances to give to this proposed body, including three banking directors, the control of our monetary policy, and, to a certain extent, power over the provision of credit for the carrying out of works of a national development nature.  I ask the Taoiseach does he think that the people of this country have authorised him to hand over this extraordinary power to this body?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate power is here, as was pointed out by the Taoiseach, and will be exercised by him if there is a scrap, or a lack of co-operation, to use his own words, between the three banking directors and the other members of the board. We cannot afford to take a chance at the present time with so many of our own people out of work, and so many more of them leaving the country because they cannot get work or wages or money to maintain themselves and their dependants.  The Taoiseach read out the number of members on the boards of the so-called central or State banks in different parts of the world. He did not give the number of members or the conditions under which they are appointed in Sweden or New Zealand.  He gave the number of members on the Board of the Australian State Bank.  Strange to say, they are only eight in number, but the members of the State Bank in Australia are not guided, as the Minister for Finance said here to-day, by the experienced bank directors.  They are guided by the Minister of Finance of <Col N="1090" /> the Australian Government, elected by the people of Australia and responsible to the people of Australia.  That is the terrible difference between the position of the board now proposed under Section 5 of this Bill and the powers conferred on the members of that board here, compared with the powers and authority of the members of the Australian Bank Board.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Dockrell was joking &mdash;although his line of argument was very closely related to the line of argument put up by the Minister for Finance&mdash;when he said we were suggesting that you could go out on the street, call any fellow between the ages of 25 and 60, and say that he is a suitable person to become a member of the central bank board.  I will furnish him with a list of the members of the Bank of Ireland Board, and I guarantee that he will not point out to me the names of two men out of the 15 who are under the age of 60.  I saw in the &ldquo;Social and Personal&rdquo; notes in the <i>Independent</i> recently that one of the members of that board had celebrated his 77th birthday.  I have as much respect as anybody for old age, but these facts do not fit in with Deputy Dockrell's suggestion&mdash;I think it was rather a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; suggestion&mdash; that we would take up every Tom, Dick or Harry in the street and say that he could be regarded as a suitable member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I would prefer to take responsibility for the putting of a majority of civil servants on this board instead of these three banking directors because, if there were a majority of civil servants on the board, we would have some say in their activities when we came to discuss the Estimates, whereas when we pass this authority to the board, with the limited powers in Section 5, we cannot say another word during the lifetime of the Dáil, or until the Bill is amended.  If the Bill is passed in its present form, we can put down questions, if the Ceann Comhairle allows them to go on the Order Paper, but the Minister concerned will give us the same answer as different Ministers now give from time to time in connection with the operations of the Electricity Supply Board, the Turf Development <Col N="1091" /> Board, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and all these semi-State boards set up by the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see the first Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government entering the House, and I am surprised that he has been absent during the discussion of this very interesting section.  Deputy Norton will, I am sure, quote again, if necessary, from the speech he made when he was a boy in matters of this kind in respect of the outlook of Deputy Cosgrave when he was head of the Government. The Minister has grown up, and, I am sure, has learned something from his experience, first, as Minister for Finance, then, as Minister for Industry and Commerce and later, as Minister for Local Government.  We should all like to hear what he thinks of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell and also the Taoiseach clearly indicated that they could see the time when, instead of co-operation, there would be a conflict between the banking and non-banking members of the board.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave suggested that I knew a good deal about the activities of the bank directors. <Col N="1093" /> I do not.  I know some of them to be extremely able men.

      <P>I notice that this list includes the names of several distinguished men who signed the majority report of the Banking Commission and these are the gentlemen whose names will be put to the Minister for Finance under this proposal.  I dare say he will find that every one of the banker members of this commission will be in the list of six names handed over to him from which he will have the selection of three.  I dare say he will be in the happy, or the unhappy, according to the point of view, position of taking from the panel of six three of the members who signed the majority report of the Banking Commission.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to enable the County Management Act, 1940, to be brought into operation at an early date, whether the local elections are held or not.  The Bill does not in any way vary the powers conferred on a council and on the manager of a county respectively by the Act of 1941, nor does it impose any new duty or give any new function to either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original Act provided that the system of county management should be instituted in all county council areas simultaneously.  The main difficulty, therefore, in putting that system into operation at once arises from the fact that in a number of counties the members of the councils have been removed from office and commissioners are acting in their places.  In some counties, Dublin and Clare, for instance, the removals have taken place quite recently and, apart altogether from the question whether it is practicable or not to hold the elections in the circumstances of the present time, it is obviously undesirable, in the case of counties such as these, to reconstitute the local authorities on an elected basis until the commissioners have completed the task of cleaning up and reorganising the administration there.  Accordingly, in counties where the local authorities have been dissolved, it is proposed under this Bill, pending the restoration of this council, to retain the commissioners and to empower them to act as managers of the counties for which they are responsible.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this Bill provide for that, accordingly.  In all, there are seven counties in which the members of the <Col N="1095" /> county councils and the boards of health have been removed from office. There are also two counties in which only the members of the boards of health have been removed.</P>
    <P>In addition to dealing with this managerial problem, the Bill deals with two minor matters.  Section 3 of the Bill relates to one of these and extends the definition of a joint body to include a statutory body, at least one half of whose members are required to be appointed by two or more rating authorities.  New statutory bodies, drainage boards and the like, may be created by future legislation for particular purposes and it may be desirable to extend the managerial system to them.  Under this section there will be power to add them to the number of other joint bodies to which the relevant section in the Principal Act already applies.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill makes a variation in the scheme of priorities to be followed in the selection of the first county manager.  At the present time there are six persons acting as commissioners and discharging the functions of county councils and boards of health. One of these individuals is a secretary of a county council and, under the Principal Act, will duly receive a preference in respect of that post.  With regard to the remainder of his colleagues, it is considered that in view of the experience which they have acquired, some of them acting virtually as managers of the counties to which they have been appointed, the Local Appointments Commission should not be debarred from considering their fitness for the post until all the existing priorities have been exhausted.  The Act of 1940 gives a preference to county secretaries and secretaries of boards of health.  From the viewpoint of the widest public interest, perhaps the best thing to have done would have been not to have fixed priorities, and even yet, perhaps, it would be best to wipe out the priorities altogether and leave the field of selection the widest possible.</P>

      <P>Because I feel if we did, bearing in mind that the Oireachtas only a short time ago conferred this statutory right upon these individuals, it would be too great an infraction of the principle which has already been established.  My view, therefore, is that the best compromise between having a wider selection and accepting the preferences which have already been conferred upon certain individuals is to ensure that individuals who have been specially qualified by experience to act as county managers should receive early consideration at the hands of the Local Appointments Commission. It is proposed, accordingly, that the commissioner for a county, including the commissioner discharging the functions of the board of health for a county in which members of the council are not removed from office, should be given priority in the county in which he is functioning after the secretary of the county council and, in other counties, after the secretary of the board of health.</P>

      <P>That would be a matter for consideration by the Local Appointments Commission.  No doubt the question of a man's age will be taken into consideration in determining his suitability for office.  The effect of Section 4, in conjunction with Section 4 of the Principal Act, may perhaps be more readily apprehended if I cite the proposed order of priority.  The normal case, of course, is that of a county in which the county council is functioning and which is not grouped with another county.</P>
      <P>The order of priority in such counties, of which there are at the moment 13, will be, first, the secretary of the county council; second, the secretary of the board of health; third, the commissioner or commissioners of suspended county councils or boards of health; fourth, the secretaries of other county councils, and fifth, the secretaries of other boards of health.</P>

      <P>I said the normal case is that of a county in which the county council is functioning and which is not grouped&mdash;I am considering now the case of the 13 counties.  In counties in which the county council is suspended &mdash;except the County Dublin, which, by reason of the provisions of the Principal Act, is in a special position&mdash;the order will be, first, the secretary of the county council; second, in these cases where the county council has been suspended, the commissioner for the suspended county council or board of health; third, the secretary of the board of health; fourth, the other existing commissioners for county councils or boards of health; fifth, the secretaries of other county councils, and sixth, the secretaries of other boards of health.</P>
      <P>I should like to explain in this connection that, once these priorities have been exhausted, if it is found, that there are still some vacancies for county managers, then the field would be open to any other candidate who cares to apply for the post.  The purpose of this arrangement&mdash;an arrangement to which the Dáil has assented already, if not, in fact, asked for&mdash;is to ensure that those acting in what appears to be an analogous position will be considered first, before any other candidates can be considered at all.</P>

Naturally, if a man does not offer himself as a candidate, the question of priority does not arise in this case. I have already pointed out that Sections 5, 6, and 7 are designed to secure the primary purpose of the Bill, which is to enable the managerial system to be brought into operation as soon as possible, in as large an area as possible.</P>
      <P>Section 5 relates to the counties, other than Dublin, in which members of the county council have been removed from office.  Under this section, the selection of a permanent manager for such a county will be deferred until it has been decided to reconstitute the council on an elected basis. When that decision has been taken, the selection of the permanent manager will be proceeded with by the Local Appointments Commission, and the appointment of the permanent manager in accordance with that selection will be made before a new council is elected.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, the existing commissioner will act as county manager, as if he had been appointed temporarily.  In the case of a county in which the county councillors are still in office, but which is grouped with another county in which the county council is suspended, the Minister will appoint a person to act temporarily as county manager, until the dissolved county council is being reconstituted and the appointment of the first permanent manager for both counties in the group has been made.</P>
      <P>If an assistant county manager is required to be appointed for a county &mdash;again other than Dublin&mdash;in which the council has been suspended, or for a county grouped with it, he will not take up office until the suspension has ceased.  The reason for this provision is that, where the county council of a county in a group is suspended, there will be in the interim period, until the first county manager is appointed, the commissioner in that county and there will also be a temporary manager in the other county.  These two officers, in my view, ought to be able to carry out the work of the county manager and the assistant county manager.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not interfere permanently with anything that is done under the Principal Act.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable, to the extent to which it may be possible, to bring into operation the original County Management Act at the earliest possible date.  In order to do that, we have to adopt some temporary expedient to deal with the position which is being created by the present emergency. One of the things we propose to do in regard to Tipperary is, so far as South Riding is concerned, that the existing commissioner will become the manager for the South Riding.  So far as the North Riding is concerned, whether the temporary manager who will be appointed will ultimately be selected by the Local Appointments Commission as manager for the two groups&mdash;North and South Ridings&mdash; when they are grouped, I do not know. It may be the secretary of one or other of the county councils, or, if he is found to be unsuitable, it may be the existing commissioner or following that, the secretary of one of the boards of health.</P>

      <P>He is only temporary manager.  Before they come to the commissioner at all, the Local Appointments Commissioners will have to consider the position of the county secretary and say whether he is, in their view, suitable for appointment. If he is found suitable, he is bound, if my reading of the Bill is correct, to get the appointment.  That does not necessarily mean that he must be the best man; it merely means that he must be suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill relates again to counties outside Dublin in which the members of an elective body have been removed from office.  At present, there are the cases of the Urban District Councils of Longford, Buncrana and Trim, and a few others.  Pending the reconstitution of such local authority on an elected basis, it is intended that the commissioner who has been appointed to act for it will perform the duties of both council and manager. When the County Management Act comes, in due course, into full operation <Col N="1102" /> in the county, after the local authority has been reconstituted, the permanent manager will be appointed under the Principal Act by the Local Appointments Commissioners and will be the manager for the elective bodies within the county.  There is a similar provision in respect of the elective bodies wholly or partially within the County of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the position of Dublin County.  Under the Principal Act, the Dublin City Manager is appointed to be Dublin County Manager.  The provisions of this Bill with regard to the order of priority for the post of county manager are not applicable to Dublin.  Dublin County Council was suspended last September and it is proposed that the commissioner appointed in place of the county council, the board of health and Balrothery and Rathdown Boards of Assistance shall continue to act for these bodies pending their reconstitution. This applies also to the position of the commissioners administering the affairs of the Dublin Board of Assistance. These arrangements will necessitate an adjustment of the payment to be made to Dublin Corporation by Dublin County under Section 14 of the Principal Act in respect of the cost of management and sub-section (3) of Section 7 of this Bill makes provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>If the Oireachtas passes this Bill, as I hope it will, it will be possible, in due course, to bring the County Management Act into operation and, with it, the remaining portions of the new Local Government Act of 1941 as well as the Public Assistance Act of 1939.  These three Acts will then form the general basis of the new system of poor law, public health, and local government, which is designed finally to replace the somewhat cumbersome, inefficient and unsuitable system which was taken over from the British Administration.  Measures for the complete reorganisation of the whole system were initiated by the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, were carried somewhat further by the Local Government Act, 1925, and by the several Acts reorganising the municipal administration of <Col N="1103" /> the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  We have now reached a stage when, as I have said, far-reaching changes are about to be made.  The passage of the Public Assistance Act of 1939 has necessitated the drafting of new public assistance regulations, while the passage of the County Management Act, 1940, has involved the recasting of the forms of account of the local authorities.  The extremely detailed work entailed by both is almost completed, and it is hoped to have the new form of local accounts and the new public assistance regulations ready very shortly.  As soon as they are ready and when the new county managers shall have been selected by the Local Appointments Commissioners, as provided by the Principal Act, it is intended, subject, of course, to the passage of the Bill now before the House, to put the County Management Act, 1940, the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and the remaining provisions of the Local Government Act, 1941, into effect.</P>

      <P>I intended to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, because I was speaking, through you, to the Deputies of the different Parties.  I do not think they did.  This House had brought before it a County Management Bill in which, swallowing some of the principles they once enunciated, the Government proposed a certain type of improved administrative machinery for county councils.  That Bill was passed.  It was supposed to improve, and in my opinion would improve, the carrying out of the functions of local bodies. That Bill was given the Government a couple of years ago.  The Minister now <Col N="1104" /> presents this patchwork business to us and explains what the result will be when the Oireachtas passes it, as he hopes it will.  The Minister speaks as a member of an Executive Council that feels itself saddled with very serious responsibilities arising out of the emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the proposition put before the House by the Minister, and when we consider how much more varied and widespread in relation to the whole country are the antics of the Government in relation to nomenclature, the Minister will appreciate that it hardly tends to systematise the machinery for carrying on business with clarity, or as to how that machinery is going to work.  The Minister asked that he should not be interrupted, and I do not want to do so or to reply to his interruptions.  The House passed the County Management Act in order to get better machinery to carry on local government.  The Minister who is now presenting this Bill to the House is a member of a Government that feels that it has very serious responsibilities, and that it has to direct the work of the country through very difficult times.  We have got organisations of various sorts in which the people are called together.  In my opinion, there is not a more important piece of machinery than machinery to control local bodies.  If we turn to the county medical officers of health we know that they deal with <Col N="1105" /> evacuation and with A.R.P., and we turn to the county surveyors when certain things want to be done on the roads, or to have turf supplies gathered.  There is no systematised piece of machinery so valuable, but the position in which that machinery is being left in a time of emergency is indicated in this Bill.  Men and women have been brought together and have elected their controlling bodies in various classes of public services.  Here we have local bodies but, instead of getting people elected to local bodies, in accordance with the law as it stands, then putting the County Management Act into operation by these local bodies and giving the country a clear-cut vigorous lead, we have this chipping and chopping.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that a number of local bodies had been dissolved. Will he say if much of the reason why it was necessary to dissolve them was because they were old and withered, and so long on the job over the statutory time that they have not been functioning properly?  These councils were last elected in 1934. Normally they should be elected in 1937, but were not, because it was said that would clash with the general election.  Then they were going to be elected in 1938, but that clashed with another general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That situation went on until they were to be elected in 1940, but then there was an emergency.  While the people are asked to come together and to elect governing bodies, the Government does not call upon the country to elect local representatives.  As a people we are either the biggest pack of hypocrites or are the biggest pack of muddlers.  I do not know what we are.  For generations we are supposed to have been struggling in order to set up our own machinery of government. Now when we have it, these bodies for the slightest reason are trampled upon and set aside.  I could understand them being trampled upon and set aside for political Party purposes of one kind or another, but I cannot understand the machinery of local government being trampled upon and set aside in a time of emergency, by those who howled so <Col N="1106" /> much to the contrary about the importance of the people standing up to responsibilities and doing their duty in order to be prepared for the emergency.</P>
    <P>There is one way to give a real lead to the country and that is by seeing that the machinery is in good trim for any emergency that may arise, whether a military or, as is much more likely, any social emergency, that we may be up against, and in the spirit of these times to ask the people to set up their representative local bodies and then without any chipping or chopping to get the newly ordained machinery into their hands.  We will then know where we are with regard to the fabric of local government and its scope, as we will have a closely knit machine, including the county managers, the county medical officers of health, the county surveyors and the secretaries of county councils in every local government area, with men and women freely elected in the spirit of the emergency and ready for responsibilities and the duties that will face them.  If the Minister is going into an emergency with this type of Bill, then he is going into an emergency with no local government machinery, except machinery where a man will be known here and there for his initiative and energy, and will be contacted with because of his initiative.  He will not be there as a piece of systematised machinery with a proper local body around him.  I ask the Minister if he really thinks that I am making these remarks for any other reason but that I absolutely believe in them, and because I am convinced that we should have local government in such trim to-morrow that it could operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that we have not for a long time heard such a lot of thimble-rigging as was expounded by the Minister when introducing this Bill. I take it that if the Minister was in the House when the parent Bill was put through, he will remember that everything that has happened in connection with that Bill was indicated from various parts of the House.  As far as one can see from the Bill now <Col N="1107" /> introduced it is trying, in my opinion, to make confusion more confounded. I have consistently opposed the county management system, because I am not yet convinced that it is going to create any better system of local government than we have at present.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the people are permitted to retain the power they have at present, better results will be obtained for the people whom they represent than there will be if county managers are appointed all over the country.  The principal aim of this Bill seems to be to set up a priority category.  The Minister has mentioned certain people, people holding positions as commissioners at the present time, county secretaries and secretaries of boards of health.  I asked him, in the course of his statement, why it was that town clerks in rather important boroughs in the country should not be placed upon that priority list.  I understood from him that when he had reached, I think, secretaries of county boards of health, it was proposed then to widen the field and permit any person in the State to make application for the position of county manager.  I suggest to the Minister that that is very unfair.  I propose to submit an amendment on Committee Stage to endeavour to secure that, at least, town clerks of municipalities with certain population should be given an opportunity of endeavouring to secure a position as county manager.  I think it is most unfair to keep out people in that category while you open the position to men who have had no previous knowledge of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware that at the present moment the Local Appointments Commission have placed in the position of town clerk and in other positions under local authorities, people who have had no experience hitherto of local government in the country.  I, for one, am perfectly satisfied that in some cases these people have made a mess of local government in the areas in which they were appointed.  I have one particular place in mind, where a town clerk was appointed who was taken out of a commercial office, who had had no connection, <Col N="1108" /> good, bad or indifferent, with local government work.  The result is that, although that man has been in that position for a couple of years, he has not yet acquired the necessary knowledge to enable him to be helpful to his council in carrying out local government in the county.</P>
    <P>I said before that it was pointed out to the Minister's predecessor that, in the opinion of a great many people in this House, the original Bill, when passed, would not work smoothly.  As far as I am concerned, I am going to vote against this Bill.  I am absolutely opposed to the county manager system. I am perfectly satisfied we could do better without it.  I am not going to vote for this Bill or do anything to put the parent Act into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, this Bill has been introduced largely because of various resolutions which have come from South Tipperary.  I do not fall out with it on that account because practically every local body in Tipperary, parish councils, and so on, have passed resolutions, copies of which I have received, asking that the County Management Bill be amended so as to permit of the present county commissioner retaining office as manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Rightly or wrongly, I think it has something to do with it.  I am not quarrelling with it at all.  The people want it and they are probably the best judges as to who would be suitable.  There is also in South Tipperary&mdash;Deputy Loughman can bear me out&mdash;an insistent demand that the county should be divided as it is at present, into North and South Ridings, for the purposes of county management. I moved an amendment to the County Management Bill to that effect, and I hope to do so again, because I feel that County Tipperary is much too large to be managed by one man. When I come from Carrick-on-Suir to Dublin by road I touch five counties, and I could drive the same distance in my own constituency, going the shortest way, and still be in County <Col N="1109" /> Tipperary.  I feel that if a county manager has to manage a county of that size, he cannot give it the necessary attention.  There are counties in which it is proposed to have a county manager which are much smaller in area and population than South Tipperary, and even much smaller than North Tipperary.  I cannot give the names of these counties at the present time, but I think I mentioned them before in connection with the Principal Act.  Unless the Minister says that he will agree to accept an amendment of that kind&mdash;his predecessor refused&mdash;I will be again compelled to put down an amendment to add a new section to the Bill to divide County Tipperary, for the purposes of this Bill, into North Riding and South Riding.  In South Tipperary we have corporations, we have at least four urban councils.  All these things require looking into.  I feel that if a county manager has to deal with the eastern part of the county he will be able to pay very little attention to my part of the county.  I would like Deputy Loughman to reiterate what he advocated on a previous occasion.</P>

      <P>That is not what I got up to talk about.  Deputy Mulcahy seems annoyed about this Bill.  He wants a local election as an alternative to the <Col N="1110" /> Bill.  I think if there were normal conditions existing in the country everyone would welcome a local election, but the problem, in my opinion, is whether you could hold a local election and do full justice and get a fresh mind, under present conditions.  I believe that, under present conditions, the large urban areas would, to a great extent, control future county councils.  That is why I would be opposed to local elections at the present time.  I was not clear when the Minister mentioned the priorities in connection with existing commissioners. Will they have a right to apply to be made county manager, after the secretary and the secretary of the board of health, in all counties?</P>

      <P>I want to protest against that.  I think it is most unfair to set up six men and give them the choice of, I think, 24 areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>You are going to give the six men now acting as commissioners a choice of 15 areas or a choice of the whole country.  You are going to allow them a choice as to what county they might like to be manager in.  I am sure that the Local Appointments Commissioners, when they come to fill post X, we will call it, will know quite well that the secretary of the county council will apply, that the secretary of the board of health will apply, and that one or two commissioners will apply.  They will know that those two&mdash; we will call them niggers in the woodpile&mdash;are there.  They can easily pass over the secretary of the council or the secretary of the board of health, knowing that these men are there to fall back on.  That is the objection I see to this Bill.  It fundamentally changes the principle of the County Management Act.  If they were allowed to compete only in the counties in which they are acting as <Col N="1111" /> commissioners at the present time, there would be no real objection to it, but to give them the right to apply to be county manager in any one of the Twenty-Six Counties was never suggested and I should like to put it to the Minister that that is a fundamental change in the County Management Act.</P>
      <P>That is a point to which I should like to call the Minister's attention and I think it is important that we should give it serious consideration.  It is strange that six men should be given a priority over all other men and placed in exceptional positions as against any other citizens in the State. The existing secretaries of county councils or boards of health would not have any chance against them.  These other men will get priority in a county in which they have not been functioning at all.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the matter very seriously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mulcahy.  I think it is a very regrettable fact that local authorities should have outlived their term of office three times over.  The dissolution of so many local authorities is due in no small measure to that fact as it was inevitable that a certain amount of senile decay should have crept in amongst them.  People lost interest in the work of local administration.  Many of them failed to attend meetings and the natural result was that there was inefficiency. For that reason, it is to be regretted that a further postponement is now about to take place.  I also agree with Deputy Mulcahy that, facing a period of very grave uncertainty, particularly during the emergency, it will be a serious handicap in rural districts if people have to depend on the direction of one man who possibly may not be very well acquainted with local affairs at all. Certainly a virile local body, newly elected, would add greatly to the strength and the power of organised effort to meet any contingency that might arise.  I think that this measure is going to give rise to many complications and difficulties of administration as well as to certain injustices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The point raised by Deputy Allen is one that the Minister might well consider.  There is the question of appointing two temporary managers in two counties which it is proposed to join for the purposes of management later on.  It appears that one temporary manager is going to lose office later.  I think it is an injustice, first of all, to appoint a man in a temporary capacity in that way and then afterwards deprive him of office.  It will mean that there is little likelihood of his getting a similar position in any other county.  If a manager is appointed from the priority list in another county, that in fact means that a secretary who has been acting as temporary county manager will have no chance of being elected for that county.  To that extent, at all events, I feel that it is an injustice to the man who is expected to fill the position of temporary county manager.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister.  Some of the commissioners who have been appointed recently may be applicants for the position of county manager later on. If they are appointed by the Minister &mdash;the Minister in fact said that the appointment was made by the Appointments Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The manager will be selected by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a note of the Minister's words.  He may have meant to put it the other way, but that is what he said.  Where a man is appointed to an office, when he is pretty well on in years, I should like the Minister to tell us how his superannuation is ultimately going to be calculated.  If he has given long years of service in another county, and he is taken out of that county and appointed as manager in some neighbouring county, he may possibly only serve ten years as manager.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether the county of which he is appointed manager will have to pay his superannuation, <Col N="1113" /> although he has given the best part of his life to the service of another county.  I feel that this whole measure is very unsatisfactory.  It would be far better to face up to our responsibilities and to have local elections now.  New bodies coming into office imbued with new vigour would produce better co-operation and would provide a better prospect of working the County Management Act effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that the Government is no less anxious than any member of the House that these local elections should be held. I feel that the situation which Deputy Mulcahy has described is the cause of many of the difficulties we are experiencing with local government, but against the desirability of holding these elections we have to put the very solid difficulties with which the country would be confronted if it were proposed to hold them in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> First of all, I think there would be a vast mass of public opinion against the holding of these elections.  The people would say: &ldquo;Here we have a united country with men of all shades of opinion and of all Parties in the various services that have been organised to meet the emergency and the worst contingency that the emergency may bring.  Are we going to divide the country again into factions and political camps?&rdquo;  Then we would have difficulties with regard to the provision of election materials, transport, etc. For that reason it is doubtful if we could hold elections in present circumstances, but we are anxious to get the County Management Act into operation at the earliest possible moment. If we get this measure through, it will enable us to put the Act into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just saying, at the time it became necessary to report progress, that although the Second Reading debate should have decided, as far as we are concerned here, the major questions of this Bill, the questions of principle involved in it, at the same time it was inevitable that in the discussion of the amendments to it we should have these fundamental view points brought up and debated again and again.  Now, in debating these points the first thing necessary is to be quite clear as to what the Government had in view in this Bill, what it purposes to achieve by it and why, in fact, it brought it in at all.  The history of the Bill is something like this: that shortly after we came into office, in the carrying out of the programme that we had indicated, we thought it desirable that a central bank should be established, and that its powers should be considerably wider than the powers which are being exercised by the Currency Commission. When we proceeded to do that it was strongly suggested that we should not do it until there had been a public examination of our financial position and of the whole question of a central bank with it.  I am half sorry that the period of time which elapsed since has passed, though I doubt very much, if we had proceeded at that time with our project for a central bank, it would, in effect, be very much different from the Bill before us.  I think that the facts of the situation, when we had thoroughly examined them, as we would have examined them, would have led us almost inevitably to the point of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you start from the general theory on which central banks have been and are founded, you will very quickly realise that the circumstances in the different countries affect the general conclusions very seriously, and that the conditions here are in a way exceptionally peculiar: that the powers which they give to the board of a central bank in other countries would be <Col N="1116" /> ineffective in what would be one of its chief functions, apart from the maintenance of the soundness of the currency, that is the control&mdash;or if I might put it in a wider from&mdash;the influence on the volume of credit in the community. The methods by which that influence on can be exercised effectively in these other countries cannot apply here and would not work here.  If you want to get quickly the reason for that you will find it in the fact that here our commercial banks have an exceptionally large volume of sterling assets in a liquid form immediately at their disposal, so that the methods which would be used in other countries, where their commercial banks were not in that position, would not be effective with us at all.  I would suggest to the members of the Labour Party, and to all those who approach this question of a central bank from the point of view of effective control and of purchasing power available for the community, to study that fact and ask themselves, how they would get over that particular difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach mind restating the difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is the volume of sterling assets in liquid form immediately available to be turned into cash by the commercial banks.  We have not a money market, but even if we had, unless the volume of business that was being done by it was extraordinary in comparison with our other resources, it would not be effective.  That is the central point as regards the difficulty of giving to the central bank the power of controlling the volume of credit here.  I can assure members of the House that we have tried exceptionally hard to find an effective method by which our central bank can do the things that the Labour Party desire to be done, and have not found any really satisfactory method.  The nearest we have gone to influence it is in Section 45, and that is not through for reasons which will be given when we come to discuss that particular section.  So that, apart from any difference of opinion there may be about what we should set out to do, we have this practical fundamental <Col N="1117" /> difficulty which arises from the fact that our commercial banks have at their disposal a very large quantity of liquid assets which can be turned immediately into cash.  That is the practical fundamental difficulty and members of the Labour Party, or other members of the House, who feel that it is essential to have this power of controlling the volume of credit and of purchasing power available for the community will have to apply themselves to that difficulty.</P>
      <P>To put the attitude of the Government in this matter clearly, it is this: we accept generally the doctrine that as the volume of credit and of purchasing power available for the community has an immediate social influence it is of social importance, and, therefore, cannot be outside the control of the public authority.  This Bill maintains that principle in general inasmuch as there are no limits to the powers of legislation of this Parliament. Therefore, we can legislate in regard to the banks just as we can legislate in regard to the farming community, the holding of land or any other business.  It is wrong, therefore, to say that we are handing over our sovereignty on that particular vital social matter to another body.  We are not.  This Parliament has at any time the right and the power to bring in any laws affecting the banks, and the whole question of banking, just as it has in regard to any other business matter in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not do it in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. Let us see where we stand.  I say that the Government are accepting, in general, the doctrine that the volume of credit in the community is of such importance to the well-being of the community that it is a matter of great concern for Parliament and for the Government.  I say that there is nothing in this Bill, in fact in the nature of things, on account of the sovereignty of Parliament, there could not be anything which would deprive Parliament of the power of dealing with that business any more than any other.  The power is always there. <Col N="1118" /> The question is at what point and to what degree you exercise it.  With regard to the exercise of it, there are practical considerations which members of this House will, I am perfectly certain, be prepared to see the force of.  The creation of credit, even for public purposes, would have, and could not fail to have, an influence on the whole question of prices, the whole question of the relative position of different prices to the community.  The exercise of the powers affecting that credit from day to day is a work largely for experts, people who understand it and know it thoroughly, and who see all the implications of any particular proposed action.  Therefore the Government, if they were directly and immediately to exercise it, would have to exercise it through a body of experts.  They would in fact have to be, so to speak, civil servants if you wish.  In the exercise of that particular power, there is always a danger that people who are in need of money, the Government just the same as private individuals, would resort to what would appear to be an easy way of getting over some of the difficulties we have to solve here year by year when we come to the Budget; in other words, that they would meet their financial yearly obligations by the convenient method of supplying themselves with credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, no matter how it works, this ultimately in its effect would be a form of taxation on the community.  If it were to be exercised, it would have to be exercised with practically the same examination of it by the House as, for example, by the body of experts.  But it is too ready and easy a way to have at the disposal of the Minister for Finance for settling difficulties, when he did not want to face the difficulty openly and directly of taxing the community for the services, and to have it there without a certain amount of restriction. In other words, there are the same difficulties attached to it that we have because our system is a Party system; the great difficulties caused by Parties being jealous of one another and different sections of the community being jealous of the power exercised in a democratic State, particularly <Col N="1119" /> when exercised by one political Party. You would get all those difficulties in that connection if you had the direct and immediate control that the Labour Party seem to desire for the Government.</P>
    <P>Apart from any dangers of that sort, the Government, for example, do not appoint civil servants directly.  We hand over the power of selecting the servants of the State to the Civil Service Commission.  If the system is not working, or if we have reason for thinking that it is working otherwise than we intended&mdash;giving fair play and providing the best civil servants&mdash;we can interfere.  But we do not ourselves take on the daily task of appointing these civil servants.  In another direction we cut ourselves apart from the judiciary. We make the laws, but we do not sit down ourselves to interpret the laws. We give a certain amount of independence to our Judiciary and let them carry on.  If we find the judicial branch is not working properly, there is nothing to prevent us&mdash;there are certain difficulties, of course&mdash;from coming in and changing the system or, in certain cases, removing individuals.  So that, both from the point of view of keeping temptation away, so to speak, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, from the practical point of view of handing it over to experts and giving them a certain amount of latitude and liberty in carrying out the general instructions given to them, this method is just as good as the other method.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, of course, are quite right in saying you can set up a central bank and make it part of the Government organisation.  You can go further and nationalise the whole banking system.  I think that the Labour Party, if they want to be consistent in their views, would be driven almost inevitably, not merely to having a central bank of the type they are suggesting, but to the whole question of the nationalisation of banking as a general public utility.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to see where we stand, where the difference of opinion is between us.  It is true that not merely the volume of credit, but the particular use that is made of it affects the well-being of the country. Therefore, in this Central Bank Bill we are approaching it from different points of view.  I would say to the Labour Party that they could not get through this banking Bill the control which they think is necessary.  I am not judging whether they are right or wrong in the policy which they think is necessary.  We are not aiming at anything at all so complete and drastic in this as the Labour Party.  As I have said, we are approaching it from the point of view that on the whole, so far as we can see, the commercial banking system as it existed, compared with other banking systems in the world, was perhaps one of the soundest from the pure point of view of the business that they were carrying on, the safeguarding of the deposits made with them by farmers and other depositors; that their work as bankers was done as efficiently as in any other country in the world, and perhaps more efficiently than in most.  The question is asked: &ldquo;Why have they so much of their investments outside the country?&rdquo; Fundamentally they are not to be blamed for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are blamed.  I do not know any other use of the word. One of the things brought up against them is that so much of their investments has been outside the country and that a very large volume of our assets is abroad.  I say that was in the nature of our trade with Great Britain. It was our whole fundamental policy here&mdash;the fact that our economic and political position led inevitably to that.</P>

      <P>It was not the primary purpose of the banks as banks to look after the interests of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> The more we go on the more we will find that we are approaching those matters from certain similar fundamental viewpoints, differing only in practicality.  It was the business of the banks to make their profits, to safeguard the moneys that were lodged with them, and to be in a position to give those moneys back at short notice.  The fact is that the farmers and others who deposited their moneys with the Irish banks were not looking so much for high rates of interest; what they wanted was that the capital should be immediately available, and that it should be safeguarded. That was one of the reasons, amongst others, for banks having the assets which they had outside the country.  I am going to talk about that in a moment.  The fact that its immediate availability, and the liquidity, so to speak, of their capital, was the primary concern of our farmers, allowed the banks here to have a far higher degree of liquid assets than the banks in other countries. Personally, I believe that it was not necessary, and is not necessary now, to keep such a large quantity liquid. At any rate, they did it in response generally to the attitude of the community they were serving.  How did they come by those assets abroad? The main way they came by them was by the excess of our exports over our imports.  There were claims on Britain, and they could not be transferred here&mdash;that is the next point we have to get into our minds&mdash;except by the transfer here, in the main, of goods from the other side.  There may be certain interchange of securities and so on.  While it is true that we have certain claims on Britain which bring in something like £13,000,000 a year, there are claims on the British side, too, of, I think, about £6,000,000, and no doubt you can change one of those sets for the other; but on the whole the bringing home, the repatriation, as it is called, of our assets can in fact only be effected by the bringing over of goods, and the fact that those outside funds, which the banks have, remained outside is because we did not import more.  Our policy in the development of industry was to try <Col N="1122" /> to bring back those assets to the greatest extent possible.  The fact, at any rate, is that they have those liquid assets available; that they have enabled the banks to circumvent any of the ordinary measures taken by central banks to control the volume of credit, which is done by the amount of cash that is immediately available for the banks.</P>
    <P>We approach it then from the point of view that, first of all, we acknowledge the fact that this control and influencing of the volume of credit on account of its effect upon the community is a social matter.  We try to deal with that in this Bill by saying: &ldquo;Very well.  We cannot do it by the methods employed in other countries, by which the central bank can more or less effectively control the volume of credit.  We will try to do it by co-operation between the commercial banks on the one hand, the central bank, which is watching out for the community interest, on the other hand, and the Government.&rdquo;  The Government, it is true, in this Bill has no direct power of ordering, except the ultimate power which it has of saying: &ldquo;This thing is not working, and we have got to change the whole system.  The credit policy which you were following is obviously having detrimental effects on the community as a whole, and we cannot stand for that.  That cannot happen.  We are going to change it.&rdquo; It would be changed by coming to the Dáil.  We have that power ultimately, but there is in this Bill no direct power by which the Government can order the bank to do any special thing.  A number of people are set up with responsibility for trying to control the volume of credit in the general interests. That is their terms of reference&mdash;to control it in the general interests.  By their fruits we shall know them, and, if it should appear to the Government that that control is not being exercised in the direction best calculated to secure the welfare of the community, then the Government will have to take action.  Whatever Government is in power will have to take action in the way action can be taken through Parliament. Ordinarily, what we hope will happen is that there will be close <Col N="1123" /> contact between the Minister for Finance, the central bank, and ultimately the commercial banks. When the Minister for Finance seriously points out, with argument, that a certain condition obtains, and that in his opinion certain things ought to be done, they will consider it and give their views.  They will point out, naturally, the difficulties there may be in pursuing the lines which he suggests, and consequences that may not have appeared to him will be shown up, but ultimately the hope is that there will be agreement in policy between the central bank and the Government in regard to this particular social matter.</P>
    <P>The central bank, if it finds that the commercial banks are acting unreasonably, can come to the Minister for Finance and suggest to him that certain powers ought to be given to them by legislation, in order that the things that they consider vital for the community should be done.  In the same way, if the board of the central bank should be found not to be acting in accordance with what would appear to the Government to be the general interests of the community, it has one final remedy, and that is to come to Parliament and change the system.</P>

      <P>There is no use in starting in advance and making provisions, when you have, as I pointed out, the practical difficulties that are here.  Will Deputy Davin or anybody else point out to us how you can definitely affect the volume of credit through the central bank?  Even if the Government take it over, unless they go further and nationalise the whole commercial banking system, they will not be able to do it.  Why then should we, in advance of events, do a thing which it would be a pity if we had to do it at any time?  It would be a pity if any Government had to do it.  If they could get it done otherwise, it would be very much more effective.  The commercial banks have an interest; they have a community interest.  They serve a very large section of the community, <Col N="1124" /> and their interests are very largely along the lines of the well-being of the community as a whole.  They would suffer through certain evils which would follow from a wrong credit policy.  Therefore, there is a hope that we can get that co-operation, which is the ideal way of getting this work done &mdash;co-operation between the public authorities, represented by the Government and Parliament, and the central bank, which would be a body of experts.  They would become expert anyway; I suppose we will have to start by getting whatever experts we have.  One of the reasons I am sorry we wasted&mdash;not quite wasted, but lost&mdash;a number of years on this thing, and did not do it immediately without setting up a commission, is that we would now probably have a greater number of experienced people amongst us than we actually have at the moment.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate in that, on the Currency Commission, there are a number of people who have been dealing, although not quite as fully as will be the case in regard to the central bank, with a number of problems that will have to be dealt with by the central bank.  We shall have in the board of the central bank a body of people whose sole business, whose duty, it will be to influence in so far as they can the use of the volume of credit in the interests of the community.  If we think in advance that they will not do this, we ought to show why we think so.</P>
      <P>As I said in regard to this particular number of three banking directors, it is possible that if we were starting without a Currency Commission in existence, we would not have the number three.  In fact, it is almost certain that if the Currency Commission had not been formed in the way in which it is formed, and if we were beginning <i>de novo</i> with a central bank idea. we would not have them here, even to the extent of allowing them to send up a panel from which the Minister can appoint.</P>

      <P>Three of the six put up, yes; but the point is that the banking business, as such, is naturally closely interested.  It is a business we are going to affect and if we were, for instance, setting up some labour board, I imagine that the Labour Party and the trade unions would be anxious to have some representation on it, even though the matter would not be of vital public importance.

      <P>It is perhaps more fundamental in its effects than others and, therefore, is there anything unreasonable in putting these directors on the board?  I quite agree that we could have left them off and, as I say, the chances are that if we were not taking over from the Currency Commission, where this system exists and with the members and constitution of which we cannot find fault, we might, not have put them on.  We cannot, however, say: &ldquo; You should not have done that.  You have done it in the interests of the commercial banks and you have neglected the fundamental purpose for which you were set up, the welfare of the community as a whole, and have tried to use your position to assist the commercial banks.&rdquo; We cannot point to any such thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  He had better justify the complaints he makes by pointing to facts and not by making mere general statements.  I have no brief for the banks, I can assure you, but I say that, in the circumstances of our country as they were and in the conditions prevailing here, the banks <Col N="1127" /> did their ordinary business and did not take on a wider business which was not theirs, namely, the whole question of managing credit in the interest of the community, except in so far as they found that it redounded to their benefit as well.</P>
      <P>They were like any other business. They were confined to dealing with particular things and some of them were not even aware of the wider aspects of these matters.  There is the point about which Deputy Dillon spoke.  You find that one man like Walter Leaf, the Chairman of the Westminster Bank, notwithstanding all the arguments about the creation of credit, flatly denied to the end that any such thing could be done by the banks, while the other man, McKenna, took quite the opposite view and said that the banks do create credit.  The point is that very often you find the banker who is doing his daily business, which is to give loans and so on to credit-worthy people, and, in giving these loans and advances, making his money, is not always conscious and has not been conscious of the wider effects on the welfare of the community of the policy adopted.</P>
      <P>The banks adopted whatever policy was sent down from headquarters, and to a certain extent some of these headquarters were aware of the wider implications of what they were doing, but they considered the matter not so much from the point of view of the effect on the general welfare, which it was not their business to consider, but from the point of view of the effect on their own business.  It was a private business, so to speak, and, on account of its importance, you have a group of people who will say that the whole of this public utility is such that it ought to be nationalised completely.  If we were to argue nationalisation, we should be up against the same problems as arise in connection with the nationalisation of the railways, or of any other public service.  The question has to be asked: Is the public interest going to be served by nationalisation, or by the system in existence at the moment?</P>

      <P>No&mdash;to tell you what our position is.  I may say that it was a very difficult thing to find myself in the position in which I was convinced almost against my will.  I had, however, to admit argument and reason.  Being unable to find a hole in the argument, as a reasonable being, as a person governed, I hope, by reason as much as most people, I had to come to the conclusion that in our circumstances&mdash;and we must remember that circumstances may change and the position will change with them&mdash;you cannot by any central banking arrangement effectively control the volume of credit here.  We are hoping to influence it by the action of the board of the bank, and by the action of the Government in consultation with the central bank; we are hoping to influence it in the direction which appears best for the community. We have not set out in this Bill to control it.  I do not believe that even if the Labour Party took it over they could control it.  Even if the Government had it in their hands they could not control it unless they put the commercial banks completely out of business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in talking in general terms.  I approached this matter from the point of view seeing that, in so far as the control of credit was going to influence and affect the well-being of the country, we would try to get that control, we <Col N="1129" /> would try to arrange that that control would be made available in the interests of the country.  This is the best we can do in that direction.  If you say that we should have brought in a full-blooded Bill, taking over and nationalising the whole financial system, that is another matter.</P>
      <P>Let anyone who likes to do that do it, but I am not prepared to take up that attitude, because I do not think that at the present time it could be managed as efficiently as we could get it managed by proper co-operation. This is the only way left to us if we are going to get this thing done.  So far as the Currency Commission is concerned, we could not point out things it should have done and did not do. We could not say that the Currency Commission had transacted its business in a way that meant that it put the interests of the banks, as such, above the interests of the public.  We could not do that and we could not say that these people had been tried and found wanting and we were anxious to get rid of them.</P>
      <P>After full consideration, we decided that there should be three representatives for the banks.  We felt that the banks would get a better representation by that number than by any other number.  These commercial banks are competing institutions.  It is quite true they have a standing committee in which they try not to run counter to each others' interests, except in the ordinary competitive way.  They try to have common policy in regard to certain matters, but of course they have different conflicting interests and if you want to give proper representation to them the number three appears, on examination, to be the appropriate number.  I believe that if the circumstances were otherwise we would not have the association of the banks with us at all except from the point of view of trying to get co-operation.  The only reason for having this panel chosen by the banks is that we are trying to proceed by way of co-operation and we are building to a certain extent on a foundation that already exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt it was only right that the <Col N="1130" /> interests of the community should be preserved by having at least a two-to-one majority.  The non-banking members, if the whole of that board is nominated, will number six; that is, those not directly associated with the commercial banks.  Is it going to be suggested that, if it comes to a question of the public as against the private interests of the banks, those people who have not any immediate or private interest, so to speak, in the commercial banking system, will not follow the line of their duty and vote accordingly? It means that if you start with three for the banking system you almost inevitably are driven to have a considerable balance against them.  I do not think the number is too great, when you view the importance of the decisions which are going to be arrived at.  I think the proposal in the Bill is based on good grounds, though probably seven would have been the number we would have chosen were we not having this fundamental three.  In other circumstances we probably would have chosen seven and then a variety of opinions would possibly be expressed.</P>
    <P>In other countries, and for good reasons, they might want different types of industry represented.  I can imagine you would have on the boards of these banks people who would be chosen because of their knowledge of various businesses which would be affected by the credit policy of the banking system.  Coming back to the section, I may say that this number was chosen because of the foundations on which we were building and the general idea to try to get by co-operation something which we could not get by coercion&mdash;at the moment anyhow, the conditions being exactly what they are.  There is no half-way house.  If you want to get the power which the Labour Party apparently seek, you will have to go far beyond a central bank; you will have to nationalise the whole banking system.</P>
    <P>There is another important consideration. Are we, by any chance, exaggerating the importance of money in the community?  Money is very important, no doubt, but even important things can be exaggerated, and listening <Col N="1131" /> to some members of the Labour Party, as I do here from time to time, in my opinion they exaggerate what can be done by the exercise of control of credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not exaggerate what money can prevent being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the positive or the negative way of looking at that differs very much; it would not matter much which way we look at it.  Let us consider the position of other countries, America, for instance.  For years past there has been an abundance of money there; a vast pyramid of money had been collected there, but yet you had the position that although money was available in plenty; and there was a sound basis of credit, because other things were not equal it could not be made effective use of.  The position is that you must have other things besides money in order to make the money most effective.  Take our own position with regard to turf. There is no doubt, if employment were the fundamental thing, that we could get that employment if we could take hold of people and say to them: &ldquo;You must do this.&rdquo;  In that case it would mean a complete regimentation of the community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all a question of service on the part of the community, one to the other.  One section may refuse to give service although another section is prepared to pay for it.  Ultimately the position boils down to this, that so far as employment is concerned there must be made available opportunities for giving certain service and there must be people prepared to give that service in return for what will be paid to them by other sections of the community.  If one section of the community is prepared to pay for a definite service, a particular class in the community must be prepared to render that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You must have a foundation of raw materials and other things to work <Col N="1132" /> upon.  When you have done all that you must have the power to take people from one section, saying: &ldquo;There is no work to be done by you there; you must come down here where there is work, and if you do not, you will not get any help from the State to live where you are.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was about to come to that.  The whole question is the rate.  The rate depends very largely on what can be done.  Is not that so?  It depends on the use they can make of the money otherwise. What use can be made otherwise of the money, even if you go to the point of credit?  I, for one, have not been happy at all about some of the rates that have had to be paid.  In view of the fact that there are large liquid resouces available from the banks, and that there are opportunities here of using those moneys at a rate which would not be less than the current rate, I do believe it ought to be possible to get money here for national purposes at lower rates than we have been getting at present.</P>

I have not got it personally, but I have been informed by persons who have no interest in telling me untruths, that the rates at which money is made available in this country&mdash;whether for private or public purposes&mdash;are far lower than the rates at which other countries have been able to get money.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of the present war.  This Bill would have been brought in under ordinary circumstances. It is long overdue.  I wish we had our people actually using this central bank, because we would have a body of experts which would be able to give advice and deal with any crisis that might possibly occur as a result of the present situation, but the bank is not functioning.  If we have to take any action to deal with any crisis that might result from the present situation I think it will have to be <i>ad hoc</i> legislation.  No doubt, if we had this body set up and working, we could get <Col N="1135" /> their advice, but any action to be taken would have to be immediate and <i>ad hoc.</i> We hope that any such thing will not be necessary, but I am anxious to point out that this is not a Bill designed to meet an emergency situation. Its main character was long ago determined and so designed to set up a, central bank organisation here which would be able to give the Government expert advice with regard to monetary policy, and so on, and which would be in a position to give effect to that policy for the welfare of the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate, we will have various questions on various points&mdash;for instance, the extent to which banks can create credit.  That question was raised by Deputy Dillon to-day in a special form.  There is no doubt that we will have to deal with that question in some particular form. There is difference of opinion with regard to it.  I told the House about the chairman of the Westminster Bank, who denied the point flatly.  He denied it to the end, and I am told he was a practitioner in a very big way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are others who will deny it and others who will say that, while theoretically the power exists, the exercise in fact of that power would have such immediate consequences that they would not dare continue it, and they point to the experience of the present war.  They would say that their powers in practice are very limited indeed.  If you point to the increase in the last war and in the present war, they say: &ldquo;Well, look at the immediate consequences; see what happens the community where this thing occurs.  If they did that to any large extent, it would immediately show itself, either by depreciation of money or by unemployment, or by inflation, with the other results to follow.&rdquo;  If you say to them: &ldquo;Look at the war at present and how they are financing it,&rdquo; they would reply: &ldquo;All right; is the community prepared, in order to offset the effects of this increase in the volume of credit, to put up with privations that the community at the other side have to suffer? Are they prepared to be rationed, to <Col N="1136" /> have their wages impounded, so as to lower the effectiveness it otherwise would have of an increase in purchasing power and sending prices sky-rocketing, and all the rest of it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before this is done, we must take these questions and discuss them&mdash;the extent to which the banks can, in fact, create credit and influence the volume of credit.  We will also have to deal with the question of parity.  All these questions are fundamental and are exercising the minds of a large number of people who have no interest but the public good.  There are the two schools of opinion, the two extremes, with views held honestly by people who have no interest but the public good.  My own attempts, over a long period, to try to understand this, have led me, I must say, to a much more central position than I would have occupied before.</P>
    <P>This has been one of the questions&mdash;social credit, and so on&mdash;from an early stage.  I believe that a lot of the foundation of it is unsound: that is my final opinion.  It is not easy to argue that in a conclusive way, where you could get the net two points and say that one is right and the other is wrong; because all this is fairly complicated, and the effects and reactions of all the various proposed steps are so many that it is not easy to assure yourself and be confident that you have seen the whole series of reactions and taken them into purview.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill is not put forward as a Bill that will enable the bank or the Government effectively to control the volume of credit.  It may influence it, and if there is co-operation it can influence it tremendously, but it is not designed to effect it by coercive measures.  It is based on an attempt to get co-operation between the three bodies interested, the Government, as representing the community, the central bank as being the body that has to manage it from day to day, and the commercial banks.  The sole purpose held out in front of it is to serve the public interest without fear, without favour, without Party bias or anything else, and then the commercial banks doing their business <Col N="1137" /> will have to co-operate if the three are to work in harmony.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent, it can affect it, but again it will practically have to be limited by all the conditions surrounding the particular rates it will make.  I hope the circumstances of the present time will help, and that banking institutions will place more reliance upon investments in this country.  Therefore, there is a possibility of closer co-operation in the circumstances between the three bodies which will be affected than might have been the case in the past.  Their interests will allow them to run parallel or to converge more. I am sorry I had to go outside the immediate section, but I think it will lead to our understanding each other more clearly for the rest of the way than if I had not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the number, I gave the basis.  It is given as the number that was handed to us, so to speak.  Undoubtedly, we can throw it aside and have no banking directors.  If we were beginning, in all probability it would not be found in the Bill.  In the past, there was no fault.  There is nothing wrong that I can attribute to that system.  We are looking for co-operation, and as a mark of good will and co-operation we are putting these three in.  The moment you put three in, if they are not to have an overbalancing influence, you want others who might not have any such bias as perhaps these would have.  That goes to show, I think, the necessity of having no smaller number.  Other Deputies may have less belief than I have in the public consequences on the volume of credit and may say: &ldquo;Oh, we might as well throw our hat at this business and let the banks carry on as they carried on in the past.&rdquo;  I do not think that is so. In my opinion, that is the other extreme. In this particular matter, I think that the Government will stand mid-way between the two extremes: <Col N="1138" /> those who would favour the nationalising of banking and complete control in the Party or in the elected Government of the day, with the consequences that would have&mdash;the initial consequences would be very serious&mdash;and to others, those who are so conservative, and believe that as everything was done in the best possible way in the past, it would be vain to try to improve things.  That is the Government's position in regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we have listened to will have cleared the air a bit, even though I do not think the Taoiseach answered many of the questions that were put to him in the form of interruptions from this neighbourhood. The general tone of the speech ought to have done this: it ought to have discharged the emanations of people who believe the sort of rubbish that Deputy Norton read out to-night, and the type of thing that emanated from the present struggling Minister for Finance under the Taoiseach.  I still have to deal with one or two points in relation to which the Taoiseach, if he could not give a definite answer, might show the tendency of the Government.  He talked about the sovereignty of the Dáil and the sovereignty of the State.  We are all agreed on that.</P>
      <P>I submit that the worst shock that could be given to the sovereignty of the State and of the people is, that the board of the central bank should be tied hand and foot by a section in the draft of the Bill.  I do not know yet whether the Taoiseach believes that the central bank can do anything to extend or to restrict credit; in other words, whether when it gets a certain basis, it can build up a superstructure. He has not answered that. I do not see how the central bank can do it or if it is possible for any bank to do it.  When the Currency Act of 1927 was introduced, the then Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are adopting a new form of note issue, which is elastic, which is based on credit requirements, and, primarily, on the advances of the banks, but not on them only.... <Col N="1139" /> In this Bill we make no provision for having the reserves of the bank bear a particular proportion to the note issue....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The situation under the Currency Act, 1927, was that there were legal tender and consolidated bank notes. The legal tender was a secured issue backed £ for £ by sterling, and the consolidated bank note issue was made a matter to be taken into consider ation on the amount of the liquid sound advances made to the people. As far as I understand, the liquid sound advances have gone and we are hereafter entirely dependent on sterling. If that is not the situation, I should like to hear what it is.  If it is the situation, it means that under the Act of 1927 this country thought it advisable to allow for elasticity in note issue in the currency available, based on the liquid sound advances made to the people.  Of course, these liquid advances had to be verified in a particular way.  In 1942, for some reason, the Government decided that this was an appropriate time to introduce this Bill and we are supposed to be independent of circumstances at the moment.  We are building not for the immediate opportunity, as this Bill may last for a good while, but we are taking away the elasticity of the note issue which is £ for £ with sterling and certain other things.  Why that change?  The Taoiseach spoke of the abundance of sterling assets.  Do we give the central bank any power?  Have we given it any power to stop a further superabundance of sterling assets flowing in?  Do we give it the slightest control over a variable rate of exchange?  Can one prophesy that parity will be always reached?  Do we give the central bank any opportunity to vary it?  I think not.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 45, in the name of Deputy Cosgrave, asks that there should be paid to each associated bank a proportion to the extent of 25 per cent. of the total issue of legal tender notes, based on <Col N="1140" /> the security of liquid sound advances, and that amendment struck the Chair as being so contrary to the principle of the measure for discussion on Second Reading that he was inclined to rule it out.  That is the situation, that the Bill is so completely rooted to sterling and so completely divorced from the resources in this country that on the Second Reading, the Chair thought it necessary to rule out the proposal that up to 25 per cent. should be considered sound advances.  There is such an abundance of sterling it may be necessary to say that it would be foolish to add anything less.  Is that always going to be the situation?  I remember when the Minister for Finance introduced the Currency Act of 1927, he threw in a phrase like this, that if they saw the slightest danger of an inflationary tendency in Great Britain, we would have to take steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest that if the Deputy is thinking of the present situation, and of a possible development of anything of that sort, it will be of such a character that it will have to be dealt with, and undoubtedly the board will be taken into consultation.  It would immediately approach the Government with regard to the measures it felt to be necessary.  There would be immediate action taken by the Government to deal with a situation of that sort.  If the Deputy is dealing with a general situation, he has answered himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the central bank cannot do all these things, I suggest that it might be wise to give them the power.  It can deal with legal tender note issue, gold bullion, gold coins, money in any form, British Government securities, sterling balances, and deposits from any banks in Great Britain and Northern Ireland but not in Éire.  We are tied as far as that is concerned.  It may be that circumstances <Col N="1141" /> make that necessary.  I approach this in a spirit of inquiry. These are questions one is asked by people who are inquiring and we should get the answers here.  We are tied to these things and if an inflationary tendency starts in Great Britain, we are subject to whatever its repercussions are.  We are subject to them as far as this measure is concerned, and the central bank can do nothing to prevent it.  The Taoiseach says that it can go to the Government.  Why stop at the central bank?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so stated.  The Taoiseach will get a chance of following up that argument and telling me where the reins can be pulled. I do not see it here.  I hope it is here somewhere.  There is talk about expansion of credit.  There is no doubt that in England the banks at one time, when there was a deflationary movement, held out against it.  Has our central bank power to hold out against deflation or inflation, if it started in England?  I think not.  I want to be shown that that is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other points were touched upon to which I think answers should be given.  Apart from the expansion of credit, there is another concern of people in many countries as to what direction credit is to take.  Is it thought that the Government should have any say in such matters and that credit should be made easy in respect of certain developments?  Supposing one takes some difficult and costly financial reconstruction of a growing industry in this country, should the Government, through the central <Col N="1142" /> bank, have some say in the direction of credit in respect of such a matter?</P>
    <P>Can the central bank do anything, on the functions given to them in this measure, in such a matter?  I think not.  The question of an interest rate is another important thing. The Minister for Finance on the Second Reading of this Bill used a phrase which he could have got from some of the older debates in the Dáil, about 1927.  He said that no sound scheme had been held up for lack of money.  Another phrase used was &ldquo;no worth-while scheme&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach himself talked of &ldquo;no credit-worthy scheme&rdquo;. A lot depends upon the idea in the background.  A sound scheme may mean one which pays 5 per cent. &ldquo;Credit-worthy scheme&rdquo; may have the same idea behind it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  I think we must start off with the theory that for anything you get in the world some payment has to be made, but you come to a particular point.  People will argue about this pyramiding effect that there is in connection with banks, and that there is a possibility of raising a very big superstructure on a rather narrow basis of cash, say, or some sort of security.  I think there is no doubt about that.  What people's minds are exercised about is this.  Let us take a period in which the ordinary bank rate for money they lend is about 4 or 5 per cent., that is 4 or 5 per cent. in ordinary circumstances, on the ordinary amount of money they loan out, the money that appears as advances in their books.  They have got 5 per cent. <Col N="1143" /> on that and, of course, a smaller rate of interest on short term loans and better securities.  But, eventually, supposing there is an expansion of credit and that so much more money is in a particular way being put into circulation, and, say, an extra million of credit is erected on some solid basis of cash, people's minds are exercised just with this: is it right to allow the financial houses to get the ordinary 5 per cent. rate on that volume of credit and, if it is not right to let them have that, and if it is possible to have a volume of credit erected on some basis of cash, then what is the rate of interest going to be and who is going to control it?  Is it the central bank? I suggest not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the questions I am putting here have an answer in the affirmative in respect of this measure, but I have searched through the measure, backward and forward, and I cannot find that the central bank is given any of these powers.  Somebody should have them.  If the Taoiseach agrees that credit can be expanded, is it their function?  Is it a matter for the bank or for the Government?  If it is a matter for the Government, can the Government do it without the bank?  If they can, how will they operate on the bank?  Are they going to have this independent body and throw them there and let them operate as they like?  Again, I do not think that is sound policy.  I have no settled view at the moment because I can see all sorts of objections to the Government being in full control of any banking institution whatever.  The type of thing Deputy Norton apparently regards as desirable is of some abhorrence to me, as at present advised.  There is no certainty about this matter; the whole thing is in flux and we must argue it to a conclusion, but I think it would be absurd to tempt a hard-pressed Minister for Finance with the possibility of having so much money when it came to Budget considerations. We should avoid that at all costs.  I think there should be some intermediate position in which the bank would be made independent in its day-to-day administration but that the Government <Col N="1144" /> would have some say in the direction of general policy.  We have not it here.</P>

It is not under any sort of public control here.</P>
      <P>There is one last question touched on by the Taoiseach.  The thing that I think is the greatest nonsense in the Bill is Section 45, this repatriation of assets.

That is the hook that has caught some of them.  The Taoiseach here to-night says that the effective way of repatriating assets is by goods from abroad.</P>

      <P>To a large extent you can influence a bank which is asked on the one hand for credits for home purposes which, if given, would have the effect of getting imports.  If they neglect giving credit at home, which would have the tendency of bringing in goods, they can be punished by a fine.</P>

Anybody who reads Section 45 looks on it as an unwilling bending of the knee to a lot of people who are shouting outside about the vast amount of money abroad.

      <P>I want to say this about it.  We have a fair enough experience in regard to the functions <Col N="1147" /> of the Currency Commission.  We could have made that experience a little greater by widening the circle. The central bank is merely going to do in one way what the Currency Commission has been doing up to this. I do not know why the Government should bring in a measure, call it a Central Bank Bill and pretend that this bank will have all the functions which a central bank in other countries ordinarily has.  The Taoiseach told us in that connection that the banks did what they did, and that as a result of what they did, a lot of our assets were placed abroad.  My suggestion is that we are now setting up a central bank and in one way giving it banking business, but that we are not giving it any of the things that might be described as Government business.  Worse than that, we are making no bridge, so far as legislation is concerned, by which the Government can cross over to the bank or the bank to the Government. I think the Taoiseach is right in telling us that we are setting up this board but that we are giving them none of the powers that a lot of people thought they might have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was not in the House when the debate started.  Three of these matters were referred to in an amendment, but the Ceann Comhairle thought them so radical in regard to the Bill that he thought he would have to rule them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We listened to a very long and interesting speech from the Taoiseach on this group of amendments. It seemed to me, listening very carefully to what the Taoiseach said, that he was willing to give an approbation to, and expressed himself in agreement with, a very noble sentiment but that when it came to honouring this sentiment he proceeded in exactly the opposite direction to that in which the sentiment pointed.  That is an old characteristic of the Taoiseach in political matters.  For instance, when he was recommending <Col N="1148" /> the £7,000,000 loan to the nation, he expressed himself in these words and the words are quoted now in relation to this Bill because they indicate that while the Taoiseach is prepared to defend the introduction of the Bill, he has no faith whatever in the Bill and no belief whatever that it is going to relieve any of our problems.  The Taoiseach said on that occasion, using words that appear prophetic now in the light of the terms of this Bill:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am a believer in the right of the public authority to control credit.  Yet I am very doubtful whether the public authority in its control of credit can do a great deal better than is being done at present. I do believe the Government will establish a central bank but when that is done I do not think we shall, by any means, have discovered the philosopher's stone.  We shall have to face the same difficulties we are facing now.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says in effect that, while he believes in public control of credit, he does not believe that it would bring any great improvement in present conditions.  The Government can bring in a Central Bank Bill that will be recommended to the country by the Minister for Finance but the Taoiseach who believes in the public control of credit will not provide for that in the Bill.  He also does not believe that a Central Bank Bill is going to have any effect in regard to relieving our difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that statement of the Taoiseach should not be put in as a preamble to the Central Bank Bill or put on a tombstone over the central bank.  In any case, it is well worthy of repetition because it indicates something more important than may be merely said in the cut and thrust of debate, that the Taoiseach has no use for a central bank <Col N="1149" /> and, in fact, committed himself to a declaration that all our difficulties will remain after it has been established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He sees no necessity for a central bank, but on a Central Bank Bill we are necessarily constrained to discuss the question of a central bank and its relations to public policy from a monetary standpoint. Whatever merit might be in a Central Bank Bill which had for its object the conservation of the country's assets, of course such a Bill had not a dog's chance of being introduced in present circumstances.  We could discuss the question of the repatriation of capital, and we could say that we are going to achieve that by a transfer of goods from the country in which the capital is invested; but what is the use of discussing these things when your assets in these countries are completely frozen, when you cannot repatriate a single note and when your £300,000,000 invested abroad would not buy a bunch of bananas in the present circumstances?  That is the cold fact you are up against.  What is the use of talking about repatriation of assets in present circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get a present of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the war is over you may not think that present is so valuable.  To talk about repatriation of capital in present circumstances is to discuss an economic issue which has no reality for the people.  The fact is that you are exporting more goods to Britain than you are importing.  Britain can chalk up credits in London in respect of these goods, but these credits are so frozen that we cannot repatriate the assets which they represent. If Britain happens to lose the war, these foreign assets of ours will be just worthless, as other countries found to their cost after the last war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aside from all question of repatriation of capital, is it not a fact that the most vital thing for our people to-day is the control of credit?  There is no more vital issue before the people. <Col N="1150" /> There is no activity in our national life which more intimately affects the lives of our people than the issue of credit, the expansion or the restriction of credit, and that is so because of the fact that the wages envelope is still the passport to food, to clothes and to shelter.  If credit, its expansion and restriction, plays such an important part in the lives of our people, surely it is highly desirable that there should be some State control over the issue of credit, over the regulation of credit and the equation of credit to economic needs?  We have a declaration from the Taoiseach that he believes in public control of credit, but there is no provision for public control of credit in this Bill.  The Government, as Deputy Davin pointed out, have created a central bank and are giving wide powers to a directorate of nine, but so far as the interpretation of the Bill is concerned, the Government have no power whatever to influence the policy of that bank except in so far as it might be influenced by Section 6 or by Section 45.  It seems to me that the second portion of Section 6 is completely vitiated by the conditions governing the exercise of the powers directed towards promoting the welfare of the public.  Section 45, which might perhaps have caused some little stir amongst the banks in the early stages, must by now, after they have heard the Taoiseach's view of the matter, have lost all its terrors for them.</P>
    <P>If we criticise banking it is not because we wish to criticise the directors of banks.  They may all be estimable people.  They may be all highly desirable citizens.  Nobody desires to make any reflection upon them personally.  Our criticism is directed, not to bankers as such, not to directors of banks as such, but to the method which is operated under our present system of joint stock banks in this country, and so long as credit is a vital necessity to the people of this country it seems to me that an unanswerable case can be made for the nationalisation of credit and for the nationalisation of banking in this country.  Nobody need be alarmed at that.  The State in this country nationalised the supply of electricity, <Col N="1151" /> and while the supply of electricity is an important activity in our national life it is not as valuable or as important in our national life as the issue and control of credit.</P>
    <P>The State has virtually nationalised sugar production.  It even went so far as to nationalise the production of industrial alcohol.  If the State can enter into the manufacture of alcohol from old potatoes and regard that as a beneficent State activity, surely it is still more vital to nationalise banking credit and the provision of banking facilities in this country.  Nobody can question that the State can buy out the assets of the existing banks or that it can operate a national bank in which the depositors will be given all the security that the State can give, and if the State itself, acting through the Government, is not capable of ensuring the safety of deposits, then there is no other authority within the State that is capable of ensuring the safety of deposits. Nobody, therefore, ought to be alarmed at a proposal to nationalise banking in this country, and it is only through its complete nationalisation and its operation as a Government agency&mdash;perhaps, not necessarily, as a Government agency, but as a Parliamentary agency&mdash;that you can get effective control over banking in this country.  I do not blame bankers if they pursue a conservative policy in respect of the lending of other people's money.  Their functions do not lie in the direction in which some people imagine these functions do lie, but the plain fact of the matter to-day is that if any person wants credit he inevitably has to go to the bank for it.  He goes, therefore, to a private institution which is concerned, primarily, with selling money at the highest price, and that is the only place where he can get credit facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we not the Industrial Credit Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  I think the general opinion is that the ordinary banking facilities are much more satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, let us examine these two.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach ever made an application to <Col N="1152" /> the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My only purpose in intervening was so that the Deputy might understand my point.  My point is this: What great advantage does he see that is going to arise from nationalisation?  The same need will be there for securing loans, and so on, as there would be in other cases, and would the private individuals, who wish to borrow, be much better off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that in a moment.  Everybody who has had any experience of the Agricultural Credit Corporation knows that it is almost impossible to get a loan from them unless you are in fairly well-to-do circumstances.  You must not owe any rates or any annuities, and you must not have grocers' or traders' accounts outstanding; in other words, you must start off by being pretty well in funds, and then you have to have security, but that is not the type of facility which meets the needs of farmers, as we know farmers in this country.  With regard to the Industrial Credit Company, while, I think, it is a kind of a State underwriting house, nevertheless it acts in such a way as if it were really a privately financed house because, there again, while it is created through State money and while its directors are State nominees, its main concern all the time is to ensure that there is a substantial return in respect of its investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us, however, get back to the position of the banks.  A bank's main concern is to lend money to a person at the highest possible price.  Its main concern is to lend money at that high price, provided that it can get reasonable security, and I suggest to the Taoiseach that if he and I were to go into any branch of a bank in Dublin&mdash; he to go in with a proposal to erect a casino, to which fancy prices of admission would be charged, and which, because of the craze of people for betting and gambling, was likely to pay a dividend of 20 per cent., and associated with the board of which there would probably be a number of people who had the reputation of being able to put over &ldquo;quick ones&rdquo; on the public from the point of view of earning profits; <Col N="1153" /> and I to go into the same bank with the belief, fortified by geological reports and borings, that there was coal to be found in a certain portion of the country, and that coal was a vital necessity for our people in present circumstances since we could get no coal into the country, but that my project had the drawback that I could not offer very much security, that I could not be sure of paying a dividend for five years, except, perhaps, a fragmentary dividend, but that my project was granted to be a worth-while national activity, faced though it might be with a period of hard work before we would see any substantial results&mdash;I think that when we both came out from the bank the Taoiseach would be able to tell me that he got away with his application for a loan for his casino, whereas I&mdash;and he would probably commiserate with me on the fact that my proposition was not as attractive as his, and, therefore, I had been refused&mdash;would not have got away with my application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will examine that down to its foundation he will get a lot of useful information on it.  Why is it that the casino is going to pay and, therefore, give a return? It is because the individuals in the community are prepared to give what they have earned&mdash;in other words, their labour&mdash;in order to get these particular amusements, and if the State thinks that these things are not desirable and that they should not be done, its way of dealing with the matter should be the direct way of closing the casinos.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing there is not what will happen to the casino, but what will happen to the coal.  At any rate, I take it that we accept the position that the Taoiseach thinks he would have a better chance of getting away with the loan for the casino scheme than I would have for my coal project.  I take it that we agree that if the proposal looks attractive from the point of view of the banks, the loan will be granted, whereas the coal proposal would look just as black as the substance itself.</P>

      <P>All I know is that I was told earlier that the Chief Opposition would not agree.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly prepared to have the House meet on Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us clear the matter up now as to whether we are to meet on Tuesday or Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House desires, I agree to meet on Wednesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the suggestion to meet on Tuesday came from the chief Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed the usual procedure.  At any time that I have been in charge of the business of the House I usually act in consultation with the Parliamentary Secretary, and I do not think I have ever failed to convenience the Opposition, and Deputy Cosgrave more than anybody in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never asked any concession of any kind, either from the Minister or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;concession&rdquo;; I said &ldquo;convenience&rdquo;. The Deputy knows that he asked that this Bill should be put back a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is a matter of public business, not a matter of my private convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking that we should not meet next Tuesday, is not that a matter of public business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for Deputy Cosgrave's convenience that we are dropping Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is for Deputy Norton's convenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am quite agreeable for the next meeting to take place on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.35 p.m., until 3 p.m., Wednesday, 29th April.</P>
