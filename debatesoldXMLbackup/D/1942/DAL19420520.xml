    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in view of the need for increasing the production of turf he will consider if provision can be made for the making of advances to owners of turf banks willing to employ labour for turf production to enable them to pay wages, etc., on condition that the sums advanced will be repaid out of the proceeds of the sale of turf in the autumn; and, if so, whether he will state what proposals are in contemplation for giving effect to this intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence of the need for a scheme of advances of the kind suggested by the Deputy, nor is there reason to believe that the volume of production is hampered by the lack of financial measures of the kind suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) if he will state the powers conferred on the county surveyor in Meath enabling him to acquire bogs for the purpose of his turf scheme or for sub-letting and the conditions under which such powers are exercised; whether he is aware that (b) in the case of Rathmore Bog, Athboy, County Meath, the county surveyor has exercised the powers vested in him to sub-let without the permission or approval of the turbary owners a number of turf <Col N="2324" /> banks; (c) that these turbary owners are in most cases small farmers who derive their livelihood for the most part from cutting and selling turf; (d) that they are not permitted to cut their turf in these bogs until the people to whom the banks are sub-let by the county surveyor have saved a crop of turf, and that (e) it is alleged by the turbary owners that the action taken by the county surveyor in this case amounts almost to the confiscation of their property, and whether he will say if the county surveyor is acting under direction from and with the approval of the Minister's Department in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers referred to are those contained in Articles 3 and 6 respectively of Emergency Powers (No. 73) Order, 1941, which were delegated to the county surveyor by the county council in accordance with Section 73 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  The owners' permission or approval to the sub-letting by the county surveyor of bogs so acquired is not necessary.</P>
      <P>The general position appears to be that last year the county surveyor acquired a large bog, of which the bog mentioned by the Deputy forms part. The turbary owners referred to were not in any way prevented from cutting turf last year and the county surveyor has informed me that no turf bank was or would be sub-let by him where the owner was himself prepared to undertake intensive production.  Up to the present the bulk of the turbary owners have taken no steps to arrange the matter with the county surveyor. There are approximately 100 turbary owners involved and sub-lettings were made by the county surveyor to other people in only four cases.</P>
      <P>The turbary owners in the Rathmore bog are not generally regarded as persons deriving their livelihood for the most part from the cutting and selling of turf and it is presumed that if they were such persons they would have long since arranged to cut the necessary turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the four cases where sub-lettings were made, one is proceeding by <Col N="2325" /> arrangement with the former owner, the letting in another case has been cancelled, and in the remaining two cases the licences have been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>If the turbary owners show the county surveyor that they are willing and anxious to take early steps to cut the turf they will be afforded every facility by him.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Food Rations at Turf Camps.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the ration of food allowed at each meal to persons who will be employed on the Government turf camp schemes and the hours at which the meals are served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale of rations to be provided for workers employed on the Government turf camp schemes has not been finally settled, but it may be taken that the present ration is fully adequate in quantity and quality.  It is, however, subject to variation in relation to limitations imposed by emergency conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rations on the existing scale are provided for workers who are housed in the reconstructed buildings at Newbridge <Col N="2327" /> and Edenderry, which are situated at such distances from the bogs as to render impracticable the provision of a midday dinner.  It has, therefore, been necessary to provide a luncheon on the bog at midday and dinner in the evening.  These cases are exceptional and when the camps situated close to the bogs are available for the housing of workers, arrangements suitable to and possible under the new conditions will be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the ration at Newbridge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I do not want to set the ration out in detail at the moment because it is in process of variation.  I have brought one whole day's ration for a man and that is in my office now for the inspection of any Deputy who wants to satisfy himself that it is, in fact, full and adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. What I want is to ascertain the ration that is provided for those turf workers. We are surely entitled to some information on that point, seeing that the scheme is a Government scheme.  The Minister quoted the ration for me recently.  He appeared to be in possession of all the information about the tation.  If he could quote the ration for me privately, surely the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be able to give me the information I require now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may have the ration for himself. What I want at the moment is to get some information as to what the ration really is.  What is the difficulty about getting that information?  A Parliamentary question is all that is required to get information as to what the ration for a soldier is.  If a Minister is in a position to produce information with regard to the ration of turf workers, why is it not possible for a Deputy to get information on the same subject?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister gave information about the ration to the Deputy confidentially.  I am not prepared at the moment to publish that particular information, because, as I have said, the ration is in a state of change.  That, I think, is a good reason.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that following the announcement in the Press on the 13th May that he is prepared to grant licences for the import of fabrics without reference to type or price where these goods arrive in this country by the 30th June, 1942, importers have placed orders for goods offered to them by suppliers in Great Britain; and if he will state whether, if the goods so ordered fail to arrive by the 30th June, it is his intention to require the importers to return the goods to Great Britain if they do not come within the descriptions and the price limits already imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to assume that the statement in the first part of the Deputy's question is not correct.  As to the second part of the question, the announcement to which the Deputy refers warned importers that, in the case of fabrics not conforming to the descriptions and price limits previously announced, orders should not be placed, without prior consultation with my Department, unless delivery by the 30th June, 1942, was assured.  Subject to satisfactory arrangements being made to avoid a loss of supplies, it will be necessary to require the return to Great Britain of goods which are outside the published descriptions and price limits and which have been ordered without consultation with my Department if they arrive after the <Col N="2330" /> 30th June or such other date as may be determined.

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he received from Miss Sheehan, Main Street, Charleville, County Cork, a complaint regarding her inability to obtain the tea ration to which she is entitled; whether he is aware that on February 28th last the grocer with whom she was registered returned Miss Sheehan's tea ration card and refused to continue supplying her with tea; whether he is further aware that Miss Sheehan failed to obtain tea elsewhere in the town and that consequently since February last seven people, including four young children, were unable to obtain any tea whatever and that for more than two months they have received no sugar; whether two letters addressed to his Department by Miss Sheehan remain unanswered and that it was only when she sent a letter by registered post that she received any acknowledgment from his Department; whether, in the Department's reply, Miss Sheehan was informed that it was up to herself to find a grocer in Charleville to supply her with tea, and whether he can now state if a local grocer is willing to take up Miss Sheehan's tea ration card he will make an allocation of three and a half ounces of tea per week to such grocer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that Emergency Powers (Conditional Sale of Commodities) Order, 1942, will operate to transfer available supplies of sewing thread into the hands of speculators and leave stocks of textiles unsaleable on drapers' hands when they have no thread to sell with cloth; and, if so, whether he will exclude sewing thread from this Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the information at present available to my Department I cannot agree that the Order will have the effect anticipated by the Deputy, and I can therefore see no sufficient reason why sewing thread should be excluded from the Order as suggested. I have received no representations from any section of the trade which would support the view put forward in the Deputy's question.  Should such representations be received, they will be given full consideration in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in country towns it is now becoming a common practice for persons to send children into a shop one after another to buy one or two spools of thread, some of which, at least, I believe are being sold at enhanced prices elsewhere; that his Order, as it at present stands, appears to place an obligation on the trader who has stocks of thread to give it to those customers?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The trader is not entitled to say, &ldquo;I will not sell you thread unless you require it to sew cloth which I know you purchased&rdquo;.  He is bound to sell thread if they ask for it.  If that goes on, people will buy the thread from the law-abiding draper at twopence a reel and, when they clear his stocks, they will proceed to sell it on the black market at 4d. or 5d., and the draper will have no thread, particularly coloured thread, to offer with <Col N="2336" /> the textiles which he desires to sell. Surely that is not reasonable.  It is perfectly fair for the draper to say, &ldquo;I will not sell you a blue spool if you have not bought a blue textile, because you cannot possibly want it&rdquo;.  Surely that is reasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order to which the Deputy refers in his question is an Order which prohibits the sale of any commodity being conditional on the sale of another commodity or service. In the case of thread, there may be grounds for a draper relating his sales of thread to his sales of material, but there are circumstances in which people might quite legitimately require thread without requiring material. The only thing the Order does is to prohibit the sale of thread being made conditional on the sale of some other goods.  It does not prohibit the trader from exercising his discretion in the matter of the sale of thread to particular customers if he is satisfied that the limited stocks available can be allocated amongst his customers upon some reasonable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister realise that the Order draws the man who wants to obey the law into the danger of breaking the law?  A person may come in and ask for a reel of thread and the merchant may say: &ldquo;I cannot sell you thread, my stocks are going low.&rdquo;  The customer returns in half-an-hour and buys from another assistant ten yards of lawn and the assistant may say: &ldquo;I will give you a reel of thread.&rdquo;  That customer has been refused thread when he asked for it at noon, and at half-past twelve, because he bought cloth, is given thread which, immediately, <i>prima facie,</i> establishes the fact that the merchant has made it a condition of selling thread that he would sell cloth.  I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for the merchant to do.  Will the Minister accept this question as a representation from an unorganised section of the drapers' community to have the merits of this case investigated?</P>

      <P>The Corporation of Dublin in pursuance of Section 20 of the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, have made preliminary orders for the acquisition of portion of the damaged area at the North Strand in connection with the planning scheme proposed for the city.

If her son had been killed by a motor car, under the ordinary law she could have sued the owner of the motor car and got something analogous to what that boy had been paying her and would have continued to pay her throughout her life.  Does the Minister believe that any section of this Oireachtas wants to see that woman put into the county home in County Louth because her son came home to serve the country?  If he does not believe that, will he take some steps by special resolution, legislation or in some other way, to ensure that the reward for throwing up a job in England and coming home to help your country in an emergency will not be that your mother will be thrown into the workhouse if you happen to die in the course of duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Lands has been rather disappointing.  I was struck by the tendency that Deputies showed to deal with constituency matters. However much one might understand that tendency in normal times, there would scarcely seem to be any necessity for it now.  One would imagine that Deputies understood the position generally regarding land purchase operations and the work of the Land Commission.  So far back as November, 1939, I explained to the House, in reply to a question by Deputy Norton, that the Land Commission was confining itself to actual commitments, that it was not proposed to undertake new acquisition proceedings, that a very considerable amount of land was in process of acquisition or was about to be acquired, and that <Col N="2348" /> I felt that to deal with that would give the Land Commission ample work, possibly for a period of years, in any case for a substantial period.  Deputies are aware of the fact that considerable numbers of officers have been taken away from the Department to deal with other work.  I find that we are short of no less than 371 officers.  There are some branches of the Department, like the collection branch, which must remain at their normal strength; otherwise it would be quite impossible to carry on essential work such as that branch performs in collecting portion of the national revenue.</P>
      <P>The position now is worse, so far as staff is concerned, than it was when I advised the House early in the emergency that we should have considerably to restrict our operations because in addition to the large increase in the numbers we have lost, our outdoor staff, of course, has considerable difficulty in attending to its work owing to transport restrictions. As regards the actual work of land resettlement, it is very difficult to procure building materials with the result that we find it very difficult now to continue our migration schemes.  I am hopeful it will be possible to continue them even on a very restricted scale, but the difficulties of the time make it very hard to carry out any form of housing scheme at present.  Deputies know that.  I need only say, therefore, that new commitments are out of the question.  There is a Government decision that no new commitments can be entered into at the present time and we are confined, apart from the actual day to day work, to very urgent cases of turbary or afforestation work.  We are trying to acquire land for afforestation purposes; the Land Commission plays an important part in that work.  A considerable amount of the land acquired for that purpose comes through the channels of the Land Commission.  Then as regards turbary and the development of our peat resources, the Land Commission is a very important agency also. As Deputies know, it spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in the exploitation of our bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2349" /> In spite of the difficulties of the times very important work has been done. Last year, as I pointed out, no less than 22,000 acres were divided and allotted. In addition to that, migration work has been carried on.  Only intimate acquaintance with migration work can give Deputies a knowledge and understanding of the tremendous difficulties entailed in having tenants removed from one part of the country to another and carrying out all the small details connected with such schemes.  Turbary has been attended to very well by the Land Commission.  It has concentrated particularly on it since the war and the result is shown in the fact that last year the country generally benefited.  Parish councils and private individuals were able to take advantage of the offer the Land Commission had made to lease bogs.  We had a large number of lettings.  That is quite apart from the actual work of making bog roads, etc., which has been going on for years and which still continues.  I think, in the first place, it is not worthy of Deputies to suggest that the Land Commission is not doing some work which lies there to hand.  The position has been explained over and over again, that operations are very restricted and that there are very good reasons for that, the chief one being shortage of staff.  Secondly, no appreciation seems to be shown of the fact that the Land Commission is in the nature of a huge public office where, quite apart from the work of acquiring and allotting land, a tremendous amount of business is daily going on in which the public is greatly interested.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that we have, I suppose, more than 500,000 receivable orders coming into the Land Commission. There are 400,000 vested and 70,000 unvested tenants.  Even if only a small proportion of those write in about matters affecting them, Deputies will see the considerable amount of work that arises.  As the matter has arisen, perhaps I should give the House, so that it may appear in the Official Debates, some account of the type of work that falls normally to the Land Commission, and which Deputies seem entirely to forget about.</P>
    <P>The primary work of the Land Commission was the transfer of the land to <Col N="2350" /> Irish tenant purchasers.  Later on under an Irish Government it undertook what a great many people considered to be the revolutionary policy of land division and resettlement. Quite apart from what the Land Commission has been asked to perform by successive Irish Governments, it is also carrying on other very important work.  I think no Department of the State has such a wide range or such complex activities to account for.  As will be seen from the list, they are of a technical nature. Take the Acquisition and Resales Division, where at present we have less than half the normal staff.  A considerable portion of the work there deals with re-sale.  It is assumed when land is taken over by the Land Commission that everything is completed.  Actually about two-thirds of the work of the re-sale section is in respect of matters which only arise after schemes have been actually put into operation. Matters have to be dealt with arising out of correspondence or otherwise and, in many cases, if not dealt with would cause considerable loss to the State or to individual tenants.  In many cases they may be regarded as matters of urgency.  If the Land Commission did not take steps to deal with them legal proceedings might be instituted against it.  These include failure to take up immediately parcels of land, which are to be surrendered on exchange, so that income from the surrendered land is provided by allotment or otherwise; failure to follow up warning notices to tenants who are not working holdings; failure to follow up collection of cash payments which may have to be paid in one sum or by instalments, non-payment of rates which may lead to seizure of stock belonging to allottees or persons to whom the Land Commission let land, the termination of employment and stoppage of wages, of herds, caretakers, etc.</P>
    <P>There are claims constantly arising about flooding, trespass, and injury to animals, stated to be due to Land Commission neglect and likely to lead to legal proceedings.  In the acquisition of rights of way compensation has often to be paid and certain legal steps taken.  Claims for compensation for <Col N="2351" /> malicious injuries have to be made within a certain date.  Claims may be made by owners of land for interest on purchase money, if possession is not taken on the date fixed.  Any delay in the completion of exchanges may result in proceedings being taken against the Land Commission, as migrants may claim that they could not have any dealings in connection with the land until the new holdings were vested.  Claims against purchase money by the Land Commission may not be entertained if not entered in good time.  There are also applications by allottees to divide land and applications by boards of health for apportionment of annuities arising out of the acquisition of labourers' plots.  In cases of dispute between tenants and the board, this may involve legal proceedings so that inquiries have to be made and instructions issued.  Where rights of way or water rights are disputed, it may be essential to make orders.  Poor rates and drainage maintenance rates have to be apportioned and the demands identified. There are also applications for building assistance, for information from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and from old age pension and from unemployment assistance authorities. There are various other matters, including applications from inspectors for sanction in connection with new improvement works, or additional sanction in connection with works already undertaken.  That is only portion of the work of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In the Purchase branch, where revesting of land is carried on, we are at present down to almost one-third of our normal staff.  It is a very important branch, and in normal times we would have more than enough work to do in carrying on the revesting of tenancies, which has been going on extremely slowly, even though the tenants are not at any financial loss.  Nevertheless, every tenant would like to see vesting carried out, so that he became complete and full legal owner of his land.  Until revesting is completed, tenants will not be in that position. Even in the state of affairs which <Col N="2352" /> existed before the outbreak of war, it was obvious that a great many years would elapse before that work would be completed.  It has had to be laid aside owing to the shortage of staff, but that has not reduced the work of the Purchase branch to the extent that one would imagine, because the following matters have to be dealt with: flooding, erosion, turbary, embankment trust, drainage trust, resumption cases.  We had complaints of resumption cases not being dealt with, but that is only one of the many duties of this branch, which is endeavouring to get these cases heard and a decision come to so that tenants will know where they are. It deals with purchase money of holdings, over £3,000 in value, sub-division and sub-letting, revesting, miscellaneous correspondence, housing assistance, sporting and fishing rights and re-arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputies have no doubt seen the map that I have had hung in the hall showing the rearrangement of the Palmer Estate.  That was one of many hundreds of such cases.  It was referred to in the House on many occasions and is only an example of the type of very intricate and technical work that the Land Commission has been doing. That particular case was going on for years, almost for generations, but has now been completed.  Applications for admission of land to the purchase provisions of the Land Acts are not all completed.  The purchase branch also deals with estates or, even with individual holdings in which numbers of people may be concerned, where sub-letting may be carried on to a great extent.  Recently, owing to difficulties which had arisen about commonages held by numerous tenants, 30 to 40 in one case, it became necessary to call for a report covering 340 holdings in a single group.  Any attempt to deal with them and to settle all the questions arising from the commonages takes up a considerable amount of time of the limited staff we have.  In turbary schemes, regulations have to be made, and the allotments have to be made in the same legal manner and completed satisfactorily so that no question can arise subsequently, exactly as in the case of arable land which is being allotted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" /> In this particular case there are four sub-divisions, and other actions pending, and it has been found desirable, as I have said, to take up a report covering 340 holdings.  In another case, on 19 of 34 holdings affected by a turbary scheme there are sub-tenancies which have to be dealt with.  A further scheme involves 45 other holdings on one of the most difficult estates in the country.  The surveyor concerned, in order to complete these turbary schemes, has made numerous amendments in boundaries, and so on, but the consents of the tenants have not been obtained.  There are numerous sub-tenancies, co-tenancies, and claims to tenancies, and in fact there is a good-sized job of estate work of a most difficult nature to be done before the turbary end of the matter can be tackled.  It may be mentioned in this connection that the solicitor insists on due authority being given by way of amending particulars or otherwise before proceeding with the work.</P>
    <P>Those who have responsibility for the operations of the Land Commission have to see, not alone that the rights of the tenants are safeguarded, but that everything is proper from the legal point of view, so that costly litigation will not follow.  There are hundreds of cases&mdash;perhaps thousands&mdash;of board of health plots throughout the country, in all of which the particular board of health is trying to get the plots vested so as to have the matter finally dealt with from the legal point of view. That, in itself, although only one of the many activities of this Purchase branch, takes up an enormous amount of time.  I myself had an example of a case where a Deputy came to me about a holding in connection with which he said correspondence had been going on for years: there was a large number of people involved and they were suffering disabilities, legal and otherwise, through the fact that this matter was not being dealt with. When it was taken up in the Department it was found that there were actually 57 sub-tenancies on the one holding, so that to deal with even that single case will take a very considerable time.  Another case that we have had in County Roscommon concerns an <Col N="2354" /> estate of 180 holdings, and the office has to settle questions of rights of way; no less than 19 rights of way, apparently, for the tenants with holdings on that estate, have to be dealt with.  The whole tendency in debates on the Land Commission is to concentrate on the acquisition and re-sale of land, as if the entire work of the Land Commission was concerned with that, while no regard is had to the very valuable work that I have outlined, which is going on from day to day and in which thousands of tenants are involved&mdash;work that has to be carried out and which, if not carried out, may be the cause of grievous loss to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I suggest, should bear in mind that the Land Commission is carrying out, I venture to say, a larger amount of the everyday business of the community&mdash;certainly, of the rural community&mdash;than perhaps any other Department of State; that it is contributing to the essential national work of fuel supply, for example; and yet we hear very little about these activities. It is carrying out the administration of work on embankments, and dealing with questions arising from flooding, and, generally, as well as a tremendous amount of correspondence, it has, owing to its peculiar history, a huge number of obligations, running into hundreds of thousands of cases.  It has this large number of legal obligations to perform, and when it appears that matters have to be attended to they very often call for a detailed inquiry by the inspector on the spot and, as I have said, for treatment by well-trained and long experienced officials in the office.</P>
    <P>So, I think that the criticism we have heard is quite unjust, and simply arises from the fact, if Deputies are serious about it, which I doubt very much, that they just come in here, not knowing exactly what they are going to say but feeling that, perhaps, this is an appropriate debate in which they may say something of possible interest to their constituents.  Whether what they say is correct or not, or whether it is based on actual knowledge of the conditions under which the Department <Col N="2355" /> is working at present, does not seem to bother them.  I was glad, however, to hear from Deputies like Deputy Brennan that there is at any rate a body of opinion in the House which fully realises the important work that the officers of the Land Commission have been doing, not only now, but for many years past.  As I said, nearly the entire land of this country has been transferred to the tenant purchasers of Ireland through the work of that Department.  Under Irish Governments, that Department has divided over 1,000,000 acres of land, and planted people on that land; far more than was done, of course, in the long history of the Department under the British Government.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, at any rate, that there should be recognition of that work.  It is heroic work, extending over generations, beyond the time of most Deputies in this House, and certainly beyond their public lives.  But instead of acquainting the people of the country and their constituents with what has been done even in recent years, there is a most regrettable tendency, which I should like to condemn as strongly as I can, to blame the Land Commission for not doing things which Deputies know are quite impossible. If Deputies think that they could have been done, then I suggest to them that they lack honesty in the matter.  We are a democratic Government and a democratic Legislature, and one would imagine that an important Department of this kind should get credit for the work it is doing. One would imagine, in fact, that in the times that exist in the world at present, Deputies would go out of their way to maintain the prestige and credit of State institutions like the Land Commission, which is carrying out a national policy, and the officers of which have no interest whatever except to carry out that policy in accordance with the instructions given them by the responsible Government.  Should there be another Government in office next year or the year after, the Land Commission officials will carry out the duties allotted to them by that Government <Col N="2356" /> with the same fidelity as they have done under this Government and its predecessors, and I think it is a scandalous state of affairs that at this time in our history we should have Deputies, not alone getting up here in this House, but actually going out in public and identifying themselves with agitations in which it is sought to be argued that some &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; influence, antagonistic to the real interests of the Irish people, exists in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is no foundation whatever for that accusation, and it is surprising that people can be got even to whisper it, but we know that people whisper very strange things indeed.  I want to state here, with all the authority that I can, that the Irish Land Commission, like every other Government Department, is run by Irishmen, officers of an Irish Government, and that they have no interest whatever in political or other questions except to carry out the duties that are allotted to them, to carry out the policy of the Government.  It is regrettable that we should have these charges made when we could have a satisfactory debate. If Deputies had a proper appreciation of what the Land Commission has done, we might have had a fairly satisfactory debate on the lines of some of the worth-while speeches that we have heard, urging a reconsideration of the whole question of land resettlement and trying to approach the thing from the point of view of what our future difficulties are likely to be, of how this whole question of land resettlement will have to be viewed after the war, and how it will have to be regarded in view of any changes that may take place in our agricultural economy, for example, or in our external trade.  These speeches would, at any rate, indicate that some Deputies are giving thought to the after-war position, while others seem to be content to get up and raise some petty local questions which were such a feature of the debate on this Estimate some years ago.  We hear it said that the average man in the country cannot understand why the Land Commission is not doing this, <Col N="2357" /> that and the other, and why it cannot always give decisions in the way that the local Deputy would like.  I am sure nobody would have anything but contempt for the Land Commission, from the judicial side of it down to the humblest inspector, if it were its policy to do as Deputies required.  Surely, the duty of the Land Commission is to carry out the policy given to it by the Government without fear or favour, without partisanship and without regard to political affiliations.</P>
    <P>The average man in the country can scarcely be blamed for not understanding why the Land Commission, in present circumstances, no matter how much it might desire to do so, cannot re-start the whole policy of land division, which it dropped at the beginning of the war, if the ordinary Deputies of this House, or those we heard speak in the debate, do not seem to understand it.  The fact is that the work of the Land Commission has to be done thoroughly.  It has to be done in a way that, when the tenant is put into occupation of his holding, everything is settled and no question will arise.  The Land Commission prides itself, and rightly so, on the fact that it has been able to do that work satisfactorily, and out of the thousands and thousands of cases that have gone through very little difficulty has arisen because everything has been done properly, legally and carefully. If you want to do things carefully and properly then the work will take time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers raised a number of questions such, for example, as the size of holdings.  It is the policy of the Government to create on such land as can be acquired by the Land Commission the maximum number of economic holdings. It is the view of the Land Commission&mdash;it has a long experience on this matter and its view has been accepted by the Government and it is also the opinion of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;that over most of the country, outside the really congested districts, a holding to be economic in present conditions should contain about 25 statute acres of good arable land. That is the policy that is being worked <Col N="2358" /> by the Land Commission.  Deputy Childers asked why would not the Land Commission spend more money on improving the land divided, on repairing field drains, for example, on improving pasture grasses and so on so as to bring the land up to the level of the best land around the land that is being divided. Well, of course, one difficulty is finance. The Land Commission, even with its present duties, is one of the most costly Departments of State.  A considerable amount of its expenditure on improvement works is irrecoverable.  We may take it that if it were to undertake further improvements of the kind envisaged by Deputy Childers, a greatly increased financial burden would be thrown on the State in respect of Land Commission operations.  Most of this expenditure, I believe, would be irrecoverable, and, naturally, it could not be confined to the divided land.  The tenants on the adjoining lands, who purchased their holdings long ago, would demand to know why these particular advantages should be denied to them, so that eventually all tenants would, presumably, participate in this land improvement scheme that the Deputy has in mind.  It should be borne in mind that a great deal of the land that the Land Commission is dividing, and has divided, is not by any means inferior land.  It is very often some of the best land in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of flooding, and Deputy Curran referred to particular cases on the banks of the Suir.  In all these cases the Land Commission is anxious to be as helpful as possible.  It has spent thousands and thousands of pounds on the repair of embankments to help tenants whose lands were damaged. Every case is gone into carefully, and frequently other Departments, such, for example, as the Board of Works, are brought in.  The trouble is that in a great number of these cases it would be utterly uneconomic to spend the amount of money that would be necessary to mend matters.  We can only hope that, when the findings of the recent Drainage Commission are implemented in law, and when national machinery is set up, it will be possible to deal with the drainage matters that <Col N="2359" /> Deputies are interested in&mdash;Deputy Curran in particular&mdash;and that it will be on the basis of a national scheme. In any case, I would like to inform Deputy Curran that the Land Commission has decided to take no action with regard to the Tybroghney embankments, and that further consideration of the matter must await the proposed drainage legislation.  As regards Portlaw, the Land Commission is not responsible for the repair of these embankments, but is considering what assistance it will give.  Already, a considerable amount has been spent, and the land is already charged with advances to repay part of the expenditure. There is a limit, therefore, to the amount of money which the Land Commission can advance for the drainage of such lands, not anything like what could be done under a national scheme covering a wide area and having a large number of tenants participating. Embankments are a problem, and always will be a problem, so that it would be quite impossible for the Department of Lands to satisfy all Deputies and all owners in the matter. It has always tried to do its best with the staff at its disposal, and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of financial restriction.  When the decisions that I mentioned in my opening remarks were made about restricting operations, the Land Commission had commitments for very large sums of money.  But new commitments, as I say, have been excluded and, even in the case of urgent matters which fall to be dealt with, there will naturally be the question whether the scheme is economic and whether, even if it is, in present circumstances the Exchequer can provide the necessary money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers raised the question also of an inquiry into the results of land division and I think it was referred to by other speakers.  I should like to say that personally I would welcome such an inquiry, but I fear that at present the Land Commission have not the staff, nor have they the time nor the opportunity to carry out such an inquiry in the way we would <Col N="2360" /> wish.  I have indicated that, no matter how we are restricted with regard to new commitments, we have old commitments, and not only in respect of the actual acquisition and re-sale of land; we have obligations and commitments to all the tenants throughout the country.  We have to attend to their business, and it comes to a huge volume every day.  We have no staff to set free for the purpose of making the investigation and I fear that the time could not be spared.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Agriculture has been contemplating setting up an inquiry to deal with the question of agriculture after the war; to get a small number of experts to consider on what lines or in what way our agricultural policy should be shaped and what changes may be necessary to meet after-the-war conditions. Such an inquiry, if it be held, may give us some lines of approach to the problem of land resettlement.  In any case it must be borne in mind that a huge amount of work has been done. Over 1,750,000 acres of land have been acquired and divided by the State authority; over 1,000,000 since the Irish Government was established. Therefore, as Deputies will realise, a very large proportion of the available land of the country has been already dealt with.  Great inroads have been made on whatever reserves of land might be claimed to be necessary for dealing with this problem, and I think that in a comparatively short period of years it ought to be possible to complete it.</P>
    <P>We must remember that some years ago when the present Government came into office the whole problem was examined from a legal point of view with a view to seeing what steps would be necessary in order to continue the work of land division in the most thorough-going fashion.  No expense was spared in carrying out that policy.  Large additional staffs were taken in to have it carried through and new legislation was passed.  Although the acquisition of land, has perhaps been made easier, we must remember that we are no longer dealing with the old landlords; <Col N="2361" /> we are dealing with our own people, and unless we try to treat them fairly, and even generously from the State point of view, they are likely to contest every inch of ground, to take advantage of every possible legal avenue that is open to them to contest the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Very large amounts of land have been taken over and while, as I say, perhaps the actual acquisition has been simplified, distribution has not been simplified. It is still a highly delicate, highly technical problem.  Every individual scheme raises its own host of difficulties, all of which have to be settled by the staff of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I think most Deputies feel, whether they have given expression to the feeling or not, that in most cases the Land Commission inspectors have carried out their work fairly, without fear or favour, in putting these schemes into operation.  We had amending Acts; we had the first amending Act passed by the present Government in 1933 and we had that amended in 1936 and 1939 in order to clarify and put beyond dispute the compulsory powers of the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition of untenanted land and the resumption of tenanted land for division.  Deputies will remember the discussions and the controversies they gave rise to.  But the Act of 1933 or the Act of 1939 or any Land Act that the wit of man could devise will not enable the Land Commission to make a clean sweep forthwith of all the divisible land of the country.  In fact, these Acts might be described as removing restrictions which already existed in the code and made resumption simpler.  But, while it enabled the Land Commission perhaps, to acquire more land and to acquire it more speedily, the legislation in itself gives very little aid or assistance in helping the Land Commission to give out that land.</P>
    <P>We have complaints frequently from Deputies.  I warned them that only very urgent and very important matters can receive attention at the present time and, therefore, it is scarcely necessary for me to repeat that the very valuable time of highly-trained and highly-paid officials is often <Col N="2362" /> taken up in investigating and reporting on complaints which have really no sound foundation.  Generally, the Land Commission, as I say, carries out its work to the satisfaction of the public and to the satisfaction of the parties concerned.  There are always disappointed persons.  That cannot be helped, and Deputies should have sufficient experience now and be sufficiently mature to understand that the complaints of these disappointed persons must be taken with a grain of salt.  The fact is that the work of the Land Commission is carried out in the broad light of day by experienced officials.  They have to stand over their work in the time to come and I think that in almost 100 per cent. of the cases the attitude of the Land Commission official or inspector is: &ldquo;When I am leaving the service and going out on pension, wherever I may reside, I want at any rate to look back on my work in the Department as having been good work.  I do not want to be associated with work that has to be torn up again and re-started.  I do not want to be responsible for schemes that are not likely to be successful. I realise my duty to the country and to the Department and the only interest I have and what I should like to achieve is to make my schemes as good and as sound and as perfect as possible.&rdquo;  I do not think it can be denied that that is the attitude of the officials of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>When representations are made by Deputies, even if Deputies may not so understand it, these representations are always transmitted to the Commissioners; they are always noted for attention on the proper files, and they get due consideration when the time comes.  Unfortunately, they are not always based on that intimate, personal knowledge that one would wish.  It might, perhaps, be said that no matter what investigation Deputies may carry out personally in particular cases, they could scarcely ever reach that state of knowledge which the Land Commission inspector, who is specially equipped to deal with the work, has.  Deputies should bear in mind, that they are not likely to have the same knowledge, <Col N="2363" /> that they cannot have it in the ordinary way, of things that the Land Commission inspector has.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, when a scheme is put into operation, an opportunity should be given to those concerned to make their case at the time. My reply to that is that all representations sent in through Deputies, Senators, the clergy, or through other channels, are filed and considered when the scheme is being drawn up by the inspector.  The inspector is not the complete judge in the matter, either. The local inspector, having drawn up his scheme, has to refer it to his official superiors.  To suggest that the proper way to divide land would be to put an announcement in the local newspaper, advising all and sundry that the Land Commission inspector was about to divide such and such land and hold a public inquiry, would be to reduce the proceedings to a laughing-stock.  It is surprising that any responsible person could suggest such a thing.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that no scheme can be satisfactory to all concerned, no scheme can be 100 per cent. satisfactory, but I think it has been recognised nearly always that schemes are as good as could be expected, that they are as satisfactory as human ingenuity could make them.  We cannot, perhaps, be absolutely perfect.  One suggestion was that the end of our troubles would be reached if the public were to decide, presumably by voting for the local applicants, who should get land. I can imagine no proposal more absurd or more silly than that, but that suggestion has been made.</P>
    <P>The actual position is that the local inspector first makes a close study and a census of the whole district, within a radius of a mile or two of the land to be divided.  He has to consider the claims of all applicants and all uneconomic holders, whether they are applicants or not.  He has to plan improvement works, such as roads, fences, drains and buildings, and apportion the rents to be fixed on the different divisions.  This is a matter of special difficulty and importance, as the sanction <Col N="2364" /> of the Commissioners must be frequently obtained for resale at a loss. It would be very difficult to exaggerate the delicacy and difficulty of this work of preparing a scheme of division.  It is often done under constant pressure from Deputies, the local clergy and others.  When the scheme is prepared by special inspectors, selected for this work, it is checked and approved by the inspector in charge of the area and by the divisional inspector before it is examined at headquarters by Commissioners.  Questions such as works charges and questions dealing with survey and marking, with rights of way and boundaries, have all to be settled in the office and therefore, if the inspector has done his job properly, as I maintain he has in all cases, the Land Commission know more about the circumstances of the allottee recommended on the scheme and also of the applicants whose claims have had to be rejected than anyone outside the office can possibly know.</P>
    <P>Local congests and applicants generally will tell the inspectors what they will not tell their neighbours, or even their T.D. or their clergy.  The Commissioners have before them particulars of ages of applicants and the ages of their wives and children, their financial circumstances, the amount of cash in the bank&mdash;the deposit receipts are inspected&mdash;the help to be had from America or elsewhere, particulars of stock, particulars of crops on holdings, particulars of the area of the holding and the poor law valuation, and the manner in which the house and holding are being kept.  We have some very industrious Deputies here, but I wonder how many of them could accumulate that mass of information in connection with the cases of the applicants they are good enough to recommend in such large numbers for the consideration of the Land Commission?</P>
    <P>Sometimes, as we know, Deputies recommend more than one person for a vacant holding.  That is a sagacious proceeding.  What I want to emphasise is that even where a Deputy&mdash;it does not often happen&mdash;has personal knowledge of, and acquaintance with, applicants and all their circumstances, <Col N="2365" /> he is not likely to be in a butter position to judge, because his responsibility is entirely a different one from the responsibility of the inspector who is charged with putting a scheme into operation and who has to answer to the heads of his department and show that the scheme is right and proper in all respects.  The considerations a Deputy has in mind are entirely different.  It was generally recognised that once a scheme was approved and brought into operation, that was the end of it. Deputies, as intelligent and experienced men, knew that the scheme was carried out&mdash;all schemes are&mdash;in accordance with Government policy.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why in any particular case the local inspector should depart from his instructions.  If he does, he will be dealt with by his official superior.  Deputies realise that the representations which they send in receive due consideration, but once a scheme has been implemented, that finishes the matter.  There are bound to be disappointed people. Everybody cannot get land, because there is not enough land to go around. Deputies must make allowances for that.  We have had a case in County Tipperary which has created a certain amount of excitement.  I should like to refer to it because it seems to illustrate some of the points I have been making regarding land division and the method of carrying schemes into operation, which the Land Commission procedure demands.</P>
    <P>I explained already, in reply to a question in the House, that this particular land, called the Ryan estate, at Ballyholohan, near Emly, did not lend itself to be divided into standard holdings, nor did the quality of the land entitle it to be all regarded as good agricultural land suitable for division.  I explained that congestion was not so real or so acute in the immediate vicinity of Emly as in adjacent districts, and that it was not in the public interest, nor would it be in the interests of the cottiers, to allot small separate plots consisting almost entirely of wet land, as was the case on the greater part of this estate.  Accordingly, a scheme was brought into operation whereby four economic holdings were <Col N="2366" /> provided for migrants, one for the former herd, with one enlargement and one accommodation plot.</P>
    <P>I should say with regard to migrants that in order to get them to leave their particular areas and make their lands available for re-arrangement among local congests, the Land Commission has to be prepared to offer them something. You cannot deal with them on a basis of merely offering them something which is the exact equivalent in cash, in the view of the Land Commission experts.  You have to have regard to the amenities and the advantages which they have in their home holdings. They have been associated with the home place over a long period of years. They have been carrying on a particular kind of farming there.  They have the assistance of their neighbours. They are going into a strange country, even when they go into a neighbouring county, perhaps.  In this particular case, certainly, they were not received with any great welcome. They are going into a foreign country, one might almost say, very often with no experience of the conditions which they are likely to be up against.  They are losing, perhaps, certain advantages, if it were only that intimate knowledge of conditions at the home which they have to leave behind.</P>
    <P>On the Ryan estate, the building sites and the actual location of the arable land, which was upland, put certain limitations upon the scheme.  I may say, also, that Deputies, Senators, and other prominent persons recommended these migrants for consideration. They were all very fine types of men, some of them with splendid Old I.R.A. service.  Apart from that, there was no unusual pressure from the local cottiers, to whom the situation was explained. They were told that the scheme for the O'Connor estate, which it was intended to divide, and which has since been divided, was held up for the moment through legal difficulties, but that their claims would be duly considered when that came up for consideration.  That has been done.  Four ex-I.R.A. local landless men and one other ex-I.R.A. landless man from over the Limerick border have been accommodated on the O'Connor estate, together <Col N="2367" /> with one holding for the herd, two enlargements and two accommodation plots.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that it is the duty of inspectors to interview the applicants and in the case of uneconomic holders or others obviously entitled, in the order of priority, to special consideration, to consider their claims even though they make no application. In this particular case, there were 172 applicants and I think practically all these were interviewed privately.  I have seen the Schedule made out by the inspector of the applicants, giving all the information required to come to a decision on a particular applicant's case.  I have examined it carefully and I am quite satisfied, as I have already stated in the House, that this scheme was carried out properly and fairly, with no regard to any other consideration than Government policy.  A great many of the persons who made application, and whose names appear on lists subsequently supplied to me were persons without land, stock, capital or any means whatever, practically, to enable them to work land if they should get it, but in very many cases, in addition to not being agriculturists in the proper sense, or having the necessary experience of agriculture, they lived outside the distance laid down for eligibility.  In other cases, they had some land but were above the valuation limit.  On lists which were supplied to me after the whole scheme had been carried into operation, when an agitation started in the district, I find that there were 18 alleged uneconomic holders.  Of these, three were provided for on the O'Connor Estate&mdash;they were not really uneconomic holders but landless men; five had valuations over £20; the others included a postman, a shoe-maker, an egg dealer and insurance agent, a small shopkeeper, and the heir-apparent to a shop and public-house. Some others were too far distant to be considered for enlargements. As well as the 18 alleged uneconomic holders, there was a miscellaneous assortment of persons described as &ldquo;residents of Emly,&rdquo; one a smith and another described as &ldquo;a good employer <Col N="2368" /> of labour.&rdquo;  In addition to these two classes, we had 31 landless men and 29 cottiers.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that only a very, very limited number of representations were made to the Land Commission, before the scheme was put into operation, in favour of local people.  Furthermore, as I have pointed out, the migrants who were selected were strongly recommended by very responsible persons, some of whom have not been ashamed to appear on the platform in an agitation against these migrants.  So that, all the local information which is available to clergy, Deputies or Senators was available to the Land Commission inspectors, who are experienced men and who have a very good knowledge of the area.  Moreover, this was not a hastily carried out scheme.  There was plenty of time for the fullest consideration and very careful thought was given to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey says that local opinion as to the suitability of applicants should have been considered and he speaks of some people being better entitled.  I think he rather gave the case away against himself when he admitted that this was the first occasion on which he had found it necessary to find fault with the way in which Land Commission schemes were prepared. He seemed to be rather apologetic, and I think rightly so, for refer ring to the matter.  If the authority of the Land Commission is not to be preserved, if they are not to be regarded as the deciding body in this matter, who is going to decide?  Are we going to have the position that the applicants are to be marched into the village hall with the local Deputies, the fife and drum band at their heads, and a vote taken as to who is to get land, or is it to be carried on in the normal way?</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett said that the local uneconomic holders were not considered. I suggest that what I have just said will show that he had not that intimate knowledge of the personal circumstances of the applicants to enable him to say whether they were or were not considered.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that one of the migrants was a Limerick man, an Old I.R.A. man, and that as a result of his migration, land was made available for division in the locality which he left.  We <Col N="2370" /> are very grateful for the fact that he was migrated and that such land was made available for division amongst his neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I should like to emphasise again is that any land that comes into the possession of the Land Commission will be divided in future, I hope, with a view to raising the position of congests to an economic level as far as possible.  We are trying to get away from the parochial idea which would prevent the allotment of land to anybody but locals.  The policy is one which insists that after local congests have been provided for, migrants are to be brought from pockets of congestion in adjoining areas in the same or adjoining counties and, if not, from some of the scheduled congested districts.  That holds for Emly just as much as it holds for the rest of the country.  Certain elements in Emly will not have that. They will not admit congests from badly congested districts, even districts ten or 12 miles away, across the border in Limerick.  No one has contended or if he has so contended, his contention is based on an entire misapprehension of the facts, that any congestion existed in Emly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It certainly seems very strange to me that such a pioneer of democracy as Deputy Keyes should find himself in the position of carrying on an agitation with people whose declared object is to prevent outsiders from the next parish or the second next parish away, from coming into their parish.  The Land Commission or no responsible authority could accept that proposition &mdash;thoroughly bad citizenship in my opinion and unworthy of County Tipperary. In most parts of the country the policy of the Land Commission has been carried out and found satisfactory and people have not objected to it.  As regards South Tipperary, I do not know that it can afford to adopt such an arrogant attitude in this matter, having regard to the fact that among the counties which show a fairly high percentage of arrears in the payment of land annuities, it has the doubtful honour of heading the list.  In the matter of compulsory tillage I doubt whether it would occupy a place of <Col N="2371" /> honour either, so it might be no harm, as has been suggested to me, to improve the strain a little.</P>
    <P>Deputy Curran wants a special policy for Tipperary, or for any parish in Tipperary, if I read him correctly, which is not satisfied to accept the policy that has been put into operation with general satisfaction elsewhere. The extraordinary thing about it is that Deputy Curran has never visited the place, and, as far as I am aware, never met these applicants in whom he is interested.  He says that he lives 30 miles away, and his only knowledge of the local circumstances is gleaned from the local paper.  I think we have the measure of the extent of Deputy Curran's interest, and the origin of it, when we read in his speech the reasons why, although living so far away and having no knowledge whatever of local circumstances, he feels himself in a position to speak with such energy and show of authority about this matter.  &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it is unique in the history of this country to have a local agitation, backed up by the priests, such as is being carried on there at the present time.&rdquo;  Later on he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think that the priests of a parish would associate themselves with anything which was not fair or reasonable where the interests of the people were at stake.  That is the situation there at the present time.  The priests of the parish have been backing up the local people for the redivision of this land and trying to right the wrongs that would have been perpetrated in its division.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When you have that state of affairs existing, backed up as it is by the priests of the parish, one can say that the Land Commission are up against it and are not going to get away with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, apparently, the fact that&mdash;according to Deputy Curran&mdash;the agitation is backed up by the priests of the parish gives him the comfortable feeling that, <Col N="2372" /> however great his ignorance of the circumstances of the case, he is quite safe in getting up here and abusing the Land Commission for its alleged misdeeds in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that we had any representations whatever from Deputy Curran about this scheme until after the division had been carried out. There had been no agitation before the division and there would have been none, I submit, had not unwise counsels prevailed and foolish and bad advice given, I fear, by those from whom one would have expected good advice.  We cannot accept, and I do not think any responsible Deputy would urge that we should, the position that where land is available for distribution, it must be reserved for the locals of the parish who are not entitled to it under the policy we are carrying out.  Well, if we are not prepared to accept that position so far as it seems to be based on reason, on commonsense and equity, why we should be compelled to accept it under pressure, when certain persons take it on themselves to bully and intimidate the local people, is beyond me.  I entirely fail to comprehend the point of view of Deputies who think that a Minister of an Irish Government would allow himself to be intimidated by that kind of pressure.  The fact that Deputies have been whipped up to go down to public meetings, that letters were sent out to them, the fact that their reaction was to run down, make speeches and pass resolutions, and, as I have said, in practically all cases with very little knowledge of the circumstances, is no indication whatever, and I hope it never will, that a Minister is going to fall down on his job, to let down the Irish people, let down his Government and let down everybody by conceding something which is not deserved, to this type of petty tyranny that has been going on in this parish since this scheme was carried into operation.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission is the authority in this matter why is it not accepted as such?  It is not a Department of the British Government.  It is a Department of the Irish Government, <Col N="2373" /> and is manned by Irishmen to carry out the policy I emphasised and that was laid down by the elected Government of the Irish people.  Why should it not be good enough for the people of Emly or any other part of the country?  Moreover, in this matter of land agitation we have short memories. It is, perhaps, forgotten that in the height of the national struggle from 1919 to 1921, these land agitations broke out sporadically in certain parts of the country, threatening to engulf the whole national movement, and to turn it into some kind of Socialist revolutionary struggle, if steps had not been taken in Dublin at the time to put down these local agitations.  We always have people in times of trouble who are anxious to enrich themselves at the expense of their neighbours.  It would be a pity to give much consideration to such people.  Certainly in my opinion they should not be encouraged.  Rather than weaken the authority of the Government in matters of this kind, and efforts have certainly been made to weaken it by the persistent attempts that have been made to undo this scheme, one would imagine that Deputies would stand by the Government, even if they felt that fault might be found.  No fault could be found with the policy pursued and the Deputies who criticised had not the necessary local knowledge or could not be aware of the circumstances.  They simply showed themselves to be weak and to be men without backbone in attending meetings and passing a resolution describing the action of the Land Commission as injustice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I did not pass any resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Deputy Bennett did not.  Public property has been damaged.  It was the property of the Irish people.  In this agitation workers have been intimidated, and if Deputy Keyes, as a Labour leader, can justify his conscience, in being associated with a campaign in which a man from the next parish will be regarded as an outlaw, be boycotted and branded as a foreigner.  I wonder what he thinks <Col N="2374" /> about the intimidation of workers that is going on, or the campaign to prevent them carrying out Land Commission work on these lands; work that was being carried out since the beginning of last year.  There was no trouble about it until this unfortunate meeting took place some time in January in the local parish hall in Emly.  A few days after that fences erected by the Land Commission were pulled down.  A public meeting was held after that which Deputies attended, thereby associating themselves with this agitation in a very public way, and taking a certain amount of responsibility for it.  Young men again chose to take the law into their own hands.  They had done so before the meeting.  If there is anyone in the district who has intimidated the migrants or the allottees or asked them not to take up the land or to carry out their obligations to the State, I think a certain amount of responsibility rests upon Deputies who should have known&mdash;and I hope they are wiser men now&mdash;that they were brought there to give a fresh stimulus to this mischievous agitation, which could only result in absolute futility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another extraordinary thing about the whole situation is that, while the Deputies went and made speeches condemning the Land Commission, not one of them condemned the public damage that had been done.  None of them asked that restitution should be made.  They should know that those who did the damage are bound to make restitution to the State, because it is a loss, and is exactly the same as the case of a private individual, who, under the Christian law, has to make restitution to another for damage caused him.  In the course of a speech made by Deputy Martin Ryan, he said that if there was one thing which officials of any Government Department should try to avoid it was the creation of agrarian trouble in any locality.  He also said that he thought the officers of the Land Commission should go all out to avoid any trouble of that kind, because it meant that the land would not be worked.  One would imagine that the Land Commission <Col N="2375" /> officials in the execution of their duty had gone out specifically to create trouble.  The entire cause of the trouble, and the fount and origin of an agitation which was created on very specious grounds, after the scheme had been carried into operation, is largely because Deputies associated themselves with it.  If that were to extend through the country, it would be very serious indeed, and if it were to succeed in one particular area, or in one parish, why should it not be tried in others?  As one Deputy pointed out, if these people succeed, why should not others look forward to see whether they could not succeed by carrying on agitations of this kind?  I regret more than anybody the trouble that has been created, but I am faced with this position, that an organised, determined, and persistent effort has been made to prevent a scheme being put into operation, and I want to say that those who instigated it, and who are still directing it, must take responsibility for the unfortunate situation which now exists.  As far as I am concerned, as I said to-day in reply to Deputy Fogarty's question, I am going to see that this scheme, which was carried out properly and faithfully in accordance with Land Commission policy, will be completed, and that there will be no going back.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the lettings of land by the Land Commission for tillage, and suggested that the fertility of the land was being impaired, whereas his colleague, Deputy Brennan, rightly pointed out that the Land Commission is in the same position as every other farmer. We have to carry out the compulsory tillage programme, and if there is intensive cropping going on the effect, as in many other cases, is inevitable. The Land Commission are endeavouring to lay down some of their land in grass.  The Deputy referred to delays in connection with notices of resumption and to the fact that legal action was not being taken.  Some of these cases were held up for many years pending legislation being brought in in 1939, but the Act was not actually brought into operation until well on in the following year, after the <Col N="2376" /> outbreak of war.  The rules of court were only completed late in the summer of 1940, so that even if there had been no restrictions imposed on the Department by the Government regarding its operations, it would not have been able to start new proceedings for acquisition under the Amending Act of 1939 until late in 1940.  We were not able to do that.  There has been a partial closing down of resumption cases.  The Land Commission is attempting to deal with them.  Deputies who are pressing for activity on the part of the Land Commission may remember that there is another side to the matter, and that those persons whose cases are the subject of proceedings for resumption feel that a very unfair disability is being placed upon them through the Land Commission not coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to inflation prices of land after the war.  It would be very difficult, of course, to say what the position will be after the war, but, under the existing law and policy, regard must be had to the market price in the case of acquisition, and in the case of resumption the land must be acquired at the market price. Deputy Brennan raised the question of housing and suggested that we were not giving the facilities that we should to allottees.  The position is that the allottees to which the Deputy refers are all landless men, I think, for whom the Land Commission did not, and would not, undertake to build houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister, on a point of correction, that they are not all landless men.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  One is the case of a herd who was living on the land in a very bad house, and the Land Commission proposed that he should build a house and that they would make him a grant of a certain amount of money.  The money was inadequate, however, and the house was so bad that he went to live with a neighbour and is still living with the neighbour because the Land Commission will not <Col N="2377" /> give him a sufficient grant to build a proper house.  The point is that things are very different now; and the former basis is not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to write to me about the case.  The position is that the Land Commission does not undertake to build houses, but gives generous grants and advances to enable the people concerned to build their own houses.  The allottees, generally, are glad to accept the land and the monetary help, but any extra money would have to be provided by themselves.  Many of them have built their own houses, while others have just sat by and wasted their own time and that of their Deputies in coming to the Land Commission to try to get extra assistance.  It is not fair that, through the influence of a Deputy or somebody else, an applicant of that particular kind should be enabled to get extra special assistance.  He is getting special assistance already, or was getting it in normal times when housing could proceed.  He was getting this special assistance from the Land Commission which, as I say, is on very generous lines, and it seems to be rather unfair that one applicant should get more than the others.  If the Land Commission lays down a certain rate of assistance it cannot depart from that in particular cases, and there is also the question whether, having regard to the thousands of persons who are getting a recognised rate of assistance, say, from the Local Government Department, for housing, particular cases should get favoured treatment from the Land Commission.  That is one of the things we have been up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put the Minister a question on that?  Am I not right in stating that the assistance given by the Land Commission originally was 100 per cent. of the cost of the erection of a house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that is what it was.  The Land Commission erected the house and the out-office, but now the cost of the house and the <Col N="2378" /> out-office has gone up, with the result that no contractor will take the work at the price, and it is hardly fair to that particular landless man now to expect him to make a contribution towards the building of a house while, in the case of the man who came in a few years previously, the whole cost was borne by the State.  That is the other side of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there have been any cases like that, where the tenant got 100 per cent, of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I shall inquire into it.  I always understood that a certain grant was given and that the tenant, through his own labour, and by putting up a certain amount of additional cash himself, was able to get the house built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood or to mislead the Minister, but this is the case as I understand it.  A grant of a sum of £240 was promised to those landless men to build a house.  At one time they were able to get it done at that price, but it could not be done at that price now or for £60 more, and they have not the money.  That is the position.  In the eyes of the Land Commission, the grant may appear to be 100 per cent. of the cost, but it is not so now, and these people cannot build the house at that price now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Linchan spoke of the lack of housing accommodation and said that that was what was preventing occupation of holdings in many cases.  The truth is that the Land Commission pays a competitive price for the houses they build, where new holdings are being provided, and in all these cases the contracts contain a clause providing for increased costs owing to the emergency, but there are some localities in which it is very difficult to get a contractor.  Reference was also made to derelict holdings. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was amazed at Deputy Corry's statement that Cork <Col N="2379" /> has numerous derelict holdings, which are untilled, unstocked, and paying no rates or annuities, and he was also amazed that Deputy Martin Ryan should say that the same exists in County Tipperary.  Well, the Land Commission does not believe that there are derelict holdings in the proper sense of that term, but that there are holdings, owned by persons who pay very little attention to them and who owe rates and annuities, is certainly the case.  These, however, are not derelict holdings.  The trouble is that if these holdings were to be put up for sale locally there might be local opposition to the purchase of these holdings, as is often the case, and certainly nobody, not even a venturesome migrant, would be likely to come in and take over one of these holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the collection of annuities.  I am glad to say that it has improved considerably, and, in spite of the lamentable outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which affected the farmers throughout the country so seriously, our collection is not unsatisfactory. The average amount of arrears at the present time throughout the country is 5.4 per cent.  South Tipperary, as I have said, has the doubtful honour of being highest on the list, with 12 2 per cent. in arrears. The figure for Wicklow is 11.7 per cent.  I do not see any reason why these counties should have such a high level of arrears, when we have counties like Donegal with 2.1 per cent; Mayo, 2.8 per cent., and Monaghan, 1.5 per cent.  The Land Commission is always prepared, as I have already stated, to give ear to any reasonable plan that is put up to it for the repayment of arrears in an individual case, but there can be no general rule made or no general formula promulgated for the reduction of those payments of arrears. Individual cases will have to be dealt with on their merits, and if it is clear that the tenant has tried to meet his obligations, but that circumstances have arisen over which, perhaps, he had no control, preventing him from carrying on his payments, then his case, if put up, will be considered sympathetically.  We have, of course, <Col N="2380" /> the chronic cases of those persons who, not satisfied with having their arrears wiped out and their annuities halved under the 1933 Act, proceeded to build up a new burden of arrears, and there is no easy way in which these people can be dealt with.  They must be made to put up proposals which shall receive consideration.  Even in the County Wicklow, I am glad to say that in the past two years the arrears have been reduced from £60,000 to £50,000.  Arrangements have been made in a large number of cases there for payment by instalments.  I think there is a tendency there and, possibly, elsewhere to defer coming to an arrangement. I think it would be good business, on the part of the ordinary farmer-debtor, to try to make an arrangement with all his creditors&mdash;not only with the Land Commission&mdash;at the present time.  It would be much better than having a mill-stone hung around his neck.</P>
    <P>I was asked several questions about the migrants.  The scheme of migration only started in 1935 and, although we have a good deal of experience now, it is perhaps too soon yet to come to anything like a final judgment as to the success or otherwise of it.  So far as the Land Commission knows, the migrants have done very well indeed.  They are not alone, as I said on a former occasion, a credit to themselves, but a credit to the Land Commission and to the country.  The fact that they have large families of sons who cannot find a sufficient outlet for their activities locally, each one of whom probably would be able to work a good holding as well as his father if he could get it seems to be a cause of complaint by some persons.  We know that the home farm can only maintain one son and that, unfortunately, the others have to look for work elsewhere.  Out of 122 migrants from the Gaeltacht congested areas, eight returned, and out of 169 group migrants, one returned.  That was nine out of 291 who returned to their home areas.  Some of these were not at all unsuccessful, but loneliness or, sometimes, the woman of the house having the feeling that she would rather live at home than among <Col N="2381" /> strangers, was responsible for the decision to go back.  I think it will be found, if the work of the Land Commission in the County Meath and other areas into which the migrants have been transferred is carefully surveyed, that there have been hundreds and hundreds of accommodation plots provided for local cottiers and for their cows. In all cases the Land Commission inspectors have tried to facilitate these local people.  A good deal of the criticism of the migration scheme arises from a lack of understanding of the conditions in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Palmer estate, a map of which has been hung in the hall.  It is an example of the kind of thing that one meets with in the western areas.  This estate was purchased by the Congested Districts Board and covered an area of 86,000 acres in 213 townlands.  The rearrangement of the congested holdings on the estate, owing to its extent, had to be carried out by grouping townlands and in certain cases by individual townlands. The townland of Rathlacken on this estate&mdash;645 acres&mdash;was occupied by 48 tenants with very congested holdings.  As there was no untenanted land in the townland during the years 1919-1921 the Congested Districts Board migrated 15 tenants with a view to striping and improving the remaining holdings.  Considerable time was then spent in trying to produce a scheme of striping, but the tenants would not agree.  After the dissolution of the Congested Districts Board the Land Commission endeavoured in 1926 to prepare a further scheme of striping, but this had to be abandoned owing to the hostile attitude of the tenants. In 1928 some of the residents in Rathlacken lost their lives in what became known as the west coast fishing disaster and the committee set up to administer the funds subscribed made strong representations to have the chronic congestion in the townland dealt with.  Arrangements were then made to endeavour to induce further tenants to migrate and eventually three tenants agreed to do so.</P>
    <P>In 1932 a further effort was made, but the striping proposals again fell <Col N="2382" /> through.  The Land Commission tried again in 1935 without result.  A number of the tenants, however, would not agree to striping.  In 1937 three more tenants agreed to migrate.  Last year a further two tenants migrated, thus leaving 25 tenants in the townland. These remaining tenants have now at long last agreed to a rearrangement scheme.  The average rent of the holdings when the estate was purchased was £2 12s. 6d. and the average annual sum of the new rearranged holdings of the tenants remaining is £4 18s.</P>
    <P>On at least five occasions the Land Commission was unsuccessful in dealing with this troublesome rearrangement case through objections on the part of the local tenants.  These objections could only be got over by getting a certain number of them out of this very congested townland and transferring them elsewhere.  That is the position that exists frequently in Mayo, Galway, and even Donegal.  I hope that Deputies who condemn the migration scheme or who criticise it&mdash;I would recommend this generally&mdash; will try to make themselves familiar with the conditions in these very bad areas of congestion in the West before they again condemn migration.  It is quite obvious that there can be no other solution for these areas.  Houses may be built for them, but why build houses on patches of rundale of the type that we have had there?  Why not try to make a clean job of it and improve the condition of the holdings to some extent?  The fact that the average rent has been brought from £2 12s. 6d. to £4 18s. 0d. may not look very much, but when the work which the Land Commission has carried out in the area is fully considered, it will be seen that it means an enormous improvement socially and economically there.</P>
    <P>That is only a single example.  Go to the other congested areas and you will find equally bad cases, and there is no remedy for them.  Are people to be left there permanently while we have this huge machinery for land re-settlement carrying on its work?  Surely it is the primary duty of that organisation to endeavour to relieve the con- <Col N="2383" /> gestion in these areas and to bring up the standard of these wretched holdings even by £1 or £2.  Think of what it means to a great number of these poor people, if the position be that we cannot transfer them altogether out of some of these very barren and desolate areas.  When local men in the West get land in addition to their own holdings they get no special assistance.  It has not been the custom to give special assistance to allottees in the midland counties, for example.  They do not need special help and it is thought that they should not require it.  They are living among their friends and neighbours and they can get assistance that the migrants cannot get in that way. They are familiar with local conditions and they know very well what faces them.  But an emigrant coming from the far West up to the County Meath is faced with a whole host of problems and I think the Government are fully justified in giving him extra assistance. The extra assistance I think is not a great deal having regard to the importance of the work and to the fact that the whole rearrangement of large areas of bad congestion depends entirely on getting numbers of these smallholders out of those areas.  It is only in cases of necessity, and when the Land Commission is satisfied that the distances emigrants have to travel are considerable that special aid would seem to be necessary.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, I regret that we have not had more speeches directed to the broad general question of land division policy and land resettlement and what changes, if any, are desirable.  As I have said, it is not practicable, I fear, for the Land Commission with its greatly reduced staff to carry out the type of investigation that I think would be desirable and even necessary.  But I think that Deputies have an excellent opportunity at present in regard to that matter. They have a rest from some of the more controversial aspects of public life and they should, perhaps, concentrate their energies more on examining these problems.  They have been given a good example by some Deputies who have spoken.  The conditions, of <Col N="2384" /> course, in this country are different from those in other countries and perhaps as a people we are too eager, in our desire to secure the ideal, to assume that, because a particular solution of an economic problem has worked satisfactorily in another country, it will work well here.  My own view is that the problem of land resettlement should be regarded in its historic aspect, should be examined from the point of view of how it came into operation, the developments which have taken place in it, and particularly the changes of policy under native Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, we would require an intimate knowledge and a detailed report of how allottees who have been given land during all those years have succeeded; what advantage it has been to the State and to the community that they have got that land; and are they making the best possible use of it.  Such an inquiry, of course, would require prolonged travelling and consideration and I doubt if it is practicable just now.  But, as I said, I hope that the inquiry which the Minister for Agriculture has in mind will be possible and that out of that inquiry we will get further knowledge as to what modifications may be necessary in agricultural policy and in our agricultural economy.  That will have its bearing on land resettlement and the whole matter, I hope, will be fully examined.</P>

      <P>I put to the Minister the case of a very congested area on the Crotty estate in the townland of Twanyagry in which only a very small reform is necessary.  I wish to know from the Minister if he will see that that small reform is carried out; that is to say, that the subtenants will be made direct tenants and that 12 people will not have to pay their rent altogether in bulk, but that the rent will be taken from each one separately.  There is no difficulty in the matter.</P>

      <P>There is no difficulty from the Deputy's point of view.  All these Land Commission problems are beautifully simple, but the Department <Col N="2385" /> believes that the problem is a difficult one.  As I told the Deputy in reply to a Parliamentary question, the plots are so intermixed that it will be necessary to rearrange the land.</P>

      <P>That is not asked for now.  I happen to know the facts thoroughly and I have gone into them.  As a matter of fact, I know the village myself.  The rents have been completely arranged between the people themselves.  Everybody knows what rent he will pay and everybody knows the land he has got, and the only reform for which the people are asking is that each one's rent will be taken from him and that if one man is unable to pay, then the other 11 cannot pay.</P>

    <P>I gcompráid le blianta eile, níl athrú <Col N="2386" /> mór ar bith anuas ná suas ar iomlán an ghlan-soláthair atáthar d'iarraidh sa Meastachán seo le haghaidh Foraoiseachta.  Ach, dá ainneoin sin, do thárla cuid mhaith athruithe, i rith na bliana, ar chuid de phrímhghnéithe oibre Roinne na Foraoiseachta. Níor bhféidir oiread damhna d'allmhuiriú le haghaidh fálta, agus níor bhféidir síolta ar bith d'fháil as tíortha thar lear, agus do rinne an dá ní sin laghdú mór ar an bplanndáil ba phríomh-obair don Roinn sa ngnáth-shaol. Ach, má bhí an chailliúint sin ann, do bhí gnóthachan ann ba mhó ná í, mar gheall ar an ngannú trom do tháinig ar allmhuiriú adhmaid le haghaidh gnótha tráchtála agus le haghaidh teinte.  Ar an Roinn Soláthairtí, dar ndó atá an príomh-chúram maidir leis na nithe riachtanachá sin; ach, ós ní go bhfuil Roinn na Foraoiseachta ar an sealbhóir foraoiseacht is mó sa tír, do tháinig sé de dhualgas ar an Roinn sin páirt mhór do dhéanamh i soláthar an adhmaid do bhí ag teastáil. Cibé athruithe atá ar bhun-fhigiúracha an Mheastacháin seo, atá a bhfurmhór ann de bhárr chora na héigeandála.  Ag seo leanas príomh-athruithe na bhfigiúr ó bhí an bhliain seo thart ann.</P>
    <P>Fó-Mhírcheann A&mdash;Tuarastail, Páigheanna agus Allúntais (£18,282)&mdash;An £2,000 nó mar sin de bhreis atá annseo, is é is príomh-chúis leis na mionmhéaduighthe foirne do rinneadh le haghaidh Cléireachais agus Cigireachta maidir le díol adhmaid agus le riarachán Achta Foraoiseachta 1928.</P>
    <P>Fó-Mhírcheann C (1)&mdash;Talamh do Cheannach (£60,000)&mdash;Sa gcéadmheastachán do 1941-42, ní raibh ach £25,000 chun talamh do cheannach le haghaidh foraoiseachta, óir do bhítheas ag súil go rachadh an obair sin chun moille le linn na héigeandála.  Ach do fuarthas amach, ina dhiaidh sin, go raibh an éigeandáil féin ina cúis le sóirt áirithe talmhan do bheith ar fáil ní ba réidhe chun a cheannuithe ná mar bheadh sé sa ngnáth-shaol, agus, mar sin de, do fuarthas £15,000 de bhreis-dheontas.  Ina theannta sin, do bhí £6,036 d'fhuighleach ón mbliain roimh ré&mdash;rud d'fhág £16,036 de shuim iomlán ar fáil le haghaidh talamh do cheannach sa mbliain dár geionn.  Ins <Col N="2387" /> an mbliain sin, 1941-42, do thárla £32,286 de chaiteachas glan as Ciste an Deontais-i-gCabhair, agus do húsáideadh £28,604 de sin i gceannach talmhan ar bh'achar iomlán dí 8,457¼ de acraí.  Do fágadh £13,750 d'fhuighleach, agus idir sin agus an méid atáthar d'iarraidh i Meastachán 1942-43, do bheadh £73,750 de shuim iomlán ar fáil chun talamh do cheannach sa mbliain atá romhainn.  Atá agam annseo figiúracha áirithe thaisbeánas an staid ina raibh gnótha ceannuithe talmhan, an ladh de Aibreán, 1942, agus gheobhfar uathasan tuairim éigin don caiteachas is dócha bheith ann i mbliana.  San am sin, do bhí socruithe deimhne déanta do cheannach tailte áirithe ar luach dóibh £23,747 agus ar bh'achar iomlán dóibh 10,753¼ d'acraí.  San am chéadna do bhí margaíocht ar cois chun 13,160 acra eile do cheannach ar £49,115 de luach iomlán.  Dá bhfuighthí seilbh na dtailte sin go léir roimh dheireadh na bliana 1942-43, do bheadh tuairim is £75,000 de chaiteachas iomlán ann, £5,000, abair, ina theannta sin i gcóir cíos agus blianacht.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir, dar ndó, nach gcuirfí na margaíochta sin go léir i gcrích taobh istigh den bhliain, óir is minic a bhíos moill mhór ag baint le scrúdú teideal; ach is dóigh líom go bhféadfadh tailte nach iad sin do bheith le fáil.  Daoine ag a bhfuil eastáit mhóra chrannacha, ní handóigh go sanntóchadh siad an luach árd atá le fáil ar adhmad fá láthair agus go ndíolfadh siad na crainn.  Ina dhiadh sin, b'fhéidir go mb'fhearr leo an talamh do dhíol le Roinn na Foraoiseachta ná ath-phlanndáil do dhéanamh do réir choinníoll na gceadúnas chun crainn do leagan atá ann faoi Acht Foraoiseachta 1928.  Dá ndéantaí roinnt mhargadh den tsórt sin do chur i gcrích gan mhoill, do thiocfadh cuid mhaith costais ar an Roinn mar gheall ortha.  Ní dócha go mbeidh a leithéid de sheans ann athuair, agus ba tairbheach an ní seilbh d'fáil ar cibé éastáit a dtairgfear iad do dhíol.  Gan amhras ar bith, ba socharach don náisiún oiread agus b'fhéidir de na mór-estáit chrannacha do theacht faoi stiúir na Roinne. Daoine príobháideacha a mbíonn a <Col N="2388" /> leithéidí aca, is annamh chuireas siad mór-scéimeanna planndála i gcrích mar ba chóir, óir bíonn an costas riachtanach thar chumas aca.</P>
    <P>Fó-Mhírcheann C 2&mdash;Síolrú, Airíocht agus rl. (£209,471)&mdash;Is truagh liom é do bheith orm a innsint gur bh'éigean obair an tsioluithe do laghdú.  Is é is cionntach le sin a ghainneacht atá na damhnaí&mdash;go háirithe miotal-sreang le haghaidh fálta.  Ní féidir a leithéidi d'fháil as tíortha na hEorpa.  Le tamall thart, do bhítheas ag féacháil le lón mór do mhiotal-líonta d'fháil as Americeá.  Do fuarthas roinnt bheag ó am go ham; ach dá mbéadh na horduithe go léir le fáil féin ó na monarchain Americeánacha, is eagal liom go mba deacair áit d'fháil dóibh i longa anall.  An £21,000 atá sa bhFó-Mhircheann seo le haghaidh damhna, do cuireadh ann é d'íoc ar son cibé miotallíon bhéas le fáil agus ar son a n-iompair chun na tíre seo.  An soláthar le haghaidh Airíochta agus Oibríochta (£28,000), tá sé £1,000 níos lugha ná mar do bhí i Meastachán bliana roimh ré, agus is é is cúis le sin laghdú na hoibre bhaineas le fálú.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fhó-Mhírcheann na hOibre bhaineas le Síolrú, do hiarradh £100,000 anuraidh, ach níl ach £80,000 dá iarraidh i mbliana.  Do b'éigean an laghdú sin do dhéanamh mar gheall ar nithe nach bhfuil neart ag an Roinn ortha, e.g., gan oiread planndála do bheith dá dhéanamh ó thárla gann na damhnaí le haghaidh fálta.  Mar is eól do na Teachtaí, do bhí an Roinn, le tamall thart, ag iarraidh na planndála bliantúla do mhéadú.  Ins an mbliain roimh an éigeandáil do planndáileadh 7,600 acra; ach, i mbliain a 1940-41, do b'éigean teacht le 5,961 acra.  Maidir leis an mbliain seo, ní dócha go bplanndálfar breis mhór ar bith agus 4,000 acra&mdash;gidh go bhfuil san áireamh sin tailte áirithe do fuarthas le goirid agus nach bhfuil fálú ag teastáil uatha.  An lón beag de dhamhna fáluigthe atá againn, táthar ghá úsáid chomh tábhachtach agus is féidir; ach is beag nach cinnte go gcaithfear teacht le scéim laghduithe, an bhliain seo chugainn, freisin, muna n-éirighidh linn cuid mhaith damhna d'fháil as Americea.  Tá an soláthar le haghaidh síolruithe dhá choinneáil <Col N="2389" /> ar scála laghduithe dá réir sin.  Ach, dár ndóigh, déanfar gach dícheall chun oiread planndála agus is féidir do dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ní gá dhom míniú ar bith do thabhairt uaim i dtaobh an tsoláthair de £50,000 le haghaidh lóin d'adhmad teineadh.  Nuair a bhíos ag trácht le goirid ar an Meastachán Breise le haghaidh Foraoiseachta, do thugas colas do na Teachtaí faoi'n scéim tré n-a raibh an Roinn ag soláthar tuairim is 88,000 tonna d'adhmad teineadh do coinneóchthaí i dtaisce ag Comhlucht Allmhuirithe na nAdhbhar Teineadh. Do réir mar atá cúrsaí adhbhar teineadh fá láthair, is ró-chosúil go gcaithfear cromadh arís ar an obair seo chomh luath agus bhéas deireadh le hobair na planndála.  Ach ní féidir, go fóill, a mheas cad é an méid d'adhbhar teineadh caithfear d'fháil ó Fhoraois-Thailte an Stáit sa mbliain atá romhainn.  Mar sin de, níl sa £50,000 ach soláthar sealadach ar dócha breis do bheith ag teastáil ina theannta níos fuide anonn sa mbliain.</P>
    <P>Fó-Mhírcheann C (3)&mdash;Oiriúnú Adhmaid (£5,964)&mdash;Faoi'n bhFó-Mhírcheann seo, tá soláthar breise dhá dhéanamh don tsaothar bheas riachtanach in oibriú muileann so-aistrithe sábhadóireachta.  Do méaduigheadh líon na muileann seo sa gcaoi ina raibh seacht gcinn díobh ann anuraidh, agus gheobhfar a thuilleadh, más féidir sin. Tá na muilte seo an-oiriúnach do dhéanamh bloc le haghaidh teinte, agus tá an obair sin ar siul aca go lán-aimsireach fá lathair.</P>
    <P>Fó-Mhírcheann H&mdash;Leithreasuithe-i-gCabhair (£94,940)&mdash;Táthar ag súil go dtiocfaidh méadú maith ar na fáltais ó Mhuilte Sábhadóireachta de thoradh an bhreise éilimh bhéas ar na bluic ghníthear ins na muilte so-aistrithe. Den méid atáthar a sholáthar, atáthar ag meas go bhfuighfear £10,000 ó Bhárdas Bhaile Atha Cliath, óir atá scéim ar cois tré n-a gcuirfidh an Roinn 12,000 tonna d'adhmad teineadh ar fáil don Bhárdas le n-a dháiliú.</P>
    <P>Meastachán na bhfáltas ó Mhór-Dhíolacháin Adhmaid, do bhí £25,000 ann anuraidh, agus do laghduíodh sin go dtí £20,000 i mbliana.  Is éigean do <Col N="2390" /> thionnscail na n-obair adhmaid damhna ár dtíre féin d'úsáid fá láthair, agus atá an damhna sin ag dul i ngainne go tapaidh.  Mar sin de, atá an Roinn ag féacháil le caomhnadh do dhéanamh ar cibé adhmad foirbthe atá ar Fhoraois-Thailte an Stáit, ionnas go mbuanófar, chomh fada agus is féidir, an lón le haghaidh bun-riachtanas.  Maidir leis an gcaomhnadh sin, tá Roinn na Soláthar ag aontú leis an Roinn seo. Ach, os a chomhair sin, atáthar ag reic, tré mhion-díolacháin áitiúla, níos mó ná an gnáth-mhéid d'adhmad&mdash;tanúcháin foraoiseach agus rl. &mdash;agus atá sin dá áireamh sa Mheastachán.</P>
    <P>Ba é ba phríomh-chuspóir don Acht Foraoiseachta, 1928 cosc do chur ar leagan na gcrann as éadan, agus a chur in áirithe go ndéanfaí crainntailte d'ath-phlanndáil tar éis a mbearrtha.  De thoradh an mhóiréilimh atá fá láthair ar adhmad le haghaidh gnóthaí tráchtála agus le haghaidh teinte, do cuireadh isteach i bhfad níos mó ná an gnáth-uimhir d'fhógraí leagain, agus fágann sin breis-ualach mór oibre ar a bhfuil againn d'oifigigh foraoiseachta&mdash;go háirithe ó do laghduíodh na gléasraí taistil.  Tá gach dícheall dhá dhéanamh chun freastal tapaidh do thabhairt do na hiarratais, ach ní féidir gan roinnt áirithe mhoille do bheith ann.  Atá Acht na Foraoiseachta i bhfeidhm le dhá bhliain déag, agus ar feadh an dá bhliain seo thart, do cuireadh coingheallacha an Achta in úil don phobal&mdash; go mór-mhór an coinníoll faoi na gcaithfidh fógra roimh ré do theacht chuige an Stáisiún Gárda is comhgaraí do bhaile ó dhuine ar bith ar mian leis crann do leagan.  Dá ainneoin sin, tá leitreacha ag iarraidh ceada leagain dhá bhfáil gach lá, agus gan cruinnchuntas ar bith ionnta maidir le huimhir na gcrann, ná le n-a n-ionaid, ná leis an úsáid atáthar ag brath a dhéanamh den adhmad.</P>
    <P>Do rinneadh gearán le goirid dhá rá gur chóir na riaghlacha do shimpliú i gcásanna daoine ar mhian leo uimhir an-bheag de chrainn do leagan ar a ngabháltais féin.  I geás den tsórt sin, ní riachtanach don únaer ach an Fógra leagain do chur isteach chuig an Stáisiún Gárda is comhgaraí dhó; agus ní dóigh liom gur leathtrom mór ar bith <Col N="2391" /> an méid sin.  I bhfurmhór mhór na gcás, ní diúltuítear don iarratas, agus, ar bheith caithte don tréimhse reachtúil (21 lá), is ceadmhach don iarrathóir dul ar aghaidh leis an leagan.  Ach, do réir chosúlacha, is maith le mórán daoine an cead do ghlacadh gan a iarraidh agus gan áird ar bith do thabhairt ar choinníollacha Achta na Foraoiseachta. Ar an abhar sin, béidir nár mhisde dom a thabhairt de rabhadh uaim anois nach gceadófar a leithéid siúd d'obair, agus go gcuirfear an dlí i bhfeidhm in gach cás ina bhfuighfear fianaise go ndearnadh leagan ar bith gan an ceadúnas reachtúil do bheith fachta roimh ré. Go minic, gníthear leith-scéal gur riachtanach crainn do leagan mar gheall ar iad do bheith ina mbac ar threabhadh nó ar fhás barra; ach, sa gcas ina mbeadh sin amhlaidh, d'fhéadfaí an riachtanas d'fheiceáil roimh ré agus an fógra leagain do chur isteach san am cheart.</P>
    <P>Do réir tuarascbhála atá dhá bhfáil, is cosúil go bhfuiltear ag leagan crann chun a ndóighte, gidh go bhfuil na crainn chéanna oiriúnach do ghnóthaí tráchtála.  Ní ceart sin do dhéanamh. Ní féidir adhmad d'allmhuiriú d'fháil fá láthair, agus atá adhmad na tíre seo gann go maith mar atá sé.

      <P>This Estimate this year is dealing with a situation very different from the Estimate of previous years because the main question now in Ireland has become one of cutting down timber rather than of planting timber because, naturally, owing to the very high price at which marketable timber is going at the present moment, a great deal of timber has been cut and the Department is giving its sanction to such cutting very easily.  I think the Department's policy in that respect is perfectly right because there is a great <Col N="2392" /> deal of timber in this country which is mature timber and this is the best time at which it could be cut down and made available.  It will prove to be an advantage to the country that young trees will take the place of these trees which have already reached maturity and some of which have passed maturity.  But certain difficulties seem to me to occur.  One of them is that trees are now being cut down and the Department is allowing, by its licences, something like two or three years for the replanting of the areas from which timber has been cut.  It has occurred to me that that will become a very difficult, if not an impossible, proposition unless the Department now looks forward and takes certain steps.</P>
      <P>At the present moment there are only a very limited number of nurserymen in Ireland and they are carrying a very limited amount of stock.  It seems to me that the demands upon the stock which the nurserymen have will not enable persons who wish to replant to get the particular kind of trees which they want and, even if they get the particular species, they will not be able to get good plants.  I would like to know if the Minister is satisfied that the enormous number of trees which will be required can be provided by the nurserymen of this country.  If they cannot, will provision be made either by the Department itself growing them&mdash;which I do not think is desirable, because I do not want to see the Department in competition with commercial firms&mdash;or by importing them so that persons who are replanting their lands will have proper young trees to plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take for example the case of larch. I look upon larch as far and away the most valuable of all timbers that can be grown in Ireland.  I look upon larch, certainly for home use, as being the most valuable timber.  It is wanted for carts, for posts, for gates. It is wanted for everything the farmer needs.  I happened the other day to get a catalogue from one of the most prominent growers of trees in this country, a nurseryman who has establishments in three different counties. There is not a single larch tree mentioned in his catalogue and seemingly <Col N="2393" /> he has no larch trees for sale.  For that reason, I want now to draw the attention of the Department to the difficulties which may arise, and which, in my judgment, almost must arise when the demands for trees, possibly running into millions, will be sent to the nurserymen in this country and the nurserymen will not be able to fill them.  Of course, as I suppose every Deputy in this House who is interested in this subject knows, the Department have more or less a rule of thumb that wherever one tree has been cut another ten trees must be planted.</P>
    <P>Considering that a great deal of timber is being cut, it must be obvious to everybody that the number of young trees required will be tremendous.  It is obvious, also, that you cannot grow with success every class of tree upon every class of land.  In that respect, I should like to say that I think the inspectors of the Department of Forestry give very considerable assistance to persons who are selling timber, because not only do they carry out an examination as to whether the timber should be cut and a permit granted but they also give very great help and advice as to the correct kind of timber to grow upon particular classes of land.</P>
    <P>Dealing with that question of reafforestation, and the condition that ten trees should be planted to take the place of every one that is cut, I am beginning to wonder whether, in fact, that policy is being carried out.  I am not now talking of the cutting down that is taking place since the war began because, obviously, replanting could not take place in every instance since this large-scale felling started, but I know places all over the country where formerly there were well-timbered demesnes.  These demesnes were bought up and the timber was cut down, and I do not see a single one of them replanted not do I see any replanting going on.  I should like to know from the Minister whether the Department have ever prosecuted anyone for cutting down timber and not replanting, whether, in fact, that provision for replanting is not tending to become rather a dead letter.  There may have been prosecutions, and I am <Col N="2394" /> sure a number of persons have carried out their undertaking to replant, but I am equally certain that, as in the case of the Tillage Order, there were other persons who were very slow in carrying out their obligations.  It seems impossible for me to believe that everybody who was bound to replant has replanted and that in all these cases of failure to plant prosecutions have taken place.  It struck me that possibly the explanation is that the Department really have got no machinery to ascertain whether replanting has or has not been adequately and properly carried out.  If I am wrong in that, I should like the Minister to tell me so.  I should like to know how this policy of replanting is, in fact, being enforced.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech, if I might describe it as listening&mdash;I read the translation&mdash;it struck me that there is a great deal of timber in this country which is valuable for firewood and which is worthless otherwise.  As everybody knows, there were very large plantings in this country which stopped about 70 or 80 years ago, but very few persons continued these plantings because they were not expert foresters.  As a consequence, there is a great quantity of crooked beech and scrub ash which is magnificent firewood but which has no commercial value otherwise.  The Department might consider the question of making inquiries in the vicinity of sawmills as to the amount of such timber that is available.  I should like also to know from the Minister what is the experience of the Department with reference to the cutting up of firewood by means of the Wade portable saw.  I should like to be informed if any of these saws and cross-cuts which are driven by a very small engine are available or if the Department could make them available to persons who are anxious to cut wood for fuel, and who find difficulty in doing so, owing to the cost of labour.  I think most Deputies have seen these saws at work; they were always exhibited at the Dublin Spring Show.  One saw them there cutting through immense trunks of beech.  It strikes me that if these could be made available to persons who have such timber on their lands for the speedy <Col N="2395" /> cutting up of scrub wood, hazel and white-thorn, all of which make excellent firewood, a good deal might be done to help the fuel situation.  I fully agree with the concluding remarks of the Minister that timber which is valuable should not be permitted to be cut up for firewood when there is such a terrific quantity of other timber which is absolutely uneconomic and worthless for any other purpose other than firewood.</P>

      <P>'Sé mo thuairim gur ceart níos mó airgid a sholáthar ins an Bhóta seo.  I am sorry that a larger amount is not provided in this Vote.  The late Deputy T.D. Dowdall was a very keen advocate of reafforestation and I remember an occasion when Deputy Boland was Minister in this Department there was an argument between him and the late Deputy Dowdall as to the necessity for afforestation in this country.  One of the arguments put up by the Minister then was that there could be no comparison, say, between France and this country, because in France they utilised a very large proportion of their timber resources for firewood.  Now, at present we are using a very big portion of our timber for fuel as they do in France, and if we are planning for the future we shall have to plan for the provision of timber as firewood. Another former Minister, Mr. Connolly, said that the best investment this country could make would be 1,000,000 acres of timber.  We also see that there is an acute shortage of paper as a result of the war, and we are told by the paper manufacturers that if they had the requisite machinery here, they could utilise the soft timbers for the manufacture of paper.  That is the best argument in favour of what Mr. Connolly advocated, that we should go ahead with a very big forestry scheme to supply our future needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that the rule in regard to the planting of young trees to replace trees that have been cut is not being enforced.  I see from my own observations it is not being enforced. There is also the fact that the period <Col N="2396" /> left to an individual to plant trees to replace timber which has been cut is very indefinite.  I remember three years ago asking an official about an area in my constituency, and I pointed out that although it was three years since a wood had been cut there, nothing had been done in the way of replanting: &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we do not consider three years long.&rdquo;  I asked him: &ldquo;Do you consider four years long?&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nor five years.&rdquo;  Then I asked: &ldquo;Have you any definite period?&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;No, we have no definite period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Experts tell me that you can start to replant immediately after cutting timber.  I saw it done.  I think that the thinning of trees is not being looked after by the forestry section.  I spent a considerable time in Germany and the thinning of forests, both with machinery and with man-power, is one of the principal operations carried on by the Forestry Department there. The undergrowth is cut down and thinnings utilised for national purposes. In my county, which is supposed to be one of the best forestry areas, and within two miles of my home, there are belts that were planted by the county council 30 years ago in which trees are now smothering each other.  No effort was made to thin out these woods.  As a forestry unit has been established there, I suggest to the Minister that these belts, which were grown by pioneers in the forestry movement, should be taken over and made healthy, so that they would produce suitable soft and hard timber.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Forestry Department manned by people trained in the universities, and holding university degrees.  They should do a course at Avondale and work themselves up by doing practical work, and after spending years out-of-doors be able to progress and control the Forestry Department.  It is only by such a scheme that forestry work would be of national benefit.  I am not sure if it is the Minister's responsibility, but I should like to know what progress has been made in the drying of native timber, to make it <Col N="2397" /> useful for indoor and other classes of work for which foreign timber is not now available.  About three years before the war began a big timber firm from Staffordshire came to this country and purchased all the ash they could secure for use in aeroplanes. British aeroplanes have been made from Irish ash.  That firm wanted to establish a plant here, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave them every facility, but they could not agree to the terms, whereby 51 per cent. of the capital would be held in Ireland.  They disproved the contention that Irish timber is no good, because the manager, whom I know personally, told me that outside of Polish ash they could get nothing to touch Irish ash.  They bought up all the woods in which they could find ash.</P>
    <P>It is of importance to this nation that a drying process should be in operation in our saw-mills.  The gentleman that I mentioned described the saw-mills here as being most primitive and almost 50 years out of date.  While there is not much money available for forestry, the work done by the Department in my county has been excellently done.  The Department had a German adviser and it is possible to see that where his advice was availed of excellent work was done.  There does not seem to be the same activity now.  The work done in my county was excellent and I wish it could be extended.  I should like to see a felling of trees where it is absolutely necessary to provide firewood, but these trees should be replaced, and for that reason the sooner the Government makes more money available for the Department the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Estimate has been reduced since last year, but the Minister has explained the circumstances. I am sorry that the cultural side had to suffer, but the Minister stated that the Department were unable to procure seeds and plants.  If there was any year in which extra planting was required it was this year in order to replace the trees that have been cut down for firewood.  Deputies should realise the work that has been <Col N="2398" /> accomplished by the Department in the way of providing cheap firewood for poor people.  If that had been left to private enterprise, or if there was no competition, I wonder would the people in Dublin or the Dublin Corporation have been able to secure the cheap timber they got from the State forests?  They were able to get it on terms that kept down the price that would be charged by private individuals, by shopkeepers and others who wished to get rich quick.  Poor people were charged 1d. and 2d. each for wet logs.  It is a pity the Dublin Corporation did not get into touch with the Forestry Department earlier.  I observe that the corporation is now purchasing 12,000 tons of such timber. I notice that the Department have not increased the wages of the men who are cutting the logs.  These men are giving as useful service as the turf workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find, however, that these poor men are kept at the one old wage of 29/4 per week, with no tea allowance or any other concession.  If the Minister had gone through some of the woods during the past month he would have seen these men trying to exist and do their work on nothing but black bread&mdash;no butter, or even lard, for them, or anything else&mdash;and they are expected to work on that job, in the rain and the cold, at 29/4 a week because they remained loyally here in the country to give of their best to the country in this time of emergency. They are receiving less now in wages than the agricultural worker, while a man who had been working beside them and who joined the Construction Corps is costing the State 37/6 a week. The man who joins the Construction Corps only has to work a few hours in the day, but the man who loyally gave his service to this forestry work receives the miserable pittance of 29/4. The Minister said, in March last, that that matter was receiving attention, and now the turf workers have been offered higher wages simply because they have been on strike.  An inducement has been offered to the turf workers to continue working, but no similar inducement has been offered to the forestry workers, who remained at their work during the emergency, <Col N="2399" /> giving of their best in return for a miserable pittance.</P>
    <P>One complaint that I have to make in connection with the work of this Department is that in one area, around Aughrim, ten men out of 15 were selected for a small increase in wages. Now, that creates dissension.  Where you have permanent men who have been working there for years, without any complaint being made against any of them, and you select ten out of 15 for a slight increase in wages, that does not tend towards harmony.  I wish to pay a tribute to the Department, generally, however, with regard to their methods of promotion.  As one who has been in contact with the foremen and inspectors of the Forestry Department, and as one who has had some knowledge and interest in that Department, I must certainly say that my experience is that the inspectors and foremen are men who throughly understand their work and who can always help any Deputy in any difficulty and instruct him in matters affecting him.  The officials are most courteous in every way, from those on the lowest rung of the ladder to the highest.  I think that if some Deputies had more intercourse with these men they would appreciate that they are men of great practical experience. One thing that I admire about the Department is that, through scholarships and so on, every chance is given to the labouring men and the foremen, and there is no bar to promotion in that section.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the emergency work of providing fuel, why should not the Minister make strong representation to the Minister for Supplies for equal treatment for the men engaged in forestry work?  Is it not within the Minister's power to make a strong representation that these men should be supplied with tea in the same way as are the turf workers? They are often out from 7 o'clock in the morning and have to make long journeys, and there is no possible chance for them to get food from 7 o'clock in the morning until they get home that evening.  A number of them are married men, and I know that some <Col N="2400" /> of them, because they have no milk, take black tea with them, and that others, because they have a large number of children, do not take any tea with them because they might be depriving their children.  The result is that many of them go to work on black bread and tea, and some of them without tea.  Is it not the duty of the Government to show a good example, particularly in the case of their permanent employees?  The men engaged on this particular work should get at least sufficient to allow them to exist. Instead of that, we find that their wages to-day are what they were three years ago.  There has been no increase. First, the argument was that they should be treated as agricultural workers for insurance purposes, but the moment the wages of agricultural workers were increased, we were told that they could not be treated now on the same scale as agricultural workers because it might interfere with work on the farms and because the agricultural labourer is paid full time.  Very few farmers in my area cut a man's time because of a wet day.  There is always some work for him, and he is always in constant employment.  Besides that, he receives a bonus after the harvest. There is no argument to be made, so far as the forestry sections in County Wicklow are concerned at least, that if their wages were increased it would interfere with the wages for agricultural workers.  I am sure that the officials of the Forestry Department will agree with me that there is not an agricultural labourer for nine or ten miles around the locality I am referring to.  Where you have men engaged at the present time on forestry work, there is no farm work available.  They are all small farms there, and very few of them would have any employees, with the exception of one farmer, about ten miles away, and that farmer never employs more than about five men on his farm.  The others are all small men.  Therefore, the argument that if the Department were to increase the wages of the forestry workers it would interfere with agricultural workers in that area, cannot be sustained.</P>
    <P>I regret that this Estimate has been reduced.  I think the Minister stated <Col N="2401" /> that we have not a sufficient number of trees in our own nurseries for replanting, but I appeal very strongly that the Department should make representations to have a certain amount of work done in connection with replanting, not for the building of aeroplanes and so on, as Deputy Kennedy suggested, but for other purposes.  For instance, I am anxious that our Gaelic games should be kept alive, and if there is not a sufficiency of ash in the country the games will deteriorate for want of ash for hurleys.  There is also the matter of the preservation of game.  I am sorry to hear that our nurseries are not able to supply all the trees that may be required for the extra acreage of land that will be acquired for forestry purposes because, as I have pointed out, it is more essential now than ever that we should redouble our efforts in planting trees, considering that we saw thousands of tons of timber being brought down from County Wicklow, by rail and lorry, during the past 12 months, to be used for fuel.  I can see, of course, the difficulties that could be made in connection with the granting of permits and so on.  Every Deputy, probably, would be asked to get permission for somebody to cut trees for firewood and so on, but how long can that continue?  How long can the wholesale cutting down of woods and belts of trees all over the country continue, especially if we are not redoubling our efforts this year in replanting?  Unfortunately, under the Estimate, we shall have a smaller number of men employed on planting young trees this year.  One excuse is that we are unable to get the necessary fencing from another country.  Now, I am sure that wire would not be necessary in all cases, and I think there could be other means found to deal with that matter without going to great expense.  At any rate, that should not prevent the employment of the large number of men that are available in Wicklow on planting trees and making preparations for next October.  I could understand it in the case of certain areas where you are taking over portion of a large estate, but that does not happen in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister to <Col N="2402" /> make some statement with regard to the wages paid to forestry workers, because I do not believe they will continue to work much longer on the miserable wage they are receiving. They have been waiting patiently, and I am sure that the Minister is aware of the loyal service they have given, and I think it is very bad on the part of the Government not to recognise the position of these men owing to the present cost of living.  Every one of these men could have been earning £5 or £6 a week over in England, but they were waiting, hoping against hope that something would be done for them.  As one who has been in close touch with, probably, over 1,000 of them, I can assure the Minister that unless something is done they will not continue working there but will seek other work that is available in the area.  If they are not able to get farm work there is turf work on which they might get employment.  At the other side they are looking for men and are holding out big inducements to them to take employment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not attempt to justify a wage of 29/4 a week as being sufficient for those married men. Some of them are engaged on dangerous work in the saw-mills.  If they were employed by merchants who own saw-mills they would be in receipt of a trade union wage.  They are not receiving that from the Department. Some of them are working in the saw-mills for 30/- a week, while men in charge are only getting 40/-.  We have the position in the County Wicklow that Dublin shopkeepers are coming down there buying trees and becoming timber merchants.  They are offering big wages to workers.  Right opposite one of the State forests a Dublin merchant has purchased a wood and is paying double and treble the wages that the men employed by the Department are getting.  He is paying even more than some of the foresters are getting, and has guaranted the men six months' work.  Surely, if Dublin employers can afford to do that, the Government should give a lead by giving a reasonable increase in wages to their workmen, some of whom have had ten and 15 years' service.  I want to take this opportunity of thanking the <Col N="2403" /> inspectors, foremen and all others concerned for the advice and assistance they have given to me during a very difficult time in the last 12 months in connection with these workmen.  I appreciate their service and their help very much.  There were no disputes and no trouble, thanks to their tact.  In all the State forests in the county I received every assistance from all those officials.  I am sure the country will appreciate their action, because otherwise settlements might not have been arrived at.  We have had peace in the industry and the men have given loyal service.  I trust their action will be appreciated by the Minister, and that he will make some announcement indicating that the Department is prepared to accede to the demands they have been making during the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Britain were in control of the country, as she was at one time, and presented an Estimate of this sort for forestry, I wonder what we would have to say about it.  I well remember what people used to say before we got our independence as to what we could make out of forestry if the country were under our control. It is possible, of course, that we did exaggerate somewhat at that time.  I am certain, however, that if a foreign Government brought in an Estimate of this sort, at this time, we would all be very disgusted with it, and loud in our denunciations of the Government that did it.   We would say that if we were in authority we would be able to make a success of forestry, and would bring in a very different Estimate. I am not prepared to advocate that this country should be converted into an extensive forest or that we should have extensive forests here and there linked up with one another.  It is possible that if we did that it would be an injustice to the people because we cannot afford to plant good arable land with timber.  But we have thousands and thousands of acres of land that is not good arable land which could be planted, land that is no use for other purposes, and yet we do nothing about it.  Owing to war restrictions, <Col N="2404" /> questions of finance and various other things it may be held that this is not an opportune time for doing much in that direction.  I would remind the House, however, that an emergency period very often brings out the best that is in people.  I am sure every Deputy will agree with me on that.  The Land Commission Vote was under discussion up to a very short time ago, and for the purposes of my arguments may I refer to the great difficulty that existed up to the time of the emergency in getting turf banks allocated to people all over the country, and, in fact, getting the Land Commission interested in turf?  But when the emergency came, the Land Commission, so to speak, took off its coat, and gave turf banks to everyone. If this emergency educates us as to the future possibilities of this country, so far as the growing of timber is concerned, then possibly some good will have come out of it.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy said that this country could afford to have 1,000,000 acres of forestry.  It could, but how are we to arrive at that position?  We are not going to do so on the basis of this Estimate.  We cannot possibly hope to carry through a decent forestry programme on the basis of this Estimate.  We find that there are 60 people engaged on the administrative side of the Department, and 122 people on agricultural operations and maintenance. That is, of course, apart from the ordinary labour employed in the forests.  If we are going to have a forestry scheme for the country it will have to be a considered one by people with technical knowledge, and possibly by people who have not technical knowledge but who feel that what has been done in other countries could be done here.  At the present time we have young men clearing out of the country for want of work, and at the same time Estimates being presented to this House which make heavy demands on the taxpayers to provide employment for people.  But what employment have we ever provided? Nothing, so far as I know, that will result in the creation of a national asset.  Expenditure on forestry would provide a national asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2405" /> I remember the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance saying that he was most anxious to get schemes on which he could put men working.  But the next thing that happened was there was a shortage of fuel, and the men were diverted to the bogs. That is useful work, but it does not create very much of an asset for the future.  I would not have any fear that if we borrowed £5,000,000 for forestry we would get it repaid.  It would mean the creation of a national asset if we went the right way about it.  It may not be possible to do that now.  It certainly cannot be done on the type of Estimate that we have before us, or with the type of mind that we have behind that Estimate.  I am not finding fault either with the officials in the Forestry Branch or with the Minister.</P>
    <P>They have had a kind of legacy handed down to them, a kind of tinkering with forestry, so that we have not yet made a real start in forestry. While we follow the course that we cannot take over land and plant it unless we can link up that particular portion with some other portion and put a forestry official in charge, we will never get anywhere.  We must eventually, if we are to make it a success, adopt some scheme whereby we will get the five acres, the ten acres, the 20 acres and the 100 acres planted, wherever they are.  Certain people who are very interested in forestry and who have had experience of it in other countries were endeavouring to put across in this country a scheme whereby we would have very extensive forests.  I do not think you can ever have that, and I should not like to see that.  This other idea of getting all the land that is not useful for other purposes but is useful for forestry, planted in small patches, will have to be tackled sometime and somehow.  I do not know who will be the pioneer in it, but until we do that we will not get anywhere with forestry.</P>
    <P>I notice that in his opening statement the Minister referred to the acquisition of land and stated that it takes time and that the question of title causes delays.  Of course it does; it always has.  I understood that we had got over that difficulty under the <Col N="2406" /> Land Acts where land is being acquired for the purpose of redistribution. Is it possible that that has not been extended to forestry?  If that is so, then we ought to extend it to forestry.  If we acquire land for redistribution and, instead of delaying possibly for years in order to look into the question of title and who is to get the price of it, we take a short cut, as we have done by an Act of this House, is it possible that we have still the question of title to land which is being acquired for forestry in the position in which originally the title to land was placed in regard to redistribution? The Minister says it is unlikely that all these negotiations will be completed within the year as the investigation of title is frequently a slow process.  If there is a short cut in connection with that in regard to the acquisition of land for redistribution, that short cut ought to apply in the case of forestry, and if it is necessary for this House to pass any Act, that ought to be done.  There is no use in trying to tackle it in a piecemeal way. The work is there waiting for the unemployed and for the young men in the country.  It will take people with strong minds and with vigour and energy to tackle the matter properly. There are acres of land which want draining for the purpose of forestry and acres of land that want to be cleared of scrub for the purpose of forestry.  There is nobody bothering his head about that.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, as I said in the beginning, that if this country was governed by an outside Government we would be all up in arms against an Estimate of this sort and against the inactivity of the Government in regard to forestry.  At present bogs are being developed and turf being cut where it was never cut before.  I should like to know if, in connection with these developments, an eye is being kept by somebody on behalf of the Forestry Department, whether it is the Land Commission that do it or otherwise, to see that when bogs are cut out to a certain extent accommodation will be left for planting.  In the past, bogs have been cut out and left in slush, so that they are no good for anything.  What I am afraid of is that there is no foresight <Col N="2407" /> in connection with this policy and nobody making any bold attempt to deal with the matter.  An Estimate of this sort might be useful for a part of the country or for a county.  One country should be able to absorb the amount of work provided for.  As I said, it may be alleged that the present is not an opportune time.  I do not agree with that.  I think the present time, when people are shouting for work, when people are leaving the country for work, and when people are seeking for work at the labour exchanges and cannot get it, is the time to tackle it.  If we are borrowing money, let us borrow money for something of this nature.  There ought not to be any fear about doing it.</P>
    <P>There are some small matters in the Estimate to which I might draw attention; but the thing, to my mind, is so trivial that we ought to direct our attention to having a bold policy of afforestation for the country.  I have stated that in this House on a previous occasion and I am restating it to-day. As it is presented, I think the whole thing is trivial.  I think it will get us nowhere.  We ought to attack it boldly, and we ought to keep in mind what the emergency has taught us.  It has taught that if we had more timber we would not be in the position we are to-day with regard to fuel, wood pulp, and timber for building purposes.  If we are to have self-sufficiency in any branch, let us have it in the branch in which it is possible for us to have it without any loss, indeed with a definite gain in income and as a definite asset to the country.  This is not a case of investing money in industries where you have to import raw materials and where you may not be able to import them.  Here is a definite national asset which should be tackled.  Nobody has yet tackled it.  I hope that somebody will have the brains and the energy to say: &ldquo;This is something that can be made into a good national asset and which will absorb the unemployed.  This is something which will give work to the people who want work, which will give a living to those who are at present on the dole.  It must be tackled boldly; go ahead and have it done.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wish to touch upon a few points in connection with the Estimate.  One is the question of wages.  I have been approached by number of forestry workers about this matter and I know the conditions under which they work and the distance from home at which they generally have to work.  I think that the Minister should seriously consider raising the wages of the forestry workers.  I will take one case, and that is, the scheme in operation in Killarney district.  On an average, the workers live a distance of six or seven miles from the forestry scheme.  The plantation goes up from the bottom of a mountain to about 500 feet above sea level.  The result is that very often it takes a man about one and a half hours to get to his work and one and a half hours to get home again.  The men cannot get any hot meals except they light a fire on the mountainside. They are probably 11 or 12 hours without what you might call a real hot meal.  I am fairly satisfied that, in justice to the workers, the wages should be brought from 29/4 per week at least to the agricultural rate of wages of 33/-.  If the wages are not brought up to that point I am afraid that the Forestry Department will find that they will have a very small staff. A number of men have come to me and asked me to assist them to go to England. I told them I understood there was a certain amount of work on the forestry schemes and I got in touch with the supervisor of the scheme in Killarney and he was good enough to take them on.  But they are kicking at the moment and it is up to the Minister, if he wishes to see a development in forestry, to increase wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Department should extend their efforts to acquire land for the development of forestry schemes and to proceed as soon as possible with the drainage of lands that are considered suitable. I know there is a shortage of fencing, especially of wire netting, but nothing should stop the Department from going ahead with drainage.  That would mean the employment of quite a lot of labourers. In addition, I suggest that they should increase the forestry centres.  I have <Col N="2409" /> been in the Department on a number of occasions, particularly with reference to the district of Cordal, near Castleisland, where suitable land has been offered.  It has been certified as suitable for plantation purposes, but no scheme has yet been started in that area.  In the district of Kilgarvan there is an area of 500 or 600 acres and the land there formerly grew trees.  I think it could be brought under a forestry scheme.  I should like again to stress the importance of the wages question.  If the Minister does not deal soon with this matter of wages, it is my opinion that he will find very few men working under forestry schemes next winter.</P>

      <P>In this Estimate it is somewhat remarkable to see that there is a reduction of something over £43,000.  For the past ten years, indeed since the present Government came into office and perhaps for some time before that, one could see posters on almost every gateway indicating what Fianna Fáil would do with this country in the matter of tree planting.  After the passage of so many years, to see the Fianna Fáil Government reducing the Forestry Estimate by such a large amount is certainly startling.  The reduction is made at a time when there is a greater demand for Irish timber than there has been in the last decade.  If one travels by road or rail in any part of the country, one cannot fail to see lorry loads and train loads of timber.  I admit the Government have done something in the matter of afforestation, but they have barely touched the fringe of the problem and the reduction in the Estimate rather indicates that they are not prepared to do much more than touch the fringe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago, on the Forestry Estimate, I referred to the area of land in Connemara that was quite suitable for tree planting.  So far as I can recollect, I think the area was given at 185 acres.  That area was increased to a small extent later.  The calculation was made by experts who apparently did not know this country.  It was given by experts who came from another country, and apparently they <Col N="2410" /> based their estimate on some planting that had been done in and about Carna by the Congested Districts Board. That planting was done by people who did not seem to know very much about tree planting, because the scheme failed.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to tell us that an area in excess of 185 or 200 acres is about to be planted in such a suitable locality as Connemara.  I am glad that Deputy Bartley is here, because he may be able to let us know what is being done in that portion of the country.</P>
    <P>I observe that the sub-head covering cultural operations is down by about £43,000.  Is that an indication that the Forestry Department is prepared to do its job?  Last year the Parliamentary Secretary promised us that the Government would reduce the minimum area for tree planting purposes from 300 acres to 50 acres.  Until that time we were always told that it was not economic to plant less than 300 acres. I should like to know how many properties of 50 acres have been planted in the meantime, or has there been any attempt to acquire such land.  I suggest that some help should be given to people even with smaller lots, such as 25 acres, in order to enable them to carry out planting schemes on waste land.</P>
    <P>I find in some districts that land suitable for small holdings is being planted.  I am not an authority on tree planting, but people tell me that some lands are let go waste and, when questions are asked, the only answer is that it is not economic to plant.  We were all told in our schooldays that in order to have a fertile country it was necessary to have trees.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence and encourage afforestation. If the Minister for Finance were here, I would ask him to increase the estimate by the amount of the reductions indicated here.</P>
    <P>The quantity of timber that is leaving the wooded areas at the present day is enormous, and I should like the Forestry Department to consider the whole matter very seriously.  The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated the difficulty of getting title in respect of <Col N="2411" /> certain lands and also the difficulty of fixing a price.  I should like to know what provision is being made in the Department for replanting the lands on which timber is now being cut.  It I should not be difficult to make provision for the replanting of such land, seeing that most of it is already in the possession of the Department.  I also find in the country districts that a lot of the timber is going beyond its commercial value.  I know certain districts that will be of very little use after five or seven years.  There are large properties on which the timber is being cut, and I think some provision for replanting in those places should be made immediately.  The land is in the possession of the Department.</P>
    <P>I also know of cases where people are anxious to cut beech for fuel purposes.  During the past few months they purchased 100 feet here or 200 feet there, and now they have been refused permits.  Beech is good for fuel, and it is very little use standing on the land. If people are anxious to cut 100 beech trees why should not the Department give the permit and stipulate that some more useful wood should be planted? If they did that, they would get people interested, but they cannot get people interested when the heads of the Department are not really interested. I say that because with the cut in the Estimate they will not be able to deal with the situation at the present time. It may not be their fault that the Estimate is cut, but I think the Minister should take the matter up seriously because, at the rate at which timber is being cut at the present time, there will be very little timber left in this country after a few years.</P>
    <P>A lot of timber is being used for building purposes, and there is one offence in which I found, 12 months ago, the greatest culprits are the Land Commission, that is, cutting timber one day, sawing it the next day and putting it into houses the day after. Whoever gets these houses will have arrears of annuities because they will have to leave the houses in which such timber is used.  I would like to know what action the Government are <Col N="2412" /> taking towards providing sufficient drying plant in the country.  There is one&mdash;whether it is operative or not at the present time I could not say&mdash; but drying plant should be provided for timber that is going to be used in public buildings by the Board of Works, the Land Commission and other local authorities, and in all housing at the present time.  It is a waste of money to be using unseasoned timber for building purposes.  Drying plant should be provided and the timber should be brought up to a standard as closely approximating to well-seasoned imported timber as possible.</P>
    <P>There is another order made by the Land Commission with which I do not at all agree.  Where they accept tenders, say, from Dublin, Cork, or Limerick merchants for cutting timber they have made an order in my district that that timber can be cut only by the officials of the Forestry Department. That is most unfair.  This is a very recent order and I know very well where it applies.  I think it is most unreasonable that when any Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford or Galway merchant buys a wood, it is stipulated that it will have to be cut by Forestry Department workers.  The Forestry Department men will come in the winter time and will go to what they call a bog wood.  The wood may not even be cut to the merchants' requirements. The Forestry Department have plenty of work to do in cutting waste timber for fuel purposes for the cities without interfering with private merchants who are paying a good price for the wood and for labour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley mentioned wages. Wages seem to be a snag down the country also.  The Dublin, Limerick or Cork merchant may be paying 36/9 a week, or something like that, for an eight-hour day.  The Forestry Department are not paying that.  Then trouble always arises.  You have two sets of men in the same wood, one set working for over 30/- a week and another set working for under 30/- a week. There should be some rearrangement.</P>
    <P>My main concern is that the work of afforestation should be expedited and that we should not be told year after year that there is trouble in acquiring <Col N="2413" /> land.  We have heard every year for the last number of years that there is trouble in acquiring land, in fixing prices and in the matter of title.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that, as soon as trees are cut down, plans are ready to replant immediately. I would next appeal to him to see that where trees have passed maturity they should be cut down and the area replanted straight away, and that where the ordinary merchant buys trees for fuel to supply the city at present he should get some consideration and that permits should be granted.  I hope the Minister or the Government will consider the question of providing drying plant for timber that is being cut down for building purposes, and that the Minister will give us some definite reply as to what the proposals are in regard to Connemara or whether districts in Connemara have been examined as to their fitness for planting.</P>

      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that this year above every other year the Estimate for afforestation should be reduced, when one considers that at the present time the country is being denuded of timber and that desperate efforts should be made by the Forestry Department to replace what has been taken away in the past year.  One wonders if any preparations at all are being made for the replacement of the timber that has been taken away.  Of course, it has been stated by the Minister, and I suppose he will say it again, that there is difficulty at the moment in getting trees and seedlings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that is true or not.  I am rather doubtful as to the accuracy of that statement but, even if it were true, preparations should be made in various parts of the country to prepare the ground for the time when the seedlings or young trees will be available.  To my mind, the Forestry Department are not taking a serious interest in the question of providing timber in this country.  One important matter has been mentioned by Deputy Brodrick, <Col N="2414" /> namely, the question of providing drying plant for timber that is used for building or commercial purposes.  As he said, in various parts of the country, timber is being cut down and used in houses and buildings a day or two after it has been cut down.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Brodrick said, that is not a very wise policy, because anybody who knows anything about timber knows that that kind of timber will shrink or expand or warp.  Any building in which timber of that kind is used will collapse in a very short space of time.  I would suggest to the Minister that some effort should be made by his Department to secure that drying plant is established in different parts of the country with a view to getting timber seasoned for building purposes.  Even if the war were over in the morning, there would be such a demand for foreign timber in England and other countries where there has been large-scale demolition owing to aerial warfare, that foreign timber will not be available to this country for a number of years.  I think I am right in that statement.  Therefore, the sooner the Ministry and the Government generally see to it that some drying plant is secured so as to provide timber for building and other purposes, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of wages which was raised by Deputy Crowley, Deputy Brodrick and others, I cannot understand the mentality of this Government at all.  It seems to be moving in the direction all the time of a low standard of living and low wages for the workers under their control.  I have heard Deputy Crowley referring to the fact that in Kerry men are working on afforestation for 28/- or 29/- a week, while the agricultural labourer has 33/- a week.  I remember a few years ago raising the question of forestry workers' wages in this House, and we were told that the men engaged in forestry would always be given the same wages as the agricultural labourers.  As a matter of fact, we were told that in some cases men working on afforestation would be paid a little more than the men engaged on agriculture.  Now we have a situation in which the men engaged on <Col N="2415" /> afforestation, although I suppose it is agricultural work, are paid 4/- or 5/- per week less.  Surely the Minister will agree that that is very inequitable, to say the least of it, and that something should be done immediately to secure that the wages of the forestry worker will be on the same plane as those of the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>I notice that under sub-head C 3&mdash; Timber Conversion&mdash;sawyers, enginemen and labourers are employed&mdash; sawyers at 40/- a week and labourers at 30/- a week, inclusive.  Surely the Minister does not suggest for a moment that that is a fair wage, that it is anything approaching a living wage or that it is anything approaching the figure that is paid by employers who engage men at sawing in any part of the country?  Nobody in the country or in any small town who has a sawmill would think of offering a wage as low as 30/- a week to a labouring man to attend sawyers.  In the first place, the wear and tear of clothes and boots involved in the work would demand that a wage higher than that paid to an ordinary labourer should be paid to these men.  I think it is disgraceful &mdash;in fact absolutely criminal&mdash;for any Government Department to pay a wage as low as 30/- a week to a labourer engaged in sawing.  Government Departments should set a headline for other employers in the country, but, instead of that, the wages that this Department pay are considerably lower than those paid by owners of small saw-mills in the country.  As I said before, the mentality of members of the Government seems to move in the direction of low wages for the working class.  In practically every Department of State it will be seen that the wages paid to a working man are less than those paid by any ordinary businessman to his employees.  The Government ought to see to it that they put their house in order in this connection.  It is not at all to be wondered at that we have men going by the hundred across Channel into dangerous positions, into the middle of a war situation, in order to earn sufficient to keep their wives and children from hunger and starvation.  It is a <Col N="2416" /> policy such as this that is responsible for so many people migrating from this country and the sooner the Government realise that the better.  The wages of men engaged in forestry should at least be brought up to the level of the agricultural labourer and men engaged in saw-mills should have considerably more than 30/- a week.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to refer to the question of tree planting in Connemara were it not that Deputy Brodrick made reference to it.  In reply to his question I can only say that west of Oughterard nothing has been done.  In fact nothing has been attempted.  I have long ago given up hope that anything would be done in the way of large-scale afforestation. When the foreign expert was in the forestry division, I had interviews with him on a number of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the issue is not taken sufficiently seriously for that in my constituency.  In addition to that fact, the land in my constituency which I was told would be suitable for planting such as the Maam Valley, cannot be got.  There was another district in the Recess area which the foreign expert told me possibly would be suitable.  I have been puzzled for a number of years why the forestry division has not done something in that particular area.  I am very disappointed that it has not been attempted.  I pointed out to the foreign expert that in a place near Oughterard trees had been grown and had been cut down during the last war. His reply was: &ldquo;Yes; trees were grown, but trees and timber are not the same thing.&rdquo;  I asked him to explain that, and he said: &ldquo;Well, if you want to get an idea of what we mean by timber, you might think of a tree of the thickness of a man's body.&rdquo;  That statement was made to me <i>ex cathedra</i> and my enthusiasm about forestry on a large scale in my area oozed considerably.  If we cannot grow timber, we can at least grow trees.  I do not see why the suggestions made by some Deputies here, namely, Deputies Brodrick and Brennan&mdash;and I referred to the same matter <Col N="2417" /> here myself on one or two previous occasions&mdash;could not be carried out, that is, that officials, such as officials of the Department of Agriculture who are constantly on their rounds, should co-operate with the forestry division in picking out smaller patches of land which would be suitable for planting amenity belts.  I think a good deal could be done in that way.  A considerable amount of timber could be produced in these belts if the scheme were taken up in a systematic way.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to representations that were addressed to me recently by the Cong Parish Council with reference to the state of affairs at Ashford.  The complaint is made that a number of workmen have been dismissed recently there.  I also had representations from another source that the number of people employed in the saw-mills at Cong is not by any means sufficient to meet the demand for timber.  I think these representations should get the very serious attention of the Minister and his Department.  I believe that the demand for timber is much greater than can be met by the number of men working in the woods.  Certainly the number working in the saw-mills is not nearly sufficient to deal with it.  I would ask the Minister to give serious attention to complaints of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I know very little about afforestation and I am rather bewildered by the views expressed here on this question.  Some Deputies have spoken of the potential wealth of timber production in this country.  I am aware that this is a highly controversial subject.  Much has been written in favour of afforestation and possibly not so much against it.  I still have an open mind on the question.  I am open to be convinced that we should go in for that large-scale afforestation on lands suitable for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should try to get some sort of agreement in this House as to the type of land we are prepared to devote to forestry.  I do not think any Deputy will contend that land suitable for agricultural purposes should be devoted to <Col N="2418" /> forestry, in other words, that where men can live and produce food trees should be planted.  If there was agreement on that it would certainly narrow down the amount of land available for afforestation.  That is on the fertility side.  On the other side, you have a certain type of land that is unsuitable for the production of commercial timber, because of the absence of fertility. Deputies know that in order to grow commercial timber there must be some degree of fertility in the soil. Small trees might be grown, but commercial timber could not be grown, so that it would be an unprofitable undertaking for the State to plant land of that type.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister if at any time a survey has been made of the possibility of acquiring that narrow margin of land suitable for forestry.  Was any proper survey ever made as to the possibility of a large-scale development of afforestation on suitable land and at the same time suitable for production of commercial timber?  If that survey has not been made it would be well if some attempt were made to provide it in the near future.  Certain people in this country think of afforestation as having immense possibilities as a source of wealth.  I am inclined to question that view.  However, living in a Leinster county, where there is very little afforestation, with the exception of Wicklow, possibly I am not as conversant with the subject as other Deputies.  After reaching agreement in deciding that we should not plant land suitable for food production, or put trees where men can live, and eliminating land that has not sufficient fertility, is it possible to get an idea as to the acreage available for forestry?</P>
    <P>In judging what our policy should be in regard to afforestation, I do not think present conditions should influence the permanent policy.  I agree with the Deputy who said that this emergency provides the opportunity to make use of any mature timber we have.  Obviously it is of more value now than it is likely to be for many years, and this is the time to get rid of it. <Col N="2419" /> We are forced in present circumstances to make use of any timber that is available.  There is something to be said for the case made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  Is the Department making any provision for the replanting of land that has been stripped of timber?  Have we sufficient young trees to do so?  I am afraid that aspect of the case has been neglected.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some information about it.  Nurseries may not be in a position to supply requirements for planting purposes.  I am inclined to agree that the Department has been rather lax about insisting on the provision that where a felling licence is granted replanting must be done within a period of 12 months.  In practice, little or no replanting was done within the statutory period.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that sufficient encouragement is not given to people generally to plant small woods in order to beautify the country and to provide shelter belts.  Possibly the problems of forestry generally are sufficient to engage the attention of the small staff available, but that is a branch of work which should not be overlooked.  Every encouragement should be given to acquire small areas, not from the point of view of producing commercial timber but of improving the general appearance of the country and providing shelter belts in exposed districts.  I wish the Minister could give information on these matters, and as to the amount of land available for afforestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we consider the amount of timber which is being felled at present, and the extent to which the country is being denuded of timber, as well as the number of people unemployed, it is a matter of very deep regret that it has not been possible to extend afforestation.  The Minister stated that the two causes contributing to the rejection of such a policy were lack of seeds and the impossibility of procuring sufficient fencing materials.  Having regard to all the circumstances I consider that some steps should have been taken to overcome these difficulties.  If they cannot be overcome, at least a considerable <Col N="2420" /> amount of work should be done in regard to executing drainage and developing land suitable for planting. Deputy Hughes referred to a type of land that ought to be used for afforestation.  Wicklow is one of the most extensively planted counties in Ireland and, as far as I am aware, a considerable amount of land in Wicklow that was suitable for agricultural purposes has been put under afforestation.</P>
      <P>I can understand the difficulties of the Department in that respect.  For example, they may acquire a fairly large estate, or a number of holdings, for the purpose of planting, and it is their invariable policy to acquire as much land as possible in one locality for the purpose of facilitating supervision, protection, and fencing, and for other considerations.  Now, it very frequently happens that in a district they acquire a considerable amount of land which is not suitable for agricultural purposes, but which is suitable for planting, and in planting those areas they frequently isolate small portions of arable land, like small islands surrounded by forests, and in order to prevent trespass on the forests they find it necessary to plant those small areas, but I think that, while there have been exceptions in this respect, the general policy of the Department is not to plant land which is suitable for agricultural purposes.  I should like to point out, however, that a considerable amount of land, suitable for agricultural purposes, has been planted here and there throughout the Country Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to extending afforestation, as far as I can see, the big difficulty is to find a sufficiently large area in one district suitable for planting, and it invariably happens that it is very difficult to acquire an area of large dimensions, and in that way afforestation is being held up.  I know of one district in my own parish where negotiations have been going on for some years&mdash;in fact, a considerable number of years&mdash;in regard to the acquisition of land for planting.  The position is that they have found it possible to acquire a considerable amount, but not sufficient to justify a scheme, and they have found considerable difficulty in <Col N="2421" /> trying to acquire the additional amount which would justify a scheme, but have not been successful so far.  Now, I believe that that situation exists to a greater or lesser extent in almost every parish in the Twenty-Six Counties and in almost every townland.  There are small areas which are ideally suitable for planting, but under the present system it is not possible for the Department to undertake the work.  I should like to ask: Is it possible to devise any new scheme by which these smaller areas may be put under timber?  I think that such a scheme should be possible.  I cannot see that the difficulties are insurmountable.  I think it should be possible to acquire small areas of four, five or six acres, and I do not think there is any way of getting the enormous increase in afforestation that we need unless these small areas are planted, and they must be planted by the Forestry Department because there is no use in expecting or hoping that private enterprise will supply the needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the present emergency situation, which makes it inevitable that timber should be felled for firewood, I think it is absolutely essential that the rule in regard to replanting should be strictly enforced, and the less time that is allowed to elapse between the felling of the timber and the replanting, the better for everybody concerned.  If, for example, a land owner succeeds in disposing of a considerable amount of timber, thereby making a certain amount of money, the best time to expect him, or to compel him I might say, to undertake the expense of replanting is immediately after he has acquired that additional money.  That is just one consideration.  Of course, if timber for replanting is not available, it would create a difficulty, and I do not know how far the Department are prepared to meet the situation, but I think they should be prepared to sanction the growing or planting of any kind of hardwood timber which, if not of great commercial value, would at least have a value in providing shelter in place of the timber that had been felled, and would be useful for firewood at a later stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> As I have said, Wicklow is one of the most extensively planted counties in this country, and I think it is the county in which we have the greatest number of men employed in afforestation. As a farmer, I do not think the policy of paying the men employed on afforestation less than what is paid to agricultural labourers can be justified. The farmer or the smallholder is compelled to pay his labourers a fixed minimum wage of at least 33/- and there is no reason why a big institution like the Forestry Department should not be compelled to pay at least the same wage as is paid to agricultural labourers.  Now, we farmers and, I think, the agricultural labourers also, are inclined to assert that farming is the most laborious of all occupations, but I do not think we will dispute the fact that men engaged in the planting of timber on bleak hillsides, throughout the severity of the winter or the heat of the summer, when they get to work on those schemes, are less laboriously employed than agricultural labourers, and I do not think that the policy of paying a lesser wage to the forestry workers than to the agricultural labourers can be justified.  As Deputy Everett pointed out, those men, as far as a large part of County Wicklow is concerned, are not in competition with agricultural labour because, in a very large part of the mountain districts, there is very little agricultural labour required.  For that reason it would be only simple justice on the part of the Minister's Department to see that those men are paid at least as good a wage as the agricultural labourer.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to undertake, or to see that there is undertaken, an intensive survey of land suitable for planting.  I know that in West Wicklow there are large areas which have not been planted and which are eminently suitable for planting. It may be, as I have said, that it would be difficult to find in one particular locality a very big acreage of land suitable, but over the entire county, or an entire section of the county, it should be possible to find some thousands of acres, and I think that some portion of the Minister's <Col N="2423" /> Department should be devoted to overcoming the technical or administrative difficulties which stand in the way of having this work undertaken, because we will never get a very large increase in the acreage under timber until those small areas are planted.  Whatever difficulties may exist, I believe that they are capable of being overcome, and I should like the Minister to try to get his Department out of the rut of insisting upon having all their forests confined to one particular district.  They should be able to distribute the areas far and wide throughout the entire country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes is perplexed in regard to this Estimate as to how much land is available and what kind of land should be planted.  I think that what is wrong with a number of Deputies is that in their wild days they looked upon this country as another Canada or America where there was so much land that you could do all sorts of things.  I have observed during my membership of the House that the Deputies who are most eloquent in pleading for the acquisition of land to put congests on are those who are most anxious to see an afforestation policy put into effect.  We have, however, got to bear this fact in mind that this is a very small country, and that land hunger is a more acute problem with us than it is in any other country in the world.  The net issue for us, therefore, is: are we going to have trees or men?  I am all for an afforestation policy.  There is no county in Ireland more in need of such a policy, if it could be carried out on an economic basis, than my native county.  There is no use in thinking that trees will grow anywhere.  They will not.  As Deputy Hughes has pointed out, the land that you propose to grow timber on must have some fertility in it.  It may be possible to grow scrub or cover on any kind of land that will give woodcock shelter from the frost and snow, but it is timber we want and not scrub.  There would be no use in any Government adopting a policy to do that.  The amount of land available for producing timber for commercial purposes is very limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2424" /> I was rather surprised to hear that the Department had not given an increase of a few shillings a week in their wages to the men employed in the forests so as to bring their wages up to the agricultural wage level.  In pre-war days the defence made for not giving them an increase was that they had to be kept at the rate of wages paid to agricultural workers.  The wages of the latter have been increased, and therefore I think the Minister should give the forest workers the same wage.  They are both drawn from the same class of people and are working in the same areas, so that it would be a wise policy to have the wages of both on the same level.  The work to be done in the woods is heavy and laborious. With all respect to Deputy Cogan, I do not think it is correct to say that the work of a farm labourer is as heavy as that of the man employed in a forest.  Cutting down and removing old timber is a desperate job.  It is frightfully heavy work, and in my opinion there is no comparison at all between it and the work of a farm labourer.  I have as good knowledge of farm work as Deputy Cogan has.  No wire can now be procured to fence in new ground for afforestation, and that being so, I suppose no useful purpose would be served by holding an inquest as to why it is so.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is concerned about having timber to make carts and gates.  I agree that is a desperately practical proposition.  I think, however, that farmers should have provided themselves with sufficient gates for their farms in peace times so as to keep their horses, sheep and cattle from straying.</P>
    <P>What I am really concerned about is the position in the paper industry. I do not know any of the people concerned in it, but certain allegations have been made by them.  In fact, serious allegations were made by them during the past year to the effect that they put up proposals to the Minister, or to the Department, in regard to the conversion of timber into wood pulp.  At the time they made their proposals the machinery to enable that to be done was available.  I take it, however, that when the Minister, <Col N="2425" /> or the Department, consented to give the timber to the paper-mills the machinery was not available or, at least, considerable difficulty would be experienced in procuring it.  With all respect to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I think the Department should consider planting an extended area of soft timber that could be made available for the paper-mills which give employment to a good many workers.</P>
    <P>It would be very unfortunate if, due to the lack of timber, the industry could not be kept going.  In fact, whatever suitable timber we have available for conversion into wood-pulp should at once be set aside for that purpose so as to keep the paper-mills going.  In a time of emergency the timber normally required for house building and such work could be set aside for the purpose I suggest.  There will be plenty of opportunities for house building in peace times.  I do not know what amount of capital is in-invested in the paper-mills, but I imagine it is a considerable amount.  I am not a shareholder in the company and have no personal interest in it.  I am, however, very much concerned regarding the workers who are employed in the industry.  They are skilled people whose training takes a long time and it would be a great pity if, due to the absence of supplies of timber, the industry was not able to carry on. Everyone would become disgusted, and it might prove very difficult to start a venture of that kind again in the country.  I should like the Minister to deal with the allegations which have been made.  I do not know whether they are well founded or otherwise. This is the place to deal with them and I think they should be dealt with here and now.  It is the only opportunity the House has of considering these allegations and they are very serious allegations&mdash;that an opportunity was given to the Department to help a young industry and the Department put some petty obstacles in the way and did not rise to the occasion and do its job.  I should like the Minister also to tell the House if he will take up as a matter of Departmental policy the production of soft wood for wood-pulp in order to meet the <Col N="2426" /> requirements as far as possible of the paper industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions arising on this Vote which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister and his Department.  As to wages, I think the Minister should pay the highest possible wages to the workers.  As the matter has already been dealt with, all I say to the Minister is that men working on timber should be paid the highest possible wage for workers in this country.  Then there is the question of land, and what land is suitable for planting.  A survey should be made to get an exact estimate of the land which is suitable for planting, and a plan made as to the amount of land that could be economically developed in plantations.  Then there are a large number of acres already under plantations and several people have applied to the Department for permission to cut down these trees.  In my opinion, the Minister should take care before he grants a permit to these people to cut these trees that in return they will plant at least so many acres, not so many trees.  I would make a distinction between acreage and trees.  I know that if I get a permit to cut down X number of trees I must put down X number of new plants.  What I would like to see is that you must plant so many acres and that the plantation must be fenced in a certain way; that a person will not get a permit to cut trees until he undertakes to plant so many acres and to fence them properly, and that he will maintain them for a number of years so that we will have timber for wood pulp.  On the other hand, I would say to the farmer who has a 25-acre, a ten-acre or a five-acre farm: &ldquo;We will give you a subsidy from that other man's plantation.&rdquo; What I mean is this.  If I get a permit to cut 700 trees, once I get that permit I can apply to the Department for a grant to replant a similar number of trees.  When I cut down these trees, I will make money; I would not cut them if I did not.  What I want is that, instead of that money being given to me, that it should be given to the man who is prepared to plant 25 acres or five acres or one <Col N="2427" /> acre.  I want to divert the money and to get more new trees planted.  I want the Minister to see to it that he will not let me cut the trees unless I replant without any cost to the State. I want the Department, before they issue a permit to John Brown to cut so many trees, to make it a condition that he must plant so many acres; that if he cuts down 700 trees he must plant 2,000 new trees.  In that way we will maintain our forests.  If you do not do that, you will not have afforestation, and it is a very important matter. When the Minister issues a permit to a man to cut trees, he should put upon him an obligation to replant and also to subscribe so much to the Forestry Branch to allow another person to plant, say, one acre.  Deputy Cogan asked what the Minister was going to do about it.  What we should do is to tell the Minister what we think should be done.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, a commission should have been set up to inquire into the whole question of afforestation and told to adopt a bold policy for the afforestation of all the land that is suitable.  There are thousands of acres in Donegal, Cork, Longford, Wexford, Wicklow, Kildare and Carlow suitable for afforestation.  If the Government would give the Forestry Department power to go out and plant and replant and, before forests were cut down, to make it a condition precedent that so many acres would have to be replanted, the Forestry Branch, in my opinion, would make this country absolutely capable of supplying all its needs in the way of timber.  We would be able to supply wood-pulp to the paper factories and to provide timber for sheds which are required at present. It has been said that we cannot get timber for carts.  In the midlands there is timber suitable for carts&mdash; larch, oak and ash, all that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, no co-ordination of effort.  The Minister for Lands will give a permit for John Browne to sell the timber and cut it up, whether it is larch, oak or ash, for firewood, although it is required for carts. There should be some co-ordinated effort so that we will have a Forestry <Col N="2428" /> Department that will know its job from Alpha to Omega, from top to bottom.  We will then have something that we can depend upon.  If I want materials to make a cart I will know then where to apply for it.  I can go to the Forestry Department and the Department will know&mdash;at least if it does not, it should&mdash;that in the next county there are so many thousand trees of larch, ask or oak suitable for farmers' carts or for shafts for the shifters to shift in the hay and oats and do all the other work the Government are asking us to do.  If I want some timber and I do not know where to get it, it should be possible for me to get the information from the Department. If I write to the Department asking where I can get five or 100 cublic feet of larch or other timber, the officials there should be able to give me the information.  They should be able to tell me that it is in this that or the other wood or on State lands.  If the State lands have not got it, they should be able to say where it is procurable.  In that way you will organise the whole business, so that when the farmer is called upon to produce food he will know where to get timber for cart shafts or the shafts in the shifter and he will then be in a position to bring in his wheat, oats or hay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have already contributed to the debate, I want to protest on behalf of the forestry workers in my locality, because they are paid at a lower rate than the agricultural workers.  It is very unjust to ask forestry workers to accept a lower rate of wages than the rate paid to agricultural workers.  I live quite close to a big forest area and I know that the work there is very hard.  At certain periods of the year the men are engaged on drainage work, cleaning and clearing, and they have to travel long distances to their work.  At Ballyhooley the Forestry Department are doing great work.  They provide timber for the City of Cork and over an area within a radius of ten to 15 miles. They provide good timber at a very reasonable rate.  I believe they should not ask the workers to accept such low wages.  The work is hard and the <Col N="2429" /> workers carry out their duties under very difficult conditions.  They were working there when the weather was bad and I am aware that the conditions were anything but pleasant and, in the circumstances, it is only fair that they should be paid at the same rate as agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the granting of licences for the cutting of timber, I made an application some time ago to the Board of Works on behalf of the Kilworth Parish Council to make some timber available for the poor people of the district of Moorepark.  After some time we got a reply.  Then the Board of Works had to get a licence from the Forestry Department to cut the timber. We had to wait a long time for that. Eventually the Department sent an inspector to mark the timber.  He came to Moorepark and marked 85 trees.  If he got strict instructions to mark the most askward trees in the park he could not do his work better.  The 85 trees were marked along by the demesne wall in the hardest and most impossible places in which to cut timber.  Of the 85 trees, 60 were the worst in the park.  The result was that the Kilworth Parish Council could not dispose of them.  When a further application comes to the Minister from the Board of Works for a licence to make timber available at Moorepark for the poor of the district, I suggest that he will send down an inspector who will make a better effort at marking trees. I might mention that this is a non-turf area and, of course, the people cannot get coal.  There is plenty of timber there, in belts that can be replanted easily.  I appeal to the Minister to be more considerate when he is sending down the next inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the granting of licences to farmers for the cutting of trees, I have heard complaints that a long time elapses between the application for a licence and the receipt of same.  I must say that any time I had to go to the Forestry Department in connection with licences the officials got to work immediately and the licences were received a few days afterwards.  I have very little criticism to offer in connection with this Department.  Those who are engaged <Col N="2430" /> in the Department are doing great work, particularly as regards the forest at Kilworth.  I remember when that place was a plain, when all the timber was cut out of it.  Some 20 years ago the Forestry Department started to work there and to-day it is a pleasure, when passing along the old Dublin road from Kilworth, to see thousands of acres of splendid trees. They are a credit to the Forestry Department and a credit to the workers.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in view of the hard nature of the work and the long distances the workers have to travel, it is very unjust to have them working for a lesser wage than that received by the agricultural worker who is employed just the far side of the ditch.  As I have indicated, many of the forestry workers have to travel a long distance to work and I know of several instances where they cannot get tyres for their bicycles and they have to walk.  They are certainly deserving of an increase in their wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin seemed to be inclined to blame the Forestry Branch in connection with the difficulties that have arisen in the paper industry.  No matter what prevision was shown in connection with this matter, the fact is that we have not the reserves of timber, and will not have them for a considerable time, no matter how extensive our planting programme may be, to provide mature timber for the manufacture of paper. What happened in the matter to which the Deputy has referred is that the Forestry Branch made an offer to the paper company of a considerable quantity of soft wood for pulping purposes. The utilisation of this quantity of soft wood is dependent on the provision of paper machinery.  The paper company were unable to secure the machinery and the scheme fell through.  As far as the Forestry Branch is concerned, they have the timber still on hands and are ready to make it available if it should be possible to revive this scheme.  Experts <Col N="2431" /> in forestry believe that it ought to be possible to convert the type of timber which we can make available, as was stated in the public statement made on the matter.  It ought to be possible in a time of crisis to adapt ourselves and to adapt whatever machinery is available, or find some alternative means of pulping this kind of timber. The matter is being investigated further by the Forestry Branch and it is hoped that it may be possible to make certain suggestions for a scheme of partial conversion, at any rate, to the paper company.  I do not think it would be fair to blame the Forestry Branch for the fact that we have not mature timber available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister appreciates that I did not blame the Forestry Branch.  I referred to allegations that I saw were made.  The gist of those was that at the time when machinery was available for converting this stuff, the Minister would not give them the timber&mdash;or something to that effect.  I am sure the Minister has this material before him.  That is the gist of it.  This is the only opportunity we get of bringing these matters up and disposing of these allegations, whether they are true or otherwise.  I know nothing about the matter except what I read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not the mature timber on the scale that would enable us to start a paper industry.  Of course, many things are necessary or would seem to be necessary and desirable in a period of crisis which would not be at all desirable in peace times.  We cannot get over the difficulty that we have not mature forests.  As regards the provision of machinery, it is not a matter for us.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised the question of whether there are enough plants available for the replanting of the large number of woods that are now being cut down. This seems to be a matter largely for the nursery trade who are commercial suppliers of young trees.  In their own interests they would probably see to it that the best supplies possible are made available.  The Department will <Col N="2432" /> also be ready to extend their nursery accommodation and provision of young trees as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>On that matter, would it not be a good thing for the Department to acquaint the nurseries of the number of licences they were granting for the cutting down of timber so that they could plan their seedling planting accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is a useful suggestion which I will have considered. Wherever application is made for additional time to enable an owner to carry out replanting, we cannot deny him a good deal of latitude in the present circumstances.  The Forestry Branch is trying to provide for their own requirements as far as possible in the nurseries.  With regard to the general question of replanting, no prosecution has taken place so far, because the Act has not been in operation for a very long time.  It is only the stress of the emergency conditions and the large amount of felling that is taking place and, presumably, will continue to take place while the war lasts, that will bring more clearly to the notice of the Oireachtas the necessity for tightening up the legislation.</P>
      <P>We have been examining the question and we hope to introduce amending legislation.  The Forestry Act of 1928 was largely experimental, as most initial measures dealing with new services are.  There has been a certain amount of experience of its working and it is felt that amendments would be necessary even in normal conditions but that the emergency will probably create further difficulties which may render it necessary to amend the law still further.  As I have indicated to the House, the Branch is very busy at present with felling operations and dealing with licences, as well as with its own planting programme, but I hope it may be possible to introduce this legislation within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to the interest of owners of land to see that lands are not left idle but, as I have pointed out in my opening remarks, many of the larger landowners are not prepared, in the difficult conditions <Col N="2433" /> of the future, to face the task of replanting and very often lands are being offered to the Forestry Branch where it is felt that permission ought to be granted in existing circumstances to fell substantial amounts of timber.  It has to be remembered in that connection that we are completely dependent now on our own resources. For housing and every other activity, the building of huts for defence or for turf cutting and everything else for which it is required, the timber must come from our own resources.  Therefore we cannot reduce felling, though we would like to, and the general policy of the Forestry Branch is to restrict felling as much as possible.  In every case, of course, where felling is permitted the replanting condition is inserted and is made obligatory on the owner, but we have not enough experience yet of replanting and we could not during the war period ask people to replant.  They have not the means, in the first place.  Even the Forestry Branch itself finds it extremely difficult to carry on its work, but the whole matter is receiving attention from the point of view of strengthening the legislation, if it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of the provision of drying plants.  I believe there is a certain number of these in the country and that they are working satisfactorily.  The matter really concerns the Department of Industry and Commerce more than the Forestry Branch.  As regards saws and saw-milling machinery, it is extremely difficult to procure these at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy suggested that the forestry staff should be recruited from people who have actual experience of forestry work in the field, who are trained in afforestation work.  That is the course that has been followed. Trainees get every opportunity, as he indicated, of perfecting their knowledge of all branches of afforestation work.  They start off during their cadet course as labourers, and work their way upwards.  There is a regular system of promotion in the service so that all the staff are people&mdash;and this will be more and more the case in future&mdash;who received their first knowledge of forestry from the branch and who <Col N="2434" /> have grown up with it, so to speak. In future, as the service gets older, we shall have the position that we shall have men who have grown up with it, who have spent the years of their apprenticeship and the years of their manhood in the branch, and they will have a thorough knowledge of conditions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the wages question by many Deputies.  I explained to the House, in reply to Deputy Norton, that the question of the rate of wages of forestry labourers is a matter that is bound up with the wages of Government employees generally. A decision taken in a matter of that kind has reactions on all other Government employees.  Furthermore, regard must be had to the position in agriculture at the present time.  There are serious complaints of a shortage of labour which may become more acute as time goes on.  I think it will be admitted by unprejudiced persons, and by those who really have regard to the general interests of the community, that it would be a mistake to attract labour away from the farming industry at the present time.  The policy should be to attract it towards the agricultural industry as far as possible.  Therefore the rate of wages for forestry workers, as well as being affected by the general consideration of what the rate has to be for Government labourers in other Departments, must necessarily be affected by the position in the agricultural industry.  Deputy McMenamin says that the work is heavier than agricultural work.  It may be heavier, but at the present time farmers have a good deal of difficulty to contend with in carrying on their work.  The nation depends on that work very greatly, and it would be regarded as a serious and unnecessary imposition if we were to fix rates of wages that would draw labour away completely from the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I am reminded, of course, that people who migrate to England get higher wages.  That may be, but by the time they have paid to the various funds to which they are compelled to contribute and having regard to the standard of subsistence there, the difficulty of procuring necessary supplies, <Col N="2435" /> everything being rationed and in short supply, it is very doubtful whether the apparent rate of wages, high and all as it looks, bears any relation to what the real wages would be.  I think Deputies should bear that in mind and should not be making these comparisons between the wages that can be obtained across the water and what we can pay here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett was afraid we were growing no ash trees.  I am informed that in the year 1940-41 over 200,000 ash trees were planted out of the nursery.  Where the land is suitable and where it is possible, everything is being done to cultivate ash.  Deputy Brennan seemed to suggest that because we are in a difficult period and have not been able to carry on replanting to the extent we would like, nothing at all has been done by the State in the way of afforestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to wrong the Deputy but I would point out that the State has acquired 155,000 acres of land altogether for afforestation and that about 120,000 acres of that is productive.  Ninety thousand acres have actually been planted&mdash;most of this in the past ten years.  That is a pretty good record.  If we can make plans for doing bigger and better things after the emergency, well and good.  Unfortunately, the emergency has created difficulties for us which are very hard to surmount.  I was not here when the Deputy was speaking, but it seems that he is dissatisfied that more extensive afforestation is not being undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that it is very difficult to carry out afforestation work without fencing material and it is difficult to secure land.  There is no use in telling us that land in <Col N="2436" /> patches of 100, 50 or even ten or five acres should be planted.  If small patches even of five or ten acres are available near an existing forestry centre, they should of course be acquired but if not near a forestry centre, we have to get a nucleus of some 300 acres, as Deputies ought to know, to make a centre reasonably economic.  We want to know before starting a new centre that it will be possible to extend operations in the area.  Money is being actually paid at present to owners of small areas for planting themselves.  It would be quite impossible for us to do the type of planting on four or five or six acres which individual owners are asked to carry out and for which they receive grants from the State.</P>
      <P>We have as matters stand a large number of centres&mdash;well over 100 centres, which may increase.  These centres are scattered pretty evenly over the country.  You have an area like Wicklow which is fairly well planted.  There is a certain number of centres there fairly close together. Outside Wicklow operations are extended very widely over the country. It is very hard to plan a programme for each centre, having regard to the difficulties of the time.  There is not alone the question of fencing material but the question of plants, etc.  A staff has to be maintained at each centre. If you have an area like County Wicklow you are able to concentrate on it and a considerable amount of new land is coming in.  Then work can be much more economic than it is in some of these outlying centres.  Even the transport of timber when felled, and when it is being brought to the dumps for fuel purposes in the urban centres, presents difficulties at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin spoke about the question of timber control.  The Forestry Branch are not in charge of that work.  They act as agents for the Department of Supplies, and remarks about timber control would really be more appropriate on the Estimate for that Department.  The Forestry Branch is working in co-ordination with the Department of Supplies and that Department depends to a great extent on the specialised knowledge and <Col N="2437" /> experience of the forestry officers. It is possible that in the future the Forestry Branch will be asked to do more in the way of timber control.  It may be that more drastic control provisions will have to be brought in, and if so, that will throw an additional burden on the Forestry Branch.  The matter is under consideration from time to time and consultations take place between the two Departments.  Deputy Bartley referred to employment on the Cong estate. Additional employment was given at that centre because felling took place on a fairly large scale, but that was purely temporary work, and when the felling programme was completed these hands were unfortunately disemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the question of having a survey made of land available for afforestation.  There are a good many old reports, dating from the period of the British Government, regarding afforestation, and the amount of land available, but many of the estimates seem to be guesswork. At present it is thought that 600,000 acres would be available.  We know that the land is there but that there would be trouble in acquiring 450,000 further acres.  Before it would reach anything like 400,000 or 500,000 acres a good deal of the land regarded by the man in the street as being specially suited for afforestation would have been taken in.  To carry out a full programme of afforestation would demand a large acreage of very good arable land.  It is estimated that these 600,000 acres would provide for our entire home requirements of timber practically for all purposes.  Deputy Hughes has received some reports and is of opinion that land suitable for food production should not be taken for afforestation. I do not think there is any great amount of such land taken. There is a limit to what could be done in mountainy areas, except in special places like the Waterford and Slievebloom mountains.  The western mountain areas are not suitable, being too much exposed to make afforestation a commercial proposition.  A good many of the large estates have come into the hands of the Forestry Branch in recent years and will still come in with, perhaps, a few exceptions.  The question <Col N="2438" /> will then arise: where will we get the land for a comprehensive planting programme?  I agree with the Deputy that if we could have surveys of particular areas like West Wicklow they would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on the Land Commission Estimate, it is very difficult to carry out surveys and work of that nature, because while we have not lost staff as the Land Commission has, still a great amount of additional work has been thrown on the Forestry Branch. Because of the increased tree felling and timber control I doubt if it would be possible to carry out a survey now, but I can assure Deputy Cogan that the Forestry Branch is keenly interested in Wicklow, and realise that land coming in there is more economic to work and more convenient from their point of view.  Wicklow is the main centre of operations and small pieces of land are constantly coming in. If we are to continue a comprehensive programme of planting after the war, I think steps will have to be taken to survey large areas in counties like Wicklow, where land is not of first-rate agricultural quality, with a view to taking it in.  Certainly, on the present basis of dealing with individual owners, with rather small amounts of land, perhaps 50 or 100 acres, it is very difficult to carry out a big programme.</P>

Den mhéadú sin atá £9,400 ag teastáil le haghaidh Phinsean na nOide&mdash;costas atá ag fás ó bhliadhain go bliadhain. An caithteachas seo bhaineas le Pinsin na nOide, do thugas faoi deara go <Col N="2441" /> bhfuil sé ag leanamhaint go han-ghar don chúrsa a ndearna an tAchtuaire a réimh-innsint i mbliadhain a 1930; agus, má chruthuigheann an chuid eile dá réimh-mheas bheith chomh beacht céadna, beidh £540,000 de chostas bliadhantamhail orainn i mbliadhain a 1969&mdash;is é sin £125,000 níos mó ná suim an chostais seo fá láthair.</P>

Do mhínigh mé an scéal sin go hiomlán nuair do chuir mé Meastachán Breise i láthair na Dála i Mí na Samhna seo thart, agus ní riachtanach a thuilleadh ama do chaitheamh chun é do mhíniú an dara huair.</P>
    <P>Sa bhfó-mhírcheann seo, freisin, tá soláthair dhá dhéanamh le haghaidh tuarastal oide liteardha sna scoileanna ceartucháin agus sna scoileanna saothair&mdash;costas ar cuireadh tús leis i Meastacháin Bhreise na bliadhna seo thart. Nidh nach iongnadh, níor bhféidir an tseirbhís nuadh seo do thabhairt chun críche gan deacrachta nuadha, acht atáthar ghá réidhteach sin chomh tapaidh agus is féidir, agus táimid ag súil gur gearr go mbídh an teagasc liteardha sna scoileanna seo ar an mbun cóir, agus go mbídh sé go léir faoi chúram múinteóirí cáilighthe ag a mbeidh tuarastal sáthach maith.</P>

Do réir na bhfigiúr atá ar leathanach 202 de Imleabhar na Meastachán, ba dhóigh le duine gur hárduigheadh soláthar na seirbhíse seo ó £43,000 go dtí £45,000.  Acht is amhlaidh do measadh £45,000 ar dtús le haghaidh 1941-42, agus do b'éigean an figiúr sin d'athrú sa Mheastachán Breise, ar an adhbhar nach dtáinig oiread éileamh ó na Bainisteóirí agus d'fhágfadh riachtanas leis an suim iomláin.  Mar sin féin, táim ag iarraidh £45,000 i mbliadhna arís, óir táim ag súil go dtabharfar oiread aire go <Col N="2442" /> háiteamhail don tseirbhís thábhachtach seo agus go mbéidh £45,000, ar a laghad, ag teastáil.  Mar is eól do na Teachtaí, tugann an Stát uaidh £1 ós comhair gach £1 dá soláthruighthear go háiteamhail.  Níl san £45,000 ach meadhon-suim de £9 ós comhair gach scoile, agus measaim nach iomarcach bheith ag súil go bhfuighthí an oiread sin go háiteamhail uatha siúd ar mian leo na páistí do bheith go maith compórdach.</P>

Mar mhínigh mé don Dáil anuraidh, measann an Riaghaltas go bhfuil dhá dheagh-sheirbhís dhá gcoimhlíonadh sa gcás seo&mdash; congnamh do litridheacht Ghaedhilge, agus congnamh chun obair do sholáthar do lucht clódóireachta.  An méid do cuireadh ar fagháil le haghaidh 1941-42, cuireadh leis airgead do sábháileadh ar shlighte eile, agus is é is adhbhar do mhéadú na bliadhna seo go bhfuiltear ag brath gnó na bhfoillseachán do choinneáil ar obair chomh maith agus is féidir sin do dhéanamh san éigeandáil atá ann fá láthair.</P>

    <P>Maidir leis an mBun-Oideachas, is dócha gur cuimhneach leis na Teachtaí mé do bheith ag trácht ar a phrímhriachtanais, nuair do thugas isteach an Meastachán anuraidh.  Dubhairt mé gur bh'é an tOideachas seo ba chloch bhuinn do na seirbhísí oideachais go léir agus d'ainmnigh mé na prímhriachtanais bhaineas leis .1.  Foirgnimh mhaithe, deagh-oidí, an clár agus na modhtha teagaisc do bheith oireamhnach, agus na daltaí bheith ag freastal na scol mar ba chóir.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na dtighthe scoile, is áthas liom bheith i ndon a innsint don Dáil nach raibh an scéal go holc.  D'aimhdheóin an ghanntanais airgid, d'éirigh liom anuraidh beagnach £200,000 de dheóntais do chur ar fagháil le haghaidh tógála agus le haghaidh deisighthe foirgneamh scoile, agus, ina theannta sin, cuireadh ar fagháil £3,500 de dheóntais chun tighthe áirithe scoile do chur sa gcaoi ina bhféadfaí a n-úsáid nó go ndéantaí tighthe nuadha ina n-ionaid.  Na mór-dheóntais sin atá luaidhte agam, is é ba chuspóir dóibh 22 de thighthe nuadha scoile do thógáil agus fairsingiú nó feabhas do dhéanamh ar 213 de thighthe scoile do bhí ann cheana.</P>
    <P>Ar na deóntais do ceaduigheadh i rith na bliadhna bhí ceann le haghaidh tighe scoile do bhuachaillí i gCroimghlinn Thuaidh.  Tá sé sin dhá dhéanamh fá lathair, agus beidh áit do 1,000 dalta ann.  Sa gceanntar céadna tá teach scoile dhá dhéanamh le haghaidh cailín agus naoidheanán.  Beidh na trí scoileanna sin ullamh chun úsáide faoi Bhealtáine, 1943.  Maidir leis na nuadhcheanntair eile comhnaidhthe i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, tá trí cinn de thighthe scoile beagnach ullamh i gceanntar Ellenfield agus Larkhill (Druim Connrach Uachtair), agus táthar ag súil go mbeidh siad ionúsáidighthe faoi Mheitheamh na bliadhna seo. Tá pleananna críochnuighthe chun tighthe nuadha scoile do dhéanamh i <Col N="2444" /> gCabrach Thiar.  Do réir na bpleananna sin, beidh slighe do 600 dalta i Scoil na mBuachaill agus do 1,200 dalta i Scoileanna na gCailín agus na Naoidheanán.  Is furasta na pleananna do leathnú, agus nuair críochnóchthar scéim na dtighthe comhnaidhthe don cheanntar, beidh slighe i Scoileanna na gCailíní agus na Naoidheanán do 2,600 dalta, agus beidh slighe do 1,200 i Scoil na mBuachaillí.</P>
    <P>Ó bhí bliadhain a 1932 ann, caitheadh breis agus dhá mhilliún go leith púnt ar fhoirgnimh scoile.  Taobh istigh den tréimhse sin do tógadh 374 de thighthe nuadha scoile, do rinneadh 162 d'fhairsingiú agus do cuireadh bail ar 2,216.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliadhna seo caithte, do tógadh 45 de thighthe nuadha scoile, agus do fairsingigheadh nó do feabhsuigheadh 46.  Ina theannta sin tá 49 de fhoirgnimh nuadh dhá dtógáil agus 43 dá bhfairsingniú nó dá bhfeabhsú fá láthair.  Breis agus £200,000 costas na hoibre sin do chiste an Stáit.</P>
    <P>Is fiú a chuimhniú go speisialta gur riarachán paráisteach is bun-eagar do chóras na Scol Náisiúnta.  Réidhtigheann an t-eagar sin go maith leis an gcóras eaglaiseach.  Achar beag bliadhanta ó shoin, do mhol easpog Catoiliceach i leitir an Charghais é, agus dubhairt gur bh'eagar é do bhí beagnach gan locht.</P>
    <P>Ar an Stát atá sé de chúram tuarastal na n-oide d'íoc, agus, le n-a chois sin, tugann an Stát uaidh deóntais mhóra chun tighthe scoile do dhéanamh agus d'fhairsingiú agus chun iad do ghlanadh agus do théathadh.  Ós a chomhair sin, is ar mhuinntir gach paráiste faoi leith atá an príomhchúram maidir leis an gcostas a bhaineas le tighthe scoile do dhéanamh no d'fheabhsú no do choinneail faoi dheagh-bhail ina bparáiste féin.  Ní cúram gan sochar é, ámhthach; óir tugann sé caoi do dhaoine a chruthú tré ghníomhartha nach bhfuil siad gan an ghné is bunadhasaighe de ghrádh tíre&mdash;grádh dá gceanntar agus dá gcomhursain féin.</P>
    <P>Innseann an stair dúinn gur mhór agus gur bhuan an tsuim do bhí ag muinntir na hÉireann i n-oideachas a <Col N="2445" /> gclainne&mdash;go fiú nuair nach raibh de árus scoile ann acht scáth claidhe no fáil agus nuair do b'ionann, do réir dlighidh, an máighistir scoile agus an méirleach.  I n-aimsir ba déidheannaighe ná sin chuidigh na daoine chomh fial agus b'fhéidir leo chun gléas oideachais do chur ar fagháil dá gclainn.  Ní misde dhúinn cuimhniú ar spiorad na ndaoine úd agus féacháil le n-a bhuanú.  Leigeadh an spiorad sin i dtáimh i n-áiteanna, acht go geinearalta, tig liom a rádh go bhfuil sé beó go fóill.  Is mór an t-adhbhar áthais agam bheith i ndon a innsint gurab eól domh suim an-mhór san oideachas agus i gcoimheád na bhfoirgneamh scoile do bheith ag a lán daoine, idir bhainisteóirí, múinteóirí, tuismightheóirí agus daltaí.  Acht is brón liom a mhalairt sin de scéal do bheith le hinnsint agam faoi áiteanna eile thall agus i bhfus.  Ins na háiteanna deireannacha sin, ní mó ná gur féidir a rádh go ndearnadh saothar ar bith dá laighead leis na tighthe scoile do choinneáil i gcaoi mhaith, ná le foirgnimh nuadh do chur ar fagháil i n-ionad tighthe do bhí ró-shean nó do bhí mí-oireamhnach ar bhealaigh eile.  I gcorr-áit mar sin, tá a fhios agam gur leigeadh faillighe ar fad sna foirgnimh scoile.  Cinn slinne agus dóirse agus fuinneóga agus ballaí do thárla briste, ní dearnadh deisiú dá laighead orra.  Dá ndéantaí a leithéidí sin do chóiriú do réir mar do bheadh gádh leis, dar ndóigh ní bheadh riachtanas le mórán den deisiú costasach nach féidir gan bheith riachtanach tar éis tamaill fhada faillighe.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir dúinn a choinneáil i síorchuimhne gur linn féin na scoileanna agus gur le haghaidh oideachais ár gcloinne do cuireadh ar bun iad.  Gach duine dá bhfuil i bparáiste áirithe ar bith, bíodh páistí ar scoil aige féin nó ná bíodh, ba cheart dó a thuigsint gurab é a dhian-dualgas congnamh do réir acmhuinne do thabhairt uaidh le foirgnimh scoile an pharáiste do choinneáil faoi'n mbail ba cheart bheith orra.  Na daoine a dtugtar áird faoi leith ina bparáiste féin orra, ba cheart dóibh a gcomhairle d'úsáid go dícheallach maidir le foirgnimh scoile do dhéanamh nó do choimhéad mar ba dual do chineadh do fuair clú mar gheall ar a ngrádh don léigheann.</P>

    <P>(2)  sean-téacs-leabhra do bheith dhá gcoinneáil i n-úsáid.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Tír-eólaidheacht agus Ceól tá feabhas deimhin le tabhairt faoi deara mar gheall ar na modhtha nuadha teagaisc atá dhá gcur i bhfeidhm go geinearálta; acht, i dteagasc an Bhéarla, tá an iomad múinteóirí ró-thugtha do mhodhtha teagaisc do bhí i bhfeidhm nuair do bhíodar féin ar scoil.</P>
    <P>I Scoileanna Naoidheanán, agus sna scoileanna móra ina bhfuil roinn fá leith le haghaidh naoidheanán, tá obair na Gaedhilge ag dul ar aghaidh go sásamhail; acht, nidh nach iongnadh, níl a chomh-mhaith sin de dhul ar aghaidh sna scoileanna ina mbíonn na naoidheanáin i n-éinfeacht le Ranga I agus II.</P>
    <P>Go háirithe sna Ranga IV-VIII, caithfear a admháil go bhféadfaí fairsingiú agus foirbhiú níos mó do dhéanamh ar an teagasc tré Ghaedhilg sna scoileanna ina bhfuil na coingheallacha atá órduighthe ag an Roinn .i. eólas ceart liteardha agus labhartha do bheith ag an múinteóir agus eólas sáthach maith do bheith ag na daltaí.</P>
    <P>Scrúdú Theastais na mBun-Scol, do tháinig sé i bhfeidhm ina scrúdú neamh-éigeantach i mbliadhain a 1929, acht i mbliadhain ar bith ó shoin, ní tháinig faoi scrúdú acht 25% de na daltaí do bhí in-iontrála.  Gidh go ndearna mé iarracht, le hachar beag bliadhanta, féacháil an gcuirfí ar bun scrúdú neamh-éigeantach do mheallfadh chuige a thuilleadh dalta, níor éirigh liom congnamh d'fhagháil ó na múinteóirí i gcoitchinne.  I scéim chomh-órdamhail oideachais, is léir go bhfuil gádh le Teastas Bun-Scoile den tsórt seo, agus is léir, freisin, nach mbeidh an meas cóir ar an Teastas mura dtugtar caoi do na daltaí go léir dul faoi'n scrúdú.  Ní tugtar an chaoi sin dóibh fá lathair, agus, ar an adhbhar sin, ba riachtanach féacháil an bhfuighthí plean chun an scéal do <Col N="2448" /> leigheas.  Tar éis lán-mhachtnamh do dhéanamh ar an gceist, is é mo mheas gur mithid bun-riaghail an scruduighthe d'athrú, agus atá scéim dá hullmhú dá réir sin chun scrúdú éigeantach a chur ar siubhal i gcóir gach dalta dá mbeidh i Rang VI, nó i Rang ar bith os a cionn sin, agus nach ndeachaidh faoi scrúdú cheana. Sa tslighe sin, táthar ag súil go dtabharfar do gach dalta an chaoi ba chóir dó d'fhagháil chun teastas do ghnóthú.  Ní bheidh sa scrúdú acht trí príomh-adhbhair an scoil-chláir .i. Gaedhilg, Béarla agus Áireamh, agus déanfar an scrúdú san aon-lá ar fud na tíre.  Táim ag súil go bhfuighthear comh-chongnamh ó na bainisteoirí agus ó na múinteóirí chun an scéim do thabhairt i n-éifeacht.</P>
    <P>Ins na ceanntair ina raibh móin le fagháil go fairsing, do coinnigheadh compórdach go leór na tighthe scoile ar feadh na haimsire fuaire; acht ní raibh an scéal chomh maith sin sna scoileanna do bhí ag taobhadh le gual, óir ní hé amháin go raibh an gual gann, acht níor ró-mhaith an méid do bhí le fagháil féin.</P>
    <P>Nuair do bhí Bille na bPáiste i gceist anuraidh, do thugas geallamhain áirithe uaim i dtaobh daoine atá cáilighthe mar mhúinteóirí náisiúnta agus atá ag teagasc i Scoileanna Saothair.  Do réir na geallamhna úd, tá soláthar déanta chun tuarastail na múinteóirí seo d'árdú ionnas go bhfuighidh siad na tuarastail chéadna do bheadh ag dul dóibh agus iad ag teagasc i ngnáth-scoileanna náisiúnta. Is é rud atá socruighthe go bhfuighidh siad suim chinnte (do réir £6 sa mí d'fhir agus £5 sa mí do mhná) ó bhainisteóirí na scol ina bhfuil siad ag teagasc, agus go n-íocfaidh an Roinn an chuid eile den airgead.</P>
    <P>Baineann an socrú leis an mbliadhain airgeadais darab deireadh an 31adh den Mhárta seo thart; acht b'andeacair eólas beacht d'fhagháil i dtaobh réimh-sheirbhíse na múinteóirí seo agus níor bhféidir lán-ullmhú do dhéanamh leis na tuarastail d'íoc ina n-iomláine roimh dheireadh na bliana airgeadais sin.  Ar an adhbhar sin, do cinneadh ar roimh-íoc do thabhairt dóibh, do réir an tuarastail mhinimum <Col N="2449" /> i ngach cás, agus íocfar an t-iarmhar chomh luath agus deimhneóchthar cad is ionad cóir sa scala do gach múinteóir.</P>
    <P>Atáthar ag brath na múinteóirí seo do thabhairt isteach faoi fhorálacha Scéime na bPinsion.  Tá ullmhú ina chomhair sin dá dhéanamh fá láthair, agus táim ag súil leis an scéim fheabhsuighthe do chur i láthair na Dála dá cheadú, roimh dheireadh an tSeisiuin seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Meadhon-Oideachas, tá líon na ndálta ag meáadú leis mar do bhí sna bliadhanta chuaidh thart.  Sa tréimhse ó 1929-30 go dtí 1940-41, do mhéaduigh líon na ndalta aithnighthe ó 27,645 to dtí 38,713&mdash;rud is ionann agus buan-mhéadú de 1,000 dalta nó mar sin gach bliadhain.  Tuairim 's 39,500 líon dalta na scoil-bhliadhna atá ann fá láthair.</P>
    <P>Uimhir na Meadhon-Scol aithnighthe, do chuaidh sí i líonmhaireacht ó 294 go dtí 352 sa tréimhse chéadna úd.  Is é rud do cuireadh a bhfurmhór sin ar bun i sráid-bhailte na tuaithe, áiteanna do bhí gan Meadhon-Scoileanna go dtí sin.</P>
    <P>Is áthas liom bheith i ndon a innsint go dtáinig méadú maith, an bhliadhain seo thart, ar líon na ndalta sna Scoileanna Gaedhilge agus sna Scoileanna Dhá-Theangacha&mdash;ó 23,905 i mbliadhain a 1939-40 go dtí 24,750 i mbliadhain a 1940-41.  Atá 11,194 díobh sin sna hA-Scoileanna .i. na scoileanna ina ndéantar an obair go leír tré Ghaedhilg, agus atá 13,556 sna B-Scoileanna, mar a ndéantar cuid mhaith den obair tríd an teangaidh chéadna.</P>
    <P>Ag tracht ar na Meastacháin Oideachais dom anuraidh, do rinne mé tagairt don réidhteach tionnscnaimh do bhí déanta ionnas go mbeadh comhórdú idir an cúrsa le haghaidh Árd-Teastais na Roinne agus Scrúdú Máithreacháin na hIolscoile Náisiúnta. Tá an réidhteach sin críochnuighthe in gach slighe, beagnach, anois.  Le haghaidh scrúdú na bliadhna seo do hórduigheadh na téacs-leabhra céadna sa dá chás, agus sa mór-chuid de chúrsaí na dteanga tá comh-shocrú déanta maidir le téacsaí do achar áirithe bliadhan san aimsir atá romhainn. <Col N="2450" /> De thoradh an chomh-órduighthe sin, glacfaidh an Iolscoil le pas i n-ádhbhar ar bith de Scrúdú an Árd-Teastais mar ionann agus pas san adhbhar céadna de Scrúdú an Mháithreacháin.</P>
    <P>Beidh an comh-órdú ina chongnamh maith ag na Meadhon-Scoileanna maidir le heagrú na Rang Sinnsear, agus is maith le stiúrthóirí na Scol é do bheith déanta.</P>
    <P>Ina thaobh seo, ba mhaith liom mo bhuidheachas do chur i n-iul do lucht stiúrtha na hIolscoile agus do na hOllamhain mar gheall ar a gcomhchongnamh in ath-chóiriú agus in aontú na gCúrsaí.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Teastas-Scrúdúcháin na Laidne agus na Gréigise, b'é an gnás go dtí seo páipéir speisialta scrúdúcháin i gCumadóireacht Bhéarsa do bheith ann.  Marcanna do gheibhthí ar na páipéir seo (go dtí 60 de mhaximum), do cuirtí iad i dteannta na marc do gheibhthí ar na gnáth-pháipéir Laidne agus Gréigise&mdash;acht gan dul ós cionn an mhaximum don adbhar féin. Táthar tar éis stad den ghnás sin, óir do measadh nach raibh tréineáil fhíor-oideachasamhail ar bith san obair &mdash;nach ndearna sí méadú ar bith dob fhiú ar Laidin ná ar Ghréigis na ndaltaí, agus nach ndearna sé feabhas ar bith dob' fhiú ar a gcéill d'fhilidheacht na dteangan sin.  Is é rud do measadh go mba bhuntáistighe do na daltaí staidéar ní ba bheaichte do dhéanamh ar na teangacha féin ná bheith ag caitheamh ama i gceann Chumadóireacht Bhéarsa.</P>
    <P>Fao'n riaghail do bhí i bhfeidhm go dtí seo, do bhíodh marcanna breise le fagháil ag iarrthóirí d'úsáideadh Gaedhilg i n-ionad Béarla ina gcuid freagraí i n-adhbhair eile taobh amuigh de Ghaedhilg, de Bhéarla agus de Línidheacht.  I gcás Matamataice agus i gcás Bheó-Theanga na Mór-Roinne, d'fhéadtaí oiread agus 5% de bónus-mharcanna do ghnóthú; i gcás na n-adhbhar eile d'fhéadtaí oiread agus 10% do ghnóthú.  B'é ba chuspóir don bhónus sin an Ghaedhilg do chur dhá húsáid, agus aiseag do dhéanamh i marcanna do caillfí b'fhéidir mar gheall ar a dheacracht agus do bheadh sé í d'úsáid i gcuid den scrúdúchán.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2451" /> Do cuireadh ina aghaidh sin. Dubhrathas gurbh fhéidir iomlán na marc do bheith ós cionn an mhaximum do bhí órduighthe don adhbhar, agus ní hé amháin sin acht gur dheimhin go rabh breis iomarcach mar sin dhá fagháil.  Tar éis machtnamh do dhéanamh ar an scéal, do chinn mé ar an riaghail do choimeád acht i d'athrú mar leanas:&mdash;iomlán na mbónus-mharc do thabhairt do iarrthóirí do gheobhadh 75%, nó faoi n-a bhun sin, de mharcanna i n-adhbhar ar bith faoi leith; agus, i gcás ina bhfuighthí ós cionn 75%, na bónusmharcanna do laghdú do réir a chéile ionnus nach mbeadh bonus ar bith le fagháil ag an té do ghnóthóchadh 100%.</P>

      <P>On the Adjournment, Deputy Costello has given notice to raise:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of a letter dated 16th May, 1942, and addressed and sent by the Secretary of the Department of Supplies to six Dublin <Col N="2452" /> doctors containing a notification that their petrol ration would be reduced from June 1st, 1942, for certain reasons.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter that I have to bring before the House to-night and, through the House, to the attention of the people, is one which reflects not merely on the civic honour and professional reputation of six of the leading Dublin surgeons and specialists, but also is a matter very seriously affecting the public interest.</P>
      <P>It is little short of a public scandal the matter that has occurred and that was given wide publicity through the Press and the comments in the Press in reference to the so-called application of these gentlemen with regard to their petrol allowances. In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of yesterday there appeared, in a framed part of the principal page of the newspaper, the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Six others&rdquo;&mdash;meaning six other doctors&mdash;&ldquo;have had their petrol allowances reduced.  They applied to the Department for permission to use their cars for travelling to a golf course, thereby furnishing clear evidence that they are getting more petrol than is required for the purposes in respect of which the petrol allowance was granted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement was repeated in the <i>Irish Times</i> and substantially to the same effect in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> was written with that particular notification, obviously given by the Department of Supplies, with Government authority and with the authority of the Minister for Supplies, as the text, and there was a particularly virulent leading article in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is no over-statement to say that that statement in the newspapers of yesterday formed the principal topic of conversation and comment amongst the citizens of Dublin. It was read with indignation and dismay. I mention that for the purpose of showing how difficult it is to catch up on a lie.  My purpose to-night is <Col N="2453" /> to nail and catch up on the lie that has been given such wide publicity with Government sanction, and particularly with the authority of the Minister for Supplies and, so far as it lies in my power, I intend to see that reparation is done in this House, if not elsewhere, to these professional gentlemen who are so foully slandered by that statement issued with the authority of the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>The principal statement I want to address my remarks to in the very short space of time that is afforded on this motion for the Adjournment, is the statement that these doctors applied to the Department for permission to use their cars for travelling to a golf course.  That is a lie, and I will demonstrate here from evidence that I will produce that it is a lie. Whether it was made deliberately by the officials of the Department of the Minister concerned, knowing it to be untrue, or whether it is more probable that the statement was made recklessly without having carried out proper inquiries, as any reasonable person would do before a statement of that kind was disseminated through the public Press, makes no difference.  A statement that is made recklessly, without regard to whether it is true or false, without taking the proper steps, the reasonable steps, that any prudent man would take before a statement of that kind is made and disseminated in the public Press, is none the less a lie.</P>
    <P>I have the authority of the six gentlemen concerned to say to-night that they never applied to the Department of Supplies, directly or indirectly, for permission to use their cars for travelling to a golf course.  Not merely did not they, or any one of them, ever make such an application, but they never thought, even in their innermost hearts or minds, of making such an application. They never authorised anybody to make application.  They never knew that such application was being made on their behalf.  The officials of the Department of Supplies were notified that, so far as any application to the Department's officials or any discussion of this matter with the Department's officials was concerned, the person making that application had not <Col N="2454" /> the authority of these gentlemen to make it.  Not once but on three different occasions, were the officials concerned told specifically and clearly that any reference to or discussion in connection with this topic was without the authority or the knowledge or the sanction of these six gentlemen.  The first that any one of these six gentlemen knew of this matter was when each of them received a letter, dated 16th May, 1942, from the Secretary of the Department of Supplies, to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Supplies to inform you that he has had before him representations which were made on behalf of yourself and certain other members of the medical profession asking whether you would be allowed to bring your private cars to a golf club at week-ends; the suggestion was that a different car might be used each week-end.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been made quite clear that petrol has not been made available to doctors for travelling to golf courses, and the application made to this Department affords clear evidence that the doctors concerned are receiving more petrol than they require for the purposes for which the petrol has been given.  The Minister has accordingly directed that the petrol allowances in the cases in question shall be reduced.  The allowance granted to you for May will be reduced by two gallons as from the 1st June.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the first intimation that any one of these gentlemen got that any such representations as are alleged in that letter to have been made were made on their behalf.  They never authorised any such representations. They never knew it, but the officials of the Department knew, and were told specifically, that any statements made to them were made without the authority or knowledge of these gentlemen. Had any one of these six gentlemen known that such an application was made, they would have put an end to it.  The officials concerned knew it, as I will show and as will be proved possibly elsewhere.  That was the first intimation that they got.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2455" /> One would think that before a letter of that kind, penalising a person without giving him an opportunity of being heard, condemning three of the leading surgeons of this city without giving them an opportunity of being heard, condemning two specialists in maternity without giving them any opportunity of being heard, condemning at least one leading physician without giving him an opportunity of being heard, after a trap had been set by the bureaucrats for this busybody, who made representations on his own and nobody else's behalf, the Department officials would at least make some inquiries.</P>
    <P>Compare the letter I have read with the notification that appeared in the newspapers.  It is practically word for word what is in that letter.  It is quite clear that the officials, with the authority of the Minister, gave out this message to the public, the message that was starred in the newspapers and commented upon in the leading articles of the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Evening Mail</i> without waiting to inquire from these gentlemen, whose services to the poor, and whose work in the maternity hospitals, in the surgeries and as physicians in Dublin's leading hospitals cannot be too greatly recognised.  These gentlemen were not given even ordinary courtesy, not to mention the ordinary right of citizens. Without being asked did they make this outrageous application, or did they know it was being made, they were penalised and it was published in the Press without any communication being made with these gentlemen to know if they had any defence to make and at a time when specific warning had been given to the private secretary and to the secretary of the Department that the person speaking had no authority whatever from these doctors to speak for them and that they did not know anything about it.</P>
    <P>There was never such a precipitate rush in the whole history of bureaucracy in this country to penalise six gentlemen of high professional standing or to poison the public mind against the medical profession generally, all in order to glorify the officials <Col N="2456" /> of the Department of Supplies, whose name is mud amongst the public in this city and in the country generally &mdash;to glorify that Department at the expense of these six professional gentlemen whose services to the poor will live long after the name of the Minister for Supplies and his Department has gone down in obloquy. Immediately these doctors got these letters they replied denying indignantly that they had ever made such a request.  May I read one of these letters?  Time does not permit me to read any more.  One of these letters is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am in receipt of your letter P. 34/555 to-day and if the accusations contained therein were not so serious I would be inclined to regard them as an effort at a Departmental joke.  I have never entertained the idea of approaching your Department for petrol for use other than for professional purposes and I have not even give permission to any person or group of persons to allow my name to be included in any request such as that contained in your letter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The penalty suggested of deducting two gallons from my monthly allowance, without first making inquiries as to the validity of the matter, certainly smacks of foreign methods which are not quite understood by people who have a sense of good citizenship.  I would be obliged if you would rectify this mistake.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter was written before any publicity was given to this.  That letter was written on Monday.  Do you not think that the Department, if they had any sense of decency, if they had any sense of what was due to these professional men who stand at the top of their profession in this city, if they had any sense of what was due to ordinary persons, irrespective of what position they occupy, would have written to them, saying: &ldquo;We are sorry.  There was a mistake about this. We will see the matter is at least inquired into and if, on inquiries being made, we are satisfied the statements contained in these replies are true, we will see that reparation is made and <Col N="2457" /> public apology given&rdquo;?  No reply has yet been given to any of these letters. Not a single syllable from the Department has come forth in answer to this repudiation by each of these six gentlemen concerned, but in the Press of yesterday the matter was given the widest possible publicity in order to poison the public mind, not merely against these six professional gentlemen but against the medical profession in general.  No reply has been given to these six professional gentlemen, although the person who was originally the cause of all this trouble, apparently, having previously told, during the course of his conversation with Departmental officials, that he had no authority to discuss the matter at all and that the matter was entirely being misunderstood, went and sought an interview on Monday with the officials of the Department of Supplies and explained to them that the matter was misunderstood and that he had no authority, direct or indirect, from any single one of the six gentlemen concerned, to make the application.  That information was given to the Department on Monday.  On Tuesday morning, with that knowledge before them, with the letters from these gentlemen in their Departmental hands, this statement was disseminated, given wide publicity through the medium of the Press.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> wrote a leading article upon it, in indignant tones, denouncing these gentlemen.  The <i>Irish Times</i>, having quoted the official words communicated to the Press, said this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately, there have been signs already of a tendency to evade the law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a clear suggestion that these six professional gentlemen were evading the law and committing a breach of the law&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One professional man has had his motor licence cancelled because he used his car in order to visit a golf course.  Six others have had their petrol allowances reduced because they sought permission from the authorities to drive to their local golf courses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2458" /> Time does not permit comment on the rest because I want to read and comment shortly on the article in the <i>Evening Mail</i> yesterday.  I quote from portion of this leading article. I cannot read the whole:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the same time it is announced that no fewer than six gentlemen who possess permits actually applied for permission to use their cars for golfing expeditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pause there to point out that the editor of the <i>Evening Mail</i>, a distinguished and experienced journalist, reading the official pronouncement that was supplied to him by the Department of Supplies, or through Government sources, clearly read, as anybody else would have read, that statement to mean that these six professional gentlemen had applied for this permission, and as I have already stated and demonstrated, that is quite contrary to the truth.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the same time it is announced that no fewer than six gentlemen who possess permits actually applied for permission to use their cars for golfing expeditions.  The response to what we can only describe as an impudent application has been not only the flat &lsquo;No!&rsquo; that was the only possible answer that the Department of Supplies could have made, but a direction that the amount of petrol allowed to the six gentlemen should be reduced.  The justice of it pleases.' Obviously, these gentlemen had&mdash;and presumably still have&mdash; more petrol than they required for the purposes covered by their licences.  If it is, as it probably is, petrol stored away since the times of comparative plenty, it is only proper that they should be made to appreciate its value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the impression made by the official statement published in the newspaper about these six professional gentlemen.  That is the strong comment that the editor of the <i>Evening Mail</i> thought was called for by him editorially.  Perhaps the editors of the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Evening Mail</i> were justified in making these comments. <Col N="2459" /> If that statement had been true, it is easy to understand the indignation of the editors of these papers in writing these leading articles, because they are merely reflecting public opinion that was rampant throughout this country, and particularly in this city, where these six professional gentlemen practise, yesterday and to-day.  I quote these words from the leading article for the purpose of emphasising to this House, and through this House to the people, the seriousness of the matter and the effect it might have upon these six professional gentlemen in their practice, in their private lives and in their reputations, and also the grave effect that it might have in the public interest.  No apology is forthcoming.  No explanation is made, notwithstanding the fact that since Monday the Department are in possession of the fact that any application, if application was made, was unauthorised.</P>
    <P>I want to read quickly the remaining portions of the correspondence that have been discovered, as a result of investigation to-day for the first time by these six gentlemen as to what happened, but before I do that I would like to refer to the comment of the Department of Supplies on the refutation by one of these leading professional gentlemen appearing in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of this morning.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning there appears an indignant refutation by one of the gentlemen concerned of the suggestion contained in yesterday's newspapers. It is under a heading, in heavy type, in the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Doctor Refutes Allegation&rdquo;.  Having given the text of this doctor's refutation, it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The action of the Department has aroused great indignation in medical circles.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An <i>Irish Independent</i> representative was informed that the Department of Supplies had no statement to make for publication on the subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Department of Supplies, who are then in full possession of all the facts, <Col N="2460" /> who knew that each of these gentlemen had repudiated this thing and had said in their letters and under their hands that there was no truth in the allegation, who had been told on Monday by the busybody concerned that he had no authority, that he was acting on his own, that the Department had misunderstood even what he was getting at, informed an <i>Irish Independent</i> representative that the Department of Supplies had no statement to make for publication on the subject.  The article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was, however, authoritatively stated that the letter which was forwarded to the Department of Supplies was not a hoax, and that if the six doctors whose petrol supply had been &lsquo;cut&rsquo; had a statement to make, the centre to be communicated with was the Department of Supplies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was never in the history of bureaucracy, as I said before, such an impudent performance, such an irresponsible performance, as the publication yesterday in the Press of this lie about these six professional gentlemen. It was only surpassed by this authoritative statement issued to the representative of the <i>Irish Independent</i> that the only authority to deal with this matter of grave import, not merely to these professional gentlemen, but to the public interest, the only centre to which any application or any reference should be made was the Department of Supplies&mdash;the criminal, who was to be judge and jury in its own cause.</P>
    <P>That Department, which is judge and jury in its own cause, had given no opportunity to these six gentlemen to make their own case in their own professional interests.  Now I have to make their case, indignantly to refute this lie, to bring home to the criminals what they did, the criminals who are to be judge and jury in their own cause.  The courts were to have nothing to say to it; the public or the Dáil were to have nothing to say to it.</P>
    <P>In the few remaining minutes left to me, perhaps I might be allowed to go into the details of the case.  It is essential, in the interest of truth, <Col N="2461" /> that I should be allowed to put forward their case, and I shall try to do so in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>I should not be deprived of the few minutes that are required to establish the justice of this case.  I shall, however, put what I have to say within the shortest possible limits.  I want to say that, so far as the six gentlemen are concerned, they ascertained, from inquiries made yesterday and this morning, for the first time how the matter arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole of this matter arose through a Departmental trap which was laid for a busybody who was interfering apparently not for the purpose <Col N="2462" /> of dealing with these six gentlemen, but for the purpose of putting forward a demand on his own responsibility for doctors generally.  When that letter of the 4th May, 1942, was written by the particular gentleman concerned, he was asked for an interview and in reply to some questions put to him he said that he was speaking for doctors in general and for surgeons attached to public hospitals who might, if they were called out on an emergency call, require a car.  He was asked what doctors he referred to.  He said doctors attached to hospitals and he named a particular group attached to hospitals.  He was going to give several names when the official interrupted him and said: &ldquo;That is enough.  I have the names of six men.  These men have applied for petrol for golfing purposes.&rdquo;  At the time, he made the statement specifically that he was acting on his own, without authority, and that no doctor he was referring to, either specifically or by class, knew that he was making the application.  To use his own words on Monday, after the matter had appeared in the papers: &ldquo;He would get hell for what he was doing.&rdquo;  He was told that it was possible he would get hell for what he was doing.  Although he told the officials that he had not the consent of these doctors for making this application, this Department poured obloquy on these six gentlemen, and in fact, on the whole medical profession by curtailing their petrol allowance. This is a matter that affects not merely the professional integrity and civic honour of the gentlemen concerned but it is a matter gravely affecting the public interest.  It calls for more ventilation than I am able to give it to-night in the short time allowed to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 4th May a communication was received in my Department from a Dublin doctor, in the course of which he set forth certain queries which he wished to have answered.  He asked if there was any Emergency Order governing the use of petrol by doctors and said that, if so, he would like to have a copy of it. He asked if a doctor might give a lift <Col N="2463" /> to a friend whom he met walking.  He also asked if five doctors attached to a hospital who are members of the Portmarnock Golf Club might take out a car at week-ends so that, in the event of any one of them receiving an urgent call, he would be able to attend to it immediately.  If Deputy Costello had confined his remarks to a defence of these six doctors instead of abusing the officials of my Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not defending them.  I was merely stating the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello did not stick to the truth.  He said that this particular doctor was making a case on behalf of doctors in general and that he mentioned certain names only to illustrate his general argument. His letter, as received in the Department, refers to five doctors who are members of the Portmarnock Golf Club.  I think that fact demonstrates quite clearly that he was not making an attempt to justify doctors in general using their motor cars to go to golf clubs, but that he was concerned with particular doctors whose names he knew and who had this in common&mdash;that they were members of the same golf club.  He was communicated with by telephone by an officer of the Department and requested to furnish the names of the doctors referred to in his letter.  He said he was not prepared to give the names to my Department without prior consultation with the doctors in question. He volunteered the information that they were attached to four well-known Dublin hospitals, which he named.  He explained they were all senior men and whilst they had not been using their cars to convey them to Portmarnock Golf Club, they felt it would not be unreasonable to use a different car each week so as to facilitate them in looking after their patients without interfering unduly with their much-needed relaxation at the golf club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the following day he was again communicated with by telephone and asked if he was prepared to give the names of the doctors on whose behalf he was speaking.  He was at the <Col N="2464" /> same time told that the officer making the inquiry was not in a position to give any indication as to the attitude the Department would adopt.  Without more ado, he agreed to give the names and he read out the names of three physicians and three surgeons. He did not say that he had secured their consent to give their names but neither did he say that he had not secured it and in the light of what he had said on the previous day&mdash;that he was not prepared to give the names without prior consultation with the doctors in question&mdash;it was a natural and reasonable assumption that the doctors concerned were aware of the representations he was making on their behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Natural and reasonable!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Natural and reasonable. I decided that it was a fair inference from the facts, that these doctors were getting more petrol than they required for the essential purposes for which petrol is given to doctors.  It has been made clear, over and over again, that petrol cannot be issued to doctors or anyone else to visit golf courses or for any similar purpose.  I, therefore, directed that their petrol allowance in all cases should be reduced by two gallons a month as from the 1st June.  The terms of the letter sent to the doctors concerned have been read out by Deputy Costello.  When the doctor who had made representations received that letter from my Department he called to the Department and, at a later stage, telephoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the telephone conversation he mentioned the fact, that some of the doctors concerned, who had received similar letters from the Department, had already been in touch with him about the letters they had received. Nevertheless, I have received letters from all these doctors, stating that they deny that they gave him any authority to make representations on their behalf; and the doctor who made the representations now states that he acted solely on his own accord and without consulting any of the other <Col N="2465" /> doctors concerned.  The six doctors whose names were given to my Department are, as Deputy Costello stated, all men of eminence in their profession, and, while there are some features of the incident which are not easy to understand, I am prepared to accept without question the statements they have made in the letters addressed to the Department, to the effect that they had not authorised, and were not aware of any approach to my Department.  I accept that statement of theirs all the more readily because I feel certain that men in their position would not be capable of such questionable conduct as to place their professional colleague in the very unenviable position in which he now finds himself.</P>
    <P>I am therefore prepared to restore to the six doctors concerned the petrol allowances which I had decided to reduce, on the basis of their written statement that the representations stated to have been made on their behalf were, in fact, made without their knowledge and without their consent. I cannot agree to restore the petrol allowance to the doctor who made the representations, who, according to his latest letter, apparently still considers that the arrangement he suggested should be permitted.  I may say that I have also received representations from the Medical Association about the case of the six doctors. I think the Medical Association have a duty to consider this matter further, having regard to the account of the incident which I have now given.  I know that many doctors have misunderstood the requirements of the Department concerning the use of the petrol allowance.  May I say that I am not accusing any of the six doctors involved in this incident&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now going on to some general point and away from this matter of the use of petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that a number of cases have come to my notice of the use of cars by members of the medical profession in a manner not contemplated by the Department, and entirely unjustifiable in present circumstances. <Col N="2466" /> I have seen, from the window of my own office, cars of doctors parked outside University College which were used to convey doctors to attend the College to give lectures.  I have had to-day to cancel the permit of another doctor who had arranged for his car to call for him at a golf club.  I think it is desirable that it should be made clear to all doctors that petrol is given to them only for the purpose of enabling them to attend emergency cases when they arise.  Petrol is not given them for their convenience, and is not given to enable them to earn a livelihood.  It is not given to enable them to get relaxation or recreation. It is given solely because occasionally emergency cases may arise which they cannot cope with, without having motor transport immediately available. Cars should not be used by doctors except in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that it is the function of my Department to restrict the use of petrol to the maximum degree, and particularly in present circumstances to see that there is no abuse of the privilege given doctors in the use of cars.  I think the indignation which Deputy Costello has shown is a measure of public indignation at any evidence that might be forthcoming, that doctors or others with permits to use cars misinterpret the obligations attaching to the permits.  Because it is important, I want to say that I do not feel under any obligation to produce legal proof of abuse before withdrawing a permit.  I think my Department is entitled to act on any <i>bona fide</i> suspicion, and to withdraw a permit whenever there is reason to believe that the use of the permit is being abused, or that the amount of petrol given to an individual is excessive in relation to his requirements.</P>

      <P>The onus is on the individual who says that he requires a <Col N="2467" /> permit to use a car, or more than the quantity of petrol allowed to him. This is not a game in which the Department of Supplies is involved with a number of individuals, a game in which one of the rules is that if these individuals are not caught then they are entitled to escape penalties.  In the circumstances in which this country is placed, having regard to the very reduced petrol supplies available to-day, and the need for conserving all petrol for the transportation of food and fuel, it is an obligation on the Department of Supplies&mdash;and I have given instructions accordingly&mdash;to cancel a permit, or to withdraw a petrol allowance, wherever there is reason to suspect that abuse has occurred or might occur.  The obligation then is on the individual to make his case for the restoration of the permit.</P>

      <P>Nobody has a right to a car permit, and nobody has a right to use a car unnecessarily.  A very large number of people to whom petrol and a car meant their livelihoods have been deprived of them.  I want doctors to understand that the privilege given them is one which may have to be withdrawn under the stress of circumstances next month or the month after.  So long as petrol is made available to them the onus is on them not to abuse the privilege, and on the Department to see that if there is any possibility of the privilege being abused the allowance will be withdrawn.</P>

For 12 months the Medical Association has been <Col N="2468" /> pressing my Department for more petrol for doctors.  It has never attempted to face the problem which will arise for doctors when there is no petrol, by endeavouring to work out a plan to carry on medical services when these circumstances arise, as almost certainly they will.</P>

      <P>He has to avoid the occasions of suspicion.  Deputies laugh at that because they refuse to face facts.  They seem to consider that the curtailment of the petrol supply is something done by me or by the Department of Supplies on a whim.  It is done because of the necessities of the situation.  We have not enough petrol to gather the harvest.  We have not got enough petrol to bring fuel to the towns and cities this winter. Already this month, even with the reduction in the number of motor cars already enforced, the quantity of petrol allocated is more than we had to give. We have in future months to reduce substantially the quantity of petrol used this month if we are to accumulate enough to save the harvest or to cope with the urgent transport requirements of the country in the winter.  It is in relation to that fact that doctors, clergymen, veterinary surgeons and other people given the exceptional privilege of the use of a private car, which is denied to everybody else, must consider every occasion upon which they deem the need to use it arises.</P>
