      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the special difficulties of junior members of the Civil Service consequent on the rise in the cost of living; and what steps he proposes to take to overcome their special difficulty.</P>

      <P>The increases in the cost-of-living bonus granted under the terms of the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) (Amendment) Regulations, 1942, afforded a measure of relief to the junior members of the Civil Service.  As the Deputy is aware, the cost of living difficulties created by the present emergency affect not only civil servants but the community generally.  The question of granting further relief to civil servants, particularly to members of the lower grades, is under active consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, am I to take it that he recognises the distinction that must be made between the higher grades of the Civil Service who have comparatively adequate salaries and who must be expected to share the hardships the community is passing through, and the very low-grade civil servants whose remuneration, in many cases, falls below £3 a week, and who do require some assistance to meet the increased cost analogous to that which is available to other workers through the bonus Orders at present being made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>

      <P>In view of the many thousands of persons employed in the Post Office with wages lower than £3 a week, will the Minister ensure that this matter will receive urgent consideration?

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the present basis of valuation on farm holdings is a relic of penal landlord days, and if he will take steps to so alter same that the progressive tenant will not be penalised by increased valuation for improving his farm buildings, while the thriftless tenant benefits by letting his farm buildings fall down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answer given yesterday, 9th December, 1942, to a similar question by Deputy P.J. Fogarty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware of the fact that Christmas is a time of abnormal expenditure for most people, and that the fact of confining workers to a maximum of four days employment per week necessarily substantially limits their income during the Christmas period? Will he agree to relax the regulations <Col N="182" /> so as to enable those people to secure some increase in wages, so that they may be able to meet the additional expenditure which is inevitable for everybody at Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the regulation allowing workers a four-day week simply means that they are receiving about 8/- per week more when they are working than if they were getting unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that the Minister for Finance stated, during the discussion on the Central Bank Bill, that there was an abundance of money and of credit in this country for worthwhile schemes?  Is there anything more worth while than giving a workman a full week's work for the few weeks before Christmas, so as to enable him to buy the food necessary for his wife and children?  Why cannot the State credit, or the abundance of money we have been told about, be utilised for this purpose?  Is feeding the people not considered worth while?</P>

      <P>As already stated in the Electricity Supply Board's annual report for the year ended 31st March, 1942, a substantial portion of the electrical and mechanical equipment for the Liffey power station has been delivered and erected.  Since March last small quantities of material have been received, but the major portion of the outstanding material has not yet been delivered.  In these circumstances it is not possible to state when the plant can be placed in commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the present condition of the bridge over the Blackwater at Youghal militates seriously against the town of Youghal in its business transactions with County Waterford, and also from a tourist point of view; and if the Minister will state what is the present position as regards the reconstruction of this bridge and if he will now expedite the completion of plans for such reconstruction, so that the work may commence as soon as ever the necessary materials become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing bridge carries all normal traffic up to a limit of three tons, and if there has been any restriction on business transacting between Youghal and County Waterford I do not think it can be attributed to the condition of the bridge.  The curtailment of motor and omnibus traffic has not been confined to Youghal.  It has been widespread, and is due to causes of which the Deputy is well aware.  There has been no change in the position as explained in the reply given to the Deputy on the 5th March, 1940, except a further deterioration in the income of the Road Fund from which the two local authorities concerned were seeking <Col N="190" /> substantial grants towards the reconstruction of the bridge.  The manner of financing the cost of reconstruction is of primary importance and does not appear to have been adverted to in the question.  It must not be assumed that the reconstruction of the bridge rests with my Department.  The cost of reconstruction of the bridge, including the cost of preparation of plans, will be a charge on the councils concerned, subject to whatever grant may be allocated from the Road Fund. In the present condition of the fund there is no prospect of making any such grant and as I believe the cost of reconstruction would otherwise be beyond the financial capacity of the local bodies, I do not at present propose to proceed with further consideration of the matter.</P>

      <P>In his answer, the Minister stated that the existing bridge did not curtail traffic.  That is not exactly the state of affairs.  The traffic is curtailed and diverted to the other side, to the neighbouring county, as beet and other goods cannot be brought across.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions 18 and 19 together.  The number of persons whose households are benefiting under the Emergency Fuel Scheme in the County Borough of Dublin is approximately 24,000.  The amount of fuel which is being distributed weekly to such households is close upon 1,200 tons.  Owing to the magnitude of this scheme considerable organisation was involved, and it has not so far been possible to make provision for supplying persons of low income, but the board of assistance are making every effort to do so before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that on a question being raised by the investigation officer as to the amount of the old age pension received by Mr. John Duggan, Bohinagh, Rosscarbery, who has been in receipt of an old age pension since January, 1932, Mr. Duggan's pension has been considerably reduced; if so, if he will state the reason why the question was raised by the investigation officer and the reason why the pension was reduced; and if it is the present policy of his Department to <Col N="194" /> have all cases of old age pensions granted since 1932 re-investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the duty of an investigation officer, if information has come to his knowledge that an old age pensioner is in receipt of a pension at a higher rate than is justified by his or her means, to raise a question as to whether the pensioner is entitled to continue to receive a pension at that rate.  The law provides for this being done.</P>
      <P>Any such question comes before the local pension committee for consideration, and an appeal against the committee's decision on the question may be made to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, either by the investigation officer or the pensioner.  In the case in question, the investigation officer appealed.  It had come to his knowledge that at the time of the original claim to a pension the pensioner failed to disclose that he had a joint bank account.  Upon consideration of the facts elicited as to the means of the pensioner the rate of pension allowed was at a lower rate than the rate the pensioner had previously been receiving.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, I would remind the Deputy that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is an appeal tribunal under the Old Age Pension Acts.  The general administration of these Acts rests with the Revenue Commissioners.  Investigation officers are officers of that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This man Duggan had some money, but there was no inquiry by the investigation officer in 1932 as to his means or as to whether he had any money.  The money amounted to only a small sum.  The amount in the bank has risen since 1932, but in the meantime the investigation officer did not inquire into the case with a view to ascertaining whether the man was in receipt of a proper amount of pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus is on the claimant to disclose his full means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="195" />
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it is the duty of the investigation officer to inquire as to the means of the claimant, who is not supposed to know what the regulations are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that, under Section 9 (1) of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, any person who knowingly makes any false statement or false representation shall be liable to a penalty on summary conviction of imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months with hard labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary this man was not induced to make a false statement because he was not asked if he had money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not disclose his means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a false statement.  Furthermore with regard to the latter part of the question, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, at the old age pension committee meeting at which this case came up, there were more cases of re-investigation of pensions than applications for pensions?  Is it the policy of the Government to continue this practice of going back ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well that the Government have not adopted any such policy.  He knows as well as I that this is not a case of any economic hardship whatever, but that the claimant had a joint account in 1932, when the pension was awarded, amounting to £400, which he failed to disclose.  He is also aware, because he has been very fully informed by my Department on the matter, that the sum of £400 deposited in 1932 has increased to £594 in 1942, so that the economic hardship which existed in 1932 is certainly not as great in 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that Mrs. Bridget Tobin, of Cahirmore, Rosscarbery, who was in receipt of an old age pension of 2/- per week has, on a question raised by the investigation officer, been <Col N="196" /> deprived of this amount; if so, if he will state the reason why the question was raised by the investigation officer, and why the pension was withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained, in connection with the previous question of the Deputy, that it is the duty of an investigation officer to raise a question in relation to the pension of an old age pensioner if information has come to his knowledge that the pensioner is in receipt of a pension at a higher rate than is justified by his or her means. This procedure was followed in this case.  An appeal was subsequently made to the Minister, and upon consideration of the evidence before him, it was decided that the person was not entitled to any pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a case, similar to that to which I have already referred, of a poor woman who has lived all her life in a labourer's cottage.  Because her husband got an increase of 3/- per week, the investigation officer jumps on her and deprives her of her 2/- per week, although the cost of living has gone up considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The means of the claimant have to be taken into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies must get out of the habit of making statements instead of, or in the guise of, supplementary questions.  It leads to the prolongation of question time. To elicit and not to impart information is the purpose of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he will not agree that where, as in this case, the husband of the applicant got an increase of 3/- or 4/- per week in wages, in fact, in present circumstances, the means of these people were not increased at all and the pension should not have been reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The law provides that the means of the claimant must be taken into consideration.  There is a cash income in this case amounting to £80, representing wages earned by the claimant.  It is not a question of administration <Col N="197" /> at all, and there is no means of giving a more liberal interpretation of the law than is represented by the decision in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the law in such cases must press severely on that type of applicant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he not agree that there is a very strong case for altering the law in cases of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider that investigation officers should have discretionary powers in cases of this sort and that they should work more on humanitarian lines than on the lines of the direct letter of the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no discretion at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether, since the beginning of the emergency, the basis upon which means are assessed has been changed in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  Periodically, there is a revision in relation to the assessment of means, but more in relation to income from land, inasmuch as the value of farm produce changes from time to time, but so far as wages or cash income are concerned, it remains as the old age pension law sets out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the point not that there is a revision so far as farm produce is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The pension officer has no alternative but to take cash income into consideration.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Addition of Calcium to Flour.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been directed to the published work of McCance, of Cambridge, on the effect of phytic acid in bread made of 100 per cent. extraction wheaten flour on calcium metabolism; and whether he will arrange to have adequate quantities of calcium added to flour manufacture in Ireland, in order to overcome the nutritional dangers consequent on calcium insufficiency in the national diet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The work has come under notice in connection with the examination of the question which has been proceeding in my Department.  In so far as the examination has progressed, the case for the addition of calcium to flour does not in the present state of our knowledge appear to have been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary address his mind further to this problem, in view of the fact that he seems to be the only medical man left in western Europe to whose mind conviction has not been carried by the work referred to in the question?  Is he aware that the millers in this country have not only forborne from adding calcium phosphate to bread, but have reduced the quantity of it which hitherto they were putting into bread?  In view of these facts, will he review the information in the Department and bring himself up-to-date in regard to the effect of phytic acid on calcium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very poorly informed on this question, and when he suggests to the House that I am the only medical man in Western Europe who holds the view that it is undesirable and perhaps dangerous to fortify flour with calcium, he is stating what is entirely untrue.  I could quote many <Col N="199" /> medical men of standing, nutritional experts, who very definitely hold the view that calcium ought not be added to our flour, and the Deputy should not make these sweeping statements without fully informing himself before coming in to raise questions like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, I fully informed myself on the matter, and I want to know whether the Department of Local Government and Public Health of this country is aware that there is now a danger of calcium deficiency in the diet of our people, and, if the Department will not accept the remedy of adding sufficient calcium phosphate to the flour, have they any alternative plan for remedying the nutritional deficiency in our diet which has resulted from the 100 per cent. extraction in the case of wheaten flour?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary admit that there is a serious problem created as a result of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no clinical evidence available of the adverse effect of high extraction or that the problem would be solved by the addition of calcium to the flour.  There is no evidence available to that effect, either in this country or in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the work which has been published by McCance and his colleagues in the last six weeks established beyond all reasonable doubt&mdash;perhaps not clinically, but by laboratory tests and work that would carry conviction to the mind of the average, rational research student&mdash; that there is a real danger as a result of a calcium deficiency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy speaks of &ldquo;average rational research student&rdquo; he talks nonsense again.  It is not possible to deal with this matter by question and answer, but I could quote for the Deputy the opinions of nutritional experts of European reputation which are in entire disagreement with those of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the hardships that are being imposed on persons in receipt of disablement benefit from the National Health Society at the rate of 7/6 a week, and will he not agree to extend the free fuel scheme, or something better than that, to those who are in receipt of only 7/6 a week&mdash;people who are on the borders of starvation? Surely, such people are worthy of consideration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the vital importance of making available every possible source of plant food for the better preservation of the fertility of the soil, and with reference to the statement made by the Taoiseach to <Col N="203" /> the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 28th October last regarding the possibility of making available as a fertiliser town sewage and town refuse and waste, he will say what examination he has made or intends to have made regarding the immediate conversion of those potential sources of supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of making use of town sewage and town refuse and waste as a fertiliser has been investigated on several occasions in recent years.  I am aware that sewage sludge has been utilised to a limited extent in this country already for manurial purposes. The sludge generally has, bulk for bulk, a relatively low manurial value compared with other organic manures such as farmyard manure.  It has to be dried before being fit for use, and in view of its bulky nature, relative to its value, the costs of transport are high, unless the sludge can be used for manure on allotments or other lands near the place where it is produced.</P>
      <P>The processing of the sludge for the purpose of rendering it suitable for manurial purposes would involve the setting up of special plant for this purpose, and it is doubtful whether the product could be sold at an economic price to farmers.  The whole matter, however, is at present under investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that seed wheat wholesalers charge 61/6 per barrel for winter wheat f.o.r.; that freight charge on this to places in the rural areas amounts to 3/6 per barrel in certain cases, and that the fixed retail price is 65/- per barrel, leaving the retail distributor no profit margin; and whether he will take steps to remove this anomaly so as to prevent a hold-up in the retail distribution of seed wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed that some seed merchants are charging 61/6 per barrel for undried seed wheat of winter varieties, but I am not aware that all seed wheat assemblers are <Col N="204" /> charging that price.  Having regard to the fact that the maximum price payable to growers by seed assemblers for wheat purchased for sale as seed is 52/- per barrel, I consider that the maximum selling price of 65/- per barrel fixed in respect of undried seed wheat of winter varieties should provide a sufficient margin for a reasonable profit to the retailer as well as to the assembler of the seed.  I do not, therefore, propose to alter the present selling price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the present moment seed wheat merchants down the country, who want to make seed wheat available to their customers, cannot get it except at 61/6 per barrel f.o.r.?  What are these people to do?  They want to get the seed wheat to their customers, but they know of no seed wheat assembler who is prepared to sell it for less.  Will the Minister publish a list of those who are prepared to sell it for less?  I have tried all over the country, but I could not get it except at the price I have mentioned in my question.  Will the Minister publish a list of seed wheat assemblers who are prepared to sell the seed wheat at less than 61/6?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has received five complaints altogether on this matter from the whole country.  I do not want to dispute with the Deputy when he says that he has tried every seed wheat assembler in the country, but I think it should be possible to get the seed wheat under that price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister will agree that a great many of them are asking 61/6, and if that is profiteering, it ought surely to be possible for the average merchant down the country to ask the Department to publish a list of those who are prepared to offer seed wheat for less&mdash;to publish it in the papers in the same way as the Minister for Supplies publishes a list of fixed prices.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his Department has been in negotiation with the British Ministry of Food regarding (a) the prices and conditions at and upon which the Ministry would propose to purchase our salmon during the 1943 season; and (b) the issue of export licences to enable British manufacturers of fishing nets and twines to make delivery of such gear in response to orders placed by our people; and, if so, whether he will indicate the outcome of such negotiations as to (a) and (b), respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Conversations of the nature referred to have been held with representatives of the British Ministry of Food.  The Ministry would be prepared to purchase our salmon during the coming season subject to certain modifications in the arrangements which prevailed throughout the season just past.  The prices offered for the 1943 season are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Period A.&mdash;For all salmon leaving port in this country on and between the 1st January and the 30th January and reaching the consignee in sound condition, carriage paid, 5/6 per lb., plus a bonus of 3d. per lb. for special quality.</P>
      <P>Period B.&mdash;For all salmon leaving port in this country on and between the 1st February and the 15th May and reaching the consignee in sound condition, carriage paid, 3/6 per lb., plus a bonus of 3d. per lb for special quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> Period C.&mdash;For all salmon leaving port in this country on and between the 17th May and the close of season and reaching the consignee in sound condition, carriage paid, 2/4 per lb., plus a bonus of 3d. per lb. for special quality.</P>
    <P>The marketing would be done through licensed exporters as in 1942 season.  During the conversations, reference was made to the need for facilitating our fishermen in obtaining supplies of nets and twine from British manufacturers.  This is not primarily a matter for my Department or for the Ministry of Food, but our representatives availed themselves of the opportunity thus offered to bespeak the assistance of the Ministry with the British export licensing authority.  Our Department of Supplies has been according this subject special attention, and it is hoped to secure the release of the maximum quantity of such gear as is obtainable in the conditions of stringency now prevailing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F.H. Crowley Mr. F.H. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the prices quoted are lower than the prices for last year, particularly for the early months of the season, and will he make an effort to pursue the subject with a view to getting a better price?  Is he also aware that fishermen around the Kerry coast find it almost impossible to get nets? Will he also pursue that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the middle period it is true that the price is lower than last year, but best quality salmon in the latter period will be a ld. a lb. more. I can assure the Deputy that we did everything possible to get an improved price, but failed to reach any agreement on a better basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided that steps should be taken for the re-organisation of the collection and distribution of milk for the Dublin district with a view to maintaining supplies in the event of serious deterioration of transport.  The present Dublin District Milk Board consisting of producer and trader members only was designed to deal under normal conditions with matters affecting their respective interests.  A board so constituted is not considered a suitable body to deal with the problem which will arise if the present restricted transit and other facilities are still further impaired.  Accordingly, it is intended to re-constitute the board by appointing to it persons who have had the question of the maintenance of the supply of milk for the Dublin district and its distribution in abnormal conditions under examination for some time past.  It is probable that the reconstituted board will consist of the chairman of the present board with representatives of my Department and of the Departments of Supplies, Industry and Commerce and Local Government and Public Health, all of which Departments are concerned in the milk supply to the Dublin district.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to retain the services of the members of the present board in the capacity of an advisory council to the reconstituted board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture what was the average price per cow paid in compensation to suppliers of Ballingarry Co-operative Creamery for dairy cows slaughtered during the period of foot-and-mouth disease last year; and why were those suppliers not allowed to re-stock from May 14th, 1941, to December 1st, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The average rate of compensation paid to suppliers of Ballingarry Creamery in respect of all cows slaughtered was between £19 and £20.</P>
      <P>The date on which re-stocking was permitted in the Ballingarry area had to be postponed owing to successive outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in or near Ballingarry district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) whether the case presented to him by the committee of Ballingarry Co-operative Creamery for compensation for dairy cows slaughtered during foot-and-mouth disease in 1941 was considered by his Department; and (b) whether in reviewing those cases the officers of his Department took into consideration the fact that the ports were opened for the export of in-calf heifers before those people were allowed to re-stock; and (c) whether any representative of those people was given an opportunity to state their case for greater compensation when the matter was under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="209" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative; as regards the second part, consideration was given to this matter but as a fair market value was allowed at the time of the actual slaughter of the animals I was not satisfied that there were adequate grounds for further payments; as regards the final query, I did receive a deputation from the Ballingarry area and considered the representations made by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, did the Minister think it was fair to give to those people only the price obtaining when there was no export trade, and to allow them to restock only when the export trade had restarted?  The Minister promised the deputation that he would go into that matter.  Those people got £19 for their cows, and had to buy in-calf heifers for £6 or £7 more after the ports had been opened by the British.  Does the Minister think that that was fair or will he look into the matter?  I think that those people were most unfairly dealt with.  Their land was idle for six months, and then they had to buy in the open market when cattle had gone up £6 or £7 a head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not entirely agree with the Deputy.  Under the Diseases of Animals Acts it is laid down that a fair market value will be paid in case of slaughter, and there is no reference to the period of restocking. In all probability, those who got compensation previous to that got more than the value, and those in the Ballingarry area got at least the value of the cattle at the time they were slaughtered.  They were in a position to restock before there was any export of milch cows or young heifers.</P>

      <P>Private Michael O'Dowd received fatal injuries when the Army motor cycle <Col N="213" /> which he was riding crashed into a civilian lorry.  The court of inquiry held to investigate the occurrence found that Private O'Dowd's injuries were caused by his misconduct in attempting to pass another vehicle at a crossroads and, especially, when that vehicle had signalled its intention of turning.  The court further found that Private O'Dowd appeared to have been travelling at an excessive speed.  In such circumstances, I regret that the question of compensating the deceased's dependents cannot be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined even to waive No. 14 if I could get any guarantee from the Minister&mdash;and I suggest it would be only fair&mdash;that opportunity would be given to bring in cases that occurred before this amending Bill was brought in, that opportunity would be given to anyone who felt aggrieved, as in the cases I indicated last night, of coming before the referee and having their cases considered before him.  I think that would meet the principal objections I had in mind in regard to the Bill.  The previous Bill, as passed by the House, gave no court of appeal from the assessor.  The assessor merely told you: &ldquo;You are entitled to £50 or £5 or to nothing at all,&rdquo; and there was <Col N="216" /> no court of appeal.  This furnishes a court of appeal of some kind and, in view of the cases I quoted last night, I wonder would the Minister be prepared to make this section of the Bill retrospective and allow it to deal with the outstanding cases I mentioned.  I think that would meet the principal objection I see to the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not let this occasion pass without paying very great tribute to Deputy Corry, because, after 15 years' experience in this House, he has at last been converted to what I regard as a very sensible point of view.  Ever since he came into this House, on any occasion, mild or rough, there was one section of the community that he always criticised, namely, the legal profession. They were the one people who could do no good for anybody or who were entitled to get no recognition of any sort.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry has gone out of his way on this Bill to introduce an amendment which would permit anybody who had a grievance against the people who operate this fund to bring an appeal to the Circuit Court. Naturally, I am delighted and I regret very much that I cannot adopt his viewpoint.  I am delighted to see he has gone so far.  I am under the impression that if the Minister accepted this amendment there would probably be compensation claims for the next ten years.  It is with great regret I have to say I cannot support his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I understand, when this Bill first came in, this scheme was operated by people who are representatives of the cattle trade.  They are people who are nominated by the cattle traders themselves and, as far as I know, who command the absolute confidence of the cattle trade.  Deputy Corry mentioned cases of people who felt they had a grievance about the question of payment and he said at one stage of his address yesterday that he had 65 letters.  My information is that out of some hundreds of claims that passed through the particular body dealing with this matter in less than <Col N="217" /> 1 per cent. was any question raised about the amount of compensation paid.  When I was first asked about this position I suggested that, in fairness, something should be adopted on the principle of ordinary insurance, where there was a dispute between the insured and the insurance company&mdash; which is really what the board is, to a certain extent, that is, that there should be an arbitration.  I do not see any reason in the world to object to what the Minister is doing now.  If you are going to have an arbitrator, somebody must appoint him and as long as he does his job well, there could be no question of the present system that the Minister suggests.</P>
    <P>If, having given this particular method a trial for a year or two, we find it is not working, it would then be open to us to come back to this House&mdash;because the Minister is appointing the referee&mdash;and criticise the Minister's appointment, or ask the Minister to alter the scheme.  I am quite satisfied from what I have heard from the members of the cattle trade, from the way the scheme has already worked, and from the fact that there is a large sum of money, which is not the property of the board, or of the people interested in this, but the property of this community in the sense that it was taken off the producer in the first instance&mdash;that the less opportunities that would be given for any wastage of that money the better.  I felt originally that confining the decision merely to the Board of Assessors nominated by the board was rather harsh, and I am quite satisfied that the appointment of a referee in the position of arbitrator will meet the whole case.</P>
    <P>I do not like to question Deputy Corry's <i>bona fides</i> in bringing in his amendment, but Deputy Broderick and I and several other Deputies were anxious to know whether, in fact, the 65 letters that Deputy Corry mentioned to us represent 65 separate cases, or whether, in fact, these 65 letters represent only one or two cases?</P>
    <P>The strongest case that could possibly be made about the administration of an Act of this sort is the <Col N="218" /> total number of claims paid, and the number questioned.  Assuming there were 100 claims paid and only one questioned, that is a very strong argument in favour of the system in operation.  The position would be different if 50 or 60 were questioned. If, in fact, 55 claims were questioned, I should be very glad to know the reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the most objectionable part of Deputy Corry's statement was the implication in it of victimisation in this particular case. That, of course, reflects on the administration of the board.  I need not point out to the Minister the democratic way in which the board is appointed.  It is appointed by the whole of the cattle trade association.  The directors were appointed by them, and they appointed the assessors.  The Bill proposes to amend the method of appointment.</P>
      <P>It will mean that three directors will be going off every year.  That removes the possibility of a lengthy period of service.  One of the reasons why I feel so much about the impeachment of the board, and the charge of victimisation, is that every one of the directors is a number himself and a shipper.  It would be a dangerous thing for any member to lay down the precedent of not giving adequate value or of penalising anybody, since he himself might, so to speak, be a plaintiff before the same court later.  It would be an extraordinary thing for members of the board not to honour their obligation by giving a lesser value than they were entitled to since that might react on themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there is a huge accumulation of money in connection with this, the one thing that I fear is that more than generous treatment might be given. This mutual insurance scheme has been in operation for about two and a half years.  It was started when insurance policies were 47/6 per cent.  That has been reduced to 10/- per cent. Funds to the amount of £200,000 have accumulated in the meantime.  Of that sum, £120,000 is invested in Government <Col N="219" /> securities.  The State has the advantage of it.  It is not the property of any group of individuals, of the cattle traders or of anybody else.  If this company had not been set up, and the scheme put into operation, one can realise how much money at the old rate of 47/6 per cent. would have gone to foreign insurance companies and left the country.  I think that instead of impeaching those men and making charges of victimisation against them they are entitled to the greatest possible consideration as well as the commendation of this House and the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit, I think, in one of Deputy Corry's amendments on the question of a court of appeal.  The Minister is now proposing to meet that by appointing a referee and holding himself answerable to the House on the question of the sufficiency, or otherwise, of any compensation paid.  I would not care for a proposal to have an appeal to the courts.  This was the first time that I ever heard Deputy Linehan advocate anything that would help to add anything to the income of the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments submitted have the approval of the executive of the cattle traders' association, and I do not think there is any reason for cavilling at the provision that is being made for a continuance of the great benefit which this scheme confers on the cattle trade. Prior to its introduction our insurance was not half as extensive as it is to-day.  Formerly, when cattle were landed alive at the other side that ended all liability.  The scheme now proposes to take in the ports in <Col N="220" /> Northern Ireland, so that cattle from the South going through these ports will benefit in the same way as cattle going through our own ports.  That will be of enormous help to our producers. There is the greatest possible safeguard in this that any losses entailed will eventually be recouped to the producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a compulsory scheme, where an individual is compelled to do something, there is something to be said for the right of appeal to some court.  Therefore, I think there was some merit in the original suggestion that there should be some court of appeal.  This is a mutual society.  The board is elected in a democratic way by the members of the live-stock trade.  An opportunity is given periodically to dismiss the personnel of the board if it is felt that the members of it are not performing their duties properly. Obviously, if Deputy Corry's amendment were agreed to, the courts would have the power to mulct the people benefiting by this scheme in considerable costs.  In that way, a lot of money might be dissipated.  Therefore, <Col N="221" /> I think the amendment brought in by the Minister is a proper one in the circumstances.  He will be empowered to nominate a referee to act as a final court of appeal to which any man who feels that he has not been fairly treated can go.</P>
      <P>I think it cannot be suggested that any individual has been unfairly treated, or that there was any bias on the part of the board for or against any individual.  Their anxiety was to work this scheme honestly and in the best interests of the cattle trade as a whole, and I think they deserve every praise for doing that.  But the House must bear in mind that when we legislate here we are not legislating for the purpose of having this scheme operated by any particular board.  There may be changes and the working of the scheme in the future may not be performed as well as it is at the present time, so every possible safeguard must be made to protect the interests of individuals. I think this is a proper way of doing it, and it will not involve the society in very much expense.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment submitted by the Minister.  I support the suggestion that appeals should be made to the referee.  I think the provision for a deposit of £10 will be a safeguard so that no fictitious claims will be brought.  There must be some substance in an appeal, or else the person making it will lose his deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that I am not pressing amendment No. 14, with reference to an appeal to the court, in view of this amendment, which goes a long way to meet my case. By putting down amendment No. 14 and other amendments, I succeeded in getting this amendment from the Government, so my amendments served their purpose, and the submission of this amendment proves I was right in my contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the same opinion as Deputy Linehan expressed of his court. Deputy Linehan has so poor an opinion of his court that he has an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court, from the Circuit Court to the High Court, and even to the <Col N="222" /> Supreme Court, and those courts are all run by the legal profession.  He has such a poor opinion of the legal profession that he is prepared to accept one referee against the whole of them.  He seems to have a very poor opinion of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>This scheme has been in operation for the past two years without any court of appeal.  The amendment that has been submitted by the Minister sets out: &ldquo;...if, but only if, the claimant, within seven days after such service, requests the board in writing to refer his claim to the standing referee and deposits with the board a sum (in this sub-section referred to as the appeal fee) equal to £10 or 5 per cent.  of the appointed minimum value of each animal to which the claim relates....&rdquo; I entirely agree with that.</P>
    <P>I do not want frivolous cases brought before any court.  The Minister saw fit to put in this amendment, with the consent of the cattle trade.  I should like to pay this tribute to the cattle trade&mdash;that they were damn fine canvassers. We could not see a trace of them until my amendments were put down, and then you could not walk down the corridor without falling over one of them.</P>

There are 65 of those cases and I hope the Minister will make the clause retrospective so that this man, who had no redress so far, and who could not go into court owing to the action of the House, will be given an opportunity of having his case heard.</P>
      <P>He had no court of appeal.  Three or four cattle dealers came together and they said: &ldquo;We might give him a fiver, or perhaps £10, or nothing at all&rdquo;&mdash;it was just according to their own sweet will.  I do not want to impeach them in any way, but those are the facts.  This man should have an opportunity of going before the referee. If his case is frivolous, he will be paying £10.  I think the Minister ought to accept that suggestion.  Let us get rid of this atmosphere of suspicion that has cropped up as to the manner in which the Act has been operated.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the whispering campaign that has gone on in the corridors for the past fortnight. That man insured his animals, his milch cows and springer heifers, for £50 each.  When he discovered that all the compensation he would get for two animals, after paying £39 in insurance on the lot, was £1 5s., he came to the conclusion that there was no purpose served by wasting his money insuring his animals in that way, and he then proceeded to insure them for 5/- each. He insured 79 cattle for £50 each and he paid £39 for the insurance.  Two of the cattle got injured.  They were seen by the company's veterinary surgeon and were taken over by the company's agent and salvaged or sold to the knacker, and the amount they realised was 25/-.</P>

Those men who investigated the cases were honourable, intelligent men and they decided on the evidence that came before them.  This case that Deputy Corry has referred to would appear, on the face of it, a vindictive act of discrimination.  This is a thing that the House could not let go on any group of responsible men.  The Minister has answered the question that I put to Deputy Corry and that was: did they come within the terms of the insurance?  We must remember that the insurance, the mutual insurance of the cattle trade to-day, is the widest possible type of insurance in this country; yet, wide as it was, those animals did not come within its terms.</P>

      <Col N="227" /> What I am trying to do is to deal with the merits of the measure, but I have a natural feeling of resentment against any implication of unfair treatment or victimisation.  Nobody believes the smallest part of any such allegation.  I want to ask Deputy Corry one question, and I hope the answer to it will afford some information to the House.  How often has this one cattle trader been compensated, and on how many occasions has he been more than pleased with the amount of compensation which the board of directors considered he was justly entitled to?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the number of cattle which this man shipped, he has not got one-sixth of the compensation which smaller cattle dealers than he have got.  The proof of the manner in which he was dealt with is here in these 65 cases which were turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite clearly, from the Deputy's statement, many other cases were put up to the board of directors.  Has this man not been perfectly satisfied with the treatment of him by the board of directors in other cases in which they considered he was legally entitled to compensation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, in the name of common sense, what is the idea of impeaching a body of this kind?  In one case he is amply compensated and feels perfectly satisfied, but in another case, because the board did not give compensation, they are to be impeached as dishonourable and as victimising people.

I have been successful in partly getting rid of that trouble, and all I am asking now is that the Minister should agree to make that section retrospective, so as to enable any cases outstanding to be brought before the referee and dealt with.

      <P>To delete sub-section (2), and substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Sub-section (2) of Section 18 of the Principal Act is hereby amended in the following respects&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the insertion before the word &ldquo;until&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;from the time such animal is put on board a ship at a port in the State&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(b)  by the deletion of the word &ldquo;seventy-two&rdquo; where it occurs and the substitution therefor of the word &ldquo;eighty-four&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made here is that when the <Col N="231" /> original Act was going through it was laid down that the cattle exporter would be covered as regards insurance until the cattle reached their place of destination on the other side, that is, the farm or slaughterhouse to which they were going, or for a period of 72 hours, whichever period was the shorter.  If they reached the slaughterhouse or farm in less than 72 hours, then the insurance ceased at that point.  It was pointed out to me, however, by the cattle trade that transit has become very much slower than it was when the original Act was brought in two years ago, and they suggested that we should make some extension. There was a difference of opinion about that, but I think that, on the whole, 84 hours is reasonable.  There is a certain danger of substitution of our cattle, and that sort of thing, on the other side if you make the period too long, and the best compromise we can arrive at is to put in the figure of 84 hours instead of 72, and if the beast has not reached his destination, then he is not covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a proposal of the board or of the cattle trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather alarmed about this question of the risk of substitution that the Minister has mentioned. It would be a serious thing if fresh cattle were to be substituted on the other side and public funds mulcted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they pointed out to me that the beast is consigned from here to somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It only covers the beast for 84 hours on his way to where he is consigned to.  If he is consigned to some other place afterwards, he is not covered.  I think there would be a danger in Deputy Corry's amendment of giving 12 hours after the arrival of the beast at his destination, because if there were a sick beast on the farm they might substitute a beast that had just arrived.</P>

While I am not at all convinced that there is anything in the case which Deputy Corry has made with regard to this particular gentleman&mdash;I do not know anything about the case myself, and the Deputy has not told us the circumstances, or what accidents those cattle met with&mdash;at the same time, from the point of view of procedure, if any Deputy feels that he has a grievance I think we ought not to establish a precedent by letting the Bill out of the House without giving ample opportunity for having it amended.  We have not been accustomed to doing that.  It is a question of procedure in the House.  But I think Deputy Corry would be well advised to withdraw his objection and, as the Minister rightly suggested, let some of his friends move it in the Seanad.  I do not think he has made a good case here, and I am sure he could make at least an equally good case in the Seanad.  On a point of procedure, I think Deputy Corry is entitled to his rights and, if he insists on them, I do not see how we can push the Bill against him.</P>

I think it would be very unfair to the entire trade, particularly to those who are trading with the North of Ireland and who are paying those insurance contributions, to hold up the Bill until February.  We are anxious that everyone should be satisfied.  No one is more anxious than I am that this gentleman who claims that he has sustained a serious loss should be satisfied that the board has decided the case on its merits.  At the same time, I would ask Deputy Corry to accept the Minister's suggestion and get the amendment moved in the Seanad.  It would be very unfair to the trade to hold the matter over until the Dáil meets in February.

However, I am quite prepared to discuss the matter with Deputy Corry, if he wishes to have an amendment moved in the Seanad.

If there is any danger of any reflection being cast on the character, good name or integrity of this board by insinuations of this character, I think the best way to safeguard the interests and good name of the board, and clear the public mind of any doubts which might arise as a result of what has been said in this House would be to give an opportunity of reviewing this case.  Let us remember that this gentleman will have to put down a deposit of £10 per beast in order to have the case reviewed.  If he feels that it is worth risking the loss of a further £10 a beast, he must be convinced that his grievance is a real one.  If there is any danger of any reflection being cast on the good name of this board, I think it might be as well to have this examination, in order to show that this business is being properly and sincerely and honestly conducted in the best interests of the people.</P>

    <P>This Estimate is concerned with subsidies on fertilisers.  Deputies will remember that last year there was only one compound fertiliser obtainable. The amount distributed last year was about 28,000 tons, and it was distributed roughly on the basis of about one-quarter of what each firm had purchased the previous year.  In the season 1938-39, to go back to normal times, it is estimated that 130,000 tons of superphosphate and 126,000 tons of other artificial fertilisers were used, so that the quantity of the artificial fertiliser available last season fell very far short of our normal requirements.  At the close of the 1941-42 season all available stocks of imported phosphate were exhausted, and if no further importations are to take place the only superphosphate procurable in the 1942-43 season will be that manufactured from Clare phosphate.  The quantity of Clare phosphate likely to be available in the 1942-43 season may amount to 20,000 tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>20,000 tons.  Pyrites are required for the manufacture of the sulphuric acid necessary for the production of superphosphate from raw phosphate.  The stocks of pyrites in this country at the end of the 1941-42 season amounted to about 5,000 tons. That would be sufficient to process about half the Clare phosphate.  We must, therefore, import a further quantity of 5,000 tons of pyrites for the treatment of the remainder of the Clare phosphate.</P>

Next year we may have a better supply of native pyrites.  If we had no import then of raw phosphate, we would be in a position to turn out about 40,000 tons of treated superphosphate. The prospect of obtaining any supplies of nitrogenous or potassic fertilisers is very remote.</P>
      <P>The position, however, would be that we would find it very hard to maintain the yield of our essential crops, such as wheat, potatoes and beet.  In the circumstances the problem of importing further quantities of phosphates and pyrites has been explored, but owing to the high existing rates for freights the importation of phosphate and pyrites for the manufacture of superphosphate could not be regarded as a commercial proposition.  To give some idea of comparative prices, the pre-war average cost of imported phosphate was £1 11s.  0d.  per ton, and of imported pyrites £1 3s.  0d.  per ton. Last year, in the season 1941-42, imported phosphate had gone up to £7 15s.  6d. per ton, and imported pyrites to £3 3s. 0d.  per ton.  It is estimated that the cost of importing phosphate from Florida will be £30 a ton, and of importing pyrites from Spain £22 a ton.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party is the cleverest <i>post factum</i> party that I have ever met.  In the ordinary way, the retail price of the resultant superphosphate would be altogether too high, having regard to the current price of agricultural produce.  It is proposed to make arrangements for the importation of 24,000 tons of phosphates and the pyrites needed for the treatment of this quantity.  It is intended to bring in about 24,000 tons of phosphates from Florida.  I am not sure that it will be possible to get the raw phosphates from Florida now. That will mean another 12,000 tons of pyrites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a scientific fact, and I can assure the Deputy that it is true. It is proposed, as I have said, to pay a State subsidy sufficient to have the resultant superphosphate sold at a retail price of £15 a ton.  That would be a superphosphate of 40 per cent. In addition, it is proposed to import the quantity of pyrites necessary for the treatment of Clare phosphate, and to pay a subsidy on the same basis.  To provide for the expenditure that that will involve, and to meet contingencies, it is estimated that the sum of £800,000 shown in the Supplementary Estimate will be required.  We are budgeting for the maximum amount of raw phosphates that can be got, but I am afraid we will not get that much at any time owing to transport difficulties. If we can get them, taking 20,000 raw phosphates from Clare and 24,000 tons of raw phosphates from Florida, we will have about 80,000 tons of superphosphates for distribution. That would be considerably more than we had last season, but still not nearly as much as we used in normal times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You may take it that, roughly, the Clare phosphate is 20 per cent., and the other 40 per cent.  Of the total phosphate, there will be a small amount of nitrogen, possibly I per cent., to include in the artificial for this year.  Possibly there will also be 1 per cent. of potash.</P>

When the Clare and Florida phosphates are mixed half and half, we will have a phosphate of almost 30 per cent. soluble. There will also be a small amount of nitrogen and a small amount of potash in the mixture.  I cannot state definitely yet when this manure will be available.  It is hoped to release it in two consignments this year, to release the first consignment to farmers in February, and the second consignment about the 1st of May in time for the later crops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The securing of artificial manures for agricultural purposes is a matter of very great importance, and the efforts of the Government in this direction so far have not shown any great measure of success.  I appreciate the difficulty of the shortage of shipping and the fact that prices appear to a great extent to be prohibitive. But, when we consider this matter, we must take into account certain aspects of it.  First of all, in some <Col N="245" /> districts the lack of artificials is a far greater handicap than in other districts. In old tillage districts the lack of artificials, combined with a deficiency of humus matter in the soil, has seriously retarded production and it is likely to have a progressive effect on the production of the land.  I suggest to the Minister that, if manure is available, some consideration ought to be given to that aspect when distribution schemes are being arranged. Where you have old grass lands with a good deal of humus matter and fertility stored up, obviously there is no necessity for a great use of artificials. In the richer lands, where you have sufficient fertility, there would not be any necessity for using artificials to any great extent.</P>
      <P>In districts where you have had intensive cultivation over a period of years, particular attention should be devoted to the question of manures. Perhaps the Minister might examine into the possibility of securing a supply and ensuring, in the matter of distribution, that a greater proportion of artificial manure will go to those districts where the problem is more acute.  Unfortunately, so far as we have been informed by the Minister, there appears to be no possible hope of getting a supply of nitrogenous manure.  The ordinary farmer will realise that that is a very severe handicap, in some cases perhaps a greater handicap than the loss of phosphates. If we had a small supply of nitrogenous manure and sulphate of ammonia it would establish a crop, and often when you get a crop established it means half the battle.  If a crop is not properly established in the early stages, the result will be that you will have a lot of misses and those misses will be eventually filled in by weeds. The weeds draw on the fertility of the soil and cause foulness in the land. Usually, the weeds are smothered where you have a full crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, even if the State has to subsidise the importation of artificial manures, it might be well worth while.  Taking the long view, I think it would be a good policy to vote a substantial sum in that direction. <Col N="246" /> The Minister has not given the House any information as to the possibility of procuring Chilean nitrates, or what the price would be.  The Minister must appreciate that if you have 1 cwt. of nitrogenous manure and 1 cwt. of nitrate of soda it will probably increase the production of an acre of grain by a barrel and a half.  It would be almost equal to the value of 1½ cwts. of wheat, because it would have the effect of keeping the land in a clean condition, capable of giving a full crop. The farmer would have an opportunity of converting the straw into farmyard manure, which would go back into the soil.  These are considerations that should not be overlooked.  At first glance, the price of Chilean nitrates or any nitrogenous manure that can be procured might appear prohibitive, but we should try to realise the advantages that would result from the use of such artificials.  I feel that even at a high figure the purchase of these artificial manures can be justified.</P>
    <P>I do not know if efforts have been made by the Government to secure artificial manures from across the water.  We are all aware that the chemical industries there are producing huge quantities of sulphate of ammonia, and that is the only artificial manure not rationed to the British farmer.  They are to some extent limited in the amount of phosphates, but there is still a considerable quantity available for individual use, and they must take care to ensure that each individual will get a supply.  As regards sulphate of ammonia, the supply is sufficient to leave the market uncontrolled and the farmers are in a position to buy all the sulphate of ammonia they require at £10 a ton.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any attempt has been made by the Government to trade our commodities in exchange for sulphate of ammonia.  The suggestion was made that we should exchange stout. It takes good land to produce good barley, and in exchanging stout for nitrogenous manure and sulphate of ammonia it would simply mean that we would be exchanging good barley for manure.  If the manures increase our production, and enable us to create bigger surpluses, those surpluses will <Col N="247" /> eventually go back to the country that releases the sulphate of ammonia and other manures.  I am convinced that if an effort was made by the Government along the right lines, satisfactory results could be achieved, but I am afraid that the proper approach has not been made to this problem.</P>
    <P>There are other weapons we might use in attempting to bargain for a supply of nitrogenous manures.  The fact that Great Britain has a milk problem, and in this country we have any amount of useful stock for dairying purposes&mdash;and this is the only country where they can get that type of basic stock&mdash;could be used to our advantage. It might be indicated that we are willing to co-operate in that connection and are prepared to release maiden heifers and in-calf heifers suitable for dairying purposes.  But if we are prepared to do that we are entitled to a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  The lack of artificial manure is the greatest handicap the farmer has to suffer.  That applies particularly to my constituency&mdash;Carlow and South Kildare&mdash;and to the Minister's constituency, where they have fairly intensive tillage operations.  The Minister no doubt appreciates the difficulty of farming under those conditions. While we were lucky this year to get fairly decent results, we must realise that it was an abnormal year, and we cannot hope for that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>There is bound to be a progressive reduction in the yield from these crops. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the possibility of getting rock from North Africa, in the changing circumstances of the time, ought to be kept constantly under examination, because if it is possible to get it from North Africa it is bound to reduce considerably the cost of the raw phosphate.  I suggest that the point be kept constantly under observation, with a view to securing some cargoes of rock from that country.</P>

      <P>Do not ever be in the slightest doubt about it.  I want to pass on to the next matter now.  When listening to Deputy Hughes, who I know to be one of the best farmers in the country and from whom I have learned a lot, I can never fully understand his attitude on the subject of humus and artificial manures.  I always seem to gather that when he is speaking of these two things, he identifies them as the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of the problem is that if you have an abundant supply of artificial manures, that is the time when you must be most apprehensive about a decrease in the humus content of the soil, and that in a time of shortage of artificial manures the strain upon the humus content of the soil is proportionately less.  I listened to Deputy Hughes to-day speaking of the necessity of artificial manures in order to preserve the humus content of the soil of the intensively <Col N="251" /> cultivated areas of Eastern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon; that is what I understood him to say.  The very reverse, so far as I understand it, is the case.  During this period when we have inadequate supplies of artificial manures, we may expect the humus content of the soil which has been subject to heavy artificial manuring in the past to recover somewhat, but it is perfectly true that the soil of intensively cultivated parts of Ireland must now be very materially deficient in potash, phosphate and nitrogen.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has the barefaced audacity to get up to-day and say that nobody in the House asked him to bring in phosphates in abundance before the present situation of absolute scarcity eventuated.  Is it or is it not true that every year for the past eight years the Fine Gael Party has asked the Fianna Fáil Government to take the tariffs and quotas off artificial manures?  Is it or is it not true that, year after year after year, we warned the Government that their policy of preventing the farmers from getting adequate supplies of superphosphate of lime would have a horrible result ultimately?  Is it not true that, at the Ard Fheis of the Fine Gael organisation, a plank was inserted in the Fine Gael platform that artificial manures should be freely available to the farmers, without tariff or quota restrictions of any kind, and is it not true that Fianna Fáil consistently insisted that the manure manufacturers of this country must get their pound of flesh and that no farmer would be allowed to get an ounce of manure if he did not pay his toll and levy to the manure tariff racketeers in Ireland?</P>

      <P>Yes they continued it up to about nine months ago.  Is it not true that every farmer who wanted to buy a bag of manure over the past ten <Col N="252" /> years had to pay his toll to the shareholders in the Irish manure factories here before he could get it?  Is it not true that up to about nine months ago there were tariff restrictions on the importation of manures into this country? Is it not true that these manufacturers, who were piling up unprecedented riches, did little or nothing towards the accumulation of a stock of phosphate rock for use here?  Would not one imagine that any other body of men, growing fat and rich and sleek on the plunder that they have taken during the last eight or nine years, would be prepared to take a little tithe of what they robbed the Irish people of and have invested it in the purchase of some large open space, then bring in, in whatever ships could be chartered, phosphate rock and dump it there so that, when the time of scarcity should come, they would be able to say: &ldquo;Well, if we did rob and plunder and bleed you during the last ten years, at least, in some sort of self-justification, now, in a time of scarcity, we will return to you a tithe of what we stole from you and ask you to forgive us the rest?&rdquo;  Even if they had made that feeble gesture of restitution. I think the Irish people would have been glad to say: &ldquo;Very well, die in peace!  We forgive you nine-tenths of your robbery and are prepared to accept the tithe in redemption of your theft.&rdquo;  But they would not even do that, and we are blandly informed now by the Minister for Agriculture that the cupboard is bare&mdash;there is nothing there&mdash;and that if we want to get any in now we shall have to pay £30 a ton for it and risk the lives of Irish seamen to fetch the phosphate rock across the seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Minister now says that nobody in Dáil Eireann ever thought that this thing could take place and that everybody, like himself, was amazed when it did take place&mdash;that nobody realised that this situation would materialise, and that he did not realise it until suddenly the revelation struck him and he told us all about it. Well, words must have lost their meaning if Dáil Eireann can sit in silence and listen to that.  There must not be a single Deputy over there on the <Col N="253" /> Fianna Fáil Benches who does not remember bawling like a bull for tariffs on the importation of artificial manures.</P>
    <P>Is there one amongst the eight of them who are sitting over there now who did not do his share of bawling for tariffs on artificial manures?  There is not a yap out of them now, however. I see over there Deputy O'Reilly of Meath, Deputy Corry of Cork, Deputy Allen, and so on.  They are all sitting mumchance there now, but I remember the time when they were roaring throughout the country about the protection of Irish industries and asking that tariffs and quotas should be clapped on so as to prevent foreign manures from coming in.  Now we are told blandly by Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, that if they did so he never heard them.  On the other hand, I see Deputy Hughes, Deputy McGilligan, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Keating, and Deputy McGovern of Cavan, over there on the Fine Gael Benches, and I remember every one of these men warning the Government of the danger of preventing artificial manures from coming into this country, both from the point of view of the deterioration of the soil, the decline in its fertility, and also from the point of view of the danger that the day would come when it would be impossible to get these manures in at all.</P>

According to what he says, he never heard any representations on the matter and it is only now that he has woken up to this serious situation.  Now, I do not attach too much importance to the brains or intelligence of the eight members sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches at the moment, but if they can swallow that statement, then God help them.</P>

      <P>There they are!  Look at them!  Would any one of them get up and say that he shares the Minister for Agriculture's illusion that nobody protested against the restriction on the importation of artificial manures into this country during the last eight years?  Were they all deaf, too? Apparently, they were, or else they are dumb now.  Now, we were talking yesterday about unemployment and I said that one of the great crimes to be charged against this Government was that when large-scale schemes were required for the relief of unemployment it was discoverd that the preliminary work necessary to put the scheme into operation had not been done, and that when a scheme was urgently required for the relief of distress, our Government was prone to say: &ldquo;Well, it will take about nine months to prepare, and the boys will have to starve while we are doing the preparatory work.&rdquo;  Over the last three years, since the declaration of war in 1939, we have been at this Government to tell us whether there were phosphates in Clare and, if there were, to take all measures requisite to ensure that they would be placed at the disposal of the farming community of this country. The first difficulty was that the proprietor would not give the phosphate. The next difficulty was that there was no railway transport to get it out.  The third difficulty was that there were no roads to get it to the railhead.  All this while, however, we had 110,000 idle men in the country, wanting work and unable to get it, and as far as I can make out we are still without railways or roads to get out the phosphate. Is it true to say that one of the chief difficulties is that the transport facilities are not there, and that if the Minister could blast the rock out there still would be no means of carting it out?  Perhaps the Minister will tell me that that is one of the main difficulties in connection with the Clare phosphate deposits at the present time?  Is not the question of transport one of the main difficulties in the getting out of the rock?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all kinds of roads built all over the country.  There are roads running through bogs which no human foot will ever tread, but it appears that nobody thought to build a road in Clare.  There are thousands of unemployed men in County Clare, drawing the dole every week, and every one of them could be employed to make a road there, and I mean a real road that would carry heavy traffic to the railhead.  This is the winter of 1942, and we are starting the fourth year of the war, but we did nothing to build a road there, and I suppose that if the war goes on for another 50 years the Minister will start to think of building a road there, and by that time, I suppose, there will be no explosives with which to blast the rock.  I suppose we would all die at the thoughts of the Minister for Agriculture going into the Clare phosphate deposits with explosives. This is the man who has had the effrontery to get up here to-day and assail the Fine Gael Party as the greatest Party for <i>ex-post facto</i> statements that he has ever met.  When I look back on all the abuse that I heaped on that poor man's head for his catastrophic bungling of the whole agricultural situation of this country, and especially with regard to artificial manures, which did not seem to make the slightest impression on him, I begin to wonder if representations made in Dáil Eireann are of any use at all.  Has the Minister referred this question of phosphate rock and superphosphate to the Taoiseach's emergency Research Bureau?  I understand that the iron pyrites system is the one that is universally practised, and doubtless the most economic process of reducing this rock to a soluble manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I wonder is there no other chemical process, albeit it is more expensive, than the iron pyrites, sulphuric acid process to achieve this purpose.  As iron pyrites have now reached the level of £15 a ton delivered here, that makes it one of the most expensive methods for the reduction of phosphate rock, and it brings under consideration alternative <Col N="256" /> chemical methods that nobody might have bothered about when iron pyrites were available at £3 a ton.  Does anybody seriously believe that if the iron pyrites deposits in the world were suddenly exhausted, humanity would get on without sulphuric acid?  I do not believe it would.  They would simply cast around and find some other method of procuring this essential commodity. It may be a great deal dearer than it used to be but they would get it.  We have as good scientists on this Industrial Research Council as there are anywhere.  Have they been consulted, or, when we learned that supplies of sulphuric acid were not available from the common source of supply, have we all sat back and said: &ldquo;That's that, and there is no more we can do about it&rdquo;?  I believe at this moment that if adequate quantities of rock phosphates could be got out of the deposits in County Clare, ways and means could be found, albeit expensive, of reducing it to the condition of the superphosphate supplied for use on the land.  I believe that the reason why more energetic measures are not taken by the Government is that they know they cannot get the deposits out because they were too lazy during the last five years to take the necessary preliminary steps to provide transport.</P>
    <P>They do not want to get the phosphate rock in quantities in excess of what they can handle, and for that reason they are not going to get it&mdash; because they did not take time by the forelock and make the provision necessary for its reduction into a suitable form independent of the pyrites supplied from abroad.  I venture to swear that, if that problem were put up to the council, we would get the answer that there is another chemical method of dealing with rock phosphate, a chemical method that would be within reach of our resources at the present time.</P>
    <P>Let me pass on to potash.  I used to be a member for Donegal, and I well remember that, at the very beginning of this war, when potash manure became hard to come by, my instinctive interest in my old friends of the west coast of Donegal who used to make an income out of kelp, and who lost that <Col N="257" /> market, induced me to raise a question in Dáil Eireann as to whether seaweed should not be used on an unprecedented scale as manure in view of its potash content.  Deputy Joseph Mongan and Deputy T.J. O'Donovan have both raised that question time and time again in this House.  Deputy Mongan was able to point out that during the last war Mr. Martin McDonagh, of Galway, without any subsidy or anything else, bought the seaweed and converted it himself into some dehydrated commodity which was used as potash manure in the west of Ireland. The Minister for Agriculture informed us that his information was that it would be cheaper to cart it in a wet condition than to carry out any dehydration process upon it, but it is pure nonsense to suggest that it would be cheaper to cart seaweed from the Galway coast to the County Carlow in a wet condition, in the present state of our transport system, than to dehydrate it in Galway and ship it from Galway in a dehydrated condition to the centre where it is really required. At the present time we have to consider not only the matter of pounds, shillings and pence for freight charges; we have got to consider the capacity of the railway wagons.  Seaweed consists of about 90 per cent. water.  Does any man seriously suggest to me, in the present state of our transport, that we are to cart 9 parts of water and one part of weed, when, by dehydrating it on the Galway coast, we can ensure that we will be carrying nothing but pure potash seaweed?</P>
    <P>We all know that the potash content of seaweed bears little relation to the potash content of sulphate of potash, but it would be something.  The manure which the Minister provides for the country contains only about 1 per cent., and you might as well leave that out, because it is so microscopic that, by the time it is distributed over the soil, it will have no effect at all.  If we initiated a big drive to employ some of those agricultural labourers that we are going to prevent from going to England on gathering seaweed during those periods of the year when they are not actively engaged upon the land, dehydrate that seaweed, and <Col N="258" /> then distribute in the beet growing area the potash manure obtained from it, and reserve it for that area&mdash;I understand that potash is one of the most urgently necessary manures for the beet sugar crop&mdash;we would be doing something useful.  It might very well be that, at the conclusion of the emergency, we would have to scrap the machinery and wipe the whole thing off, but at least at this time when turnips and mangels and beet are badly required for human and animal food we would be able to keep the wheel turning.  It may be very much more difficult to do that now than it would have been two or three years ago, because to get any kind of machinery now is an extremely difficult business, but, if we can convert turf into charcoal, and can artificially dry turf, I suppose we should be able artificially to dry seaweed, and once you have got the seaweed dried I suppose the same machinery that would cut phosphate rock would cut seaweed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister will do anything about the seaweed business, but he should. However, seaweed is not the only source of potash; bone is a very useful source of potash.  Has any consideration been given to converting any available bones into bone manure? Bone manure used to be very popular in this country.  It used to be very widely employed, but as far as I can see it has almost gone off the market in the last two or three years.  I suppose the destruction of the pig population has rendered the supply of bones less abundant than it used to be; but there must still be a great deal of bone knocking about.  Deputy Belton suggests that we should disinter all the calves that the Minister for Agriculture slaughtered, and that their skeletons might be turned to account now.  However, I am not sure that the bones will be there.  They would probably have disintegrated in the soil by this time. The use of bone manure ought to be present to our minds, and an energetic campaign for the collection of bone refuse should be organised for the purpose of converting it into manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I want to put to the Minister is this: he has pointed out <Col N="260" /> that the available nitrogenous manure is sufficient only to put about 1 per cent. into the compound mixture.  That is waste of good nitrogen.  Surely it would be much more sensible to make up his mind what crops were most urgently in need of nitrogen, even if it had to be confined to a certain district, and put all the nitrogen out on those crops?  For instance, I think we could probably use nitrogen most economically at the present time on wheat, if you want wheat, and I think probably a great many of the wheat crops in the next season will stand in urgent need of nitrogen if the yield is not to fall out of all sight.  I would be inclined to go to the principal wheat producers in the country and give them whatever supply of nitrogen is available.  Then we would know it would be used for the best possible purpose.  I am not so familiar with beet growing.  I do not know whether nitrogen has any effect on the sugar content of sugar beet or not but take some crops where you are satisfied that you will get a positive return for every lb. of nitrogenous manure put out and use it on that crop.  Then you will get something for your nitrogen.  Distributing nitrogen broadcast in a compound mixture is, I think, wasting it.  You might as well throw it away, more especially when you have an alternative source of nitrogen for the mixed farm.</P>
    <P>Why has not the Minister conducted a more vigorous propaganda during the last two years for the cultivation of clover?  Clover is one of those mysterious plants which draw nitrogen from the earth and fix it in the soil.  A crop of clover, instead of drawing nitrogen from the soil, implants nitrogen in the soil and it is a common experience of those who have seen a field too liberally endowed with clover receiving a normal application of artificial manure that the oats will lie down because the nitrogen content of the soil is too high, owing to the additional nitrogen induced by way of artificial manure.  Why do not we try to make up the deficiency in nitrogenous manures in large areas of the country by planting clover?  It could be done and had it been done <Col N="261" /> we could, with a clear conscience, take the total available supply of nitrogenous manure and employ it exclusively on a very limited range of crops and even in a very limited area in the country.  I do not doubt that some Deputies in this House will take the view that too intensive application of nitrogenous manures over a confined area may overburden the land and impoverish the humus content of the land, as has occurred in certain States of America.</P>
    <P>That is not a view I share.  I do not think there is the slightest danger of impoverishing the humus content of our soil in our lifetime, with our climate and general conditions and the mixed farming that goes on pretty generally throughout the country but there is very great danger that you may get very large areas of the country which would become virtually unfertile for the want of nitrogen, potash and phosphate. I want to emphasise that nobody can doubt that the employment of large quantities of nitrogen on our land at the present time is calculated dangerously to reduce the phosphate and potash content of the soil and to mitigate against the fertility of the land as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have always taken the view that our fathers, since they acquired security of tenure in the land, put their money back into their land instead of putting it in the bank.  They invested their savings in increasing the fertility of their soil so that they would have something to fall back upon on the rainy day or that their children or their grandchildren would.  This is the rainy day.  Now is the time to spend what was saved up to insulate our people against the shocks of war or emergencies of this kind.  If we were to forbear from spending courageously the accumulated fertility of our soil at the present time, we would be like a miser who died of hunger in a garret and who was found to have £300 or £400 in the tick of his bed.  It would be daft to forgo our essentials for the purpose of increasing the fertility of our soil at the present time.  We should resolutely, cheerfully and courageously diminish the fertility of our soil at the <Col N="262" /> present time.  Now is the time to do that so that when the emergency is over we will be all in good fettle to proceed building up fresh reserves in good farming over the next ten or 20 years, so that if any future generation should stand in the same position as we stand now they will have the same reserve to fall back upon as was left to us by our fathers and grandfathers subsequent to the securing of fixity of tenure for them by better men than are in the public life of this country at the present time.</P>
    <P>The last subject I want to mention is this.  The way in which the subsidy is given is by handing over the whole thing to the manure manufacturers and they are supposed to abate the price of the manures by so much when they are distributing it.  I want to tell Dáil Eireann what I know they did and it was a very tricky and very astute thing.  Prior to the war, if you went to a manure manufacturer he produced his list and that list would be subject to certain discounts, if you paid in seven days or in 30 days or three months.  Those were the list terms. When you were presented with that list you would say to him: &ldquo;I will take the best discount you can offer.  Make it up on the basis that I will pay in seven days and give me a net price. Do not be chopping and changing the discounts, interests, and so forth.&rdquo; He would eventually work it all out and say: &ldquo;If you pay in seven days, I will deliver this manure to your station, say, at 3/8 per cwt.&rdquo; If it was superphosphates, you would say: &ldquo;I will not give you 3/8.  I will give you 3/6 net.&rdquo;  In 99 cases out of 100 you got the manure at 3/6 and that enabled you to sell it for 3/9 to the farmer. The manure manufacturer prepared his list prices in the knowledge that, when he came down to tin tacks, he would have to make that allowance.  What happened when the Government rebate came, supported by the tariffs and the quotas?  The manure manufacturers of this country formed themselves into a close ring.  They walked in, threw down their lists and said: &ldquo;Take that or leave it.  There will be no rebate of that list.  You will get the Government 5/- a ton and that is all.  There <Col N="263" /> will be no 2d. or 3d. per cwt. knocked off the price for you.  Take it or leave it.&rdquo;  The net result of it was that the boys put the entire subsidy in their own pocket&mdash;every penny of it.</P>
    <P>I never paid the list price.  In 20 years' dealing I never failed to get 2d. or 2½d. off per cwt.  That represents practically 5/- a ton.  When the Government subsidy came along, they said: &ldquo;You will get the Government subsidy.  Take that or leave it, if you do not want it.  There is a tariff and you cannot bring it in.  If you do not take what we offer, you will get none.&rdquo; In that circumstance, I remember going to the Minister for Agriculture and saying: &ldquo;Give me a licence and I will bring in a cargo of manure.&rdquo; Personally, in my little tin-pot shop I could not sell a cargo of manure, but I could get a few merchants to share the liability of the cargo, and we would have broken the ring.  I was told: &ldquo;No; these boys must have their pound of flesh.  That was the bargain. They were to be entitled to bleed every farmer in Ireland.  There was to be no exception.  They were to get their blood from every individual farmer, large and small, and we cannot stop the farmers in Ballaghaderreen and that district from being bled with the rest.  You must act as their leech. Bleed your neighbours and send in the blood.&rdquo;  That Minister there made that answer, and I here assert that every penny of the manure subsidy that was given by this House for the reduction of the price of manures in this country went into the pockets of the manure manufacturers in Ireland, and perhaps a farthing out of every 3d. was passed on to the farmer.  There was no means of proving that, because the official lists are there, but there is not a single Deputy in this House who dealt in artificial manures who does not know that what I am saying is true.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be becoming for Deputy O'Loghlen and myself to be comparing our respective business methods.  I am giving my experience of what happened in the country over a long term and I want the House to know this.  I trespass on the time of the House, but I think it is right that the House should know it. Sulphate of lime is a thing that is always sold for no profit, the same as Indian meal.  The average profit taken on a cwt. was 3d.  The great objective was to get supplies at an even figure, at 4/-, 3/9, or 3/6, so that you could charge 3/9, 4/-, or 4/3 for it.  I have had long experience of the trade.  If the list price worked out at 3/7½d., they came down to 3/6, so that you could sell it at 3/9.  If the list price was 3/5, you could get them to come down to 3/3, so that you could sell it at 3/6.  The day the subsidy, quota and tariff were introduced, that vanished.  The net result of it was that the entire subsidy went into the pockets of the manure manufacturers and the farmers got perhaps one-sixth or one-eighth.  It is right Dáil Eireann should know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warn Dáil Eireann now that, so long as we have the system whereby competition with the domestic manure ring is prohibited, that ring will rob the farmers and, by hook or by crook, will get the bulk of any subsidy paid by this House for a reduction in the price of manures into their own pockets.  The farmers will get none of it.  There is no means of securing manures to our farmers at a fair price except by the establishment of a manure monopoly to be controlled, run and operated by the Government, the accounts of which should be laid before this House annually, or, alternatively &mdash;and this, in my opinion, would be the better way&mdash;to have full free trade <Col N="265" /> in manures, and let us buy them wherever we can get them at the most advantageous price.  The system of having the Government as the sole monopolist is, I think, a very much second best, but it would still be better than having those blood-suckers operating.  I could buy manures on the markets of the world 20 per cent. cheaper than the Government would ever be able to produce them.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that, at the present time, the opening of the ports to free imports will not avail us much, because supplies are not available from abroad. In that situation, I say deliberately that the manure industry here should be a State industry.  For the duration of this crisis it should be operated by the Government on a non-profit basis. Any subsidy voted by this House for artificial manures should be applied exclusively to a reduction in the price of the manures to the farmer who uses them.  No part of this subsidy should find its way into the pockets of the manufacturers.  The only way to ensure that is to have the manures which we are going to produce produced by a State monopoly for the duration of this crisis.  At the conclusion of that period there should be open, free trade to buy manures, wherever we can get them, in the cheapest market in which they can be procured.  In default of that, the best plan would be that there should be a State monopoly which would manufacture and distribute the artificial manures required by the country. These are urgent matters, and I am going to ask the Minister to give an assurance to the House that, in some measure at any rate, he is not going to make as big a mess of this business in the months to come as he has made of it in the last three years.</P>

      <P>To judge by their statements, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hughes are not going to give much help to the House in this crisis.  Deputy Hughes' cure is that we should go now to North Africa for rock phosphates.  I think it would pay the Irish nation to send Deputy Dillon away as a one-man deputation to bring them over here. Deputy Dillon said that this Government had no foresight.  He should be <Col N="266" /> the last member of the House to stand up and tell us what we ought to have done.  When he sat on the benches opposite, beside Deputy Cosgrave, he outlined the terms on which he was prepared to assist this Government during the emergency.  His first proposal was to blow up all the beet factories, and his second, the abandonment of wheat growing.  The last suggestion was made five months after the war had started; and he is the gentleman who now gets up to talk about lack of foresight.  The Deputy has learned a lot since then.  He seems to be fine and strong, although he now has to eat flour made from the mildewed wheat that he spoke about three years ago.  He talked then of the mildewed rotten wheat grown in this country.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Deputy Dillon definitely attacked the Minister for Agriculture for not having foresight enough to pile up here rock phosphate.  I remember before the war started, and, in fact, some months after it had started, this same Deputy suggested that we should grow no more wheat but, instead, should bring in shiploads of it from Britain.  Deputy Hughes suggested to-night that we should now go over to Britain for nitrogen.  The position is that during last season the British Government only gave farmers in <Col N="267" /> Northern Ireland one-sixth of the nitrogenous manures given to them in the year previous.  They had only the same quantity for their own farmers. These are the cures which are being propounded by Deputy Dillon and by Deputy Hughes.  I do not agree for a moment with the arguments which were put up by Deputy Dillon in regard to the manufacturers.  I may say that I do not hold any brief for the manufacturers or for the retailers either.  So far I have not heard of Deputy Dillon's firm going bankrupt between the manufacturers and the consumers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry stated that the contributions of Deputy Hughes and Deputy Dillon to this debate were of no value.  I might equally describe Deputy Corry's contribution to it as not being so very valuable either.  If there is anything that I deprecate&mdash;and I do not care whether it comes from Deputy Dillon or Deputy Corry&mdash;it is the type of language that is used in this House about certain sections of the community, let them be wholesalers or retailers or anyone else.  It is very easy to describe people as racketeers and sharks.  Now, Deputy Corry must have had at his disposal, so far as the retail and wholesale prices of artificial manures are concerned, all the information that one could desire.  He could have had from the Department of Agriculture exact details of the wholesale and the fixed retail price of any article.  If the Deputy goes to the trouble of looking up that information&mdash;taking into account the cost of transport, the breaking up of large quantities, and the subsequent distribution, with the people handling and distributing these things on the basis that the Minister asked them to; I think there was hardly any compulsion in it, and the Minister was satisfied that the scheme was handled well&mdash;I do not think he will find any justification for describing people as racketeers or sharks.  I may have misinterpreted the Minister, and I wonder was I right in understanding him when he mentioned 24,000 tons of phosphate rock from the United States, and when he said he did not think it was possible to get that now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be grateful to have some indication from the Minister of how much he hopes to get now.  I understood that the amount of superphosphate we will have in the coming season was based on the 24,000 tons from America, together with what could be supplied from County Clare. If the Minister does not hope to get any supplies from America, then that puts a different complexion on the matter.  What does he expect to get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> There is one matter to which I wish to make reference.  It relates to pyrites.  I understand that, so far as the Irish supply is concerned, it comes from Wicklow, but I think the Minister must be aware that there are other places in the country where supplies of that material are available.  I do not know whether his Department has ever made a survey of other parts of the country where that material would be available.  I have a recollection of sending a sample of rock some years ago to the laboratory of one of the university colleges and they indicated that it contained a certain content of pyrites and sulphur.  At the time there was not any particular demand for it, but, if it would be of any assistance to the Minister now, I can give him as much information on the subject as I possess.  My technical knowledge of the matter is absolutely nil, but, if it would be of any use to the Minister, I shall give him the area where the discovery was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might be in a position to give him details of the analysis. Until this Vote came under consideration, I did not quite realise the importance of the matter.  My information was that at the end of the Boggeragh Mountains, on the Cork and Kerry border, an out-crop gave some indications of pyrites and sulphur.  It may not be very valuable, but yet it may be of considerable use in the present emergency.  I shall be glad to give the Minister details in regard to that place to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year there was a composite manure prepared and I understand there was a price fixed of £10 a ton.  In certain parts of my county, particularly in the intensive tillage areas, it was not possible for a number of people to get any of that composite manure at £10 a ton, plus freight charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They had to purchase manure, which I believe was something similar to the composite manure, at prices of from £20 to £25 per ton.  They were very <Col N="271" /> dissatisfied, but I suppose the Minister could not do anything in that respect, as it appeared that the merchants who supplied this manure were getting their supplies from outside.  It was not home-manufactured manure.</P>
    <P>In the coming year, if it is at all possible, the people should get uniform treatment, and, whatever price is fixed by the Department, a fair share of the manure should be made available to people in the districts I have in mind. Their whole difficulty seems to be that they were for a number of years dealing with merchants who got their supplies from outside, and consequently had to go to the same merchants last year for their ration of manure, and had to pay the extra price.  That occurred in the Athenry, Monivea and Menlough districts of the County Galway, which comprise part of the most intensive tillage district in the county.  As I have said, the people who were fortunate enough to get the composite manure informed me that the results from the home-manufactured manure were very much better than the manure purchased at the higher price of £20 to £25 per ton.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us enough to draw up a balance sheet and it is well that the country should know that balance sheet and should know exactly where we stand.  People who use this cry&mdash;I will not say they are people who should know better; they are people who do know better&mdash; that if 25 per cent. tillage will not give us food, we must have 30 per cent. and so on, cannot be honestly using it.  The controlling factor in our tillage system is manure.  To get a crop, you must have adequate manure, and I submit this to the Minister or to any man with practical experience or theoretical knowledge, once you scatter the available manure over a wider area than that manure is able to nourish reasonably well, you get a lesser return.  The lesson for us to learn&mdash;those of us who have not learned it long ago, and it is time the country was made wise on the point&mdash;is that our food supply is governed by our available manure.  I have not got the statistics to enable me to deal with our artificial manures in normal times and I do not know if the 250,000 tons mentioned by the Minister represent 250,000 tons pre-war.

      <P>Well, if I say: &ldquo;Yes, we should pay this price for those fertilisers,&rdquo;<Col N="274" /> how do I arrive at that?  You will have to relate it to something, and we are now confined to these 80,000 tons of farmyard manure.  We have no other source of supply, and on those two supplies depends the amount of food that can be grown.  I think that it would be better to spend that £800,000 in subsidising, if you like, the growing of more food for live stock, feeding the live stock here, and producing good manure, because we know what it consists of and what it can do.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not explain&mdash;or at least I did not understand him to explain&mdash;where this £800,000 would be eaten up.  Why did he not put up that £800,000 to subsidise barley, oats and wheat for animal food, so that we should have bacon and manure, so that we should have butter and manure? We are short of bacon and butter, and we are short of the manures that would be good and useful in giving us our food supplies.  I think it would be much better to spend this £800,000 in helping to grow more crops for animal food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, I think I was alone in this House in opposing the prosecution of people because they fed live stock with any of the food that they grow. I still maintain that position, and I think it would be better to spend the £800,000 in a special subsidy for growing wheat to feed the live stock, and let that wheat be used for the feeding of live stock so that we can have bacon and butter and also manure&mdash;manure that we all know and we all know what it can do.  With regard to this stuff that is to be put up, I know that I would not depend on it for a crop, and I would chance my arm on a crop with any man in this country.  I might experiment with it, but I would not chance my main crop with it, and I do not think that any farmer in this country would do it or could afford to do it.  I am sure the Minister has done his best.  I could go back and ask why did he not bring in phosphatic rock when it could be brought in, and he will never be forgiven for not doing so, but I realise that he must deal with the position as it is now, and there is no use in talking of what might have been done or what should have <Col N="275" /> been done.  We can tell him all about that on another occasion.  Here, however, we come to this matter of the £800,000.  I think it is a waste of time to be making a deal with Britain about some other products and getting in artificial manure in exchange.  I do not think anything will come of that. Britain is fighting for her life, standing on her own two legs, and I do not see that we can get anything from her by any bargaining powers that we may have.  When it comes, however, to talking about bringing in phosphatic rock from North Africa it seems ridiculous to a man who is facing his cropping year now.  That happens to be the greatest centre of hostilities in this world war at the moment, and if I were to get all the phosphate rock that is in North Africa, merely for going out there and bringing it home, well, I would not go out there, and neither would anybody here.  If he did, I do not think he would bring home very much, not what would fill his waistcoat pocket, and if he brought home his life he would be very lucky.</P>
    <P>It is all right talking about percentages of phosphates, soluble and all that, but we all know that these things do not always work out to specification. They may not act when you want them.  The weather may be severe on your crop&mdash;it may get stunted&mdash;and all the phosphates in North Africa will not stimulate that crop even when it does get moisture afterwards.  I do not agree with all the criticism of manure manufacturers.  Where our manufacturers have been lax is that I think they depend too much upon potash, phosphates and nitrates&mdash;too much of each kind being available at the same time.  They do not refine it sufficiently as they do on the Continent so as to have a delayed action, so to speak, in all these ingredients so that they will act at different times, and that when one is dying there is another coming up.  I know that a company that started here and was doing that was crushed out.  They were the best manures that were ever distributed in this country.  All you had to do was to send for these people and they came and looked at you soil, drew up a prescription, <Col N="276" /> much as a doctor does for a patient who hands it to the chemist, and they applied the manures accordingly and gave a detailed analysis.  We are a long way from that in this country, but we shall have to arrive at it some day.  I wonder was what Deputy Dillon put up to the Minister true with regard to these manures? The Minister told us that we are only getting 20,000 tons from the Clare phosphates.  Where would 20,000 tons go in supplying the nation?  If that is true, what effort is being made to develop these deposits?  Is it also true that there is no road?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>But we are mixing this with the Clare phosphates, and why not have all phosphates developed here instead of spending this money on the imported stuff?  I was interested in the Clare phosphates years ago.  As a matter of fact, I placed an order&mdash;I could not say now whether it was for 100 tons or 10 tons&mdash;but that was 20 years ago, and I am still waiting for that order to be executed.  Apparently they had no road then, and it would seem that they have no road now.  We would all be very glad to give them a trial, but why are they not developed? Why take the risk of importing foreign phosphates at a big price and paying a big State subsidy for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is their strength, or what is their availability.  You can have a manure with a fine analysis on paper, but you may find that it just is not the manure which the soil will assimilate when it wants to feed the plant.  It is a very dangerous thing to make too big an experiment with ingredients to which we have not been accustomed.  I can speak with a little practical experience of this.  Deputy Dillon asked me, by way of poking fun, <Col N="277" /> I suppose, how much of this had I used to grow wheat.  Well, if you are going to grow wheat successfully, you are not going to grow it mysteriously; you want to know what you are putting in to nourish it before you can count on getting a good crop.  It would be very difficult for any Deputy here to say whether or not you should spend this money.  Although I do not believe in placing ourselves in the hands of civil servants, I think that in this particular case we will have to place the matter in the hands of the civil servants and the Minister, because they alone have all the references and can sit down and study this question.  Personally, I feel that we have to trust them.  None of us here has the time or the opportunity to sit down and consider the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that he ought to consider what are the products most needed by the nation, products that those artificial manures are required to nourish.  The quantity is too small to try to scatter it over too many crops.  Deputy Corry suggested wheat and beet.  I have no practical experience of growing beet commercially.  I grew it only once, and that was in 1925, in the experimental year when it was tried out in every one of the 26 counties. I have no commercial interest in it, but from the national point of view, I would support Deputy Corry's suggestion.  I understand that beet is mostly grown with artificial manures, and that the shrinkage in the beet crop is largely due to the shortage of those manures.  Therefore, I think that the beet crop should get a good ration of whatever artificial manure is available.  The wheat crop is one that this country is called upon to produce to a very increased extent during the emergency.  Consequently, it needs a greater amount of manure than any other crop, because a lot of our land is being called upon to grow wheat so intensively that it wants special nourishment.  I think there is a very good case for distributing this artificial manure between the wheat and beet crops.  I have not sufficient knowledge of the requirements of both crops to say in what ratio it should be distributed, but I would appeal to the <Col N="278" /> Minister, as a matter of first rate national importance, to ration this manure between wheat and beet in the proportion that he and his advisers consider best.  While I have not a lot of faith in this manure, and this is a lot of money to spend on something which may be of very little use, still when it comes to a question of feeding the nation, you cannot measure the difference between want and a sufficiency of food in terms of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Belton that we cannot measure in money what this manure might be worth.  If we were living in normal times I would say that its value is negligible.  This is principally a phosphatic manure.  I think the Minister told us that the percentage of phosphate was about 1 per cent., and of nitrogen less than 1 per cent.  That means that it is simply a phosphatic manure.  The cheapest ingredient in any complete manure is phosphate.  It is suitable for certain crops and for certain lands.  For instance, it would be suitable manure for grass, but not for potatoes.  I would ask the Minister whether there is any alternative to expending this money on phosphates? For instance, would it not be possible to get a complete manure from any part of the world?  Some time ago, we used to import a great deal of guano from Peru.  That is a complete manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what it cost, it would be a valuable manure.  The small farmer would prefer to get an article which would give good results, no matter what the price may be, especially for use on the potato crop, the most important crop grown here.  I do not know exactly what manure suits the beet crop.  If we cannot get a complete manure, and if there is any other alternative to the manure that the Minister has in view, I suggest that we should get a nitrogenous manure. The advantage of a nitrogenous manure is that it is most suitable, as some Deputy remarked, to force the crop in the early stages, and keep down the weeds.  That is an important matter which we should not lose sight of at the present time, because the weeds <Col N="279" /> are eating up the fertility of the soil, and the pulling of the weeds wastes a lot of valuable time.  I find, in County Cavan at any rate, that if we have to run short of any ingredients for manure it would be better to run short of phosphates rather than nitrogen.  Nitrogen is the most important element.  Another point that is worthy of consideration is whether nitrogen is procurable in any part of the world, no matter how distant.  One cwt. of nitrogen is equal to 400 cwt. of phosphatic manure, whether you get it in the form of nitrogen or sulphate of ammonia.  Nitrogen is less in bulk and weight and therefore would be more economical in shipping, but I do not know whether it is possible to get it or not.  If it is not possible to get it, there is no use in discussing it.  If there is none to be procured abroad, I suggest there are sources of nitrogen at home, for instance, soot.  I do not know what becomes of the soot in the cities and other places.  There is a great deal of nitrogen going to waste, I am afraid, in soot.  I do not know whether the manure manufacturers are using it or not, but a lot of it is wasted. Even in the country districts people do not make the best possible use of it.  If it was spread thinly over fields that are under tillage it would be valuable.  It would be no harm if leaflets were sent out in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The quantity of phosphate that the Minister proposes to import amounts to, I think he said, about 60,000 tons. The amount that was used in normal times was 250,000 tons.  That is exclusive of slag, which was another phosphatic manure.  Slag, we know, was used principally for grass.  It was also used largely for turnips.  We have to bear in mind that there is at least double the crop to be manured now. Instead of having 250,000 tons of phosphate, we have, at most, 60,000 tons, or about 30 per cent.  Taking 1 per cent. of a ton as a unit, we find it would represent a reduction of from 10,000,000 units to 1,800,000 units.  That has to go twice as far, because we have twice, perhaps three times, as much crops. We have one-fifth of the amount of <Col N="280" /> manure to cover two or three times the amount of land.  I think the amount is negligible but, nevertheless, if there is no alternative and if you cannot get the nitrogen or some other form of manures, then I suppose it is well not to turn down the idea, but I would support any alternative, if there is an alternative, to expending all the money upon this phosphatic manure because I do not think it is a good manure.</P>
    <P>If it is at all practicable to get the Clare phosphate working, an effort should be made to have it in working order next year.  Twenty per cent. is not bad, if we can get it at home.  The money would not all be lost in initial outlay.  Seeing that money is being paid to so many unemployed people for doing nothing, it would be well spent on developing and opening up mines. It would be serviceable even in normal times; during the present emergency it would be invaluable.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will give that aspect of the problem careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes raised a few points about certain districts having more claims for artificial manures than others.  As I explained in my opening statement, all these aspects of the problem are being examined and considered but, as I said, although we may try to show some preference to a particular crop or a particular class of farmer, I feel that at least half the manure, at any rate, ought to be distributed on the same basis as last year, that is, on the basis of the use of manure by the farmer previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That will ensure that the tillage districts will get more than the non-tillage districts, because they were the best buyers in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  In regard to nitrogen, we have, as a matter of fact, made various attempts, I need hardly assure the House, to get nitrogenous manures from Great Britain, but without any success, except in regard to a small quantity which would be negligible.  We have also tried Chile&mdash;which was raised by Deputy Hughes, and we have an option on some nitrates there.  They would be <Col N="281" /> extremely costly by the time they reached here.  We could not be sure when they would reach here, if at all, because shipping is difficult; it is a very long way around, and it would take a long time to get them here.  As far as we can calculate now, I think it may be taken that nitrate of soda would be between £60 and £70 a ton by the time it would arrive here.  Even if Deputy Hughes is right in saying that one cwt. of nitrate of soda might give three cwt. of wheat, it is hardly worth that.  If it costs 65/-, and gives three cwt. of wheat in return, it is questionable whether it is worth bringing in at all.</P>

      <P>I do not know if it is going to serve any good purpose in going back to what happened before the war, but all I can say is that I said here that I was not aware there was any demand before the war to bring in raw phosphates and store them here for a war period.  There was naturally a demand from everybody&mdash; the Fine Gael Party and every other Party&mdash;to try to get more artificial manures used before the war, but that was merely, I think, that we should try to get the farmers to use more artificial manures and to get them at a cheaper rate, and so on.  It is quite true that we were asked on various occasions to take off the tariffs, quotas, and so on, but that was asked indiscriminately with regard to every industry, as well as the manure industry. I think it was wise in a way to keep those factories working, because small as our supplies are now we could not even have those supplies if the factories were gone out of business.  It was necessary to maintain those factories. It is not true to say either that the farmers had to pay more for their fertilisers before the war because of that protection, because against the protection a subsidy scheme was introduced.</P>

Then there is afterwards the rail transport which, as we all know, is fairly difficult all round.  I think that whatever phosphates are there that can be quarried and mined, they can be got out as far as the road is concerned.</P>

Deputy Dillon raised a question about the bringing in of pyrites, and asked why we did not develop some alternative.  That has been referred to the Emergency Research Bureau.  They have not given us any better alternative yet.  Kelp was also spoken of as an alternative.  I did not mean what Deputy Dillon said.  I never meant that it would be cheaper to bring the seaweed from Galway to Carlow and have it disposed of in the form of kelp.  What I say is that the seaweed is being used at present within ten miles of the coast, and that it is cheaper to allow the farmers to draw the seaweed with their horses and cars than attempt to limit the amount given to them by turning it into potash and kelp, and then selling the kelp to them and to others.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon also asked about bone and blood manure.  I do not think there is anything going to waste in that way.  He also wanted to know why we did not conduct a vigorous campaign for clover.  It is true that clover would give us nitrogen, but neither the clover seed nor the seaweed is going to waste.  I certainly would long ago have advocated the advantages of putting in clover and ploughing the crop up again after a year or two, but for the fact that I knew we would not attempt that since we have only barely enough clover seed to carry on with.  We cannot <Col N="284" /> make it compulsory on farmers to put in clover when we have not got the seed to give them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made a rather unfair attack, I think, on the manufacturers of phosphates.  He said they were putting the subsidy in their pockets.  The Prices Commission looked after the manufacturers' costs and fixed the price of the manures.  I do not know whether the Deputy has any fault to find with the efficiency of the Prices Commission, but if we recognise its efficiency then we must be satisfied with the prices it has fixed.  Deputy Linehan said that he thought that I had put in some reservation about the amount of phosphates that might come from Florida.  I said the Estimate was brought in on the basis of 24,000 tons of phosphates from Florida and the necessary amount of pyrites.  I do not think, however, that it will be possible during this season at any rate to get in that amount.  Of course, we will probably go on bringing it in even though it may be too late for this season.  Probably we will have it in time for next season.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton thought that this money that we are asking might be better spent in another way.  I want to say this to the Deputy&mdash;it may be a case of great minds thinking alike&mdash; that when I saw the Estimate first it did occur to me to ask myself whether we could not spend this £800,000 in another way that would give us better results.  I looked at the matter in somewhat the same way as the Deputy.  Could we use it by encouraging, say, the stall-feeding industry or the pig industry, and in that way get manure as well?  I found, however, that the £800,000 is a very small amount when you think of applying it in that way.  You will get very little results, if any, in fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £19,648 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for transport and meteorological services.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will note from the Estimate, a sum of £25,000 is being provided for the construction of canal barges.  Some time ago the Government, having regard to the increasing difficulty of maintaining adequate transport facilities for essential merchandise, owing to the serious supply position of petrol, oils, coal, tyres, etc., and to the further deterioration which would arise should there be a reduction in or a cessation of these imports, decided to increase canal transport facilities by the construction of 30 wooden barges, which, being horse-drawn, are entirely independent of any imported supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orders were placed for the construction of 20 barges in the first instance, <Col N="287" /> and the orders for the remaining ten barges will be placed in the immediate future.  Eight have been completed, and work is progressing on 12.  There is already a waiting list for the available barges and a sufficient volume of work to enable them to be fully occupied.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the use of the 30 barges which are being constructed, together with the fleet already in operation, will practically exhaust the capacity of the Grand Canal for barge traffic.  The use of a number of barges on the Royal Canal is under consideration, but the area served by that canal does not appear to be productive of much suitable traffic. An agreement has been reached with the Grand Canal Company whereby that company, free of charge, has accepted responsibility for the renting of the barges to suitable operators for use on the Grand Canal.</P>
    <P>The other sub-heads to the Vote relates to expenditure in connection with civil airports.  Owing to the expansion of traffic at the Shannon airport, provision has to be made for additional administrative staff and additional equipment.  As Deputies may have seen in the papers, an airport manager has been appointed.  The person now holding the office for a probationary period is an Army officer and, for the time being, his salary will be carried on the Vote for the Department of Defence.  Further administrative staff has been appointed, together with additional crews for launches.  Additional messenger and cleaning services have also been provided. The use of two additional launches at the Shannon airport has involved an increased expenditure upon petrol, maintenance and insurance. Fire-fighting equipment has been provided, and certain modifications and expansion of the existing equipment is also necessary.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there has been a considerable concentration of staff at Foynes, far in excess of what the local accommodation was capable of providing suitable living quarters <Col N="288" /> for.  The possibility of providing living accommodation for staff at Foynes is being considered, but, in the meantime, it has been decided to operate a subsidised bus service from Limerick for members of the staff employed at Foynes.  The staff will be required to pay fares which are regarded as the maximum which could be imposed upon them, having regard to all the circumstances. But, even allowing for the payment of these fares by the staff, the cost of running the bus service will involve a weekly sum of £50, for which provision is also being made in this Estimate.  The problem of staff accommodation at Foynes has become very serious, and the inauguration of this bus service for the persons employed there recently became a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>This development in connection with the utilisation of the base at Foynes contemplates that it will be necessary to continue to use Foynes at least for the duration of the emergency, and possibly for some time thereafter.  The difficulty of procuring equipment has held up work on the construction of the flying-boat base at Rhynanna.  It is considered necessary and desirable that we should provide, not merely adequate safety equipment at Foynes, but also all the other facilities necessary to make it a first-class airport, even though we contemplate that at a later stage the terminal of the Atlantic air services will be transferred to Rhynanna.  Deputies will note that increase is anticipated under the item of &ldquo;Appropriations-in-Aid&rdquo; The particular increase shown there arises out of the fares to be paid by members of the staff upon the bus service to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £31,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Unemployment Insurance and Employment Exchanges (including Contributions to the Unemployment Fund), Unemployment Assistance, the Special Register of Agricultural and Turf Workers, and Insurance against Intermittent Unemployment, and for certain Services in connection with Food Allowances (9 Edw. 7, c. 7; 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 30; 11 Geo. 5, c. 1; 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5, c. 15; 12 Geo. 5, c. 7; No. 17 of 1923; Nos. 26 and 59 of 1924; No. 21 of 1926; No. 33 of 1930; Nos. 44 and 46 of 1933; No. 38 of 1935; No. 2 of 1938; No. 28 of 1939; No. 4 of 1940; No. 3 of 1941; and No. 7 of 1942).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal item in this Estimate, as Deputies will have noted, is the sum of £48,000 required during the remainder of this financial year to finance the project of the special register of agricultural and turf workers to which reference has already appeared in the Press.  As Deputies know, there has been a movement of population from many rural districts out of the country to an extent which has created a danger that the full requirements of agriculture and turf production in respect of labour during the seasons of maximum activity will not be available. Because of that danger of a scarcity of skilled workers for these important <Col N="293" /> occupations at certain seasons of the year, the Government decided to restrict their emigration.  The regulations in force prohibit absolutely the emigration of workers with experience in agriculture or turf production from all parts of the country, outside what are known as the congested districts.</P>
    <P>It was felt, however, that the imposition of a ban upon the emigration of such workers, who, by the very nature of the case, were likely to be unemployed during the slack seasons, imposed upon the Government an obligation in present circumstances to make some adequate provision for them during these periods of unemployment. It was decided, therefore, in the first instance, to increase the rates of unemployment assistance payable in respect of dependents of unemployed workers in rural areas, and, secondly, to establish a special register of agricultural and turf workers.  Those whose names are inscribed on such register will become entitled on certain conditions to enjoy privileges of a specified character.</P>
    <P>In the first place, they will become entitled to receive, over and above the unemployment assistance which they might otherwise obtain&mdash;and that includes unemployment assistance at the increased rates now payable&mdash;a sum of 5/- a week as a sort of retainer on their services.  The privileges include also exemption from any Employment Period Orders that may be made, and, in addition, a preference for work financed out of State funds.  By means of this register, it is thought that we can secure the retention in the areas concerned of a sufficient number of skilled workers to meet the requirements of agriculture and turf production in next year.</P>
    <P>It is intended, of course, that those who participate in the scheme will accept obligations.  Each person who applies for enrolment on the special register must, in the first instance, be suitable for employment in agriculture or in the turf industry, and must also undertake that while he is enrolled on the special register he will accept any offer of suitable employment, anywhere <Col N="294" /> in the State, in agriculture or the turf industry, which may be made to him at any time.  He will be expected to apply for such employment if so directed by a local officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and not to leave such employment voluntarily, without just cause, or to lose it through misconduct, and he must also undertake, when so directed by an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to leave other employment, unless he can show just cause for failure to do so, in order to undertake any employment in agriculture or the turf industry which may be offered to him.  The intention, of course, is that every effort will be made to secure employment, for those whose names are inscribed on the register, within the vicinity of their residences, but the obligation that is accepted by those who apply for enrolment is to accept work of this character in any part of the country in which it may be offered to them.  It will, of course, be an entirely voluntary business.  There will be no obligation upon anybody to apply for enrolment, and those who do apply will be informed of the nature of the obligation which they are undertaking.</P>
    <P>The period of enrolment will normally be for 12 months.  It is anticipated that the first date upon which men may be enrolled upon the special register will be the 6th January of next year, from which date payments to members will also be made.  The amount which should be paid to persons who become enrolled on this special register, when unemployed, was, naturally, very fully considered. It had to be kept in relation to the agricultural wage.  Under this scheme, a person who enrols on the special register and who is, in consequence of the number of his dependents, entitled to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance, will, in fact, receive 28/- weekly when unemployed.  It is obvious that there must be a difference between the maximum rate so payable and the amount which the individual could earn when employed, as otherwise difficulties might arise.</P>
    <P>While I think that the introduction <Col N="295" /> of this scheme will help to solve a problem of the agricultural industry and help to meet certain difficulties that have been experienced in connection with turf production, it will also result in an amelioration of the position of agricultural workers, but I should not like any agricultural worker to participate in it without realising fully that certain penalties will follow from any subsequent refusal on his part to accept work of the kind for which he is being retained.  These penalties will include disqualification from receipt of unemployment assistance for a period of 12 months.  It is clear that there must be a substantial penalty.  Failure to accept work in agriculture or in turf production by a person who had voluntarily enrolled in the scheme and accepted payment of the retaining fee during periods of unemployment would be a breach of contract which the person would commit deliberately, and consequently a deterrent in the form of a substantial penalty is a necessary part of the project.</P>
    <P>In the case of the congested districts the position will be somewhat different. There is not the same absolute ban upon the emigration of workers from these districts as applies now throughout the rural parts of the rest of the country.  It will, however, be open to workers in the congested districts to apply for enrolment on this register. If they do enrol, then they will voluntarily abandon any right they might otherwise have to an exit permit, to permit them to emigrate, for a period of 12 months following the making of the contract by them.  The position, therefore, is that while in the country generally there will be a ban upon the emigration of skilled agricultural or turf workers, together with the opportunity of enrolling on the special register and getting the benefits that follow therefrom, in the congested districts there will not be the same ban upon the emigration of such workers. There will be, at the same time, the opportunity afforded to enrol upon the register and to secure the resulting benefits.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the scheme will <Col N="296" /> cost £48,000 in the first quarter of next year, that is, from 6th January, when it comes into operation, until the end of March.  It is difficult at this stage to give an estimate of its cost during a full year.  It is hoped that it will be possible to ensure that all those whose names are enrolled upon the register will, in fact, be employed in agriculture or turf production for the greater part of the year.  This Supplementary Estimate also provides for the increase in the rates of unemployment assistance payable in rural districts under Emergency Powers (No. 236) Order.  I have already explained to the Dáil, in connection with another Vote last week, the reasons why it was decided to grant increased unemployment assistance in rural areas by expanding the cash benefits payable in respect of dependents, rather than by an extension of the food voucher scheme now operating in urban districts.  It is true that on the basis of the present value of the food that is supplied free on the voucher scheme, reckoning that value at urban rates, the value of the voucher is greater than the additional cash benefit being provided in rural areas, but it is probable that, taking the country as a whole, and reckoning the value of these foodstuffs on the basis of the prices in rural areas as distinct from urban areas, there is not such a substantial difference.  The increase being granted to unemployment assistance recipients is at the rate of 1/6 for each dependent of theirs within the limits of dependency prescribed in the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    <P>The additional expenditure which it is anticipated will arise in the remainder of this financial year in consequence of the increase in the rates of unemployment assistance payable in rural areas is £80,000.  Under this Supplementary Estimate we are also making provision for salaries and expenses in connection with the scheme for insuring building trade workers against loss of employment due to inclement weather, which was embodied in the Insurance (Intermittent Employment) Act passed this year.  There has been some delay in bringing that Act into operation.  That delay is attributable to the time required to perfect the <Col N="297" /> administrative machinery necessary for the purpose, and to print the stamps and the cards that are required in connection with the scheme.  I think it will be possible to get all the necessary administrative arrangements completed, and the necessary forms, cards and stamps provided in sufficient quantity to enable the scheme to commence about 1st April.  Deputies will remember that the scheme must be in operation for a period of 12 weeks before benefits become payable under it.  In other words, contributions will be collected from workers in the building industry for a period of 12 weeks before the second part of the scheme, which provides for the payment of benefits, can be brought into operation. That is part of the original scheme, and is provided for in the Act, the idea being to ensure that a fund will be collected from which any benefits accruing may be provided.</P>
    <P>I think I have now covered the main items to which this Supplementary Estimate relates.  They are: the introduction of the special register of agriculture and turf workers to which I have referred, the expansion of the rates of unemployment assistance payable in rural areas, and the inauguration of the scheme for insuring building trade workers against loss of employment through inclement weather. The total additional amount required is £31,000.  The actual amounts involved are larger, but savings upon other sub-heads have made it unnecessary to provide the full amount that might otherwise be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the new register which the Minister proposes to set up, consisting of agriculture and turf workers, due to the extraordinary exodus of labour from the country, some effort was called for to deal with the situation.  The question now arises whether the Government has dealt with the matter in the way in which it ought to be dealt with.  It is an experiment of sorts, and to my mind it is a dangerous experiment.  It is resorting to an expedient with which I at least&mdash;and I think most people&mdash; do not agree.  It is, in fact, an extension of the dole to induce those people <Col N="298" /> to stay at home.  I am giving the Minister and the Government credit for sincerity in the matter, but this is certainly a very feeble attempt to implement the promises which the Government made when they came into office.  It would not serve any useful purpose to resurrect all the things that the present Minister said at that time with regard to employment and the way in which it could be provided, the way in which emigration could be stopped, and the remissness of his predecessors in office in not attempting to do those things.  Having resort to an expedient of this sort appears to me at least to be an indication that the Government is really bankrupt of any scheme of employment to keep the people in the country.</P>
      <P>Instead of this retaining fee which the Minister proposes to pay to those people who sign the register, I would be much better pleased to see the Minister offering to pay a full week's wages to those men for a full week's work.  I do not think that the provision of work for those two types of workers&mdash;they are really one class&mdash; presents at all the same difficulties to any Minister or to any Government as the provision of work for the unemployed in general.  The unemployed in general comprise all classes of workers, from clerks down to road-makers and turf-cutters.  Here we have just one class, manual labourers, and we have in this country the necessity for workers of that nature.  We have an amount of drainage to do.  We have an amount of reclamation of land to attend to.  We have reafforestation to tackle.  All those things are shouting to be taken in hand, and yet we say to those people: &ldquo;If you sign this register we will pay you, while you are out of work, a retaining fee of 5/- a week, with certain other privileges.&rdquo; I intensely dislike giving anybody money for doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, it has had a bad effect on workers all over the world, and it has had a very bad effect in this country.  If the Minister set his mind down to it, I am sure he could do better than this scheme.  He could provide work for those people.  If those people are obliged to give an undertaking <Col N="299" /> that they will take up work of the nature which suits them&mdash;that is either agricultural or turf work&mdash;in any part of the country, that removes certain difficulties which might handicap the Minister in another way.  Perhaps when the Minister has got his register ready he may put something like that into operation; he may formulate big schemes, but I doubt if he will, because I think if he had the capacity to do it he would do it at the present time. The emigration of workers from this country was certainly alarming, and something had to be done about it. The Minister has experimented with this matter but I do not see much hope of turning it to productive account.  I think that the system of retaining people by paying them money for doing nothing is a bad system.  Perhaps it is the thin end of the wedge.  Perhaps it is a beginning.  If it is, I wish it luck. At least, I am not at all enamoured of it.  We should be able to do much better.  With all the plans we have had for the relief of unemployment, with all the experience we have had, with all the millions of money we have spent for the last few years in this direction, we do not seem to have got anywhere.  We do not seem yet to be in a position to grapple with the unemployment question.  People are drifting out of the country as fast as they can and the only way we can induce them to remain in the country is to offer them a retaining fee.  I think it is bad business.  I am afraid we are bankrupt of plan to relieve the unemployed if this is the best we can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as a very belated and also a very poor contribution to a frightfully big and dangerous problem that is confronting the country at the present time.  In so far as it carries any recognition of the rights of the turf-workers&mdash;and it is a poor enough recognition of their rights&mdash;I am glad to see that recognition given. But, if I might make a suggestion to the Minister&mdash;and it is made without the desire of being unduly critical or of indulging in any recriminations&mdash;I think a much better earnest of appreciation of the value of turf-workers in this country might have been given <Col N="300" /> some time ago by his colleague or by the Government in an increased wage to the turf-workers.</P>
      <P>Turf-workers entered into this scheme for the production of turf with great enthusiasm.  I have seen ample evidence of it in the county from which I come.  Men were quite willing to travel very long distances to undertake that work, proving completely that Deputy Brennan's arguments were entirely unfounded when he suggested that there was any general demoralisation amongst the workers of this country. They travelled eight and ten miles to work and tried to outdo each other in their eagerness to partake in that work.  After 12 months' experience of that and in face of unanimous demands made by the local authorities consisting of representatives of all Parties, the official attitude here was that they could not get any increase in their wages.  I would prefer to see a fair recognition of the rights of turf-workers to a living wage than the rather poor, stingy and niggardly kind of recognition that is given to them in a scheme of this kind.  I am glad to see that the Minister has recognised what a wrong and futile proceeding the imposition of an Employment Period Order was.  It has made for untold hardship amongst many people who were genuinely anxious to work if they could get it, but who found themselves at the beginning of an Employment Period Order with no other remedy than to go to the relieving officer and local poor law officials to tide them over the period from March to October.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have here again evidence of the fact that the children of our poor people and of our unemployed people seem to be marked out for special treatment.  A person who pays income-tax is given a generous allowance of £50 a year in respect of a child.  The unemployed man, up to recently, got recognition to the extent of 1/- a week for his dependent child. That is now increased to 1/6.</P>

      <P>This shows in any case some attempt at repentance, but it is a very late attempt considering that within the last 12 months 50,000 people were given permits to leave the country, and in the preceding year about 27,000 people left.  Many of our best workers are gone, and it is a very hard person who would try to blame them. There was very little opportunity for them to do anything in this country. Speaking for a very large number of them, speaking with intimate knowledge of the circumstances, the character and the integrity of a very large number of workers in this country, I think it was a libel on them to suggest that they have been in any way demoralised. I think it is great credit to them that they have borne the difficulties of the last two or three years and preserved their manhood to the extent that they have, above all, that they have preserved their faith in many things where they had very little encouragement.</P>
      <P>This is a poor beginning, but I give the Minister credit for honesty in facing up, to some small extent, to the problem that exists.  His action in that matter is in very favourable contrast to the action of his colleagues in the Cabinet who have lamentably failed, in my opinion, to give any recognition to this problem.  One of his colleagues here to-day spoke about the privilege&mdash; the privilege of giving men condemned to four days' employment a week, two extra days' employment in the week. He described that as a privilege.  That statement was made in an Irish Parliament by a responsible person, and that person has the power of condemning workers in this country to that unhappy condition of things.  He described as a privilege the natural right to bare justice, the right of people in this country to get a week's employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for every other member of the Party, I want to reiterate our view that the remedy for all this is to give the people work, and that any attempts of this kind are merely temporary patches in a very big and gaping rent in our national economy.  The Minister has made some small beginning. <Col N="302" /> In so far as he has made a gesture in the right direction, his action is to be commended.  Very much more requires to be done, and I hope the Minister, having taken his courage in his hand in this matter, will go further along the road of securing better conditions and wages for turf workers, and of securing the retention of many people in this country, by a relaxation of another type of legislation that he has been associated with&mdash;the tying down of wages in this country, with all the evil consequences that have flowed from it to the extent that it has been carried out.  I put these suggestions to the Minister in the hope that he will give consideration to them; and I put them, fully conscious of the fact that I think he is quite honest in his statement to this Parliament this evening, and in the attempt he has made to deal with that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I would like to make to the Minister, when he did mention the turf workers at all.  I think it must be perfectly obvious to Deputy Murphy, and every other southern Deputy, that as far as turf production is concerned this year, and as far as Counties Cork and Kerry are concerned, there was certainly no shortage of workers in the bogs.  If anything, the problem there was not shortage of workers, but of handling the number of workers available.  The Minister has seen questions included with the others on the Order Paper of this House, asking the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance what he intends to do with the turf that was cut in Cork and Kerry, and which has been in the bogs since last year, and which is likely to be unsold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite appreciate what happened. Orders went out to the people in charge to cut turf and every available man was put into the production of turf without, in many cases, any real organisation as to the proper winning of the turf or the handling of it afterwards. As far as turf was concerned, the problem of shortage of labour did not arise in those areas.  I was glad to hear Deputy Murphy pay a tribute to the people who engaged in that work. <Col N="303" /> He was perfectly right when he said that it showed that it could not be said of those people that they were not willing to work.  They travelled long distances in lorries and on bicycles and worked under most miserable conditions and in very bad weather, particularly this year.  Anyone would have been proud to see those people go into that work in the spirit in which they did.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters in connection with the scheme on which I would like to have some information from the Minister.  A person who enrols under it must go wherever he is told, either to engage in the fuel campaign or to do farm work.  In the case of a farmer who requires extra men to cope with the increased tillage work during next year's spring, summer and harvest seasons, will he be in a position to go to the labour exchange officer and have the two or three men that he requires sent to him?  There is no danger, I think, of a shortage of men for the bogs, but there may be for farm work.  I am sure Deputy Murphy will agree with me in this, that no matter how much hardship may be associated with work on the bogs young men, and particularly the sons of small farmers, prefer it to work on the land.  The weekly income seems to appeal to them, and the tendency amongst them appears to be to take work under the county council or on the bogs.</P>
    <P>They will avoid work on a farm if they possibly can.  Naturally, the Minister would like to avoid compulsion as far as possible.  Even though a person enrols under the scheme it would not be good for it if severe compulsion had to be applied.  In my opinion, if a farmer requires men and is prepared to pay the proper rate of wages, he should be able to get them. A movement of labour from one part of the country to another may lead to a certain amount of criticism.  I think the Minister ought to make it clear&mdash; he did, as a matter of fact, in part of his opening speech&mdash;that such a movement will be confined to as small a degree as possible.  If, however, there <Col N="304" /> has to be a movement of men from one area to another it should be confined to the younger men and the single men.  Even from the wages point of view, it would be a considerable hardship on a married man to be moved. It would cause more hardship in his case than in that of single men.</P>
    <P>As regards the payment of unemployment assistance to those men until they are required either on the land or in the bogs, Deputy Brennan mentioned a number of works on which they might be employed, such as drainage and clearance schemes, and in that way be provided with regular employment by the State.  Deputy Murphy, who is a member of the Cork County Council, and has a wide experience of the county in general, knows that there is one type of work that might be undertaken at present. It is apparent to anybody travelling through the country, and that is road work.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that in recent years there has been some curtailment in the execution of that class of work, not so much on the tourist and main roads as on the secondary and by-roads.  The result is that they have been deteriorating rapidly.  That is a problem that could get very dangerous and become expensive if something be not done about it. I would ask the Minister to consider this matter between now and the introduction of the main Estimate next year.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that his Department, in conjunction with the local bodies, when they get those rural workers on the register, should give them regular employment on road work.  That would be much better than keeping them idle on employment assistance and the 5/- a week.  In conclusion, I want to protest again against the practice of bringing forward Supplementary Estimates.  The number that we have considered represent a total of about £1,000,000.  In making my protest on this occasion, I am rather embarrassed, since two of the Supplementary Estimates are entirely new, the one that we discussed earlier this evening from the Department of Agriculture, and this one.  But I do want again to reiterate my protest <Col N="305" /> against the practice of bringing forward Supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <P>With regard to the employment of people on the land, I read in the <i>Irish Press</i> a couple of weeks ago a statement to the effect that at a hiring fair in Donegal, farmers from the Six Counties offered a wage of £70 for six months' work to farm labourers from that area.  I do not think you will have people remaining here if you can offer them nothing better than to wait for work on a retaining fee of 5/-, with a small increase for their children. There are plenty of works that need to be done, and those men should be employed on them and paid reasonable wages.  Yesterday and to-day I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that the reason why men were being employed four days a week instead of six was that they wanted to have an equal distribution of work.  That suggests to me that the competition is not for goods but for work.</P>

I would much prefer to see him putting those men to do useful work.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that those works will not produce goods.  I say they would produce assets for the nation, and it would be much better to have men doing that than living idle on what they are being offered.</P>

He referred to what occurred at a hiring fair in Donegal. He said that farmers came in there from the Six Counties and offered agricultural labourers a wage as high as £70 for the half year to work and produce crops there.  I would like to remind him that the production of crops in that area is being subsidised by a powerful big belligerent empire.  Now, that is the obvious answer.  There is a subsidy as high as £10 an acre for potatoes alone, and every other crop is subsidised. That is the obvious explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a different grievance from that expressed by Deputy Linehan and Deputy Hickey. For the first time for a number of years we have useful schemes allocated by the Department of Public Works, to be carried out in the congested districts in Donegal, held up for want of men.  The reason for the shortage of labour is that young men, who previously drew unemployment assistance and who had to sign during the unemployment <Col N="307" /> period, were offered work in Kildare and they refused to accept it.  They were then cut off from unemployment assistance until the 31st December. These men cannot get work on the schemes unless they are recipients of unemployment assistance and, consequently, there is a shortage of labour for the schemes that have been proposed for Donegal.</P>
      <P>I understand that the total additional labour required for the bogs in Kildare would be 2,000 or 3,000 men.  I venture to say that in Donegal we have at least twice that number and they have been deprived of unemployment assistance because they would not go to Kildare.  The position is that if the persons deprived of assistance in Donegal volunteered to go to Kildare, there would not be accommodation for them and there would not be work or materials for them.  It is hardly fair to penalise all the single, unemployed men in the county.  If they volunteered, in that county alone, to go to Kildare, the facilities to give employment to them would not be there.</P>
      <P>I suggest that some remedy should be found to get over this <i>impasse</i> with regard to the recipients of unemployment assistance.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance should devise some scheme, such as fixing a quota to be taken from each of the counties associated with turf production, and they should endeavour to get that quota filled by offering certain inducements and allow the persons who remain behind to participate in the essential public schemes that have been approved for the various counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite admit that to devise a scheme of that kind is very difficult, but it should be possible to arrive at some conclusion as to what number of men you could take from a particular county and bring to Kildare and arrange that those who are allowed to remain could participate in carrying out essential schemes.  I suggest that in a family where there are three or four young men, and where one would volunteer to go to Kildare, the others, if they are not allowed unemployment <Col N="308" /> assistance, should at least be allowed to participate in schemes in the vicinity of their homes.  You could get over the difficulty in that way.  There are certain counties associated with turf production, counties like Donegal. Mayo, Galway and Kerry, and I suggest that a quota of 500 men from each of these counties would supply all the labour required in Kildare.</P>
    <P>When the Kildare scheme started almost 12 months ago, a number of men came to the camps and, for one reason or another, a large number returned home.  They gave the impression, in areas where an effort might be made to recruit labour, that the conditions in these camps, and in Kildare generally, were anything but favourable.  I think the time is opportune for a statement to be made on the conditions prevailing, the rates of wages paid, and other matters.  I understand some improvement has taken place in the camps since the initiation of the scheme and it would be well that that improvement in conditions was made known.  We should endeavour to counter the propaganda that has been spread abroad concerning the conditions in the camps in Kildare.</P>
    <P>It seems surprising, in view of the figures Deputy Hickey has quoted with regard to wages for farm workers, that we have such a large number of unemployed men in Donegal.  If they are offered £70 for the half year, it is surprising that a larger number do not take advantage of that.  The fact is that we have young men in Donegal clamouring for work.  Schemes have been sanctioned for the county, but large numbers of the schemes, I am informed by the county surveyor and the assistant surveyors, are held up because there are not sufficient numbers of married men in receipt of unemployment assistance to carry them out.  In order to carry them out they would require many single men, but they are not available, for the reason that I indicated earlier in my remarks. Some steps should be taken to remedy that position so that turf production schemes and useful road and drainage schemes can be undertaken.  All these <Col N="309" /> useful works could be proceeded with if proper arrangements were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Money is not in any way a difficulty, so long as any scheme of work will produce goods in the process. If, at the present moment, we were to spend £10,000,000 on road work, it would bring nothing into the country and would only consume things which are in the country.  The sole effect of that would be to dilute the existing money in circulation and to raise the price of goods.  In other words, any work which was done would not produce any return which would replace the goods absorbed during the process.</P>
      <P>The only effect of a scheme of that kind at the moment is equivalent to taxation, equivalent to redistribution of existing goods.  That is all I want to say for the moment in relation to that.  In relation to the question raised by Deputy Brady, the difficulty is that the country has to have turf produced for it, and the only places from which it can get competent turf workers economically and properly are from the areas in which production of turf is possible but has been shut down.  In other words, it is not possible, while it would be very desirable, as Deputy Brady has said, to fix a quota all over the country.  That quota, if it is taken from any area which is at present capable of producing transportable turf, does not add in any way to the total production of turf, and it is consumable goods in the form of food and fuel that we have to produce. It is for that reason, I understand, that this particular regulation was introduced.  It will be in relation to its effect upon the total production of fuel for the very critical winter which is coming after this that any action which is taken would, in my opinion, have to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is in complete agreement with the view expressed by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Murphy that it is much better to give people work for wages than payment during periods of idleness.  I do not think anybody will seriously contest that view.  Not merely does payment of wages for work mean that <Col N="310" /> the community is getting some return for the amount expended for the maintenance of the individuals concerned, but it is better for the individuals also.  It is, however, undesirable that it should be suggested that it is possible for us in present circumstances to devise such a programme of work that every person who is unemployed could be given full-time occupation in the carrying out of that programme. That is not possible.  There were practical administrative difficulties in doing that, even in normal times.  These difficulties are immensely increased in present circumstances, when, in addition to the administrative problems which are always there, there are problems created by shortages of material, transport and even tools, in some cases.</P>
      <P>The intention is, however, that these persons who are enrolled on the special register of agricultural and turf workers will, so far as it is possible to do so, be kept in employment.  It was for that reason that I stressed, when describing the scheme, that one of the privileges which follows on enrolment in the register will be a preference for employment on State-financed schemes of work.  Clearly, there will be every reason to follow that programme, but it is necessary to make provision, and, in the circumstances of this particular case, adequate provision, to ensure that no undue hardship will be suffered by the individuals concerned during the intervals during which it will not be possible to give them work upon the State schemes to which I have referred, in agriculture or turf production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan described it as an extension of the system of doles to induce people not to emigrate.  That is a wrong description of it.  We have in fact prohibited these people from emigrating.  We are not offering them this retaining fee or increased unemployment assistance for the purpose of inducing them to stay at home.  In the national interest, we are compelling them to stay at home, but the fact that we have decided upon that prohibition on their emigration places on the community an obligation to see that their compulsory retention at home will not <Col N="311" /> involve exceptional hardship for them. It is only these workers who are being subjected to this absolute ban on emigration.  they are being subjected this year to that ban for the first time. The policy of the Government in relation to emigration is, I think, well known in the House.  We prohibit the emigration of any person who is in employment, or any person for whom employment is immediately available, but those who are unemployed and for whom there was no employment available were not prevented from going, except persons under a certain age limit.</P>
    <P>Now we have decided to go further in the matter of restricting emigration by placing an absolute ban on the outward movement of certain skilled agricultural workers and skilled turf workers, and we are doing that because in next year there is a danger that in the seasons of maximum employment in agriculture and turf production, there will not be enough skilled workers to meet the requirements of these industries.</P>
    <P>Coinciding with the introduction of that restriction upon their emigration, we have decided to make special provision for the workers concerned.  The workers are not being compelled to enrol in the special register.  That is a matter which is left to their individual discretion.  If they do enrol, however, in addition to becoming entitled to these privileges of extra payments, exemption from Employment Period Orders and preference on State schemes, they will also accept certain obligations, and amongst these obligations is that of accepting work in agriculture and turf production, when they are required for it and wherever they are required for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady raised the most pertinent point in the whole discussion, and I think it is necessary to deal fairly fully with that point.  I am certain that every member of the House will agree with this contention: the obligation of the State to provide assistance to unemployed persons arises only when the State is unable to provide employment for them.  We are all <Col N="312" /> agreed that it is better that we should provide employment for those who are unemployed than that we should give them unemployment assistance, cash allowances.  The corollary to that is that when employment can be provided under reasonable conditions, and on reasonable terms, which are determined not by the State, but by an impartial court of referees set up for the purpose, refusal to accept that employment must involve disqualification for receipt of unemployment assistance. The individual who refuses the work is no longer involuntarily unemployed; he is unemployed by his own choice.</P>
    <P>That is the situation which arose in connection with employment in the turf camps last year.  By reason of a great deal of dishonest propaganda concerning these camps, a false impression relating to them was created in many parts of the country, and many workers became reluctant to go to these camps It was necessary that an effort should be made to recruit a sufficient number of workers to fill the camps, and to get the maximum production of turf from these turf schemes. By every method of publicity and inducement, workers were sought for the camps without any element of compulsion whatever, but a sufficient number of workers prepared to remain in the camps was not secured by that method.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, therefore, to single unemployed men without dependents in the western districts of Connaught, in Donegal, and in other parts of the country, an offer of employment at these turf camps was made, and those who refused to accept that employment were debarred from receiving unemployment assistance until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I think that that situation is easily defensible.  Yet, I must confess that I was somewhat perturbed by it because a substantial number of workers were for a period disallowed their unemployment assistance&mdash;in fact, a larger number of workers than could have been accommodated in the turf camps if they had all accepted the offer of work.  It is partly because of the rather unsatisfactory nature of the method operating in this year that this new scheme is being introduced. <Col N="313" /> If a similar situation should arise in next year, in which there will not be available, through voluntary enlistment, a sufficient number of workers for the turf camps, then clearly those persons who have enrolled upon this special register will be called upon to make good the deficiency.  No doubt, in the selection of the number of persons required there will be some quota system, such as Deputy Brady suggests, operating.  The situation, therefore, will be that we will have a list of persons who are prepared to go for work where that work is available to them and, naturally, work on the turf camps in Kildare, or any other class of agricultural or turf production work, for which local labour is insufficient, will be offered to those persons. It is not anticipated that the number upon the special register will be insufficient to meet all requirements of that kind, but if it should prove to be insufficient, then the same situation will arise, in respect of other persons receiving unemployment assistance as arose in this year, because, as I have intimated, the State's obligation to its unemployed citizens is to offer them unemployment assistance or work&mdash; work, preferably&mdash;and when it does offer work the obligation to give unemployment assistance no longer exists.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that desirable works cannot now be proceeded with in County Donegal because of the fact that there are not the requisite number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, in accordance with the usual regulations, due to the disqualification of a number of single men in consequence of their refusal to accept the work in County Kildare, but these single men knew the consequences of their refusal when the offer of work was made to them.  The disqualification ceases to operate at the end of this month, and a new situation will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In that connection I may explain, in order to show that there is no possibility of injustice &mdash;and I think it is necessary to emphasise this&mdash;that there is machinery in existence which ensures that the decision in such cases will be based upon the facts of each individual case. It must not be assumed that there was a general decision to disqualify all persons of a certain class in these districts. Each person had a right to have his individual case examined by the local court of referees.  The local court was obliged, no doubt, to make its decision within the ambit of the regulations laid down, but if there was in the case of any individual a circumstance which made it unreasonable to expect him to travel so far away from his home in order to take employment, his disqualification ended and his right to unemployment assistance was restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that happened in the case of a number of the labour exchanges, where men went to Kildare on the understanding that they would get 33/- a week, but when they got there they were put on piece-work and only earned 16/- a week and would not remain there for that reason.  I had correspondence with regard to that from all over Cork County.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I cannot deal with individual cases now.  So far as I know, the average earnings of persons employed at the Kildare turf camps exceeded what they would earn in corresponding work either in Kildare or in the localities from which they came.  There may have been exceptional cases, but I am talking about the general conditions prevailing there. At any rate, there were in November, in County Donegal, 6,000 applicants for unemployment assistance, as against 1,300 who were disqualified in consequence of their refusal to work in Kildare.  However, I merely want to bring that situation, existing in County Donegal and, to a certain extent, in County Mayo and County Galway, into the general picture.  I repeat that the State's obligation to pay unemployment assistance ceases when the individual refuses to accept a <Col N="315" /> reasonable offer of work&mdash;an offer held to be reasonable, not merely by the unemployment assistance officer, but by the court of referees to which the individual concerned has a right to appeal.  Because, however, of the unsatisfactory manner in which that principle was applied, we are now adopting a new scheme, and this new scheme will avoid some of the causes of individual hardship which arose in this year.  In the future there will exist a register of persons who will have contracted to accept this type of work wherever it may be available, and, in consideration of entering into that contract, will have obtained certain payments and privileges not available to other unemployed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply now to the young men in the cities and towns as well as to those in the rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if they are competent agricultural or turf workers. Clearly, there is no point in putting on this register people who are not capable of doing such work, but it applies to persons in towns and cities who have had experience of agricultural or turf work in the course of the past two years.  It is, of course, as I began by saying, perfectly true that if possible we should try to meet the problem of unemployment by creating work. Deputy Brennan, however, mentioned only three classes of work.  It is remarkable that whenever we come to discuss the question of agricultural work or schemes of employment, all minds seem to work in the same way, and only a very limited programme can be advanced.  Deputy Brennan says that we should provide work in drainage, land reclamation, and afforestation.  Now, if there is any body in the world which should know the folly of rushing into large-scale drainage operations, it should be this House.  The experience of the last 20 years has taught this House and the servants of this House that drainage can do more harm than good unless it is carefully planned on a very large scale.  Because of the general recognition of that fact, a commission was set up to consider what was the best type <Col N="316" /> of machinery to plan drainage on a scale which would ensure that drainage schemes would do good instead of doing damage.  That commission sat for a long time and made its report, and legislation is in course of preparation on the basis of that report.  The Government decided, quite rightly, that action in connection with large-scale drainage must await the creation of the authority for which that legislation will provide.</P>
      <P>Land reclamation is a general term which covers a multitude of activities. I think everybody in the House will agree that the farm improvements scheme now being administered by the Department of Agriculture is one of the best schemes ever devised in this country.  It is a method of providing employment for agricultural workers during slack seasons.  The scheme can be extended, and I think it is intended to extend its operations.  It has been limited by certain administrative difficulties-the inadequacy of the staff at the disposal of the Minister for Agriculture to examine the various projects that are put up under it.  It is, however, precisely the type of scheme that we should endeavour to maintain always in operation in this country to provide employment on the land for agricultural workers during the seasons in which agricultural employment is at its lowest.  Afforestation is something that we all talk about, but there is not much point in talking about it now, because, from what I have been informed about it, any substantial expansion in forestry activities is not possible during the war.  There is no use in planting trees unless you put a wire fence around them, and you cannot put a wire fence around them now, which means that the only result of new forestry activities would be to feed the rabbits more effectively than they are being fed at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to what he called the bad system of Employment Period Orders.  I do not think that Deputy Murphy and some of his colleagues have ever fully appreciated the necessity for having some such scheme in connection with unemployment assistance.  Mind you, the Government <Col N="317" /> could have inaugurated an unemployment assistance scheme which would have cut out of its ambit completely the average type of person living in western counties, the small farmers and the sons of small farmers, persons who are occasionally occupied upon their own holdings but who are at other times available for work for wages, and in fact require work for wages to supplement what they can get from their holdings in order to obtain a livelihood.</P>
    <P>It is not practicable to devise any system of unemployment assistance that covers those people unless you have in that system something corresponding to our Employment Period Orders.  During the times that they should be occupied upon their holdings, either in the spring or during the harvest, those persons should be compelled, by reason of the withdrawal of State assistance, to do the work that is available for them on their own holdings.  I agree that the operation of Employment Period Orders has covered more persons than those to whom I am now referring.  It has covered ordinary agricultural workers who are employed for wages, and have no means of subsistence except what they get in the form of wages in return for their labour.  It is one of the defects of any scheme of this kind that rules and regulations which are quite justifiable and sound when applied to general classes will, in individual cases or in some classes, involve hardship. It is true that we could restrict and have, on occasions, restricted the operation of Employment Period Orders, but the system itself is quite sound.  I do not agree with Deputy Murphy that it is a bad system.  We may have operated it on occasions in a manner which Deputies could criticise, but I would not agree that the system should be abandoned under any consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that. I fully agree with Deputy Murphy&mdash;I have myself often made the same <Col N="318" /> assertion in the past&mdash;that a great deal of nonsense is spoken about the demoralisation amongst workers arising from the payment of assistance in cash from the State.  It may be true that, in individual cases, there is some demoralisation&mdash;demoralisation due to protracted periods without employment&mdash;but in my experience there is no greater degree of demoralisation amongst workers in consequence of their receiving from the State cash assistance for which they have not worked than there is amongst wealthier classes who get dividends from investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think so, and they are the very people who talk about demoralisation amongst the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of having a final line of defence again destitution is thoroughly sound.  We must, by every means within the limit of our resources, try to deal with the problem of unemployment by providing work, but, in order to make sure that nobody who is omitted from any work schemes is on that account brought to destitution, we must have some system of prviding cash benefits.  That is what the unemployment assistance scheme of this and, so far as I know, of every other country is designed to ensure. If it is possible to get such a high degree of efficiency in human organisation that you can give to every individual, when he wants it, work where he wants it and to the extent that he wants it, then we can abolish the unemployment assistance scheme, but I do not think we are likely to see that in our day, unless, of course, we adopt a system of conscription involving the establishment of labour camps and the compulsory transfer of workers to jobs where the State is interested in certain operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, in regard to men who go from Donegal to Kildare or from Bantry to Kildare to work for 33/- a week, that there is amongst those men a desire to work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and I think even more highly of the hundreds of <Col N="319" /> workers who never saw a bog in their lives but who went down from Dublin to Kildare; I do not say that very many of them stuck it there, but at any rate their desire for work was demonstrated by the fact that they went from Dublin to those places.  It is true, as Deputy Linehan said, that there was no shortage of turf workers in the South of Ireland this year.  I think it is also true, generally, that there was no shortage of workers in agriculture in any area.  There were reports of local shortages in County Kildare and elsewhere.  Despite what some Deputies say about turf camps, agricultural workers in Kildare and some neighbouring counties were attracted to go to the turf camps rather than remain in agricultural employment in those areas.  But we visualise the possibility of a shortage next year.  That is why this scheme is now being introduced.  I have explained that the scheme is in consequence of a ban upon the emigration of those workers.  The ban is designed to ensure that any diminution in the number of persons available for agricultural or turf work will not proceed further, and following upon measures to that end the obligation to adopt this scheme arises.</P>
      <P>The intention is that farmers who require workers for harvesting operations or sowing operations or agricultural activities of any kind, and who cannot get them locally in the ordinary way, will get them through the employment exchange from this special register.  It is also true&mdash;I should like to emphasise this, because it is not desirable to discourage agricultural workers from enrolling on the register &mdash;that the efforts of the authorities administering the scheme will be to provide, for those who enrol, work within the vicinity of their own homes if possible. It is quite true, however, that workers in Donegal, Mayo and the congested districts, who voluntarily agree to enrol on this register, must agree to take work offered to them elsewhere. It is unlikely that, in those districts, there will be any special problem in providing adequate workers for the conduct of agricultural activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> Deputy Linehan referred to his objection to Supplementary Estimates. I think in present circumstances his objection is largely theoretical.  It is quite clear that in the world in which we now find ourselves, with circumstances changing from week to week and from month to month, we cannot sit down at the beginning of the year and budget completely against every possible contingency that may arise during the year.  These matters which are covered by the two Supplementary Estimates I am introducing now are large matters.  In normal times they would be the subject of major debates in this House.  They all arose out of the changing circumstances of the year and are accepted more or less as matters of routine in the conditions in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>There was a number of interesting statements made by some Deputies that I would like to argue, but I think it would be extending the scope of this debate to do so.  Deputy Hickey assures us again that the old order will have to go.  I think the old order has very nearly gone, but I would like to make one prophecy, in conclusion: that, when the old order is finally disappearing, the last bulwark of its defence will be the trade union movement.</P>

      <P>Last night, when I started to speak upon this matter, I alluded to the vital statistics in so far as they interpret the actual physical condition as at present existing, and I think it was <Col N="321" /> Deputy Dr. Hannigan who wanted to know the periods over which we had the statistics.  Up to last night I had the figures only for the first two quarters of the year, but I have since got the figures for the third quarter. The same tendency which is shown is even aggravated in the third quarter: the marriage rate has gone right up; the birth rate has gone right up and the death rate is still rapidly falling. I think if the Deputy would inspect these graphs he would save himself a lot of trouble.  However, I will give him the figures if he wants them.</P>
      <P>Taking the three quarters of 1941 and 1942, as far as marriages are concerned, this year the figure was 4,007 against 3,554; in the second quarter, it was 4,616 against 3,724; in the third quarter it was 5,041 against 4,223. Births were 14,365 against 13,678 in the first quarter; in the second quarter, 18,177 against 14,946; in the third quarter, 17,735 against 15,056.  The figure for deaths in the first quarter was 12,103 against 14,648; in the second quarter, 10,811 against 11,328, and in the third quarter, 8,524 against 8,683. The deaths, which would, I think, interest Dr. Hannigan perhaps more than anything else, those of infants under one year, which would be to some extent an indication, fell from 80 per 1,000 births, 62 per 1,000, to 57 per 1,000.  These are the recognised vital statistics covering the physical condition of everybody in the whole State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I am quoting from the <i>Quarterly Return of Marriages, Births and Deaths</i>, but the Deputy will find all of them in the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  In the same way, we had other vague suggestions of evil conditions and, mind, I do not want to overstress <Col N="322" /> them one way or the other, except to remove this atmosphere that has been attempted to be created, that there is something specially bad and wrong now and that things are visibly going wrong.  The question of malnutrition was raised.  It was admitted by Deputy Keyes that the statistics that were given were favourable but, because they were favourable, he says statistics do not matter.  There is no evidence, as far as we know, that malnutrition exists on any extensive scale. All the indications at the present moment are, broadly, favourable, but I do not regard the degree of improvement as sufficiently satisfactory nor am I satisfied that the basis upon which those figures are gathered are of very definite exactness.  Some years ago I thought that the three vital statistics were the three most important social statistics we could get and I went to a good deal of trouble to inquire what they were and to do what I could to see that they would be made more uniform and more reliable.</P>
      <P>The next matter that was dragged in here was vouchers, all this being consciously or sub-consciously directed to producing the idea that the Government in charge of this was callously disregardful&mdash;these were words used&mdash; callously disregardful of the necessities of the problem.  One Deputy said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We charge the Government that they are deliberately and wilfully responsible for lowering the vitality of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House to realise the meaning of a phrase of that kind.  A Government appointed by the majority of the people, maintained here over two or three General Elections, here now, I should say, for 11 or 12 years, are of such a character that they can be accused of deliberately and wilfully, of set purpose and known intent, reducing the vitality of the people.  Surely there is no man in the House who, adverting to the dictionary meaning of these words, would use them in relation to anyone here.  No honest man would say them and no intelligent man would believe them.  But, as part of that campaign, the very action which is taken by the Government for the purpose of trying to safeguard the <Col N="323" /> most unhappy and the most unfortunate of our people from consequences entirely outside their control, to assure them immediate, definite and unchallengeable access to the necessities of life, is turned into a weapon of attack &mdash;not a weapon of light attack.  &ldquo;Deliberately degrading,&rdquo; says Deputy Murphy, &ldquo;producing the sordid symptoms of servility and decay.&rdquo;  This is the thing that is done by the Government of this people, for the poorest of its people: giving them direct cheques, not upon paper money of variable quality and of variable reliability in their access to goods, but giving them cheques direct upon the goods themselves, cheques which have precedence of everybody else's on the bank of those essential and necessary goods, and they are described as &ldquo;deliberately degrading,&rdquo; deliberately producing &ldquo;sordid symptoms of servility and decay.&rdquo; What are these?  84,000 vouchers have been issued to the dependents of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, to old age pensioners, including blind pensioners, their dependents and children, to widows, children and orphans who are beneficiaries under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts and to the recipients of disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts: every one of them is entitled, whatever may be the variation in price, and whatever may be the difficulty in getting them, to a share in those goods every week.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of that?  &ldquo;Degrading&rdquo;. Here is a report from a county medical officer of health.  I do not propose to give you the name or the county, but I am prepared to hand the document to any Deputy who wishes to see it.  It is a typical statement.  I do not propose to publicise the individual himself:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During this year supplies of medicines were limited, especially as regards cod liver oil, emulsion, malt, ostomalt, etc.  These medicines were very useful in families whose dietary was limited and insufficient, and the failure to obtain them owing to war conditions was a hardship and probably <Col N="324" /> discouraged attendance at dispensaries. This coincided, unfortunately, with the scarcity of the formerly despised &lsquo;bread and butter and tea&rsquo; diet of many families... However, the introduction of the food voucher scheme towards the end of the year for recipients of home assistance, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, etc., has been of the greatest benefit during the winter.  In fact, it is the greatest single measure of relief yet afforded, and it is hoped that it will be continued irrespective of war conditions, and it should eventually repay a hundredfold by maintaining and improving the health of those for whom it is intended....</P>
    <P>An improvement in the health of small children, resulting from the regular supply of milk and butter over a period of a few months during this winter has been evident.  Such improvement gives us the hope of an increase in the general standard of health among those from whom our cases of tuberculosis are mainly recruited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a description in a report by a county medical officer of health of the filthy thing which this Government invented deliberately to degrade the people and create &ldquo;sordid symptoms of servility and decay&rdquo;.  In exactly the same way as there have been these 84,000 cheques upon the bank of food for the people, there also have been issued 36,000 vouchers upon the bank of fuel, a bank which has been prepared for them over the whole year. The best, the driest, the most uniform, the most portable, and the most conveniently burnable type of material that we could get in the country has been kept for those 36,000 beneficiaries, and, due to the foresight of this Dáil, they are now in benefit.</P>
    <P>I think I may say that I am personally responsible for the voucher system.  At any rate, I am prepared to take personal responsibility, by name, for every one of the 8,000 people who are receiving food cheques in Cork, and the 5,000 who are receiving turf cheques.  I am prepared to say that I personally am responsible, by <Col N="325" /> name, for any insult which has been offered to them in trying to help them in this manner, and making sure that, whoever else may go short this winter either of food or fuel, at least they will not go short.  This is quite an important matter.  It is one in which in the interests of fair play and of decency in public life we ought to come down to brass tacks, one way or the other.  When this voucher system was introduced into this House it was denounced with &ldquo;bell, book and candle&rdquo; by the Labour Party, and then, apparently they had a meeting. At any rate, and I say it is to their credit, one of them had the courage to come in here and withdraw the whole of that attack and to say that they did approve of it.  Not having immediately seen the benefit which was there, they have had the courage and the manliness to admit the mistake of putting themselves behind a movement which could be misrepresented.</P>

Does the Party stand for Deputy Murphy, who says we are deliberately degrading people, that we are producing symptoms of servility and decay, or do they stand for Deputy Keyes, the proposer of the motion, who said: &ldquo;I should like an extension of this system&rdquo;?  He asks for the indefinite extension of this system.  So far as we are concerned, as long as there is food and fuel and any other store in this country, and there are people in need, it will be our policy to bring the needy as closely and securely in contact with that supply and to give them as unchallengeable a demand upon it as is humanly possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we are told again, in the same spirit of producing this atmosphere of blackness, that we are engaged in deliberately deporting the people&mdash;that that is our solution of the unemployment problem.  The only justification for that was the statements that there were extremely high wages in another country and that we were not prepared to raise the standard of wages in this country in competition with those outside wages.  At the same time, a bitter complaint is made that the cost of living is rising and that wages are unable to meet the increase. I have already quoted in the House the actual costs of one of the most important and critical commodities in consumption at the present moment&mdash; turf fuel.  I have shown you its price from the time the slean is first put into the bog until the turf is delivered at the dumps.  I have shown you that <Col N="327" /> 78 per cent. of the total cost represents direct wages and, in the other 22 per cent., there is contained a very considerable residuum of wages.</P>
    <P>What would be the effect of raising the wages of all those engaged in all the processes of primary and secondary production that are required in order to bring those goods to the fireplaces of the people?  Assume that you raise the whole of the wages 10 per cent., and the direct wages content is 78 per cent., and what is the effect?  Is there any getting out of it? This is an absolutely inescapable necessity.  I might be accused of having a false idea of this matter.  I am going to quote a very courageous and honest utterance which has been made by one of the parties engaged in that process of secondary production called transport.  There was a meeting held in Cork, a meeting of the Cork branch of the Railway Clerks' Association, and Mr. J.T. O'Farrell, the Irish secretary, said that during the period in which prices generally had gone up by 45 per cent., railway freights had increased by only 15 per cent., while standard rates and passenger fares were not increased at all.  Railway men were not content to try to exist any longer on pre-war incomes in order that the public should have transport services at slightly over 1923 rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must mean 1939 rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, it should be 1939 rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport to roadside, labour content, 90 per cent.; transport to rail head, labour content 50 per cent.; rail charges, labour content 60 per cent.: transport to dump, labour charges 60 per cent.  Is it not perfectly clear to everybody that, in this particular case, if the cost of transport goes up, the cost to the consumer of this commodity must go up in proportion?  If it were possible to put a fence around some particular trade or industry and say: &ldquo;We will raise those wages and we will not raise any others,&rdquo; then what might happen would be that the injustice under which the railway clerks feel they are <Col N="328" /> labouring could be remedied at the expense of the general community.</P>
    <P>But no one here is going to suggest that if, for this purpose, and under these conditions, the wages of railway transport workers are raised, all other wages shall not be raised in conformity with them.  And if all wages concerned in this transaction are raised in conformity with them, what escape is there from the statement that the increase of those wages will produce, in relation to an absolutely necessary and vital commodity, a directly corresponding increase and the destruction of the benefit of the increase to those who receive the wages?  If all the wages in relation to all the people engaged in that one transaction of handling turf are raised, surely the same thing will happen in relation to agriculture, in relation to manufacture, in relation to fishing, and so on, and the demonstrable and provable effect will be that the benefit is extinguished in the process of the remedy attempted to be made.</P>
    <P>If there was some way in which one could segregate particular cases, then, in my opinion, it would be quite reasonable to decide which should have the benefit and which should pay the price.  But, speaking generally, that is not so.  What is possible is this, and it is behind this proposal that I would like to regiment the feeling and the power of the Dáil, that wherever there is a rise to be given, it shall be given (1)  to those who are on the lowest end of the scale, and (2)  to those to whom a rise in wages will be translated through an inducement to work further into a higher productivity in relation to some necessity.  But any mere smearing of the whole picture is not going to do any good whatever.  I have said that I am merely taking turf as an example that, in my opinion, the primary producer, the man who is working hardest, the man out on the wet bog in the fog, in the dark of the early morning, going home in the wet. dragging through all that heavy stuff&mdash; he is the worst paid man of the whole lot.  He is the man we are going to be short of this year, and if any inducement is to be given down the whole long line of production, from the time <Col N="329" /> a slean touches the peat until the cured turf touches the fire, in my opinion, the man who has the first claim on it is the man with the slean and the barrow, who brings that wet turf from the condition of wet peat into the condition of saved turf on the side of the hard road, ready for us to take away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been saying that all the time and I have never said anything else, but that the one place to put the money into the wages pool is at the bottom.  If you have any increase of money to put into the wages pool, where you put it will always affect other things, but it will directly affect the place you do put it.  If you increase all the lower wages by 2/- or 3/-, that 2/- or 3/- will go to every one of them, and one halfpenny of it might go to men with 15/- above them.  If you give 7/- to the men at the top, it will drag up the lower wages by about 1/-. Where the wound is, put the plaster, where the necessity is, put the money; where the right is, do it; and give to the men who need it most, to the men who have been unprotected, to the men who are delivering the goods.</P>

      <P>We raised the wages the last time.  When we were being attacked here in respect of low wages on relief schemes, we were the strongest and only force raising agricultural wages.  When we were accused, on the basis of 24/- a week, of paying a low wage, we were paying a wage which was higher than the agricultural wage in every county in Ireland, with the exception of Dublin and Clare, and, in the same way, we have seen that any money the State gives for the relief of necessity came to those who needed it most and came, so far as was humanly possible, at the time they needed it most and in proportion to their individual needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing we have in this <Col N="330" /> smearing of the picture is that the only figure of wages which Deputies can discover as having been paid is 4/11. There was no allusion to any other wage.  &ldquo;Crumbs,&rdquo; says Deputy Murphy, &ldquo;a little bog road of £40 at 4/11 a day in the winter.&rdquo;  He did not say that in every one of the schemes covered by over £1,000,000 and sometimes more the wages appropriate to that trade in the particular districts and ruling at the time were paid.  He did not even know that of the 4/11 works, a very considerable proportion were not done in the winter.  They were the one type of works of which we used, if possible, to find an opportunity to do a considerable part in the summer.  We did about 200 separate draining schemes every year in the summer months, because, under these conditions, we could get better value.</P>
    <P>What is the proportion of the total amount of unemployment fund money which is spent at 4/11?  Make a guess at it&mdash;the one figure you know; the thing you chalk on the footpaths for general elections and which some people publish on placards on which they do not dare to put the printer's name.  What is the proportion this year of the 4/11 to any other wage?  Ten per cent.  What were the other wages? What I am suggesting is that when we come to solve these questions Deputies should try to leave an atmosphere of cleanliness and fairness.  Let us come together as men anxious to co-operate and not men who, because they serve, are accused of deliberately degrading the people.  Here are the figures: Clonakilty, 5/10; Cobh, 8/6; Buncrana, 6/-; Tralee, 8/5; Drogheda, 8/10; Dundalk, 9/11; Ballina, 8/4; Westport, 8/-; Sligo, 9/2; Carrickmacross, 5/-; Clonmel, 8/6; Dublin, 11/4; Cork, 11/4; Wexford, 8/6; and Bray, 9/-.  They have never heard of any of these rates, and, if they did hear of them and did know them, and if they knew that £1,000,000 of work was being done on a basis of this character, why did they deliberately choose to concentrate on only one figure?  Why did they not tell the truth, and the truth in this matter is the whole truth?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, many for six. Are the Deputies sure of that?  I know, and the Deputy does not.  He is simply chancing his arm, like something else I shall deal with in a minute in regard to chancing of the arm.  At present due to the fact that unemployment assistance is increasing, that voucher values have gone up, that extra provision has been made of one kind or another, and that the amount which a man is given on relief works is related to the amount which he receives for unemployment assistance, it has been necessary to increase the day's work, and, broadly speaking, unemployment assistance payments and helps of that kind are rising so high that they are tending to push rotation off the map.  It went up from two days to three days, four days, five days and, in some cases, to six days. In the cities it is four days now; in some places it is five days, and in many places it is six days, and as the unemployment assistance and other payments made by the State for the benefit of the unemployed increase, that same thing will rise, but the House may take it that whatever money is put in our hands for the relief of distress due to unemployment will go to those who need it most where and when they need it most and in proportion to their individual needs, <Col N="332" /> without regard to any other consideration whatever.</P>

The Deputy will find it on the records of the House&mdash;a formula of which I am proud, a formula up to which we have lived, and a formula which has lifted relief works, as they are called, to the level of unemployment work, which has taken out all the degradation and all the evil there was, which has enabled a man to draw unemployment wages with as high a head as any other wages and which has allowed 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 men in the year to go through the register and not to be beholden to any man, not to have to ask me, Deputy Davin or the county surveyor for a job, but knowing he has got a job in title of his necessity, that he held it as long as his work was right, that he was beholden to no man and was earning money which he could take with his head up and spend with a good heart.</P>
