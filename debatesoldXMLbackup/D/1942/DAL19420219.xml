      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The provisions of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, and regulations thereunder administered by sanitary authorities are intended to ensure a pure and wholesome milk supply for the community. Under the Milk and Dairies Act every dairyman who is engaged in the sale of milk for human consumption in the form of milk must be registered with the local sanitary authority and registration is not granted unless the premises and methods of production and distribution are satisfactory; and the animals, premises, and methods of production and sale are subject to regular inspection by the sanitary authority's medical and veterinary staff.  Section 33 of the Milk and Dairies Act enables the Minister, on the application of the sanitary authority, to make an order compelling the pasteurisation of all milk sold for human consumption in the sanitary district.  So far no such application has been received.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim breise ná raghaidh thar £31,710, chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1942, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Puist agus Telegrafa (45 &amp; 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 3, c. 26; Na hAchtanna Telegrafa, 1863 go 1928, etc.); agus Seirbhísí áirithe eile atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £31,710, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; The Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; etc.); and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The net total of the Estimate for the Financial year ending on the 31st proximo, already approved by the Dáil, amounted to £2,515,143.  An additional sum of £31,710 is now found to be required.  The actual excess over the authorised Estimate amounts to £65,341, but there are offsets of £1,407 from increased Appropriations-in-Aid and of £32,224 from savings on other sub-heads, leaving a net excess of £31,710.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional money required under sub-heads A (1) and A (3) amounts to £9,500, representing cost of extra staff for increased telegraph and telephone traffic, extended hours of telephone attendance, substitution of officers on military service or on loan to other Government Departments; also increased payments to sub-postmasters, mainly in respect of work in connection with the issue of food vouchers, etc.  There is an excess of £5,500 on sub-head E (1), representing additional payment to the British Post Office and to railway companies <Col N="1997" /> in respect of excess parcel traffic from Éire to Great Britain. Ordinarily the incoming parcel traffic from Great Britain exceeds the outgoing, but by reason of war conditions, the position in this respect altered during the past year, the postings in Great Britain for Éire showing a falling off, while the traffic in the reverse direction for a time materially increased.</P>
    <P>The excess of £20,000 under E (5) is due almost entirely to the diversion from surface to air services, on account of the slowness and uncertainty of the former in existing conditions, of correspondence for places abroad, mainly for North and South America and countries beyond.  The excess of £4,610 under G (1) results from increased purchases of miscellaneous non-engineering stores, in anticipation of shortage of supplies and rising prices.  Of the £14,631 excess under K, approximately £9,000 represents the cost of stores due to be delivered in 1940-41 but delayed, the relative payments falling into the current financial year.  The balance represents additional cost of storm repairs and rearrangement works, the outlay on which was greater than was anticipated.  There is an increase of £11,100 under N (1).  This sub-head covers superannuation, etc., charges and the explanation of the increase is that the number of retirements, deaths, etc., in the current year is larger than it was expected to be.</P>
    <P>The offsetting savings amount in all to £32,224, the bulk of which results from postponed installation of radio equipment at the Dublin and Shannon airports which had been provided for under Q (2) of the original Estimate. There are savings under E (4) of £3,500 due to revised subsidy arrangements come to with the British Post Office in relation to the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead service, resulting in a reduction by that amount of the Éire contribution for the current year; under G (2) of £5,700 due to delays in delivery of uniform clothing by contractors, the result mainly of difficulties in obtaining raw materials; under I (2) of £2,064 by reason of reduction in travelling of engineering officers owing to emergency restrictions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> The increase of £1,407 under sub-head T, Appropriations-in-Aid, is almost wholly due to additional receipts amounting to £5,682 in respect of items manufactured in the Post Office factory for other Government Departments, chiefly for the Department of Defence.  The extra receipts are offset by deficiencies caused by curtailment of sales of engineering stores owing to emergency conditions; by reduced receipts from Savings Bank funds and by the cessation of receipts from the British Administration for excess parcels traffic.</P>

      <P>A year or two ago the South Cork Board of Assistance made application for the setting up of two or three telephone kiosks for people far removed from the city, and we are quite at a loss to understand why that simple request has not been granted. One reply from the Department said that the requirements of that locality were well served by a telephone box, which was two miles from where we wanted it.  I would like the Minister's Department to pay more attention to a small demand of that kind.  We have 800 houses built by the corporation in the area, the occupants are mainly poor people, and if they want a doctor they have to go nearly two miles. Surely it is not too much to ask that a telephone kiosk be provided?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>An additional sum of £3,756 is required to meet expenditure out of the Vote for National Health Insurance for the current financial year.  The principal item in the Estimate is £3,000 in respect of State Grant on expenditure on benefits and their administration. The expenditure on benefits in the current financial year has been higher than was expected when provision <Col N="2001" /> therefor was made in the original Estimate.  When that Estimate was being prepared the indications were that there would be a decrease in the number of civilian men insured under the National Health Insurance Acts during 1941 owing to increasing unemployment and the enlistment of a large number of insured men in the defence forces.  A substantial reduction in expenditure on sickness and disablement benefits was therefore estimated for, members of the defence forces not being entitled to these benefits.  The reduction in the number of insured civilian men in 1941, however, proved much less than was expected, and the consequent reduction in benefit expenditure was less than anticipated by the amount now provided in this Estimate.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £220 is required under the sub-head for incidental expenses.  Of this amount £218 is provided to repay to the National Health Insurance Society the cost of supplying information to the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with the administration of the Emergency Powers (Food Allowances) Order, 1941.  This order makes provision for the issue of food vouchers, exchangeable for food, to certain recipients of disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, who are in necessitous circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been arranged that the National Health Insurance Society issue to such members as are resident in the areas set out in the order and are recipients of disablement benefit, an official notification of the essential provisions of the order, and of the method of application for inclusion in the food voucher scheme.  The society, in collaboration with the Department of Industry and Commerce, has compiled a register of members in receipt of disablement benefit who reside in the areas set out in the order, are in necessitous circumstances and have applied for inclusion in the scheme. The register is kept up to date by the society, and by reference to it the Department of Industry and Commerce issue the food vouchers.  The <Col N="2002" /> number of such persons receiving food vouchers is 4,203.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £400 is required to meet the increase in the cost of travelling of insured persons to centres for examination by the district medical referees.  This increase in cost is due (1) to the curtailment of railway and bus services, involving increased cost of travelling by cars, and (2) to the increase in rail and bus fares, and the abolition of return bus tickets.  The number of persons examined by the district medical referees in the current financial year is slightly fewer than in the previous year, but the amount provided for travelling expenses was exhausted in the first nine months of the year owing to the increased cost. Hence the necessity for the additional sum of £400.</P>
    <P>The three items of additional expenditure which have been dealt with amount to £3,620, to which has to be added a sum of £1,736, representing a short-fall in receipts to the Vote. The salaries of the staff engaged on work in connection with the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts are recouped to the Vote by the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund.  Owing to changes in personnel, vacancies unfilled and reductions in staff, it is now estimated that the amount falling to be recouped will be £1,736 less than the amount for which credit was taken in the original Estimate.  There is thus a total sum of £5,356 to be provided, against which there is a set-off of £1,600 which is the amount expected to be saved in the current year in respect of salaries, etc., of the staff.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I can give the Deputy the information in the form in which he asks it.  The society estimate that the number of insured persons residing in the scheduled area and in receipt of disablement benefit is <Col N="2003" /> 11,000.  As the Deputy is aware, it is only those persons who are in receipt of disablement benefit who qualify under the food voucher scheme.  Of the number I have indicated, 4,200 reside in Dublin City and suburbs. About 50 per cent. of the Dublin cases are in receipt of food vouchers.  I understand that out of about 6,052 applicants some were drawing sickness, but not disablement, benefit. There was a large number of rejections. The people who applied were rejected largely because they were not resident in the area to which the scheme applied or were not in receipt of disablement benefit.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim breise, ná raghaidh thar £10, chun íoctha an <Col N="2004" /> Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1942, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí na Muir-Sheirbhíse (Achtanna Loingis Cheannaíochta, 1894 go 1939, agus an tAcht Imeall Trágha, 1933 (Uimh. 12 de 1933)); chun íocaíocht áirithe Cúitimh, ar an n-áirmhítear págh breise do mhairnéalaigh agus costas cóireála leighis; agus chun Deontaisí chun Fearas Cosanta áirithe do Longa do chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £10, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1939, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain payments of Compensation, including extra wages of seamen and the cost of medical treatment; and for Grants in respect of the provision of certain Protective Equipment for Ships.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that under some of the sub-heads a rather considerable increase in expenditure is anticipated. The most notable of these is sub-head F, which provides for services in connection with wreck and salvage. Provision is made each year to enable receivers of wreck to incur expenses and pay salvage on wreck.  Property of this nature is handed over to owners or under-writers who prove a claim to it within a year, on payment of salvage and expenses.  Unclaimed property is sold for the benefit of the State. Before the war it was found that an annual provision of £100 was adequate under this sub-head, but the war has resulted in considerable quantities of wreck being washed up or brought ashore, with the result that the figure of £100 has been multiplied many times.  The amount provided in the main Estimate for 1941-42 was £2,000, based on the previous year's experience, but this has proved inadequate. Wreck came in in larger quantities than anticipated, realised higher prices, and involved greater payments for salvage. The expenditure to the end of November last was £4,164.  Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to <Col N="2005" /> have a dependable estimate of the total amount necessary in the financial year. It is proposed to provide an additional sum of £5,000 in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The other sub-heads that require special mention are sub-heads I (4) and J. Sub-head I (4) relates to allowances in respect of detention abroad.  This is one of the heads of the war compensation liability undertaken by the Government in 1939 in order to provide benefit equal to that given by the British Government for the crews of British ships.  The amount provided in the main Estimate was £200, but this has not proved adequate and a further £150 will probably be necessary.  This involves a total of £350 to provide allowances for dependents of three members of the crew of the s.s. &ldquo;Luimneach&rdquo; who are not Irish nationals, and are under detention in occupied France.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J provides for grants in respect of the equipment of ships for protection against magnetic mines.  The cost of protecting Irish ships against magnetic mines is another liability which has been undertaken by the Government. The amount provided in the main Estimate was £7,800, but as none of the provision made in the previous year was expended, as the examination of claims was not completed, there is a carry over from that year which was not foreseen when the Estimates were prepared.  This carry over has swollen the anticipated expenditure for 1941-42, and an additional £5,000 is, therefore, provided, making an estimated total of £12,800 for the whole year.  The total amount of the Supplementary Estimate, however, is only £10.</P>
    <P>The total Appropriations-in-Aid provided in the main Estimate were £5,621, but the receipts from wreck have greatly exceeded the expectation. The estimated receipts were £5,621, and the total appropriations are now put at £18,621, that is, a surplus of £13,000.  The excess receipts have been appropriated only to the extent, of £8,990, required to offset excess expenditure under the charge sub-heads, leaving a total of £10 to be voted.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £65,000, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for Compensation and other Payments in connection with Injuries to Property due to the dropping of bombs by foreign aircraft and kindred incidents while the State is not engaged in war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House may remember that when, some months ago, this subject was before the House, I promised Deputy Cosgrave that I would bring in a token Vote later on to enable further discussion to take place on this matter.  Well, it has become necessary to move more than a token sum, a sum of a considerable amount, and it fulfils two purposes: first, to give the necessary opportunity for discussion that was promised, and also to provide the sum of £65,000, which is necessary to enable additional provision to be made for recouping <Col N="2008" /> local authorities money spent by them in making damaged dwelling houses habitable, and in giving grants to people for the purchase of immediate necessities in the way of furniture and clothing.  When I moved the Vote formerly, I explained that the £50,000 Estimate was only tentative.  We now find that compensation payments to individuals up to the end of the financial year will use up about £15,000, leaving a balance of £35,000 for reimbursements to local authorities.</P>
    <P>To the end of December last, expenditure by the Dublin Corporation and Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation amounted to £125,200 and £4,560, respectively; allowing for expenditure by other local authorities the total would be in the neighbourhood of £132,000. It will be some time yet before the local authorities are in a position to present their claims in detail, and further time must elapse before the claims can be fully examined and audited.  As the local authorities could hardly be expected to wait for full recoupment until this has taken place, it is proposed to make them a payment on account before the end of the financial year.  The additional provision now asked for, together with the balance of £35,000 to which I have referred, will enable me to repay local authorities something like 70 per cent. to 75 per cent. of their expenditure to date.</P>
    <P>Up to date, 1,250 claims, roughly, for compensation under the Act have been lodged, and claims are coming in at the rate of something less than 50 a week. We have made offers of compensation in 139 cases, 80 of which have been accepted.  None has been refused so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When he is meeting the local authorities to the very large extent of three-quarters of their bills, I hope that I will be able to persuade the Minister, in a certain number of urgent cases at any rate, of unfortunate people who are not in the happy position of the local authorities, who are simply living on their own resources, some of which are very slender, to take cognisance of their condition and give them a grant to meet some part of their claim for which it is clear that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the very serious hardships arising out of cases in the North Strand area, where a very considerable amount of damage was done to the premises of people in business. There is a variety of cases.  You have the case of people whose business was destroyed but who had a business elsewhere and who were able to transfer part of their business elsewhere and, at any rate, were able to earn an income sufficient to keep them in circumstances in which they could wait for whatever compensation was due to them.  You have others who are not able to do anything to provide for their future.  Amongst those people whose business was completely destroyed you had two classes: those who were satisfied to allow the corporation to take over their premises completely and those who objected to the corporation taking over their premises and who were taking action that would delay a decision, both as regards their compensation and as regards what the corporation would do. Between the various classes there has been some slowing up.  As to those people who did not object to the corporation taking over their property, there ought to be no difficulty in meeting them almost at once, at any rate to the extent to which the Minister is meeting the local authorities.  Whatever <Col N="2010" /> compensation the local authority is to give them, whatever compensation is due for the demolition of their premises, it should be possible to make a fair shot at the amount and to give them an advance on their compensation.</P>
      <P>But then there are other cases of which I find it necessary to give a description so that the Minister will understand how urgent the conditions are.  There is the case of a man who had a hairdressing establishment in the North Strand area.  He owned the premises and had a fairly good weekly profit.  He was able to buy a house in another part of the city through a building society and there was a mortgage on his premises on the North Strand.  He was able to pay the interest and a sum in repayment of the principal under his mortgage; he was able to pay rates and taxes; he was able to keep a family of six, and he had a small account in the bank.  After eight or nine months he now finds himself in a position in which his business is completely wiped out and he is unable to get any other place in which to start business.  He is eating into his money; in fact his money is practically all gone, and his family are in a very bad way.  Owing to interest which is due on the mortgage on his property and other bills the man is getting into debt.  Eight or nine months have passed since his business was destroyed; he has not been assisted in any way out of any of the relief schemes and no approach has been made to him either by the Government or the corporation to put him into a position to get a premises so that he could get back to his work.  That is one type of case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another type of case is that of a widow who was the owner of property which brought her in £166 per year and which was her only means of livelihood. She maintained a son and daughter.  That was all she had to live on and her whole income was completely wiped out.  Since her income ceased she had to sell her furniture to keep herself and her family.  She owes two years' rates on her private house for which the corporation are threatening <Col N="2011" /> to sue her.  She owes £20 in ground rent and she has no money to pay any of these.  She has not been able to get relief of any kind or any advance to help her to tide over the present situation. Another lady was the owner of a house in which she kept lodgers.  Her husband brought in £4 8s. 8d. per week in wages.  The woman herself was injured and spent three weeks in hospital.  The husband was also injured and was discharged from hospital after three weeks.  He was certified from the hospital as being fit for work, but he was subsequently examined by another doctor who certified him as unfit and he has not been working since.  There you have a person who was keeping lodgers and whose husband was earning £4 8s. 8d. per week.  For some time past the total income of these people is £1 2s. 6d. which they receive from the labour exchange.  They have been given a corporation house for which they have to pay 10/9 per week and 1/3 for electric light.  The woman is attending the hospital still, and as she is not able to go to the hospital unattended bus fares cost her about 5/- a week.</P>
    <P>Another lady was running a dairy and grocery shop in that area.  She owned the house and the shop and was able to maintain herself and a niece in fairly comfortable circumstances. Her means of livelihood was completely wiped out and she and her niece are living on the charity of the woman's brother.  She applied to the Red Cross Society and obtained no help.  Another lady was running a green-grocery for ten years and had an income of about £3 a week which was sufficient to keep her and to pay her rent.  She was unable to get any relief from the Red Cross Society when her business was wiped out.  She was told to apply for outdoor relief.  She filled up certain forms for relief but it was some time before she got £4 5s. 6d.  Then she got £5 from the Red Cross Society.  She applied for the widows' pension and was allowed 7/6 per week.  She has to pay 10/9 a week to the corporation and she is in a very great state of poverty.</P>
    <P>Then you have the case of a man who has a wife and six children.  He is <Col N="2012" /> not so badly off from the point of view of income.  His house was damaged and he was living in three rooms over a shop.  A large part of the house being damaged, the roof had to be taken off and the house had to be covered with tarpaulin.  He had no money to effect repairs.  Because repairs would cost more than £130, the corporation would not do them.  He has been able to get no advance from the Government to have repairs done. This man, with his wife and six children, are living in three rooms over a shop, which he lets.  Because he has not money to get repairs done, there is a tarpaulin over one side of the family residence.  In the meantime, the cost of building has gone up and it will be much more expensive to have repairs done now than it would originally have been.  He is anxious to get the repairs done but he is not able to lay hands on the necessary money.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to say, particularly with regard to people whose living has been injured, that he will look quickly into these cases and, before another couple of weeks are past, do something for these people analogous to what has been done in regard to local authorities.  There has been considerable lack of co-ordination and understanding between the different authorities in this matter and a considerable amount of time has been lost. The matter is now brought very definitely home to the Minister as his responsibility and I urge him to take immediate action with regard to it. Serious hardship has been caused and, if these people are left any longer as they are, they may not be able to get back into the kind of employment for which they are fitted and which has been traditionally theirs.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons why I asked that there should be a token Vote before the end of the year was that it was almost inevitable that some kind of case would arise in respect of which there would be doubt as to whether it was provided for under the Act or not.  I know that we are not entitled to discuss anything on this Vote except what is provided for in it, but this is an exceptional Estimate.</P>

      <P>Persons engaged in one class of business are apprehensive that their business is not covered by the Act.  I refer to pawnbrokers. They are not owners of the property pledged with them.  Presumably, the people who left their property with them would not be regarded as owners either.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that case and see whether provision is made for compensation in respect of property taken in by pawnbrokers. One sub-section would suggest that that type of case had been thought of but it is not clear and it can be appreciated that complications might arise.  Those who left their property with the pawnbroker might look to the person who made the advance for compensation while, if the property were to be restored to the original owner, the claim of the pawnbroker would arise.  The persons concerned are in doubt whether the case is provided for or not and it is not clear from the Act that it is provided for.</P>

      <P>When dealing with the Department of Finance, that hope is more pious than sound.  There is a note to this Estimate which states that the expenditure will be offset to the extent of any compensation recovered from external Governments or authorities.  I do not know what representations have been made by the Department of External Affairs to the German Government in respect of the ascertained damage.  Does the Minister believe that there is any prospect of recovering compensation from the German Government before this war is over, or does he hope to recover any compensation after the war?</P>

      <P>It is simply a hope; there is no cash.  I shall put down a question, as the Minister suggested.  I had some discussions with the Department <Col N="2015" /> of Finance in connection with compensation claims.  The Minister, when in opposition, would agree with me that the spirit of Pharaoh enshrouded the Department of Finance in most matters.  My experience in discussing bombing compensation cases with the Department gave me the impression that there was a new spirit there.  I found only a desire to deal with cases expeditiously, sympathetically, and helpfully.  When urgent cases were brought to the notice of the Department&mdash;I refer only to bombing cases&mdash;there was willingness to deal with them expeditiously and, I might say, very efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer only to bombing cases, and only to cases which I handled personally.  In respect of the rest of the Department, the spirit of Pharaoh still flourishes there.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us, in his reply, when it is hoped to dispose of all these claims.  If the German Government is not going to meet them, let us deal with them in the spirit that these were unfortunate Irish people who suffered by the unfortunate dropping of bombs on our territory.  As a community, we should be glad to ensure that, so far as our finances permit, these cases will be dealt with sympathetically, understandingly and in a broad human spirit.  They should be dealt with, too, as quickly as possible, so that the minimum of hardship will be imposed upon these unfortunate people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to this debate, I am, like other Deputies, anxious to get information on behalf of some of the unfortunate victims of the bombing.  I notice that Deputy Norton, like the rest of us, is anxious to know at what rate claims are being liquidated.  I understand the Minister mentioned that something like 10 per cent. of them had been agreed upon. That was a rough and ready figure and the Minister was uncertain of the number in which a financial payment had been made.  I also understood the <Col N="2016" /> Minister to say that some time before the end of the financial year 75 per cent. of the compensation would be made available to local authorities. Does that mean that nobody can hope to receive payment before the end of the financial year?  If it has taken nine months to dispose of 10 per cent. of the claims the Minister can furnish a date on which the last of the claims will be settled.  Stress has been laid on the hardship caused individuals who cannot order their lives until they know in what position they will be in in respect of their claims, and I should like to press the Minister for some acceleration there.  People would be glad to hear even that their claims had been provisionally accepted or something like that.  I urge the Minister to give some hope to nine-tenths of the people as to what their position is in regard to claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the calculation made by Deputy Dockrell about 10 per cent. of the claims being dealt with in nine months is not a fair one.  It is certainly nine months since the bombing took place, and to say that we have only dealt with 10 per cent. of the claims since the bombing is, I consider, fair enough.  The legislation was only passed last September, and we could not have considered any claim before that.  It was about November 1st, before the regulations were printed and issued so that claims could be sent in.  We expected a rush of claims but people took their time about sending them in.  They came in extremely slowly for the first two months, but probably they had to take time to examine carefully all the official writing contained in the forms and to get advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, even in urgent cases&mdash; and the cases that Deputy Mulcahy referred to are urgent&mdash;they were very slow about sending in claims for months after the forms had been delivered.  However, the claims are coming in now.  We have received at least 1,250 to date.  They are coming in at the rate of 50 a week and will be dealt with rapidly.  We could not start to calculate anything before the legislation was passed and the forms that <Col N="2017" /> were issued came in.  It also took time to organise the staff.  Not alone had we to set up a special section in Finance to deal with the matter, but we had also to get the Board of Works to do a considerable amount of work in the way of examination in relation to buildings and furniture, and the local authority also came into it. Even with the best will in the world, and with a desire to be as expeditious as possible, there were at least three Departments or sub-departments of the Government, and the local authorities that had, owing to the necessities of the case, to examine claims and to make a detailed examination of the facts set out in them. That takes time.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the comment of Deputy Norton regarding his experience in the Department.  It cannot have been a great experience, but such as he had up to the present in dealing with claims for damage to property he said he found the officials of the Department ready to meet him and to do everything possible to facilitate him.  I do not think that is confined to the section which deals with these claims.  As far as my experience goes it is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly true of all the officials dealing with these types of case.  If Deputy Mulcahy would be good enough to give me further particulars of the cases he mentioned I will make a special note of them and see that they are dealt with with the greatest expedition.  I know that letters reached me about some of the cases he mentioned and everything we can do about them will be done.  I realise that when Deputy Mulcahy referred to the hardship these people suffered and as to what Deputy Norton also said, they were not over-stating the facts.  Through no fault of their own these people have been put in a very serious position and their lives upset.  The word &ldquo;upset&rdquo; is not nearly strong enough to describe the upset to their lives and their future.  It has been of the greatest magnitude.  I realise that, and anything that can be <Col N="2018" /> done within the powers that the Dáil has given us to mitigate that upset as soon as possible I hope to have done.  I should like Deputies in every part of the House if they come across cases that they regard as ones of special urgency to notify me and I will have everything possible done.  I know that the officials will be only too glad to take pains in those cases so that they will be dealt with as expeditiously and as generously as possible.  Deputy Norton asked about the prospects of payment.  I believe we will get payment, but God knows when.  Who can tell when this war will end?  I do not think there will be any prospect of getting any money before the war ends.</P>

      <P>I do not think that people can be blamed for the delay in submitting their claims. There was a good deal of confusion in connection with this matter and in many cases the claims were submitted to the corporation.  I have endeavoured in all these cases to get people to work through a solicitor in order, in the first place, to safeguard the interests of the people involved and, in the second place, to make matters easier for the Department. It expedites matters to have them handled in a suitable way.  I do not want to spoil the beautiful picture painted by Deputy Norton in regard to the generally satisfactory way in which claims are met, but I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to this unsatisfactory feature.  Take a case in which there is a claim for the loss of a set of artificial teeth.  It is argued that there is a limited life to a set of artificial teeth and the Department declines to provide the cost of a new denture.  They offer two-ninths or three-ninths of the cost or something like that.  I think it is an appalling thing to have the Department meet people who have suffered the kind of upset these people have had to endure in that way.  I hope the Minister will be able to secure that that particular type of rebutting claims will not be the dominant feature of the discussion of these claims between the Department and people who have applied for compensation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £48,000 is required under sub-head M (7) which provides for allowances in respect of the storage of butter for winter requirements and the production and acquisition of butter and other dairy products.  It is estimated that the production of creamery butter for the year ending 31st March next will be 662,000 cwts. or about 4,000 more cwts. than the previous year.  The guaranteed return from milk used in the manufacture of dairy products was 6d. per gallon which is the equivalent of 158/- net per cwt. for butter.  The retail prices for the year remained unchanged at the equivalent of 152/- net per cwt. and payment of a production allowance of 6/- per cwt. is <Col N="2022" /> accordingly being made to bring butter to the guaranteed value of 158/- per cwt.  The production allowance on 662,000 cwts. of butter amounts to £199,000.</P>
    <P>Then there is a corresponding allowance made on cheese costing about £9,000 while the cost of cold-storing butter for winter requirements amounts to £82,000.  There are certain arrears from the previous year which amount to £15,000, making a total of £305,000. There is a saving in respect of claims not maturing for payment this year amounting to £7,000 so that the net total for this year in respect of the cost of production of creamery butter, as far as the State is concerned, and the cost of storing it, is £298,000.  A sum of £250,000 was already provided in the original Estimate and the supplementary sum required now is £48,000.  On the other hand there will be a saving on another Estimate, that is in respect of export bounties, of about an equivalent amount, so that the total expenditure on butter, for export or home production, will remain at about the same figure estimated in the beginning of the financial year. The reduction in the export subsidy is due to the reduction in the export of butter.  Since margarine went off the market, there has been an increase of about 25 per cent. in the consumption of creamery butter.</P>
    <P>The second item with which we have to deal is £6,000 in respect of the expenses of veterinary surgeons.  This arises under the Fresh Meat Acts.  As Deputies know, during the foot-and-mouth disease there was a very big export of fresh meat, of both dressed meats and cooked meats, and a number of factories came into existence. There were 27 new premises in all requiring veterinary supervision.  The cost of this extra supervision is estimated at about £6,000, so that under these two sub-heads the amount required is £54,000.  There are, however, savings on other sub-heads amounting to £53,990, so that the net sum required is £10.</P>

      <P>It would be very hard to say that.  I suppose I could find out the figure, but most of our regular staff were working on foot-and-mouth disease for part of that period, and were replaced by temporary staff.  To that extent, some of this money may have been spent on the inspection of pigs and bacon, but most of it is applicable to the other part of the business.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim breise, ná raghaidh thar £9,210, chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1942, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí an Ghárda Síochána, le n-a n-áirmhítear an Taca Síochána (Uimh. 7 de 1925, Uimh. 10 de 1926, Uimh. 5 de 1937, Uimh. 28 de 1939, agus Uimh. 19 de 1941); agus chun Costaisí áirithe de chuid na gCaomhnóirí Aitiúla, maraon le Deontaisí-i-gCabhair (Uimh. 28 de 1939).</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £9,210, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1942, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Gárda Síochána, including the Taca Síochána (No. 7 of 1925, No. 10 of 1926, No. 5 of 1937, No. 28 of 1939, and No. 19 of 1941); and for certain Expenses of the Local Security Force, including Grants-in-Aid (No. 28 of 1939).</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is, I think, self-explanatory, but I had better go through the different items. The first sub-head is AA.&mdash;£1,456.  This sum was paid to eight officers who were compulsorily retired during the year. Each officer got three months' pay in lieu of notice.  The extra £2,500 under sub-head C was required for subsistence allowances because of the additional work thrown on the force in dealing with the enforcement of the restrictions following the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.  Under sub-head E, there is a sum of £5,795, due to the rise in contract prices as a result of the war and emergency conditions obtaining.  The period of wear of garments supplied to the Gárda has been extended, two years' issues being now made to cover three ordinary annual issues.  There has been an appreciable saving in public expenditure as a result.  With regard to the sums of £180 and £125, under sub-heads G and K, this expenditure, which is for cleaning, barrack maintenance and conveyance of children to industrial schools, varies from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> Sub-head M&mdash;£1,538&mdash;is for compensation to the dependents of members of the Gárda Síochána fatally injured in the performance of their duties and compensation to members who are injured, but not fatally, in the performance of their duties.  The cases of the two officers in Holles Street were the first two heard.  The others have not been heard yet.  I believe that the practice in the courts is that jury cases take precedence in the lists. I understand that when the judges come back from circuit these cases will be heard.  Sub-head N&mdash;£6,481&mdash;is for miscellaneous equipment, of which £50 is for revolver holsters.  There is an item of £4,150 for wireless equipment. This item has now figured in the Estimates for 1939-40, 1940-41 and 1941-42, the reason being that supplies were not obtainable and only part delivery was made.  Delivery of the outstanding items is expected shortly.  The whole cost was estimated to be £7,960, of which £3,809 was spent last year.  The equipment was for a wireless communication system between Gárda headquarters and local stations and vicinity with portable receiving sets for Gárda patrol cars.  They have got these at last.</P>
    <P>There is also an item for safes for the proper custody of confidential papers, etc., which was mentioned here last year.  We got the safes only recently.  The sum of £4,103 under sub-head O represents extra Local Security Force expenses.  One item was 7,000 steel helmets at a cost of £2,975 for use in A.R.P. areas.  Six thousand have been delivered to date, and the delivery of the remainder is expected before the end of March.  The sum for badges and armlets is £178.  Part of the expenses was in respect of ammunition supplied on a repayable basis by the Army to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; group, now the L.D.F., prior to the 1st January 1941.  After that date the expenses generally of the L.D.F. fell on the Army Vote, and of the L.S.F. on the Gárda Síochána Vote.</P>
    <P>The next item is sub-head P&mdash;£1,000 <Col N="2028" /> L.S.F. grant.  The extra sum is required to meet capitation grants to district funds of the L.S.F.  Until the claims for the annual renewal of £1 capitation grants which are being received and examined, it will not be possible to state the actual expenditure. The local audit by my Department of the district fund is almost completed; the accounts were found most satisfactory, and reflected great credit on the keen efficiency of the L.S.F. district officers responsible.  I believe that was the general experience everywhere&mdash;that the accounts were very well kept indeed.  I desire to take this opportunity of congratulating the officers responsible on how well they kept their accounts.  The next item is sub-head Q.  The payment from the Road Fund is in respect of the expenses of the Gárda Síochána in the execution of the Roads Act, 1920 and the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  The estimated receipt was £20,000 and the actual £18,218, a deficiency of approximately £1,782.  This sum represents 2 per cent. of the receipts into the Road Fund for the year 1940/41.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to mark in an appropriate manner the 25th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, the Government decided, <i>inter alia:</i> (1)  to hold a special commemoration parade, and (2)  to have struck two medals, one for those who took part in the Rising, and the other for those who had service subsequently in the War of Independence.  The present Supplementary Estimate, for a gross sum of £2,250 and a net sum of £10, is now introduced in order to get the Dáil's authorisation for the special expenses incurred in connection with the parade and medals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parade was held on Easter Sunday, 1941, and consisted of units of the Army, Old I.R.A. units, surviving fit <Col N="2030" /> members of those who took part in the actual Rising, and units of the various emergency defence forces, and the Dáil is now asked to approve the expenditure incidental to it.  This expenditure covers items such as the platform, the wireless and telephonic apparatus used in the General Post Office, past which the units marched and at which the salute was taken.  The cost of such incidentals was approximately £263.</P>
    <P>The 1916 Medal, mounted on a green and orange poplin ribbon, depicts Cuchualain in a dying attitude, and the design is the work of a corporal serving in the Army Corps of Engineers.  This medal is awarded: (1) to persons in possession of military service certificates for service rendered during Easter Week, 1916; (2)  to persons who did not apply for such certificates, but who can produce evidence to show that if they did they would have been entitled to a certificate; (3) to the next-of-kin of those persons who have since died and who had such certificates, or would have had them if they had applied for them.</P>
    <P>Two thousand medals of the 1916 type were struck and the bulk of them were presented by an Taoiseach on the 8th, 10th and 12th April, 1941, at special parades held at Collins Barracks, Dublin.  Of the 2,000 medals struck 1,906 (including 266 posthumous) have actually been awarded, and the remaining 94 are held either for 1916 men living overseas or for persons who have yet to satisfy the Department that they are entitled to them.  The cost of the 1916 medals is approximately £345.  Mounted on a black and tan poplin ribbon, and designed by a civilian, the service medal depicts in the centre a typical member of a flying column, and the quarters bear the arms of the four provinces.  Ten thousand medals of this type have been struck and are ready for issue.  They will be awarded for service rendered subsequent to Easter Week, 1916, and prior to the Truce of 1921.  The question as to whether their issue will be confined to persons who had active and pensionable service, or whether persons who had service of a non-pensionable <Col N="2031" /> nature will be included is under consideration. The cost of the 10,000 medals which have been struck is £1,642.  The special gross expenditure, therefore, in connection with the commemoration of the 1916 rising which the Dáil is asked to approve is £2,250, and as this sum is offset by savings on the Army Vote, the net expenditure which it is asked to vote is the token sum of £10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the beginning of last year when the commemoration of the 1916 rising was planned&mdash;in fact, I think, it was after it was carried out&mdash;I drew attention to the fact that there were aspects of the national presentation of Easter 1916 that ought to be borne in mind.  I quoted at that particular time the challenge of Pearse to the conscience of our people as to how it was possible for a man to look after his family in Dublin on 20/- a week.</P>
      <P>This Estimate makes certain provision for the Office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  Yesterday a National Health Insurance Bill was introduced which the Parliamentary Secretary said was far-reaching, and I raised on that Bill the difficulty and the inadequacy of the machinery for dealing with national health which provided that a man and his family would, during the father's sickness, get only 15/- a week under the National Health Insurance Act.  Two of the three Dublin papers this morning made no reference at all to any of the general aspects of that position that I put before the House.  I want to ask on this Estimate, which provides certain things under the Office of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, was there any aspect of my contribution on the National Health Insurance Bill yesterday evening in the House forbidden by the censor to be printed in any of the morning papers?</P>

It <Col N="2034" /> is a serious problem and it is one the Minister should inquire into.  The Minister also mentioned in the course of his statement that it is not decided yet whether the post-16 medals will be given only to men who received service certificates or otherwise.  I think he should reconsider that question and make inquiries among 1916 men on that matter.  I can assure the Minister that the issue of 1916 medals only to men who received service certificates has created a bad feeling in one particular district anyhow and it is most unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen mentioned the 1916 men who did not get service certificates and that their comrades might be likely to refuse to wear their medals on that account.  I rather imagine that the verifying officers would be some of these men that he mentioned and that these men did not verify their comrades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They did verify them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If they verified, the referee would have no alternative but to give the certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inquire further into it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to look any further into the question of the 1916 certificates at all. If we finally decide that the black and tan medal will be issued to all who gave service, which was not active service or pensionable service, on the statement the Deputy has made, these men would be entitled to the black and tan medal in those circumstances but in no other circumstances that I know of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1916 men that have not got service certificates would become entitled to the black and tan medal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1916 service certificates will be issued only to those who have service proved before the referee. They will be issued to no one else, but the service medal will be a medal which may possibly be issued on the basis of an attestation or something like that <Col N="2035" /> from company officers who will be prepared to attest that the individual they are recommending or testifying to has in fact served with his unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not be called a black and tan medal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an active service medal in fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten thousand.  Does the Deputy mean the active service medal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 10,000, but there has been considerable controversy about certain men who had not got pensionable service but who had rendered good service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was not active service and it is now under consideration, as a result of representations which have been made to An Taoiseach, as to whether we will not extend that medal to the general service instead of active service men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if representations were made about the 1916 medal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations whatever have been made at any time about the 1916 medal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to receive such representations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at this stage. I could not.</P>
      <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
